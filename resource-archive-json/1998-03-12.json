He\r\n\r\nalso  asked whether GST registered businesses could delay  their\r\n\r\npayment  to the Income Tax Department for GST collected  by  one\r\n\r\nquarter to help ease their cashflow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the current GST annual turnover limit of $1\r\n\r\nmillion is already high and excludes, therefore, practically all\r\n\r\nsmall businesses.  With this $1 million turnover threshold, most\r\n\r\nbusinesses  such as provision shops, retail shops,  hawkers  and\r\n\r\nHDB shopkeepers are exempt from applying GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, businesses are already allowed to file returns\r\n\r\non  a  monthly or quarterly basis and pay IRAS the GST collected\r\n\r\nwithin  one month after the returns are filed.  The traders  who\r\n\r\nare  in a net refund position from Government usually choose  to\r\n\r\nfile  returns on a monthly basis.  Businesses with  turnover  of\r\n\r\nless  than  $1  million but has voluntarily registered  for  GST\r\n\r\npurposes  are  also allowed to file returns  on  a  half  yearly\r\n\r\nbasis.   As  the  GST payable is, in fact, money collected  from\r\n\r\ncustomers, the traders who choose to file quarterly returns have\r\n\r\nthe  use of GST collected for two months on average.  Since  the\r\n\r\nGST  is  not  a tax on the trader, unlike income tax,  there  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  no basis to allow companies to keep the  money  which\r\n\r\nbelongs to Government any longer than what is already provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Chiam is not here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $532,215,600 for Head N ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $368,238,500 for Head N ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head W\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head W, Ministry of Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\nAmendment No. (1), Mr Leong Horn Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, local companies have been lamenting about the rising\r\n\r\ncost  of  doing business in Singapore for several  years.   They\r\n\r\nhave  been encountering cost pressures in terms of increases  in\r\n\r\nwages, fees and rentals.  Now, with the economic slowdown, local\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  facing  the  added problems  of  lower  business\r\n\r\nturnover and credit squeeze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier in my speech during the budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  more than 50% of local firms feel that their businesses\r\n\r\nwill  be badly affected by the economic slowdown, both in  terms\r\n\r\nof  local  and  foreign  sales.  On the other  hand,  they  also\r\n\r\nencounter difficulties with banks which are now putting a credit\r\n\r\nsqueeze on their banking lines.  It is fair to expect that banks\r\n\r\nwould  wish  to  review their loan exposure and  minimise  their\r\n\r\ndoubtful  debts.  However, in the process, local  companies  are\r\n\r\nbeing  further squeezed by higher interest cost and fewer credit\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of cost of doing business, local companies wish\r\n\r\nto  see  that the Government could consider reducing  rates  and\r\n\r\nfees  such  as  HDB and JTC rentals, instead of just  putting  a\r\n\r\nfreeze  on  them.  In the area of increasing costs, local  firms\r\n\r\nhave  found  that  in  the  last two  years,  PSA  has  actually\r\n\r\nincreased  their  fees  three times.   Now,  with  the  expected\r\n\r\nintroduction  of ERP, businesses are also concerned  that  their\r\n\r\ntransport costs will increase, since it is essential for them to\r\n\r\ntravel,  especially along the expressways so as to  ensure  fast\r\n\r\ndelivery of their products.  Hence, ERP may, over a longer term,\r\n\r\ncause them to incur higher transportation costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local companies are also faced with the burden of higher\r\n\r\nfinancing cost of borrowings.  Most small firms are charged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2-3%  above  prime  rate for bank borrowings.   In  addition  to\r\n\r\nborrowing cost, they also have to incur higher interest  charge,\r\n\r\nand thereby weakening their already poor cashflow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government\r\n\r\nwould  consider doing a comprehensive review of the  problem  of\r\n\r\ncost  of  doing business for local firms, in the  light  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I also like to urge the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nthe  problem of credit squeeze faced by local companies.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  higher costs and tightening bank  credit,  many\r\n\r\nlocal  firms  may  be forced to close.  This will  have  serious\r\n\r\nrepercussions  on  the  economy.   It  will,  in  turn,   create\r\n\r\nunemployment and hardship for Singaporeans.  Hence, I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  monitor closely the  health  of  the  local\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, as my GPC Chairman\r\n\r\nhas  alluded to, the number one gripe of the business  community\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  the rising, if not high, cost of doing business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    The  attendant  issue  of  the  erosion   of   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness is fundamental to our survival.  These  concerns\r\n\r\nhave  been  made  more pronounced in the light  of  the  current\r\n\r\neconomic and financial crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our GPC's various feedback sessions, complaints and\r\n\r\nconcerns range from expensive real estate to high manpower  cost\r\n\r\nto  a heavy burden of Government fees and charges.  Most seem to\r\n\r\naccept that with the limited manpower resources available, there\r\n\r\nis  little  room to artificially raise supply without  affecting\r\n\r\nwork  quality.  Yet, on the other hand, the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  has managed to clinch record investment commitments  year\r\n\r\nafter  year, which is a feat not to be scoffed at.  What  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  draws  multi-national corporations to Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\nwide  range  of choices that they have?  Political and  economic\r\n\r\nstability is obviously an important prerequisite, but this  must\r\n\r\nbe matched by a viable business cost profile.  For at the end of\r\n\r\nthe day, it is still dollars and cents that speak loudest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is, therefore, a fundamental\r\n\r\none.   What is our operating cost profile, for the country as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  or  by  sectors,  in  terms of  the  various  components,\r\n\r\nincluding  real estate, manpower, Government fees  and  charges?\r\n\r\nAnd  how  does  this  breakdown  or  profile  compare  with  our\r\n\r\ncompetition?   More  importantly, is the real  estate  component\r\n\r\ndisproportionately high as felt by many?  Finally, does our cost\r\n\r\nstructure resulting from the free market forces in play for real\r\n\r\nestate   and   manpower  inherently  disadvantage  the   smaller\r\n\r\noperators?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim is not here. Mr Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nover the past few days, the debate in this House has focused  on\r\n\r\nthe  question of the rising cost of doing business in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  these  are the key factors  that  affect  the\r\n\r\nsurvival and development of our businesses and our international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the operating cost of doing business, I think the\r\n\r\nvarious  levies  and  charges  imposed  by  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards account for a very large proportion,  such  as\r\n\r\nfactory  and  shop  rentals, utilities charges,  foreign  labour\r\n\r\nlevies,  property  taxes, GST and port charges.   Recently,  the\r\n\r\ndevaluation of currencies in our neighbouring countries has made\r\n\r\nit  more difficult for us to compete with them in terms  of  our\r\n\r\ncost  of business.  Over the long term, this will be detrimental\r\n\r\nto our exports and  external trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent survey conducted by the Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry among its members, more\r\n\r\nthan  50% of its members fear that there will be rising cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing business in various degrees, and this includes the charges\r\n\r\nand  levies  imposed  by  the Government and  statutory  boards.\r\n\r\nObviously,  any  such  charges  and  levies  and  their   upward\r\n\r\nadjustments will accumulate to produce serious negative  effects\r\n\r\non the cost of doing business here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greatest worry among the business community is\r\n\r\nthat  adjustments of Government charges and levies appear to  be\r\n\r\nmade  on  the  basis  of \"to each his own\",  and  are  aimed  at\r\n\r\nbalancing  income  with expenditure or accumulating  substantial\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  Under such circumstances, the Government departments\r\n\r\nand  statutory boards,  because of the rising cost, will compete\r\n\r\nto  adjust upwards their own charges and levies and neglect  the\r\n\r\noverall competitive edge of the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to solve these key issues, I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  set up a review committee  on  Government\r\n\r\ncharges  and  levies in order to review and monitor the  various\r\n\r\nadjustments by the Government and statutory boards.  This is  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  such  adjustments  are  reasonable  and  properly\r\n\r\ncoordinated.  In this way, our businesses can then rely  on  the\r\n\r\nprice-competitive and efficient public facilities  and  services\r\n\r\nto maintain our international competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, rentals are not usually\r\n\r\na  large component of total business costs, but nonetheless they\r\n\r\nare  a significant component.  I would therefore like to address\r\n\r\nthis  issue.  I will confine my remarks to rentals about factory\r\n\r\nspaces  although the same principle would also  apply  to  other\r\n\r\nindustrial and commercial properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a stable and open market, rentals are set by\r\n\r\nnegotiations  between  willing sellers and  willing  buyers.   A\r\n\r\nprice that is produced by this interaction reflects the level at\r\n\r\nwhich  tenants are able to profitably and productively make  use\r\n\r\nof rented space.  These market transactions are therefore a good\r\n\r\nbenchmark  for the HDB and JTC to set their posted  prices,  but\r\n\r\nunder  stable market conditions.  In a falling market,  however,\r\n\r\nthese  benchmarks represent only the ability of new  tenants  to\r\n\r\npay this price and are no longer representative of the prices at\r\n\r\nwhich existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntenants  are  able  to profitably make use of  this  space.   By\r\n\r\nright, existing tenants who cannot afford the rentals should now\r\n\r\ngive up their space.  And if no new tenants can be found, market\r\n\r\nprices will then fall.  But if tenants at the posted prices  can\r\n\r\nbe  found,  then  market  prices will be  maintained.   But  the\r\n\r\nexisting  tenants may find it difficult to give up  their  space\r\n\r\nimmediately,  even though they may be better off doing  so,  and\r\n\r\nthere are several reasons for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, tenants may be locked into long leases. They\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  able to break their leases without having  to  pay\r\n\r\nstiff penalties.  Secondly, they may not be able to give up just\r\n\r\na  portion  of the rented premises and keep the rest because  of\r\n\r\nthe  specific configuration of the factory space.  Thirdly, they\r\n\r\nmay  still need the space even though it is no longer profitable\r\n\r\nnor  productive  just to store slow moving inventory.   The  net\r\n\r\neffect  of  these  reasons is that businesses will  hold  on  to\r\n\r\nrented  premises  at  higher prices for some  time  before  they\r\n\r\nfinally give up the space.  High occupancy levels, therefore, do\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily mean that posted rents still reflect the  rates\r\n\r\nthat tenants are able to pay.  They may simply have no choice in\r\n\r\nthe short term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many HDB and JTC tenants are already paying less than the\r\n\r\nposted prices, but this only proves that not all businesses  can\r\n\r\nafford  to pay posted prices.  In a rising market, it  would  be\r\n\r\ncorrect  for  the Government to continue to adjust  these  below\r\n\r\nmarket rentals gradually to the level of the posted prices.  But\r\n\r\nin  a  falling  market, it is inadequate for the  Government  to\r\n\r\nsimply  freeze  posted prices.  The real level of  affordability\r\n\r\nhas already fallen even though the statistics do not necessarily\r\n\r\nshow  it,  because  of the lag factors which I  have  enumerated\r\n\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  not  wait for all the statistics to be available  before\r\n\r\ntaking  action.   He  has  said that we should  also  allow  for\r\n\r\nanecdotal  evidence  to  guide us in interpreting  the  emerging\r\n\r\nmarket  trends.   I  hope therefore that MTI  would  accept  the\r\n\r\nfeedback  from  the many Members of this House who  have  spoken\r\n\r\nthat   rental  levels  are  too  high  for  many  of  our  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  I am glad to hear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   MTI  consults  regularly  with  the  business  community.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be useful also if the Ministry makes some field\r\n\r\ntrips to speak to small businesses directly, those who rent just\r\n\r\na  few  hundred square metres of space in HDB and JTC factories.\r\n\r\nThen  they  can see and hear for themselves the real  impact  on\r\n\r\nthese small businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they will find sufficient evidence that there is a\r\n\r\ncase  to  not  just freeze rentals but to adjust  posted  prices\r\n\r\ndownwards  and to slow down or indeed to freeze the increase  in\r\n\r\nrental  rates  for  those who are already  paying  below  posted\r\n\r\nrents.  If the Ministry would do this, perhaps for a year or two\r\n\r\nor three, until such time as the economy rebounds, it would help\r\n\r\na lot of small companies to ride through this rough patch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the lower rentals, business costs can also\r\n\r\nbe  reduced  by streamlining operations.  However, some  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent rules by HDB and JTC make it difficult for businesses to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  For example, an HDB tenant who spoke to me said that he\r\n\r\nrents  three  separate units of flatted factory space  from  the\r\n\r\nHDB.   To  streamline  his  operations,  he  has,  on  his  own,\r\n\r\nnegotiated  and agreed with other tenants to swap factory  units\r\n\r\nso  that he can have a single contiguous space.  However, he  is\r\n\r\nunable  to make this exchange with other tenants for the  reason\r\n\r\nthat  their rentals would go up if they make the swap with  him.\r\n\r\nThis  happens because the tenants he wants to exchange the  unit\r\n\r\nwith  are paying less than posted rental rates.  HDB treats  the\r\n\r\nexchange  of  units  as  two separate transactions,  firstly,  a\r\n\r\nreturn  of  each unit to HDB and, secondly, a new allocation  of\r\n\r\neach unit to the tenant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that both the HDB and JTC would reconsider this\r\n\r\nrule.  The tenant should pay the same total rent as he had  paid\r\n\r\nbefore  the  exchange with his fellow tenants.  Some adjustments\r\n\r\ncan  be made for technical factors, such as the location of  the\r\n\r\nunit  or  the  quality of the finish.  But the rents  themselves\r\n\r\nshould  not be adjusted to current posted price.  In  this  way,\r\n\r\nHDB  or  JTC would not collect less rent than before.   The  new\r\n\r\ntenants or the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting  tenants  will  also not have to  pay  more  rent  than\r\n\r\nbefore.   But  they  would  still  be  able  to  save  cost   by\r\n\r\nstreamlining  their operations.  The total space utilised  would\r\n\r\nbe  more  efficient. This is a \"win-win\" situation for  all.   I\r\n\r\nhope  therefore that the Minister would ask the HDB and  JTC  to\r\n\r\nconsider this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Many companies have responded to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  call  to regionalise by investing  overseas.   The\r\n\r\ntask of seeking opportunities overseas has been a difficult  and\r\n\r\narduous  one.  Those who have ventured out find the  going  even\r\n\r\ntougher  now,  as they are being exposed to the  Asian  market's\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis. These companies venture out to invest  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  on  their  own  with their eyes open.   Therefore,  they\r\n\r\ncannot blame the Government when they encounter difficulties  or\r\n\r\nincur losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics released by the Government in\r\n\r\nOctober last year, the total cost of direct investments overseas\r\n\r\nby  Singapore  companies grew 21% to $46 billion as  at  end  of\r\n\r\n1995.   About 35% of these companies invested in ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nand  about  59%  invested  in  the whole  Asian  region.   These\r\n\r\nregional  investments have left Singapore firms exposed  to  the\r\n\r\nAsian  economic slowdown.  Sales in these countries are dropping\r\n\r\nand  coupled by the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN countries, the returns are depressed and the risks are\r\n\r\nnow  higher.   Several  years  of  effort  have  been  put  into\r\n\r\npromoting  the  regionalisation  drive.   Many  companies   have\r\n\r\nestablished good connections in neighbouring countries.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  although  there  is a temporary setback  on  the  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis,   Singapore   companies  should  not   give   up   their\r\n\r\nregionalisation  drive.  Those with the financial  strength  and\r\n\r\nmanpower resources should continue to look for opportunities  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.  The  idea  is to use the neighbours  as  low  cost\r\n\r\nmanufacturing bases for Singapore firms.  For example, the  idea\r\n\r\nof  promoting  cross border investment holdings  with  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncompanies  may be meaningful, as it would be helpful to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe comparative advantages of both countries for mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our focus on the regional crisis now seems to be on\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  and Singapore being its closest neighbour  would  be\r\n\r\nparticularly concerned with the adverse impact should there be a\r\n\r\nmajor  implosion  in  Indonesia.   I  would  like  to  ask   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  how  it  intends  to  handle  the  situation  should\r\n\r\nIndonesia  suffer  a  major  financial  and  political   crisis.\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  economic collapse will have an  adverse  effect  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's   investment,   trade  and   commerce   with   them.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  naturally  concerned  that  a   collapse   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  will have a major impact on Singapore and Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy.   Perhaps  there are ways to shield ourselves  from  an\r\n\r\nIndonesian fall-out arising from a collapse which, of course, we\r\n\r\nhope  will not happen.  I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  means  for Singapore to isolate ourselves  from  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, regionalisation is\r\n\r\nstill  very important because the second wing of our economy  is\r\n\r\nthe  one  important way for Singapore to continue  to  grow  and\r\n\r\ncreate wealth for the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my Budget debate speech, I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  not get too easily distracted by the  problems\r\n\r\nfaced  by the region.  We still should have a long term view  in\r\n\r\nmind.   In  fact,  this  is  an excellent  opportunity  for  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  to look for bargains in the region both in greenfield\r\n\r\ninvestments as well as to buy into troubled companies which  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  the management expertise of Singapore  companies.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  am  disappointed at the lack  of  new  initiatives  to\r\n\r\nencourage  regionalisation, I would like to suggest a number  of\r\n\r\nnew short term and long term measures to accelerate the momentum\r\n\r\nof our regionalisation drive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, can the Government share some of the costs\r\n\r\nrelated  to regionalisation for some of these companies?   These\r\n\r\ninclude  the  cost of relocating the employees to  the  overseas\r\n\r\noperation; the cost of training and retraining employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  they go for assignment overseas and as they return back; and\r\n\r\nthe cost of higher insurance of offshore operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to provide further incentives and funding for\r\n\r\ncapital  and  asset  investments made by the  companies  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   In   my  opinion, although we have some  schemes,  the\r\n\r\ncurrent allowances are too small to be effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to provide tax rebates for individuals (the\r\n\r\nemployees   of   the  companies)  who  take  up   regional   and\r\n\r\ninternational  assignments.  Rebates can be used to  offset  the\r\n\r\nhigher cost of the children's education in international schools\r\n\r\nin  case the company does not provide the loss of spouse  income\r\n\r\nand other incomes for the employees who leave Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to work with the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nto allow the period of absence from Singapore to be counted when\r\n\r\ncomputing  the  minimum occupation period of the HDB  flat  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  when  the individual wants to  sell  or  upgrade.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the  period  of absence is  not  counted.   So  this\r\n\r\nbecomes a big problem when the employees return and they  intend\r\n\r\nto upgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other issue that I would like to mention, and this was\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned  by  Mr  Leong just now, is:  can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nenlighten the House as to how Singapore will be impacted  should\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian  economy collapse?  The  impression  among  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is that we are highly dependent and  that  if  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian economy collapses, so will the Singapore economy.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister can give us assurances that  this  will  not\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee is not here. Mr Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I agree with what Mr Leong has informed\r\n\r\nthe  House earlier that we should look for opportunities in  the\r\n\r\nregion  and the fact that the regional economies are  not  doing\r\n\r\nwell  should  not  deter us.  In fact, we  should  be  bold  and\r\n\r\ncourageous  and  look for new grounds.  As  pointed  out  by  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh,  we  can  seize the opportunity,  and  in  this\r\n\r\nregard, I would request the Minister whether he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  experts  in  his Ministry could  advise  the  would-be\r\n\r\ninvestors what are the areas that our investors could  go  into.\r\n\r\nI  think we should also look beyond the region.  We should  look\r\n\r\nfor  markets.   I was rather surprised that a Malaysian  company\r\n\r\ngot  a project in Andhra Pradesh in India to build roads.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  why  with our vast experience in building construction\r\n\r\nour  builders  were not encouraged to do so.  If the  Malaysians\r\n\r\ncan do, so can we.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other question that bothers me is this. We are\r\n\r\nfocusing  ourselves too much in the region.  I think  there  are\r\n\r\nfertile markets that we have not explored, eg, Latin America.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  got  roving\r\n\r\nambassadors.  We should examine markets where nobody  has  gone,\r\n\r\nand  I  think  we should be the first to go.  Because  in  these\r\n\r\ncountries - Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean - there may\r\n\r\nbe some opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which I think we should seriously explore is that\r\n\r\nour  banks should see whether there are openings in other  parts\r\n\r\nof  the world, and take an equity participation in viable banks.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I think in the world, the United Nations, are  places\r\n\r\nfor  our  building construction.  We should also  explore  ideas\r\n\r\nwith  other institutions in other parts of the world on  how  we\r\n\r\ncan  go  about building houses, and in this area, I think  India\r\n\r\nwould   be  a  classic  example  where  there  are  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nopportunities.  I know that there are obstacles  but  we  should\r\n\r\ntry to examine our opportunities in the sub-continent as well as\r\n\r\nin  Latin America again.  And, if necessary, I think MTI  should\r\n\r\ntake  a  mission,  make a study on its own,  and  then  get  our\r\n\r\ninvestors interested in the project.  I said this because unless\r\n\r\nMTI takes the lead, I do not think we can proceed.  MTI can take\r\n\r\nthe  lead, convince our people that there is some hope, and this\r\n\r\ncan be done only if there have been studies done by MTI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will ask the Minister whether he and his officials\r\n\r\nhave  done  any  study  as  to  the  opportunities  of  building\r\n\r\nproperties,  and  construction in Latin America  and  Africa  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, once again, I would to like to\r\n\r\nbring  up  the  issue of the short-term problems  businesses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are facing due to the regional crisis.  No one  could\r\n\r\nhave  predicted the extraordinary outcome of the regional crisis\r\n\r\nwhere  the regional economies and their currencies `nose  dived'\r\n\r\nat  such a fast pace.  No matter what actions the governments of\r\n\r\nthe  affected countries took, none were effective and none could\r\n\r\nrestore  the  loss  of  confidence  in  these  countries.   Many\r\n\r\ncompanies in the region are effectively bankrupt and many of our\r\n\r\nown companies used to do business with these companies.  The net\r\n\r\neffect  on Singapore businesses has been widely spoken about  in\r\n\r\nthe  House over the last few days.  The bottomline is that  many\r\n\r\nSingapore  businesses are faced with short-term  cash  flow  and\r\n\r\ncredit financing problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Thailand and Indonesia, as countries, faced similar\r\n\r\nproblems,  resulting in the crippling of their  economies.   For\r\n\r\nthese  countries, the IMF rescue package was set up to bail  out\r\n\r\ntheir  economies.   I have a similar suggestion,  on  a  smaller\r\n\r\nscale,  but  with the same principles, for Singapore  businesses\r\n\r\nthat may face the same crippling problems.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to create an IMF-style or equivalent bailout\r\n\r\npackage  for Singapore- based economies and companies which  are\r\n\r\nstill  viable  for the long term, but are caught by  the  sudden\r\n\r\nturn of events that even our Government could not have foreseen.\r\n\r\nThis  need not be a handout, but in the form of loans which  can\r\n\r\nbe  jointly administered by local banks and the Government  with\r\n\r\nspecial  interest rates.  The Government can establish stringent\r\n\r\ncriteria  so  that  we  ensure only the  companies  with  strong\r\n\r\nfundamentals  qualify and we do not end up helping truly  `sick'\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister or the Government also guarantee\r\n\r\nletters  of  credit issued by local businesses,  just  like  the\r\n\r\nproposal we made for Indonesian companies?  This will be another\r\n\r\navenue  to help ease the cash flow and financing problems  faced\r\n\r\nby our companies here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad is not here. Mr Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I will touch on the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of the manufacturing sector.  As I mentioned  in\r\n\r\nmy  earlier speech, I feel that the proposed budget for  1998/99\r\n\r\ndid  not  adequately address the critical issues  faced  by  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.  There are both long term issues  as  well\r\n\r\nas  transient issues caused by the crisis and also by  the  long\r\n\r\nterm  competitiveness of Singapore as costs go up and down here.\r\n\r\nBeing  one of the biggest contributors to the economy, at around\r\n\r\n25%  of  the Singapore GDP, this sector deserves more  attention\r\n\r\nthan it got in the Budget announced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the long term, I am glad that the Minister for Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry,  a  few  days  ago, reaffirmed  the  Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to make manufacturing and services the twin  engines\r\n\r\nof growth for our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight that even in developed\r\n\r\ncountries, manufacturing continues to be an important  component\r\n\r\nthat will fuel economic growth in these countries.  I quoted the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of the Taiwan economy, which attributed its  growth  to\r\n\r\nthe  electronics and semiconductor industries by 15 times  in  a\r\n\r\nspan  of seven years.  I strongly believe that we still  have  a\r\n\r\nlong way to go and we can follow some of the growth policies  of\r\n\r\nthe Taiwan government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, the regional crisis has created strains\r\n\r\non many companies, mainly related to the loss of value of assets\r\n\r\ninvested  in  the  region,  cash  flow  problems  and  also  the\r\n\r\ninability  to  collect debts and the loss of  sales  because  of\r\n\r\ninability of customers located in the region to purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to ask the Minister to consider the\r\n\r\nfollowing  proposals, so that we can ensure  confidence  in  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short term measures - some Members have mentioned these.\r\n\r\nI would like to say it again.  Land and rental costs have always\r\n\r\nbeen a key component that contributed to the high cost of doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore, other than labour cost.  Can JTC and  HDB\r\n\r\nrentals  be lowered by 15% rather than freezing them at  current\r\n\r\nlevels?   In  fact, rentals in the commercial sector  have  been\r\n\r\ncoming down.  So, why not JTC and HDB rentals?  Although we  can\r\n\r\nunderstand that the rentals currently for JTC and HDB are  lower\r\n\r\nthan market rates, our businesses are used to these rates. So as\r\n\r\nthey face problems, we need to accordingly come down by the same\r\n\r\npercentage quantum as the commercial rates have come down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to stop all increases in Government charges, like\r\n\r\nutilities  and PSA charges.  In fact, PSA has increased  charges\r\n\r\nthree  times in the last three years, citing corporatisation  as\r\n\r\nan excuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to give a utilities rebate of between 10% and 15%\r\n\r\nto all businesses for the next two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to extend credit schemes like the LEFS to trading\r\n\r\ncompanies which are having problems getting bank loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, how can the Government ensure that 15% reduction\r\n\r\nin  the property tax get passed on to the tenants?  Many Members\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  this.  I hope that the Minister  can  devise  a\r\n\r\nmechanism where the landlords will ensure that tenants get  part\r\n\r\nof the savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long term measures - could the Minister consider\r\n\r\npreferential   land  pricing  for  new  start-up   manufacturing\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  invest a minimum amount  of  capital?   I  am\r\n\r\nlooking  at  land  rent waivers for a period  of  10  years  and\r\n\r\nsubsidised pricing of the property that they purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow JTC tenants to more easily sublet their\r\n\r\npremises  and  let  them have the flexibility  in  managing  the\r\n\r\npremises that they are already renting from HDB or JTC.  So I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  there should be little interference  once  the\r\n\r\ntenants have rented the premises from JTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly feel that manufacturing and technology will\r\n\r\nalways   be   important  for  Singapore's  future  growth.    I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, hope that the Minister will seriously consider  these\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the retail industry has been\r\n\r\nfacing  slower business in the last three years.   I  understand\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Singapore  Retailers  Association  that  the  retail\r\n\r\nindustry  will continue to face a difficult period in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years.   Moreover, with the strengthening of the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  against  the  ASEAN currencies, the  cost  of  goods  in\r\n\r\nSingapore would be dearer by some 20% to 50%, compared to  those\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  ASEAN  countries.  This will further  impact  the\r\n\r\nretail  trade as it would be difficult to attract visitors  from\r\n\r\nthe region to come to shop in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the retail industry, I have the following\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Singapore Retailers Association and the Singapore\r\n\r\nHoteliers  Association  wish to request whether  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  consider shortening the ALS hours on Saturdays,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe retailers, shops and restaurants in the shopping centres and\r\n\r\nhotels in the CBD zone can do more business during the weekends.\r\n\r\nThey  suggested the hours of operation could be shortened,  say,\r\n\r\nfrom the present 2.00 pm to even 12 noon.  With the introduction\r\n\r\nof  the ERP, this request can be factored into the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second idea is to curb the release of more retail\r\n\r\nspace, since there has been a reduction of business in both  the\r\n\r\nmain  Orchard  road  tourist belt as well  as  in  the  regional\r\n\r\nsuburban  centres.   The request is that the  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider  curtailing the supply of additional  retail  space  in\r\n\r\nfuture land tenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the retailers feel that the relevant authorities\r\n\r\nsuch as the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) could help to put  out\r\n\r\nmore  effort to promote tourism to Singapore.  This is even more\r\n\r\nimportant  now  to  bring  in  more Australians,  Europeans  and\r\n\r\nAmericans  to  supplement the drop of tourists  from  the  Asian\r\n\r\nregion.  It would be useful to promote more mega events such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Great  Singapore  Sale, Aerospace  Show,  and  other  major\r\n\r\nexhibitions and events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government could look into these suggestions to\r\n\r\nhelp the local retail industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, small and medium enterprises will\r\n\r\nalways be important and always employ a very large proportion of\r\n\r\nour workforce.  I believe an economy focusing on a large network\r\n\r\nof  SMEs  will  always result in a more flexible  and  adaptable\r\n\r\neconomy  that  can respond to changes fast.   In  fact,  in  the\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley in the USA, many such companies  are  playing  a\r\n\r\nmore  and more important role.  The same is true in Taiwan  -  I\r\n\r\ntouched about this in my Budget debate speech - which is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  strongest economies in the region and which was  relatively\r\n\r\nunhurt by the regional crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, for the last two years, in the budgets announced by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the signals that are given to  our  local  SMEs\r\n\r\nhave  not  been very encouraging.  I would like to request  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister look into a few areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to a similar question last year, the Minister\r\n\r\nstated  that  there  are numerous schemes available  (I  believe\r\n\r\nabout  60 schemes or so which are very confusing) to assist  the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  both financially in training and in infrastructure.   Sad\r\n\r\nto  say, not many SMEs have benefited from these schemes for one\r\n\r\nmain  reason - it is just too complex and difficult for them  to\r\n\r\nprocess their applications.  I am sure very competent and highly\r\n\r\nqualified  civil  servants may have drafted these  schemes,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  they  may not have realised is that the SMEs do  not  have\r\n\r\nsimilar  high calibre people to understand this.  This  mismatch\r\n\r\nis  what  our  real  problem may be.  Could  the  Minister  help\r\n\r\nsimplify  the schemes to make them more user-friendly,  so  that\r\n\r\nmore  SMEs  can successfully utilise them?  Otherwise,  it  will\r\n\r\nonly  benefit  the  larger companies who  have  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nresources to apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his summary speech on 10th\r\n\r\nMarch  gave some figures of the companies successfully  applying\r\n\r\nfor some of these grants.  I would like to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow   what   percentage  of  the  total  SME  population   this\r\n\r\nrepresents.  In my own opinion, this number may be very small of\r\n\r\nthe total population of companies that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister consider changes in the SDF\r\n\r\nclaims  policy?   I suggest we allow the maximum claimable  from\r\n\r\nthe  current  30% to 70% to be raised to 90% for the  SMEs.   To\r\n\r\nreally  benefit  the  SMEs, I would also like  to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nmanagement  level workers and foreign workers also  be  eligible\r\n\r\nfor SDF claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a very specific suggestion is the tax\r\n\r\ndeductibility of vehicles, which is currently at  $35,000.   Can\r\n\r\nthis be raised to the full market value of the vehicles?  Today,\r\n\r\nthe  COE  costs about $35,000.  So the full cost of the  vehicle\r\n\r\ncomes  up to $80,000 to about $100,000.  So I believe we  should\r\n\r\nreview this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nCurrently,  through  the Productivity and Standards  Board,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  implementing  the  Local  Enterprises  Technical\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme (LETAS).  According to the Board's statistics,\r\n\r\nso  far,  about  2,900  SMEs have benefited  from  this  scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever,  under the scheme, the quantum of assistance is  rather\r\n\r\nrestricted  whereby engagement of  professional consultants  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  financed up to 70%.  In other words,  the  enterprises\r\n\r\nwill  still have to fund the remaining 30% in order to engage  a\r\n\r\nprofessional  consultant  to  assist  them  in   their   overall\r\n\r\nbusiness  development.   As a result,  many  new  and  promising\r\n\r\nenterprises will not be able to benefit from this scheme due  to\r\n\r\nfinancial  constraints.  They are, therefore, unable  to  get  a\r\n\r\nbreakthrough in their business development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I would appeal to the Government to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  quantum  of assistance to expand  the  assistance\r\n\r\nscheme  and  to  liberalise the limitation  and  restriction  by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the subsidy to 90%.  I would also suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider  enlisting the  help  of  the  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce to help in the implementation of the LETAS scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment,  the  various Chambers of  Commerce  have  full\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the needs and development of the various trades\r\n\r\nand  industries.  However, due to lack of funds, they could  not\r\n\r\nafford  to  engage enough full-time staff to help their  members\r\n\r\napply  to  the  Productivity and Standards Board for  assistance\r\n\r\nunder LETAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government can consider granting funds to\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers  of Commerce to employ suitable staff  to  provide\r\n\r\nfull support to their members in applying for the assistance  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  helping more members to enjoy the  benefits under  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  through  the  LETAS scheme,  assisted  seven  textile\r\n\r\nmember  firms in their computerisation programme.   Through  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  the  seven\r\n\r\nmember  firms jointly engaged one computer company to help  them\r\n\r\nimplement  full  computerisation for their  businesses.   By  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  the Chamber helped the PSB to save six times the  grants\r\n\r\nthey   would  have  given  should  the  seven  companies   apply\r\n\r\nseparately.   Very  clearly,  close  cooperation   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the Chambers of Commerce will  achieve  greater\r\n\r\ncost  effectiveness.  More importantly, by so  doing,  the  link\r\n\r\nbetween the Government and the business community can be further\r\n\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, the Government has been sparing no efforts\r\n\r\nin  promoting  regionalisation, and the active participation  of\r\n\r\nSMEs is a force that cannot be overlooked.  But because of their\r\n\r\nconstraints in size and scale, many SMEs will find it  difficult\r\n\r\nto  go  regional  without Government assistance.   Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that the Government establish an investment  fund\r\n\r\naimed at the regional market to assist SMEs to venture into  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  region  and  help  them  to  secure  soft  loans   at   a\r\n\r\npreferential rate of interest on a dollar to dollar  basis.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  I  would  also suggest  that  the  project  be\r\n\r\ncoordinated   by   a   well  established  business   and   trade\r\n\r\norganisation and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanaged by professionals from both private and public sectors to\r\n\r\nensure that the objective of the fund can be achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, today, Singapore is still very\r\n\r\ndependent on large multi-national companies, and over the years,\r\n\r\nwe  have  developed a large pool of very qualified managers  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  helping  these  companies  remain  competitive   and\r\n\r\nproductive.  While there is nothing wrong with this, I  feel  we\r\n\r\nstrongly lack a good pool of entrepreneurs who could propel  our\r\n\r\neconomy  even  further.   I  am highly  impressed  by  the  many\r\n\r\ntechnology  start-ups in the Silicon Valley in the USA  and  the\r\n\r\nHsinchu based Science and Industrial Park in Taiwan.  We have to\r\n\r\nask  ourselves  why  we  are  not seeing  the  same  success  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir, it is my contention that we  do  not  have  an\r\n\r\nenvironment that is conducive enough to promote or encourage the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit.  Unlike the countries I mentioned  where\r\n\r\nboth  are  the lands of many `second chances', in Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nhave the exact opposite where there are very few second chances.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore environment and its laws do not tolerate failures\r\n\r\nand  therefore do not encourage creativity and innovative  risk-taking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a number of proposals, which I think\r\n\r\nwill greatly help change the Singapore environment and encourage\r\n\r\nmore risk-taking, especially in technology start-ups.  First, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  amend our bankruptcy laws - the current laws are  very\r\n\r\nunforgiving  and create a long-term stigma for  those  who  have\r\n\r\nventured and failed in the risks that they took.  This for  sure\r\n\r\ndiscourages innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit.   I  hope\r\n\r\nchanges can be quickly made to our bankruptcy laws to give  such\r\n\r\npeople more chances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to provide incentives and facilitate a conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment for venture capitalists and technology investors  to\r\n\r\nbe  easily  set up to support entrepreneurs on high  risk,  high\r\n\r\nreturn projects.  For the few Singaporean venture capitalists we\r\n\r\ndo have, my experience has shown them to be highly conservative.\r\n\r\nWe  need  more  competition for them by inviting  and  providing\r\n\r\nincentives for\r\n\r\nventure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapitalists to set up funds in Singapore.  Sir, such  funds  can\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  range  of  $100 million to  $200  million  and  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily the billions of dollars of funds that we  have  been\r\n\r\ntrying to invite in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I see a need to set up a consortium of local\r\n\r\nprivate  sector companies who can collaborate in R&D  for  home-grown   technological   ideas.   In  this   consortium,   people\r\n\r\nconstantly  rotate in from the local companies on  a  secondment\r\n\r\nbasis  so  that there is a constant flow of new ideas both  ways\r\n\r\nfrom the companies to the consortium.  While it should be mainly\r\n\r\na   private  sector  initiative,  the  Government  can  help  by\r\n\r\nproviding the infrastructure and some funding.  The funding  can\r\n\r\nbe shared between the participating private sector companies and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and  the  individual companies  can  share  the\r\n\r\ntechnology developed through cross licensing agreements with the\r\n\r\nconsortium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, individually, many of our local companies do not have\r\n\r\nsufficient resources to achieve what the synergy among them in a\r\n\r\nconsortium  can achieve.  So I truly hope that we  can  consider\r\n\r\nsetting up such a consortium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I suggest that we allow easier listing of start-up\r\n\r\ncompanies  by  modifying the SESDAQ rules, to  waive  the  three\r\n\r\nyears' operations and profitability requirements, much like  the\r\n\r\nNASDAQ  in  the USA where companies with good ideas  get  listed\r\n\r\neven before there is any inflow of cash from the businesses that\r\n\r\nthey have set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we try to teach creativity in schools, I believe\r\n\r\nteaching  alone is not enough.  We need an environmental  change\r\n\r\nto nurture the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, it is common knowledge that tourism\r\n\r\nhas been and will continue to be a challenging sector, not least\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Asian  region,  given  the  confluence  of  several\r\n\r\nnegative  trends.

Singapore  is  not  spared.\r\n\r\nIndustry  players  here  are already  struggling  with  a  sharp\r\n\r\ndownturn in tourist arrivals, particularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the ASEAN region, less spending power and rising operating\r\n\r\ncost.   Given  the  threat of a shrinking pie,  competition  has\r\n\r\nintensified,   if  not,  turned  ferocious.   We  have   already\r\n\r\nwitnessed  the  adverse  impact these negative  trends  have  on\r\n\r\nairline  companies and almost certainly the wave  will  hit  the\r\n\r\nhospitality and retail sectors equally hard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most players have accepted certain eventualities such\r\n\r\nas  slowing demand from the economic crisis, they are  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  the situation might be aggravated if the following  issues\r\n\r\nare not addressed.  Firstly, the adverse impact of a severe haze\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  that  that  Singapore  experienced  last  year.   A\r\n\r\nrepetition   of  this  health  hazard  would  erode  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncredibility as a tourist destination and would put to waste  all\r\n\r\nthe  past promotional efforts, especially those made in the wake\r\n\r\nof last year's haze.  Any pre-emptive or preventive effort would\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  most critical to the fate of the  entire  tourism\r\n\r\nindustry.  Secondly, that if tourism promotion efforts  were  to\r\n\r\nbe curtailed by the overall austerity intent of this new Budget,\r\n\r\nthen   some  players,  especially  the  smaller  hoteliers   and\r\n\r\nretailers, would be rendered non-viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, on the contrary, it is felt that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  all  the more pump in extra resources at  this  time  to\r\n\r\nsustain the promotion of Singapore as a tourist destination.   I\r\n\r\nwould therefore like to reiterate my GPC Chairman's request that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  considers investing more in innovative  tourism\r\n\r\npromotion, including the design of packages and programmes  that\r\n\r\ntakes into account a generally more budget conscious clientele.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I agree with Mrs Lim about the\r\n\r\nneed  to  review  our  policy  on tourist  promotion.   We  have\r\n\r\nachieved  a  great deal and I would like to pay tribute  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourism Board and its officials.  But, nevertheless, I\r\n\r\nwould urge them not to rest on their laurels.  Opportunities are\r\n\r\ncoming  up  now  in  the sense that more and more  airlines  are\r\n\r\ncoming  and  air fares are getting cheaper.  But, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nas mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  Mrs  Lim  earlier, the haze has created a big  problem,  and\r\n\r\nMembers  have  also shown their concern.  It is not  within  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  the Minister, but it is very important to  minimise\r\n\r\nthis  problem.   Sometimes  the  media  paints  a  picture  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is such a dangerous place.  The important thing is  to\r\n\r\ndrive  home the message that Singaporeans are more healthy  than\r\n\r\nprobably those in other parts of the world.  So the messsage has\r\n\r\nto be sent.  But in the meanwhile, we should also re-examine the\r\n\r\nissue  and I would suggest an angle which has probably not  been\r\n\r\nlooked into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing generation of tourists both from America\r\n\r\nand Europe who are coming to this part of the world and they are\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the Museums and the cultural scene.   Singapore  is\r\n\r\nuniquely  situated in the sense that no other country,  probably\r\n\r\nwith  the exception of Malaysia which is a big country,  whereas\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  a very small area, has got the Chinese  culture,\r\n\r\nIndian culture, Malay culture and others as well.  What we ought\r\n\r\nto  do  is to promote this cultural heritage and I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat we can take a leaf from the Indonesian experience.  When  I\r\n\r\nwas there years back, the Ramayana Mahabatra Ballet was superbly\r\n\r\nperformed.  The tourists enjoyed it.  May I urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nexamine the possibility of having the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have Chinese opera, probably in English. We could\r\n\r\nhave  musicals from China.  We could have musicals  from  India.\r\n\r\nThe  Indian  and  Chinese cultural scene  could  be  created  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the tourists will enjoy it.  This is an area which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  may want to study because we are  having  a  lull\r\n\r\nperiod  now.  We should see what other areas the tourists  want.\r\n\r\nI remember reading in the newspaper that the museum tourists are\r\n\r\ngetting  bigger.  We do not have many museums but  at  least  we\r\n\r\nhave a cultural scene.  I would go even further.  We should form\r\n\r\nour   own  ballet  company.   At  least  we  could  invite   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  and I think they will be willing to  come  here  to\r\n\r\nperform on a cultural exchange basis for some months.  We  could\r\n\r\nadvertise  this to the tourists and they will come.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that they just come and watch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  procession  of  Thaipusam which has a  considerable  crowd.\r\n\r\nThere  are other aspects of the Indian and Malay cultural  scene\r\n\r\nwhich  could be put on showcase and the tourists will enjoy  it.\r\n\r\nSo  I  am asking the Minister to give some serious consideration\r\n\r\nto this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. I know the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  does tie up with Singapore Airlines.  I think they should\r\n\r\nalso  tie  up  with  other  airlines to  see  how  we  can  sell\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh Choon Kang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nrecently, a voter came to see me and complained that he had been\r\n\r\nconned  by a commodity futures trading company.  Within a  short\r\n\r\nperiod  of  six  weeks, he lost nearly $200,000.  This  happened\r\n\r\nsome  two years ago.  Over the past two years, he went from  the\r\n\r\nCommercial  Affairs Department to other Government agencies  for\r\n\r\nassistance, but was unable to recover the money he had lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to him, he responded to a \"vacancy for part-time\r\n\r\ntraders\"  advertisement in the newspaper and fell into the  trap\r\n\r\nof  the  commodity trading company.   What happened to  him  was\r\n\r\nquite  similar to what was described in an article published  in\r\n\r\nthe  Lianhe  Zaobao  on 17th December last year.   This  article\r\n\r\nentitled  \"One  has  to  be extremely careful  when  going  into\r\n\r\ncommodity futures trading\" by one named Zhenwei.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this voter, the company first arranged for him\r\n\r\nto  attend  lectures and to listen to how the  company  enlisted\r\n\r\ntheir  clients.    Subsequently, he was persuaded   to  open  an\r\n\r\naccount  of his own, for trading in commodity futures.   He  was\r\n\r\ncoaxed into signing the contract without looking into the  small\r\n\r\nprint  therein.   Subsequently, he found that this was  a  legal\r\n\r\ncontract  authorising  the  traders  to  transact  in  commodity\r\n\r\nfutures on his behalf.  The people in the company used all kinds\r\n\r\nof  incentives and inducements to talk him into putting all  his\r\n\r\nmoney into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   account.   The  impression  created  then  was   that   by\r\n\r\n\"investing\" more money, he would be able not only to recover all\r\n\r\nhis  losses but also make profits  amounting to some $1 million.\r\n\r\nSo within a short period of six weeks, he put in $200,000.  When\r\n\r\nhe  had exhausted all his savings, he was even asked to sell his\r\n\r\nflat  and get cash for further  \"investment\".  Fortunately, with\r\n\r\nthe  advice of friends, he decided to instruct a lawyer to write\r\n\r\nto  the  company  to close his account.  At the  time  when  his\r\n\r\naccount  was closed,  he found that there was only about  $5,000\r\n\r\nleft in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this amendment to create an opportunity to\r\n\r\ntell  Singaporeans that trading in commodity futures is a highly\r\n\r\nspeculative activity  which entails extremely high  risk.   Some\r\n\r\ntraders  have resorted to improper means to induce ignorant  and\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens  to indulge in such  speculative  activities.\r\n\r\nIn  the  process, these people earn huge amounts of  commission,\r\n\r\nbut  their  poor clients lose all their hard earned  savings  or\r\n\r\neven  retirement  money.  I therefore  would  like  to  ask  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  to be vigilant and not to fall into the trap with  the\r\n\r\nhope of making a quick buck.  At the same time, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Government  to  take proper measures  to  check   such\r\n\r\nunscrupulous business activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, to develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into an international business centre to ensure  that\r\n\r\nin the next century we can be the leader in the regional economy\r\n\r\nis an important economic strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop into an international business hub, one of the\r\n\r\nmain  conditions  is  to be able to attract  foreign  companies,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  multi-national companies to set  up  regional\r\n\r\nheadquarters in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of EDB, up till the end of\r\n\r\n1996,  Singapore had approved only 22 companies  to  have  their\r\n\r\noffices in Singapore accorded the status of oversea headquarters\r\n\r\nor business headquarters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied\r\n\r\nwith this result.

Many MPs have\r\n\r\nbeen  exhorting  the Government to concentrate on  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining  of  workers,  particularly  during  this  period  of\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is a good time for companies to be given\r\n\r\nshort-term  assistance  by  the  Government  for  retraining  of\r\n\r\nworkers,   so  that  local  companies  and  their  workers   can\r\n\r\nrightfully adjust to the changes in the economy.  One idea is to\r\n\r\nask  the Government to consider increasing the subsidy level for\r\n\r\nSDF-funded training programmes from the current top level of 70%\r\n\r\nto,  say,  90%.  This increase can be a short-term measure  for,\r\n\r\nsay,  two  years, so as to encourage companies  to  devote  more\r\n\r\nfunds to retrain their workers during this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Toh is not here.

To\r\n\r\nachieve this, economic development is an important means to this\r\n\r\nend.   Full  employment  could go a  long  way  in  helping  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to achieve the objectives of enhancing the quality of\r\n\r\nlife and standard of living of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 70s, because we have been able to sustain\r\n\r\nfull  employment, the life of Singaporeans has  indeed  improved\r\n\r\ntremendously.   According to statistics,  the  real  incomes  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean workers have gone up, on the average, by 5.4% a year\r\n\r\nsince  1973.   More significantly, workers who  earn  less  than\r\n\r\n$1,500 per month, as a percentage of the workforce, has declined\r\n\r\nfrom  about  80% in 1987 to 42% last year, a drop  of  about  40\r\n\r\npercentage points over a period of 10 years.  I think this is  a\r\n\r\nvery  significant achievement that the Government can  be  proud\r\n\r\nof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead into the future, Sir, I feel that we have two\r\n\r\nmajor  challenges.  Firstly, how are we going  to  sustain  full\r\n\r\nemployment?  And, secondly, how are we going to help more  lower\r\n\r\nincome workers to move into the higher income group, as what  we\r\n\r\nhave done in the last 10-20 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the issue of sustaining full employment, I\r\n\r\nthink this is going to be a very challenging task. Today, if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  look around the world, not many economies are enjoying\r\n\r\nfull  employment.  I have stated many times in this  House  that\r\n\r\nthere are 35 million workers in the US who are working on a part-time basis, 18 million workers unemployed in Europe, and in  the\r\n\r\nlast  two days, I read that unemployment in South Korea has gone\r\n\r\nup  to  1.5 million, and every month 10,000 workers are becoming\r\n\r\nunemployed.   In other words, many OECD countries and  NIEs  are\r\n\r\nfinding it difficult to create enough employment to sustain full\r\n\r\nemployment or to lower unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, I feel that during this period of\r\n\r\nslowdown,  we  have  to  take  a  fairly  serious  look  towards\r\n\r\ncontaining  the cost of doing business in Singapore,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nslow down the pace of retrenchment, which may be picking up very\r\n\r\nsoon  or  continue to pick up over the years.  I have looked  at\r\n\r\nlast  year's Economic Survey, and according to this  report,  it\r\n\r\nwas   stated   that  the  unit  business  cost  (UBC)   of   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector continued to increase in 1997 at  the  rate\r\n\r\nof  0.4%.  And this report went on to say that last year,  ULC's\r\n\r\n(unit labour cost) contribution to UBC's growth was negligible,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause ULC's growth was flat.  Services cost contributed  0.46%\r\n\r\nto the growth of UBC while Government rates and fees lowered the\r\n\r\nUBC  index by 0.06 percentage point.  From this report, it would\r\n\r\nappear  that  the  main  contributors towards  the  higher  unit\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost  in  Singapore  is  not  quite  labour  cost  nor\r\n\r\nGovernment rates and charges, but rather it is services cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are services cost? Again, according to the various\r\n\r\nreports,   services   cost  would  include  rental,   utilities,\r\n\r\ncommunication, trade and transportation, interest  and  finance.\r\n\r\nOf  the  five  items,  I believe the first four  items   rental,\r\n\r\nutilities,  communication, transport and trade   are  very  much\r\n\r\nrelated  to the fees and charges imposed either by the statutory\r\n\r\nboards  or  corporatised entities.  These include the JTC,  HDB,\r\n\r\nPSA, CAAS and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that since the services cost has been the\r\n\r\nmain  contributor to higher unit business cost in  Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest that, if possible, the MTI may  wish  to\r\n\r\ntake  the lead to take a closer look into this area and  to  see\r\n\r\nwhat  can  be  done  to  encourage these relevant  agencies  and\r\n\r\nstatutory boards to review their pricing policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are basically two ways of determining the rate\r\n\r\nof  charges to  your customers.  Some organisations look at  the\r\n\r\ncost  of provision, either a product or services.  They add  the\r\n\r\nnormal profit margin and from there, they determine the price to\r\n\r\ncharge  the  customer.  This is known as the  cost-plus  method.\r\n\r\nThe  second approach is to look at the market place and see what\r\n\r\nwould be a fair rate to charge the customer, what the market can\r\n\r\nafford  to  bear.  And from these, do whatever is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nlower the cost of production, so that you can continue to remain\r\n\r\nviable without charging too high a price to the customers,  what\r\n\r\nis known as price-minus approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the business world of today, in the private sector, many\r\n\r\norganisations have moved away from the cost-plus method\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards  the  price-minus method. The  reason  is  very  simple.\r\n\r\nCompetition  is  so  keen  that any  provider  of  products  and\r\n\r\nservices  is no longer a price-setter, but rather a price-taker.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have to accept this is what the market can bear,\r\n\r\nand  their challenge is to lower the cost of production so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can meet the price expectation and yet remain viable.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I sincerely hope that some of our statutory boards\r\n\r\nand  corporatised  entities can really change their  mindset  by\r\n\r\nmoving   away   from  the  cost-plus  mentality  and   challenge\r\n\r\nthemselves  to what extent they can move towards the price-minus\r\n\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because two days ago, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nin  this  House,  in  response to the call  for  containing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  rate  of  fees and charges, mentioned  that  these\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies will continue to do regular revisions  with\r\n\r\nsmall  increments  for fees and charges in  order  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrising  cost of operation.  His statement is probably valid  for\r\n\r\nthe  ministries  and  departments which are providing  a  public\r\n\r\nservice.  What I am afraid is that some of the statutory  boards\r\n\r\nand  coporatised  entities may misunderstand what  he  said  and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  adopt  that  kind of business  approach  in  their\r\n\r\ndealing of the products and services.  This is the first  point.\r\n\r\nIt  will  go a long way if MTI can help to contain the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbusiness,  in  particular, services cost, so that companies  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to survive in this difficult period and hopefully,  the\r\n\r\npace of retrenchment can be managed somewhat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the issue of helping the lower income workers\r\n\r\nto  move  into a higher income group.  According to  the  Labour\r\n\r\nForce  Survey  of 1997, among workers who are 30-40  years  old,\r\n\r\nthere  are  150,000  of them earning between  $1,000-$1,500  and\r\n\r\n130,000  of them earning between $1,500 and $2,000.   What  this\r\n\r\nmeans  is  that  there are 280,000 workers  in  Singapore,  aged\r\n\r\nbetween  30-39,  earning between $1,000 and $2,000.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  many  of these workers are trainable and it is  worthwhile\r\n\r\ninvesting in their upgrading because they have another 30  years\r\n\r\nof working career ahead of them.  At the same time, I believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere will be enough good paying jobs and better paying jobs for\r\n\r\nthese  workers  to  move  into because under  the  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's   Competitiveness,  I  believe  the   various   sub-committees have identified the growth sectors for the next  five\r\n\r\nto 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest that MTI may wish to\r\n\r\nconsider taking stock of all these new growth sectors identified\r\n\r\nby the various sub-committees and do a projection on the kind of\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities that are coming up in our economy  over\r\n\r\nthe  next five to 10 years, look into the kind of skills  needed\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers  to  move into these new  growth  sectors  and\r\n\r\nprovide that information to the Ministry of Manpower so that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower, in coming out with new  initiatives  and\r\n\r\nenhancing  the quality of workforce, will make sure  that  their\r\n\r\nprogramme and the economic development programme under  MTI  are\r\n\r\nkept in sync.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I feel that the setting up of MOM is a\r\n\r\nvery  timely move.  At the same time, I also feel that  MOM  and\r\n\r\nMTI  must work hand-in-hand so that all the new and better  jobs\r\n\r\nbeing  created  in the economy in the future  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the Singaporean workers, especially the older  and  the\r\n\r\nnot-so-young workers who are under-educated.  Many of  them  are\r\n\r\nnot looking forward to more handouts through wealth sharing, but\r\n\r\nare looking forward to be given a chance to participate directly\r\n\r\nin  furthering the economic progress of Singapore so that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean can live a better life in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in this fiscal\r\n\r\nyear  there  is  a  big budget allocation for  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.   For  the  preparation of our young  ones,  this  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable and I fully support it.  As our economy  matures,\r\n\r\nthere  must  also  be a budget for retraining of  those  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   I  commend  the  Finance  Minister  for  his  quick\r\n\r\nresponse to support the call from Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon for  more\r\n\r\nretraining and upgrading of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to recognise the past contribution of our workers\r\n\r\nand  stand  by  them during hard times.  Is  it  not  our  moral\r\n\r\nobligation to retrain and upgrade these workers to enhance their\r\n\r\nfuture  employability?  I would like to call on  the  Government\r\n\r\nand the employers to recognise this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without retraining, our workers' productivity will remain\r\n\r\nstagnant.  Any retraining will enable them to get a higher value\r\n\r\njob  which  will imply a higher income for them, as Mr  Lim  has\r\n\r\njust pointed out.  This would also generate more profit for  the\r\n\r\nemployers.   Since we have quite a large pool of  workers  below\r\n\r\nSecondary Two education, there should be a large scale  training\r\n\r\nprogramme, including providing a basic education such as primary\r\n\r\nand   secondary  education,  IT  training  and  specific  skills\r\n\r\ntraining,  etc.   Some  of these forms of training  are  already\r\n\r\nbeing  carried out by NTUC and MOL.  The NTUC has the  BEST  and\r\n\r\nWISE  programmes.   They  also  have  the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  (SRP) for which 80% of the training cost is  paid  by\r\n\r\nSDF and 20% is paid by the employer.  At the same time, EDB pays\r\n\r\n70% of their salary during training with the balance of 30% paid\r\n\r\nby  the  company.   These programmes have received  overwhelming\r\n\r\nresponse.   So  it  is necessary to reach out and  convince  all\r\n\r\nemployers and workers to participate in programmes of this kind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable that the employers, especially the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  are afraid of losing their employees after training them.\r\n\r\nBut if all employers can change their mindset and capitalise  on\r\n\r\nthis  window period of slower economic activities to train their\r\n\r\nworkers,  there  would  be a better chance  of  success  because\r\n\r\nworkers are less likely to job hop.  We applaud the NTUC and MOL\r\n\r\nfor their effort in setting up the programme but I would like to\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to upgrade this retraining programme  to  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide  programme.  To achieve this, I  hope  the  proposed\r\n\r\nbudget  that allows for the upgrading of skills of 9,000 workers\r\n\r\nonly  in  the fiscal year 98/99 will be increased substantially.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I would like to cite one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample of what other governments have similarly done for  their\r\n\r\nworkers in terms of training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction Industry Training Authority of Hong Kong\r\n\r\nprovides   basic   courses  such  as  bricklaying,   plastering,\r\n\r\ncarpentry  work, plumbing, etc.  Similar to our  SRP  programme,\r\n\r\ntheir trainees for these courses receive training allowances  as\r\n\r\nwell as free-of-charge training in their basic craftsmanship and\r\n\r\nconstruction supervisory courses.  In addition, there is also  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy  scheme  for  the  employers  where  the  employers  are\r\n\r\nsubsidised HK$2,000 per month for two to three years  for  every\r\n\r\nsingle  basic  craft graduate they employ.  This encourages  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to  employ  such properly trained  persons  in  their\r\n\r\nconstruction work. The Singapore Contractors Association and the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Construction  and  Timber  Industry  Employees'  Union\r\n\r\n(BATU)  are  currently discussing to work  out  a  programme  to\r\n\r\nintensify skills training in the construction industry.  We hope\r\n\r\nthe Government will support the effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retraining of workers should be regarded as an\r\n\r\nurgent  national issue.  Therefore, I urge the Minister  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor more off-Budget allocations to do more for the upgrading  of\r\n\r\nthe national workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my amendment is on\r\n\r\nthe training of manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hear with great interest what Mr Lim Swee Say has\r\n\r\nsaid.   In  fact, he has brought up many valid points about  the\r\n\r\nretraining  of  workers.  But the only problem of retraining  of\r\n\r\nworkers is that it costs a lot of money.  In fact, the Secretary-General of NTUC has said that two to three times more money  has\r\n\r\nto be spent on the retraining of workers than what has been done\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government only pays lip service to the retraining\r\n\r\nof  workers.  There is no provision for funds  anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget  which has been set aside for the retraining of  workers.\r\n\r\nSingapore wants to attract high technology industries,  but  the\r\n\r\nhigh  technology industries need plenty of trained workers.   It\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreported  that  the  job  growth at  4%  in  Silicon  Valley  at\r\n\r\nCalifornia is the highest in America, but the problem  there  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a great shortage of skilled workers.   Singapore\r\n\r\nshall  also  suffer the same fate if not enough skilled  workers\r\n\r\nare  trained.  The wafer fabrication and other  high  technology\r\n\r\nindustries take in only trained workers.  If Singapore does  not\r\n\r\nhave enough trained workers, the high technology industries  may\r\n\r\nbe  reluctant  to  come and as a consequence our  economy  shall\r\n\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these times of low economic growth and where the private\r\n\r\nsector is not doing well, the Government must play a bigger part\r\n\r\nin  the  retraining of workers.  The Government cannot, like  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  depend only on businesses and the Skills Development\r\n\r\nFund  to  carry the burden of retraining of workers.   In  these\r\n\r\ndifficult  times, the urgency for Government to  give  financial\r\n\r\nsupport  for  retraining  of workers is  all  the  more  greater\r\n\r\nbecause of rising unemployment.  I know the Government's  policy\r\n\r\nis against paying out freely for welfarism.  But money put aside\r\n\r\nfor  the retraining of workers is definitely not payment out for\r\n\r\nwelfarism.   It  is an investment.  I would again  call  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that in these times where retrenchments  of  workers\r\n\r\nare  on  the rise it should give generous releases of funds  for\r\n\r\nthe retraining of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, many speakers before me\r\n\r\nhave mentioned that these are indeed tough economic times and it\r\n\r\nis  important that Government spends time, effort and  funds  to\r\n\r\nprepare  Singapore  to  face  the  challenges  ahead.   We  have\r\n\r\nallocated  indeed some funds for skills retraining and  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining  and development of manpower to help those coming  back\r\n\r\nto work and to retrain them to prevent structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider putting even\r\n\r\nmore money because this must be seen as an investment for us  to\r\n\r\nmake  at  a time when things are relatively cheaper and  workers\r\n\r\nare able to spare that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three basic areas that I would urge the Ministry to\r\n\r\nlook deeper into are as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollows.   The  first  is  this  group  of  elderly  people  and\r\n\r\nhousewives who are returning back to the workforce.  With  these\r\n\r\ntwo  groups of people there are certain problems which  I  think\r\n\r\nhave  not been addressed sufficiently.  First of all, for  those\r\n\r\nreturning  to the workforce after 10 or 15 years away  from  the\r\n\r\nworking world they have a lack of confidence. Sometimes, even if\r\n\r\ntheir   skills are still there, they feel that their skills  are\r\n\r\nnow  obsolete  and out of date because times have changed.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  teachers  would feel that students  nowadays  are  not\r\n\r\nquite  the  same as they were when they first taught  10  or  15\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  So they lose that confidence.  I think we  can  use\r\n\r\nthis  quiet  time to spend a little bit more time in orientating\r\n\r\nthem back to the working world, back to schools or companies  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  professions  they  are  in.   And  we  must  encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies  to do these things by giving them tax incentives  and\r\n\r\ngrants.   We also need to have a kind of agency which can  match\r\n\r\nthe job and the skills with the particular person that needs  to\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  the workforce.  We do not see too much  of  that\r\n\r\ncurrently  and with the Ministry working perhaps in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  the Ministry of Manpower, some funds can be allocated  for\r\n\r\nprojects like this.  An agency like this could then be  able  to\r\n\r\nmatch  more  accurately the needs of the market and  the  skills\r\n\r\nthat are out there waiting to be harnessed.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area that we need to look closer into and more\r\n\r\ndeeply  is  this area of service skills.  I have just had  lunch\r\n\r\nwith  a group of businessmen who feel that these are tough times\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore is costly and the region is very cheap.   And\r\n\r\nif  any tourists were to start coming back again, they would  go\r\n\r\nto  our  neighbours rather than here.  Our discussion turned  to\r\n\r\nthis  area  of service skills.  Many of our shops, whether  they\r\n\r\nare big or small, are still caught in a time-frame which I think\r\n\r\nis  what made us competitive in early days when our labour costs\r\n\r\nwere  low.   We emphasise the cheapness of what we  sell  rather\r\n\r\nthan the quality of what we sell and the quality of service  and\r\n\r\nthe follow-up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we give after the sale.  I think we need to spend effort to\r\n\r\ngive companies and workers the rationale, the incentive and  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  they should upgrade their service skills.   Because\r\n\r\nright now Singapore is already an expensive place, and if you do\r\n\r\nnot  pack your products or services at a higher level, then  you\r\n\r\ncannot  compete  with  the  crowd.  You  have  to  rise  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation  where, like on Fifth Avenue in New York,  things  are\r\n\r\nvery  expensive, everybody knows that, yet the whole world makes\r\n\r\na  pilgrimage there whenever they go to America.  And I think we\r\n\r\nmust  begin to give Singapore that cachet, that image of a place\r\n\r\nwhere you come because you get good products, you get good after-sales service, and you will not be taken for a ride.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I would urge the Minister to look at\r\n\r\nand  to give more funds to is this area of preventing structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.  This means that there are workers out  there  who\r\n\r\nare  not quite so skilled but perhaps have never had time to  go\r\n\r\nfor  training.  And even if they had time after work,  they  are\r\n\r\ntoo  tired  to  do  so.  Many of the workers would  actually  be\r\n\r\nholding two to three jobs and they might say, \"Look.  I have  no\r\n\r\ntime  to go for training.\"  I think this is an opportunity  then\r\n\r\nfor  us  to find schemes to give companies the opportunities  to\r\n\r\nretrain  the workers on the workers' own work time.  Because  to\r\n\r\nask them to do so otherwise would not be very successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I would like to ask the Minister to continue\r\n\r\nlooking deeply into these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the training of\r\n\r\nworkers  and the upgrading of their skills in this technological\r\n\r\nage  are  of  utmost  importance.  Skills training  will  enable\r\n\r\nworkers  to  reach  the level as demanded of  them.   This  will\r\n\r\nenhance their employability.   From the economic point of  view,\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  of  our  workers' skills will  make  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  more competitive.  Although the funds for the  training\r\n\r\nof  workers  come  from the Skills Development Fund  (SDF),  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  the  training is done  depends  much  on  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  The Government has not been active  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproviding  the  training and upgrading  of  the  skills  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.     The  employers call the shot.  This is  often  very\r\n\r\nrestrictive because in the curriculum, the courses are  designed\r\n\r\nin such a way that they cater only to the needs of the companies\r\n\r\nemploying them.  More often than not, they do not help to expand\r\n\r\nthe  vision  of  the workers themselves, and the companies  only\r\n\r\ncare  for  themselves.   As a result, all this  training  cannot\r\n\r\nachieve our overall national objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, because how and when the workers are to\r\n\r\nbe  trained  is in the hands of the employers, the workers  feel\r\n\r\nthat  if  there is no more future for them in the company or  in\r\n\r\nthe  industry, they will not be motivated  to embark on  courses\r\n\r\nto   improve  themselves.    Although  there  is  now  a  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme (SRP) to enable  the  trainees  to  get\r\n\r\nbetter and more comprehensive training, I think only about 1,500\r\n\r\nworkers have benefited under the scheme.  The Government  should\r\n\r\nexpand such training courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Government consider providing\r\n\r\nbursaries  for  workers to encourage and help  them  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves  or  to go into another area of higher  skills.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Ministry of Education gives bursaries to people who\r\n\r\nwant  to become teachers and it also gives bursaries to existing\r\n\r\nteachers  to upgrade themselves.  I think we should  give  these\r\n\r\nworkers  a  similar kind of bursary to help them  upgrade.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should be able to know what kind of industry will, in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of economic development, be needing  more  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  what  kind of industry will be eventually  phased\r\n\r\nout.  So they must have objectives charted out to make sure that\r\n\r\nthese  workers in the sunset industry can upgrade themselves  to\r\n\r\ngo into the sunrise industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the spending of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Trade and Industry for its economic development\r\n\r\nprogramme  is reported to be 1.8% of GDP for this  year.   I  am\r\n\r\nalso  happy to note that, as reported in this House, a total  of\r\n\r\n76  companies participated in the Skills Redevelopment Programme\r\n\r\n(SRP) initiated and launched by the NTUC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese   76   companies,  together  with  NTUC,  EDB,   ITE   and\r\n\r\npolytechnics have committed to retrain and upgrade the skills of\r\n\r\nover  5,000  workers.   An estimated $20 million  is  needed  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  training of these 5,000  workers.   In  the  next\r\n\r\nphase, an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 workers will be targeted to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the SRP.  To train such a large number of workers\r\n\r\nis  no  small  task.  But I think the commitment of the  various\r\n\r\norganisations,  as  well  as  the participants,  is  not  to  be\r\n\r\ndoubted.   But what is lacking, however, is the funding required\r\n\r\nto  carry  out this skills upgrading programme.  With  the  next\r\n\r\nphase  of participants targeted at 20,000, the SRP will  require\r\n\r\nat  least $80 million to successfully carry out all its intended\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total number of retrenchment exercises carried out\r\n\r\nin  the electronics industry in the last fiscal year, more  than\r\n\r\n60%  were  carried out in the last three months.  The  prospects\r\n\r\nfor these workers in finding alternative employment are tough as\r\n\r\nmore  companies  are  restructuring and downsizing.   Without  a\r\n\r\nproper education and nation-wide recognition of their skills and\r\n\r\nexperience  they  have  acquired over  the  last  years  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious  company,  it  is  unlikely  they  are  able  to   gain\r\n\r\nalternative  employment.  Moreover, if they  are  able  to  find\r\n\r\nalternative employment, even in the best situation,  who  is  to\r\n\r\nsay that they will not be retrenched two to three years down the\r\n\r\nroad?  No one can guarantee life employment.  But with SRP, what\r\n\r\ncan  be  guaranteed is life long employment.  If no  significant\r\n\r\neffort  and  funding is provided for the retraining  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  these  workers, what we  may  face  is  the  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  problem of structural unemployment.   This  upgrading\r\n\r\nwill in time increase the productivity of these workers who will\r\n\r\nbring  back the increases and other relevant skills back to  the\r\n\r\nrespective  companies.  Thus, unions do have a  part  in  adding\r\n\r\nvalue  to these companies.  This new partnership direction gives\r\n\r\nan added new dimension to the labour-management relation that is\r\n\r\ndeveloping in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI's increased spending will create jobs. But if we do\r\n\r\nnot  train  these  workers  now, when these  higher-paying  jobs\r\n\r\nbecome available, our workers will not have the necessary skills\r\n\r\nand qualifications available to take them up.  If no significant\r\n\r\neffort and funding is provided to the training and upgrading  of\r\n\r\nthese  workers, there will be a mismatch between these new  jobs\r\n\r\nand the current workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SRP has the ability to confer skills certification upon\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  its programmes.  This was made possible  through\r\n\r\nthe   development  of  the  national  skills  certification  and\r\n\r\nrecognition  in Singapore.  It is also progressive,  because  as\r\n\r\nexisting  industries  continue to innovate  and  new  industries\r\n\r\ndevelop, new skills upgrading syllabus can be produced  and  the\r\n\r\nnew skills can be certified to meet the needs of the industries.\r\n\r\nI  see  skills  upgrading of our workforce as critical.   It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary because of the 5,000 workers currently in the SRP, 71%\r\n\r\nhave  Secondary Two qualification and 50% of them are  40  years\r\n\r\nold.    If  their  skills  are  not  upgraded,  they  will  find\r\n\r\nthemselves left behind.  Employers have done their part, so have\r\n\r\nthe  unions and workers.  It is now up to the third party of the\r\n\r\nTripartite Committee to do its part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Government has Edusave for those in schools.\r\n\r\nSir, may I propose that in the long term, Government should have\r\n\r\n\"Skillsave\",  so that the future workers will not be  caught  in\r\n\r\nthe same web of circumstances as the current workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay is not here.

It is a reflection\r\n\r\nof the far-sightedness of our Government and it is also indeed a\r\n\r\npreparation  for  the  future.  R&D  is  actually  a  long  term\r\n\r\nprocess.

When we can also  take  note  of  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of such long-term programmes from the  commercial\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it is a generalisation, but many American\r\n\r\ncompanies will cut back their R&D funding whenever their  profit\r\n\r\nmargin  is  being  squeezed.  On the other  hand,  for  Japanese\r\n\r\ncorporations, they have a long term plan for R&D.  Indeed,  they\r\n\r\ncapitalise their R&D programmes.  So, in the recent years,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  you  look at the number of patents, R&D outcome for Japanese\r\n\r\ncompanies,  they  tend to be more productive than  the  American\r\n\r\ncompanies.   I do support the funding provided by Government  in\r\n\r\nthis  year's  budget  for  R&D.   But,  nonetheless,  when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  budget  is tight, we have to  be  more  critical  in\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  various R&D programmes.   At  a  time  when  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Nominated MP, Mdm Claire Chiang,  had  lamented  the\r\n\r\nsmall  amount of budget we allocated to MCD, it is all the  more\r\n\r\nso  for us to ask whether the R&D money allocated to the various\r\n\r\nGovernment-funded R&D institutes is actually value for money and\r\n\r\nvalue for money well spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have the National Science and Technology Board,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  overseeing organisation, and ask  more  critical\r\n\r\nquestions  in  assessing how much benefit would incur  from  the\r\n\r\nmoney  we  spend  on such programmes.  I would  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that maybe now is a good time to review the whole  R&D\r\n\r\nfunding  programme to trim the fat and to critically review  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes funded by the NSTB in this financial year.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, as our economy\r\n\r\nupgrades to more high-tech industries, I think we will need more\r\n\r\nR&D  activities.  I learn from the Economic Survey,  the  latest\r\n\r\nrelease  by the Government, that the number of personnel engaged\r\n\r\nin  R&D activities in 1996 grew by 18% to 15,419.  I think it is\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncredible  improvement and progress.  But  I  believe  that  more\r\n\r\ncould be done.  If you look at the statistics again released  by\r\n\r\nGovernment, you will notice that as far as the gross expenditure\r\n\r\non  research  and development is concerned, it has tripled  from\r\n\r\n1990 to 1996.  Similarly, the number of research scientists  and\r\n\r\nengineers  has more than doubled from 4,329 in 1990  to  10,153.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  you were to look at R&D expenditure  per  research\r\n\r\nscientist  and  engineer  (RSE),  it  has  increased  only  from\r\n\r\n$130,000 to $177,000 for the same period, which is less than 30%\r\n\r\ngrowth.   So  I think here is an indication where in  fact  more\r\n\r\nneeds  to be pumped into this area to help facilitate the growth\r\n\r\nof  R&D  and  R&D  activities to expedite the upgrading  of  our\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is that the private sector was the\r\n\r\nlargest employer of R&D personnel in 1996 employing 57%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal R&D manpower and the RSEs in the private sector were  most\r\n\r\nhighly concentrated in the electronics industry cluster which is\r\n\r\nabout  2,780,  followed by engineering which is  a  low  second,\r\n\r\nabout  895, and IT and telecommunications at 614.  Here,  again,\r\n\r\nwe  will  notice that the spread of our RSEs is uneven  and,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  that, more could be done to effect a better spread  of\r\n\r\nour R&D energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), Sir, is\r\n\r\ndoing  a  good job in continuing to facilitate the  build-up  of\r\n\r\ntechnology   and   its  knowledge  infrastructure   to   benefit\r\n\r\nindustries  and companies.  And they are doing a  credible  job.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in  1997,  14  research  institutes  and  centres\r\n\r\ncollaborated  in more than 120 joint projects with industry  and\r\n\r\ntrain more than 170 researchers to support the five key industry\r\n\r\nclusters, mainly electronics, manufacturing and engineering,  IT\r\n\r\nand  telecommunications, chemicals and  life  sciences  industry\r\n\r\nclusters.   But, again, here, I think we are very far  from  our\r\n\r\nfull  potential and I believe MTI could look into it to  provide\r\n\r\nmore resources for its development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of nurturing greater interest in science and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  Sir,  the  School Adoption  Scheme  (SAS)  saw  the\r\n\r\nparticipation of 144 students in 16 R&D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  organisations, while the national undergraduates\r\n\r\nresearch programme and the overseas R&D attachment programme  in\r\n\r\nthe  universities encourage the participation of more  than  648\r\n\r\nstudents respectively.  While it is a good start, I think  there\r\n\r\nis  room  for  more  participation and I  hope  we  can  provide\r\n\r\nfacilities for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we need to create a more conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  foster a culture of innovation  and  technology\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  in  Singapore.  In  1997,  for  example,  NSTB\r\n\r\nfacilitated a total of 16 international R&D collaborations  with\r\n\r\nSingapore based companies and R&D institutions.  Again, it is  a\r\n\r\ncredible start, but I think there is room for more collaboration\r\n\r\nprojects  which  will enable Singapore to leverage  on  overseas\r\n\r\ntechnological capabilities and manpower resources.  One point  I\r\n\r\nthink  that bears scrutiny is, for example, the problem we  face\r\n\r\nin  terms of losing some of our scholars.  As the demand for our\r\n\r\nscholars,  in terms of R&D areas, will grow from multi-nationals\r\n\r\nand  international companies in America and Europe, we  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide more opportunities for such collaboration so that we can\r\n\r\nalso expose our scholars and manpower to such needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I continue with the next cut, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, much has been said about IT\r\n\r\nand  its role today.  IT is expected to permeate our daily lives\r\n\r\neven  more in the years to come.  May I say that no one will  be\r\n\r\nable  to escape the growing tentacles of information technology.\r\n\r\nMuch also has been done by the Government, NCB in particular, to\r\n\r\nprepare  Singapore  and  its people for  IT.   Be  they  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry  or schools, we can be proud of the proactive  approach\r\n\r\ntaken by NCB and Singapore to get our island all wired up and IT-friendly.  But we have not achieved the desired results for  all\r\n\r\nthe  programmes  we  have.  The FAST  FORWARD  by  PSB  and  its\r\n\r\npredecessor  for  adult workers, for example,  achieved  limited\r\n\r\nsuccess,  some say even failure.  However, in the light  of  the\r\n\r\nimportance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout IT and our future, whether it is in our economy or quality\r\n\r\nof  life, we should not relent and should instead press on  with\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to bring more people on-line by hardware and  heart-wise.   For  the  latter, that is, to help more Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ncross   the   psychological  barrier  before  they   embark   on\r\n\r\nfamiliarisation and improvement courses, I would  like  to  urge\r\n\r\nMTI  and  NCB,  in particular to do more work at the  grassroots\r\n\r\nlevel,  tap  the grassroots organisation network and  reach  and\r\n\r\ngoodwill  to  bring  home the message of the  importance  of  IT\r\n\r\nfamiliarisation  hands-on and upgrading.  The  grassroots,  Sir,\r\n\r\nare an important base to plant the seeds of IT culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, in last year's Committee of Supply,\r\n\r\nDr  Ho  Tat Kin raised this problem of the millennium bug.   The\r\n\r\nmillennium bug or the year 2000 problem is a programming  design\r\n\r\ndefect  in  some software, hardware and microchips  which  could\r\n\r\ncause havoc when computer systems do not recognise the change of\r\n\r\ncentury  from  the  20th  to  the 21st  century,  because  these\r\n\r\ncomputers  are  programmed to only recognise  the  year  by  two\r\n\r\ndigits  and  so it cannot tell the difference between  the  year\r\n\r\n1900  and  the year 2000.  When computer systems are  as  widely\r\n\r\nused as they are today and they are so prevalent in all sorts of\r\n\r\nequipment and even the cars that we drive, a serious problem can\r\n\r\narise if these computers or chips do not recognise that the year\r\n\r\n1999 has changed to the year 2000 and then it stops working.  If\r\n\r\nthey  stop  working or if they think that the year 2000  is  the\r\n\r\nyear  1900, then of course banks will be paying a hundred  years\r\n\r\nof   interest  and  cars  may  decide  that  they  are  due  for\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  therefore switch off so that drivers  will  be\r\n\r\nforced to send them for repair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things may be minor but I think in America and in\r\n\r\nEurope,  the estimates for potential loss actually go  into  the\r\n\r\nregion  of billions of dollars.  Because there will be liability\r\n\r\nfor mishaps if a car suddenly stops and knocks into somebody and\r\n\r\nkills,  or  damages  property, or  if  banks  suddenly  have  to\r\n\r\nreorientate  the  software because there is a lot  of  financial\r\n\r\nrecalculation to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  done.   There could be a new financial crisis of a different\r\n\r\nsort.    And  perhaps  for  companies  that  have  not  prepared\r\n\r\nthemselves  for the litigation that could arise or the  problems\r\n\r\nof  changing  the  computers to meet the 21st century,  suddenly\r\n\r\nthey may have to report insolvency because so much money has  to\r\n\r\nbe spent and they do not have it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know NCB has actually been doing a lot of publications\r\n\r\nand  publicity,   seminars,  and so  on,  to  help  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nrealise  that there is this problem out there.  The  frightening\r\n\r\nthing  to  me is that as the seminars continue to be  conducted,\r\n\r\nthere are more and more people attending, that means, there  are\r\n\r\na lot of people out there who are just beginning to realise that\r\n\r\nthere is a problem.  Banks of course have been warned by the MAS\r\n\r\nto  look  into this carefully.  The Government is also basically\r\n\r\nready for the year 2000.  But, Sir, I am afraid that the private\r\n\r\nsector  may not be ready.  This is why earlier, at a sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament some time last year, I asked the Minister whether  it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary  to legislate for a contingency like  this.   The\r\n\r\nanswer was of course that it is not necessary to legislate for a\r\n\r\none-off   event  to  ensure  that  companies  prepare  for   the\r\n\r\nmillennium.   But,  Sir, I would like to urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nrethink  that perhaps even if no legislation is required,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  some strong directives to tell companies  that  they\r\n\r\nmust  spend  money  and there must be incentives  to  help  them\r\n\r\nrecover or pay for the changes that they have to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in PC Week Asia on 8th February 1998 entitled\r\n\r\n\"Asia  not prepared as year 2000 draws near\", there was a  study\r\n\r\nof  six  countries in Asia and Singapore was one of them.   This\r\n\r\nreport   alarmingly  stated  that  almost  half   of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies,  47%  to be exact, have not addressed  this  problem.\r\n\r\nFor  those  who  have  addressed this problem,  only  1.1%  have\r\n\r\ncompleted  it and 33.4% are in the process.  Sir, it is  already\r\n\r\n1998.  They have to have the systems ready in 1999 or the end of\r\n\r\n1998  to test it for one year before the millennium changes.   I\r\n\r\nam afraid, Sir, it might be too late for many of them.  And I do\r\n\r\nurge the Minister to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nredouble  his  efforts  to  make sure that  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nrealises the impact of the year 2000 problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Recently, Prime Minister Mahathir of\r\n\r\nMalaysia has stated that Malaysia will continue to supply  water\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  beyond  the expiration of the  two  water  supply\r\n\r\nagreements.  Perhaps, Sir, this is the first time in  my  memory\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  statement  has been  made  by  such  a  prominent\r\n\r\nMalaysian  leader.   To  me, it seems to  present  a  historical\r\n\r\nopportunity for us to seal the security of water supply for  our\r\n\r\nfuture generations.  And if we can do so, it will remove a  form\r\n\r\nof  contention that has bugged the relationship between our  two\r\n\r\ncountries and will allow us to ensure that the relationship  and\r\n\r\ncollaboration between us will be on a sounder foundation in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   I realise this is a very sensitive subject and perhaps\r\n\r\ncurrently  under negotiation between our two Governments.   But,\r\n\r\nnonetheless, I would like to take this opportunity to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to be bold to seize the opportunity and to remove water\r\n\r\nas  an issue between us and perhaps take this opportunity to ask\r\n\r\nhim  whether  he would be prepared to share his  view  with  the\r\n\r\nHouse on this very important matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, water resource is a\r\n\r\nvery  hot  issue.  Our water tariffs have been raised again  and\r\n\r\nagain.   I  would like to know what efforts have  been  made  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  water resource in Singapore. First,  has the Government\r\n\r\nmade  any study on the potential of our subterranean water as  a\r\n\r\nsource  to  augment  our water supply?  Secondly,  what  is  the\r\n\r\nprogress on the study on sea-water desalination?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, on 14th March 1996, the Minister\r\n\r\nstated  in  Parliament  in the Committee  of  Supply  about  the\r\n\r\nprinciple   behind  charging  electricity  rates  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  tariffs implemented by Singapore  Power.   On\r\n\r\nthat  occasion,  he  said, firstly, Singapore  Power's  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn on total assets is low because our electricity tariff  is\r\n\r\nlow.   Secondly, I will quote him, \"there is a need to allow  SP\r\n\r\nto increase electricity tariff by 12% to 14% over the next three\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfour  years or an average increase of 3% to 5% a year to restore\r\n\r\nits  financial health.\"  But we are now in 1998, Sir.   So  from\r\n\r\n1996 to 1998, it has already been two years.  Presumably, we are\r\n\r\nstill in this process of allowing Singapore Power to adjust  its\r\n\r\nrate  from 3% to 5% a year.  Recently, in fact, SP has increased\r\n\r\nits rate by 5%.  The Feedback Unit has received various negative\r\n\r\nfeedback  from  the industry and the commercial  bodies.   A  5%\r\n\r\nincrease  in  today's  terms is in  fact  substantial.   It  has\r\n\r\nsubstantial  impact  on them.  In fact, one  organisation  whose\r\n\r\nmonthly  electricity bill is $1 million said that a 5%  increase\r\n\r\nis equivalent to $50,000 increase per month.  So it is indeed  a\r\n\r\nheavy  burden to them. I would like to ask the Minister what  is\r\n\r\nthe  basis of the recent rate increase.  Is it based on the need\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  return on total assets of  SP  or  is  it  an\r\n\r\nincrease based on the fuel price increase used by SP?  And if it\r\n\r\nis  based on this formula that Mr Yeo Cheow Tong formulated more\r\n\r\nthan two years ago, perhaps I would like to urge the Minister to\r\n\r\ndefer  or  hold  back  such  increases  until  our  economy  has\r\n\r\nrecovered to a more sounder foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since we are well ahead of time, Dr Lee, you\r\n\r\ncan have the floor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nletting me speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's regionalisation effort intensified in the\r\n\r\n1990s.   Although Singapore-based companies have been  expanding\r\n\r\noverseas   for  decades,  Senior  Minister's  speech  in   1993,\r\n\r\nregarding the need for Singapore to develop a second wing gave a\r\n\r\nmajor thrust to regionalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now know quite a bit about the external economy. For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  know  that the size of the  external  economy  has\r\n\r\ncontinued to grow, and that it is now roughly one-tenth  of  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  economy.  We also know that Singapore's earnings  from\r\n\r\nthe  external economy, as a proportion of total income, has also\r\n\r\nincreased   to   14%  in  1997.   We  know,  for  example,   the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  overseas investments in terms  of  region  and\r\n\r\nactivity.   But what we need is a clearer picture of the  extent\r\n\r\nof benefit to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomestic economy of our regionalisation efforts.  I recall  that\r\n\r\nthis  was the raison d'etre for regionalisation.  There must  be\r\n\r\nclear  and  direct  positive linkages  to  Singapore.   I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like  to  suggest  that  because  of  the  increasing\r\n\r\nimportance  of  the  external economy,  our  indicators  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  performance  should include  the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nexternal  economy as well as that of the domestic economy.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in the current crisis, what has been the rate of growth\r\n\r\nof the external economy?  What about in boom times?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the Hong Kong economy. In the 1970s and\r\n\r\n1980s,  the  average  annual  growth  rates  of  Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  roughly the same  9.5% in the 1970s  and  about\r\n\r\n7.5%  in the 1980s.  However, Hong Kong's average annual  growth\r\n\r\nrate in the 1990s was 5.1% compared to Singapore's 8.4%.  But is\r\n\r\nthis  an  indication that Hong Kong has become less economically\r\n\r\nvibrant  than Singapore?  I would suggest not.  I think that  it\r\n\r\nis  more  because  a major portion of Hong Kong's  manufacturing\r\n\r\nhas  already  shifted offshore, to China, for example,  so  that\r\n\r\nHong  Kong's dynamism is no longer adequately reflected  in  its\r\n\r\nGDP  figures.  Similarly, for Singapore, in the next  10  years,\r\n\r\nour  GDP  growth  may  no  longer adequately  reflect  our  true\r\n\r\neconomic activity, because a large percentage of our growth  may\r\n\r\nbe in our external as opposed to domestic economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the main indicator of economic performance\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  is  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  which  measures\r\n\r\neconomic  activity within Singapore, and we  all  know  how  GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth  rates  are  watched  with an eagle  eye,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether   one is in the public sector or in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nI would urge the Government to consider how the external economy\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken  into  account in a measure of  overall  economic\r\n\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically two concepts, the Gross National\r\n\r\nProduct  (GNP)  or GDP plus factor income from abroad,  which  I\r\n\r\nshall call GDP plus, for short.  At present,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneither  of these are computed in real terms, so we  do  not  at\r\n\r\nthis  present  time know the real growth rate of either  GNP  or\r\n\r\nthis other term called  GDP plus factor income from abroad.   As\r\n\r\nthe discussion is quite technical, I would not want to elaborate\r\n\r\nhere  in  Parliament.  But I realise that there are a number  of\r\n\r\nstatistical  difficulties  in  doing  so  and  that   very   few\r\n\r\ncountries,  for example, compute this concept of  GDP  plus  the\r\n\r\nfactor  income from abroad, which I believe is really  the  best\r\n\r\nmeasure that we can have of the overall economic activity of our\r\n\r\ndomestic economy plus the external economy;  in other words, the\r\n\r\nfirst wing as well as the second wing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic point is that because of the increasing\r\n\r\nimportance of the second wing to Singapore, we should  begin  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  measure of economic performance that  includes  both\r\n\r\nwings.   The  fact  that there are problems and  that  very  few\r\n\r\ncountries  do  this  are  surely  not  sufficient  reasons   for\r\n\r\nSingapore not to pioneer the effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, we are ahead of time, in fact, by a\r\n\r\ncouple of hours.

This  clearly\r\n\r\nindicates  that  the  Government recognises  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce and that the industry needs help  to  grow.\r\n\r\nMore should be done to grow the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of electronic commerce world wide is expected to\r\n\r\nexpand  some  four to six folds from the current  US$46  billion\r\n\r\nwithin five years.  If the astounding development and growth  of\r\n\r\nthe information technology industry is any clue,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  confident that this prediction will come true.   We  must\r\n\r\nencourage our companies to go into electronic commerce.  It  has\r\n\r\nmany advantages.  We can make more efficient use of manpower and\r\n\r\nresources.   We  can  operate around  the  clock.   It  provides\r\n\r\nconvenience to the customers.  Electronic commerce is a  concept\r\n\r\nof the global world.  It links the markets of the world into one\r\n\r\nbig  marketplace and thus expands the economic space of nations.\r\n\r\nElectronic  commerce  is  thus  ideal  for  small  nations  like\r\n\r\nSingapore  to serve the world.  Many who are local entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand  companies have dreamt of venturing overseas, but  the  cost\r\n\r\nhad been prohibitive.  Electronic commerce will change this.  It\r\n\r\nwould  allow  our companies, at affordable cost,  to  offer  our\r\n\r\ngoods and services to the world and we can do it from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have many of the infrastructure to support\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce.  Singapore is highly computerised.  We have\r\n\r\ngood,  advanced and efficient telecommunications, shipping,  air\r\n\r\nand  logistics  services.  If we look at the transaction  cycle,\r\n\r\nwhile  many of the steps can be carried out electronically,  the\r\n\r\nphysical goods must still be physically delivered to the door of\r\n\r\nthe  customer.  It is conceivable that an efficient  company  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, supported by our efficient air and service links with\r\n\r\nthe  world,  will  be  able to serve an overseas  customer  more\r\n\r\nspeedily  from Singapore than the customer could from a  company\r\n\r\nin his own country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans understand the importance and potential of\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce. President Clinton set up a task  force  to\r\n\r\nspearhead its development.  The task force released its findings\r\n\r\nand recommendations last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic commerce requires various sectors of the economy\r\n\r\nto  work  together.  At the moment, I am aware that efforts  are\r\n\r\nbeing   undertaken  by  various  bodies  to  develop  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce in Singapore.  This approach does not provide a  common\r\n\r\nfocus  nor  does  it  appear  a concerted  effort.   Given  this\r\n\r\npotential, I ask the Government to consider setting up a central\r\n\r\nagency to plan and spearhead the development and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth   of  electronic  commerce.   Such  a  body  will  accord\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce the importance it deserves, champion it  and\r\n\r\nhasten its development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For electronic commerce to work world wide, common\r\n\r\npractices, rules and regulations must be evolved and adopted  by\r\n\r\ncountries.   Initially, countries may resist  to  protect  their\r\n\r\nmarkets, but unless they relent, they will shut themselves  from\r\n\r\nthe world and the benefits that electronic commerce brings.   We\r\n\r\nsaw this with the Internet.  I would like Singapore to work with\r\n\r\nworld  bodies  to quickly evolve these much needed international\r\n\r\nstandards  and  rules to support electronic commerce.   I  would\r\n\r\nurge  our universities and relevant research institutes to study\r\n\r\nthe  subject  and  carry  out research to  provide  much  needed\r\n\r\nknowledge and information in electronic commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, let me first declare my\r\n\r\npecuniary interest  as a director of Singapore Power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent power failure in Auckland, New Zealand, was\r\n\r\na  very  serious one.  We are talking of a power failure on  the\r\n\r\nscale  of not hours but weeks, and now it is running to a month.\r\n\r\nA power failure of this scale, not only causes a lot of personal\r\n\r\ninconveniences,  but will be very disastrous  for  commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the now privatised electricity and gas of the former\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board (now part of Singapore  Power),  we  are\r\n\r\nencouraging  competition to make sure that  we  provide  a  good\r\n\r\nservice  at  reasonable cost to consumers.  Tuas  Power  Station\r\n\r\nwill be coming on stream sometime next year as reported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst competition is good and necessary for efficiency and\r\n\r\nlowering  cost, as quite well demonstrated in the  case  of  the\r\n\r\ncellular phone system, competition may also mean a ruthless look\r\n\r\nat cost cutting that may, over a period of time, mean a negative\r\n\r\nimpact  on  performance.  A major power failure in Singapore  on\r\n\r\nthe  scale  of  New  Zealand will be  a  disaster.   Right  now,\r\n\r\nSingapore's power supply is one of the best, if not the best, in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister, whilst encouraging\r\n\r\ncompetition,  to keep a close watch on the regulation  of  power\r\n\r\nsupplies,  to  watch  not  just the  cost  but  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nperformance  will  be tip-top, and that we must  never  allow  a\r\n\r\nmajor power failure to happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, JTC's IT 21\r\n\r\nactually  is quite a good plan.  I think it will put Singapore's\r\n\r\nland  to  best  use  in  years to come.  However,  I  have  been\r\n\r\nreceiving quite a number of feedback pertaining to JTC's way  of\r\n\r\nconducting  business, in that it has been  very  inflexible  and\r\n\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in view of the currency and economic situation,\r\n\r\nmany  private sector enterprises are going through a tough time.\r\n\r\nThey  are all trying to tighten their belts.  In fact, they  are\r\n\r\nfighting  for  survival.   I feel that JTC,  being  one  of  the\r\n\r\nlargest  landlords  in Singapore, should  try  to  help  various\r\n\r\nenterprises  which are going through financial  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nthat  probably JTC should consider not just holding  on  to  the\r\n\r\ncurrent rental charges and other charges, it should instead take\r\n\r\na  bold  step  to reduce rentals, and also take a bold  step  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   various  problems  which  are  faced   by   various\r\n\r\nenterprises in terms of their financial difficulties  and   non-fulfilment to make payments to JTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on a number of occasions, businessmen have complained\r\n\r\nto  me about JTC's demand pertaining to the utilisation of  land\r\n\r\nand buildings.  With this kind of economic downturn, it would be\r\n\r\nvery difficult for many companies to accede to JTC's demand  of,\r\n\r\nfor example, fulfilling the gross ratio requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister should enlighten the House as to\r\n\r\nwhether  JTC  will take any major steps to help enterprises  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses in Singapore to tide over this difficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first on electronic commerce.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  positioning itself to be the  hub  of  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce (EC).  This is evident from the fact that we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  national project called the Electronic Commerce Hotbed  (ECH)\r\n\r\nprogramme  and  from the incentives given in  the  Budget  under\r\n\r\ndiscussion.  For the uninitiated, EC is a broad term to refer to\r\n\r\nall  manner of buying and selling services and products  through\r\n\r\nthe  use of electronic communication channels, foremost of which\r\n\r\nis  the  Internet.  Some people even consider  the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nfunds through bank ATM machines as electronic commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I believe, a committee which has sat and made\r\n\r\nsome  recommendations  to the Government on  how  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nposition  itself  to  become an EC hub.   These  recommendations\r\n\r\ninclude   laws  and  other  regulatory  policies.   Unlike   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the banking sub-committee which was  released\r\n\r\nand  made  public and largely approved recently, the efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe  ECH Committee have been kept relatively under wraps.  There\r\n\r\nwas  a  reply  by  the Minister to Dr Lee Tsao Yuan's   question\r\n\r\nearlier  this  year,  I believe, which sketches  some  of  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  but  I  would urge the  Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nrevealing what these plans and recommendations are more  broadly\r\n\r\nso that investors and EC participants would know what to do, how\r\n\r\nmuch  to  invest in, when to invest and so on.  Because if  they\r\n\r\nare unable to obtain information on what is in store for them in\r\n\r\nfuture,  how are they going to prepare themselves.  I also  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  new  Law Reform Unit set up in the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  will  look specifically into all aspects  of  the  law\r\n\r\nwhich  relate to electronic commerce as a priority and not  just\r\n\r\nincidental  work, and to seek private sector input before  these\r\n\r\nlaws are formulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these recommendations, I understand, have been\r\n\r\nformulated  with input largely from academics and public  sector\r\n\r\nofficials.  This is an area for which more private sector  input\r\n\r\nis  required.   There is much promotional and  educational  work\r\n\r\nthat also needs to be done to ensure that consumers take readily\r\n\r\nand  kindly  to  EC.  I wonder if the Government would  dedicate\r\n\r\nfunds  to do these things, and whether Government would allocate\r\n\r\nfunds to the private sector if there can be found champions  who\r\n\r\nwould take these tasks upon themselves.  Here, Sir, I must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeclare  my  interest  as the founder of one  such  organisation\r\n\r\ncalled CommerceNet Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also brief the House on our\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  international  fora  which  are  working   on\r\n\r\nresearch,  policies and laws which will facilitate  EC.   Again,\r\n\r\nwould the Minister say if the Government would fund some of  the\r\n\r\nwork  which  is being done by Singapore organisations  that  are\r\n\r\nrepresenting  Singapore's interest and  views  in  international\r\n\r\nfora,  such  as  the  United Nations, International  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce, SWIFT and other similar private sector initiatives?  I\r\n\r\nknow  of  some private individuals who are regularly invited  to\r\n\r\npresent  Singapore's  perspective and expert  opinions  in  such\r\n\r\ninternational  fora,  but who have to spend  their  own  private\r\n\r\nfunds  for this national service.  I have for many years  called\r\n\r\nfor  the  setting  up  of  an agency to support  these  efforts,\r\n\r\nprivately  and  publicly, but my calls have not  been  answered.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is also a need for an agency to discuss and gather\r\n\r\nall  these  learning experiences from different conferences  and\r\n\r\nprojects  to  which Singaporeans have attended and  to  transmit\r\n\r\nthis  to  other Singaporeans, businesses and Government agencies\r\n\r\nalike.   We  need a concerted effort of both private and  public\r\n\r\nsectors,  perhaps even a Government Ministry to  plan,  monitor,\r\n\r\ncoordinate or even regulate such efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the Committee of Supply debate last year, I argued\r\n\r\nfor a Ministry of\r\n\r\nInformation Technology.  Perhaps what I should have  argued  for\r\n\r\nis  not so much a Technology Ministry as a Ministry which  would\r\n\r\nlead  and envision the different ways we can harness technology.\r\n\r\nWe  can  harness  this to use and manage information  so  as  to\r\n\r\npromote    trade   and   the   competitiveness   of   Singapore.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  as  IT related agencies are all  over  the  place\r\n\r\ncurrently, with the NCB, TDB and EDB in MTI, SBA in MITA, TAS in\r\n\r\nMinCom,  etc, it is perhaps time we pooled all of them  together\r\n\r\nin one Ministry to prevent confusion to investors and the public\r\n\r\nand send a message to the world that we are serious about making\r\n\r\nIT and EC work in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a question to the Prime Minister's Office about the\r\n\r\nformation of a Ministry of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation Technology, I received  a\r\n\r\nreply  that  Singapore  already has the  NCB  and  the  National\r\n\r\nInformation Technology Committee which actually has done  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  things and kept Singapore very much up-to-date and the plans\r\n\r\nlike IT 2000 have all been going on track.  I would suggest that\r\n\r\nperhaps  one  of  the most important things is when  we  have  a\r\n\r\nMinistry  that pools together all these agencies, even  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  been working well with an inter-agency committee like  the\r\n\r\nNational  IT  Committee.  It is perhaps time to  emphasise  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  really  cares  about making IT  work  and  Electronic\r\n\r\nCommerce  as  a  strategic matter that  Singapore  is  concerned\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, actually what I want\r\n\r\nto  say is on a later amendment, but since this subject has been\r\n\r\nbrought  up earlier by two other Members, I thought I would  say\r\n\r\nit  now  so that the Minister can reply in one go.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  on the issue of structural unemployment  brought  up\r\n\r\nearlier by Dr  Toh See Kiat and Mr Cyrille Tan.  Like them, I am\r\n\r\nfearful  that  the  unskilled and the  poorly  skilled  workers,\r\n\r\nmostly aged 40-plus and above would face structural unemployment\r\n\r\nas  Singapore's  economy  takes  on  the  characteristics  of  a\r\n\r\ndeveloped country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1997 Labour Force of Singapore showed that we\r\n\r\nstill  have  about  722,000 with lower  secondary  education  or\r\n\r\nworse.   This  is  not a small figure and is about  39%  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce of about 1.8 million workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would be earning about $1,000 to $2,000 a month and\r\n\r\nsupporting  a  family with teenage children.  Essentially,  this\r\n\r\nmeans that this group of workers has very little savings and can\r\n\r\nill-afford  to  be  out of work.  Yet, in a  competitive  world,\r\n\r\nthese  workers  will  be  the first to be  retrenched  and  when\r\n\r\nretrenched they will be forced by circumstances to look for  any\r\n\r\nunskilled job to keep self and family alive.  Therefore, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to propose that the Government take the responsibility  of\r\n\r\ntraining  them and also other similarly unskilled  workers,  and\r\n\r\nthat  during this period they be given a salary to fulfill their\r\n\r\nfinancial requirements.  Sir, this is not a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  idea.  Companies today pay, in fact, the normal salary  for\r\n\r\ntheir  staff  on training courses.  Therefore,  if  we  were  to\r\n\r\nconsider  that all economically active citizens are  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  ie, on the payroll, being economically active,  then\r\n\r\ngiving  them a salary while they are under training is  actually\r\n\r\nakin  to  the  practice  being presently  prevalent  in  private\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  also  the  private sector  as  well  as   public\r\n\r\norganisations which send their workers for training.  If this is\r\n\r\nnot  acceptable, could the Minister consider some sort of grant,\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Cyrille  Tan  has said, skills fund,  or  some  sort  of\r\n\r\ninterest-free  loan?  The important thing to  remember  is  that\r\n\r\nthese workers need an income to fulfil their financial needs. As\r\n\r\nlong as such income is not forthcoming, all the exhortations  on\r\n\r\nthe  need for training will be wasted on them, not because  they\r\n\r\ndo  not want to be trained but because they cannot afford to  be\r\n\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can take your other topics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> I will take all my related cuts together\r\n\r\nin this speech.  The first issue I want to talk about relates to\r\n\r\nfair and ethical trading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore market place is an orderly one and most\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  are  prim  and  proper persons  earning  an  honest\r\n\r\nliving.   In  recent years, however, there has  been  a  growing\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons  who have been skilfully skirting  the  grey\r\n\r\nedges  of  our  current law to perpetrate all sorts  of  schemes\r\n\r\nwhich exploit the naive, the gullible and the poorly-informed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing mass of persons who are selling goods\r\n\r\nand  promises  which are useless or not exactly what  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  promised.   Our  current laws on misrepresentation,  false\r\n\r\ntrade descriptions of goods,  investments and sales of goods and\r\n\r\nservices  are  woefully  inadequate  for  such  scams.   Let  me\r\n\r\nhighlight some examples and figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is something called the switch and bait\r\n\r\ntechnique.  An advertisement or a poster campaign or a  circular\r\n\r\ncampaign might advertise that a certain travel agency is selling\r\n\r\ntickets to, say, the furthest end of the earth, the North  Pole,\r\n\r\nat  $200.  People looking for adventure might say, \"Hey, that is\r\n\r\na  wonderful deal.\"  They run down and the shop says, \"Sorry, we\r\n\r\njust  sold the last two.\"  Actually, they never had  any.    But\r\n\r\nthey  just  want you to go down there, bait you down there,  and\r\n\r\nthen  switch you to another product or service they are selling.\r\n\r\nI do believe that is not quite fair game.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they use scare tactics. There was one case where\r\n\r\nan advertising campaign warned about all the dangers of drinking\r\n\r\ncoffee and it was pitched as a health education campaign.   They\r\n\r\nexhibited  scientific  reports about  foetal  abnormalities  and\r\n\r\nthing  like that.  On further look, we the Consumers Association\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  realise that the company actually was  a  company\r\n\r\nthat  was  in a beverage line.  What they were saying  was  that\r\n\r\ncoffee  has  caffeine but you do not know that  cocoa  also  has\r\n\r\ncaffeine.   Did you?  Because every evening mothers make  a  hot\r\n\r\ndrink of cocoa for the children before they go to bed.  And they\r\n\r\nsaid  cocoa has caffeine.  The implication therefore is that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  safe.  But of course this is a company selling  a  non-cocoa based beverage.  So scare tactics are there, making people\r\n\r\nthink  that unsubstantiated papers are really facts.  The  other\r\n\r\nthing about this advertisement campaign was that the paper  that\r\n\r\nthey  had  was  dismissed by our medical experts as  an  ancient\r\n\r\npaper.   It  was obsolete.  The studies were no longer relevant.\r\n\r\nBut the uninformed consumer cannot tell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third technique which is unconscionable and,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the hard sell tactics that have become such a  common\r\n\r\nway  of doing business in Singapore.  We have heard Mr Sin  Boon\r\n\r\nAnn  yesterday talk about soft commodities being sold that  way.\r\n\r\nThey  advertise  a  job  vacancy and they say  \"elderly  people,\r\n\r\nhousewives, retirees, students, anybody, no training needed,  no\r\n\r\nskills  needed, just come and you have got high income,  $2,000-$3,000 a month.\"  When people go down there,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  say,  \"You  have  to  go through two  days  of  on-the-job\r\n\r\ntraining.\"  And it is really two days of hard sell, at  the  end\r\n\r\nof  which they are told, \"Well, I think you have to prove.   You\r\n\r\nhave  to  learn on the job and prove that you are a good person.\r\n\r\nSo good in this line.  Therefore, we want you to put in your own\r\n\r\nmoney,  $15,000.\"   When  the $15,000 is  lost,  they  say,  \"To\r\n\r\nrecover  that $15,000, you need another $15,000.\" I  think  many\r\n\r\nMPs  have written to CASE and I share the pain of these  people.\r\n\r\nThey  are  factory  operators, 3-room residents  and  they  lose\r\n\r\n$30,000  or  $60,000.  They  are not  rich  people.   These  are\r\n\r\nfrightening facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of time-share complaints, from April 1995 to March\r\n\r\n1996,  CASE  received 53 complaints.  From April 1996  to  March\r\n\r\n1997,  we  received 109 complaints.  From May 1997  to  February\r\n\r\n1998,  we  received 607 complaints.  Because  this  line  is  so\r\n\r\nlucrative,  they made so much money that they do not  care  what\r\n\r\nethics are.  Because as far as they are doing something that the\r\n\r\nlaw does not prohibit or doing it in ways which the law does not\r\n\r\nprohibit,  they  say  they are safe.  These  facts  and  figures\r\n\r\nreflect  only the most egregious examples. They are the  tip  of\r\n\r\nthe  iceberg  as  Singaporeans find it too embarrassing  or  too\r\n\r\ntroublesome  to raise these matters publicly.  They reflect  the\r\n\r\nfailure of the law to adjust to changed market conditions.  Such\r\n\r\nunethical  and unconscionable ways of doing business  should  be\r\n\r\neradicated from Singapore if we do not want Singapore's image as\r\n\r\na  shopping  haven to be tarnished.  It is hard  enough  getting\r\n\r\ntourists  to  Singapore.  If they and Singaporean consumers  are\r\n\r\nexploited like this, then we become known as a nation of thieves\r\n\r\nand  this is not something that the retail sector or the related\r\n\r\ntrades  would want to be known for, because they are already  in\r\n\r\nthe  doldrums, and they will be in the doldrums for a long  time\r\n\r\nto  come  if  they do not change these unscrupulous  traders  in\r\n\r\ntheir midst, and turf them out, so to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, many are indeed honest and fair. But when\r\n\r\nthey see others resorting to these unscrupulous tactics,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe temptation is always there.  They are not being caught, they\r\n\r\nare not being prosecuted, perhaps I am a stupid fool if I do not\r\n\r\ndo  the same thing.  And I think the decline of standards  would\r\n\r\nbe gradual, but it would be inevitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time to pass legislation which makes it illegal\r\n\r\nfor  businesses to resort to such tactics.  A Fair  Trading  Act\r\n\r\nalong  the  lines of what CASE has been advocating will  enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's image as a shopping haven, enable trade associations\r\n\r\nto self-regulate and set their own standards, so that Government\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  have a light touch.  It would prevent  and  avert\r\n\r\nlitigious  resolutions of consumer disputes and make the  retail\r\n\r\ntrade  a  more productive one.  Because if the retail  resources\r\n\r\nare  not  chanelled into combating unfair competitive  moves  by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  business  rivals and the demands  of  unreasonable\r\n\r\nconsumers, then the resources can be used elsewhere.  CASE  will\r\n\r\nbe  forwarding a proposal to the Ministry within  the  next  few\r\n\r\nmonths  to  explain the issue further, and I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider its recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps you could continue after the tea\r\n\r\nbreak.

I wish to assure them  that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry will give their views utmost consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that we are well ahead of time. So the answers\r\n\r\nto  be given by myself and my colleagues in the Ministry will be\r\n\r\nsomewhat  longer than usual.  I hope Members will bear with  us.\r\n\r\nI  can  assure you that that is not our usual style of answering\r\n\r\nquestions in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the topic of cost of doing business. Several\r\n\r\nMembers  have  spoken  about  this  topic  and  they  have  made\r\n\r\nimpassioned pleas for Government to do more to reduce  the  cost\r\n\r\nof doing business.  The signals have come across loud and clear,\r\n\r\nand I can assure you that we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the situation very carefully.  Unlike  what  Dr  Lee\r\n\r\nTsao Yuan said that we might be caught flat-footed, I can assure\r\n\r\nher  that  we, in fact, have a number of indicators, and  should\r\n\r\nthere  be  a  downturn, I think we would be  able  to  spot  the\r\n\r\ndownturn  fairly  quickly.  We are not  just  depending  on  the\r\n\r\nquarterly  statistics.  In fact, we have preliminary statistics,\r\n\r\nthen we have actual statistics as the trade figures come in, and\r\n\r\nso  on.   So  that is the reason why we feel that  if  the  need\r\n\r\narises we will be able to adjust very fast; sometimes, maybe too\r\n\r\nfast,  because the Government is able to decide very quickly  on\r\n\r\nvarious measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as Mrs Lim Hwee Hua pointed out, it is instructive\r\n\r\nto  look at the composition of business costs in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nlargest component is wages.  In Singapore, remuneration accounts\r\n\r\nfor  about 35% of total business costs.  This is a key component\r\n\r\nto   moderate  for  Singapore  to  stay  competitive.   For  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, rentals account  for  only  about  3%  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs,  while Government taxes and  fees  account  for\r\n\r\nabout 2%.  The corresponding figures for the services sector are\r\n\r\nabout  9%  and  7%  respectively, 9%  for  rentals  and  7%  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  taxes and fees, as compared to 3%  and  2%  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you compare this with Hong Kong, remuneration accounts\r\n\r\nfor  about  60%  of  business costs in Hong  Kong  (Hong  Kong's\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector), while rentals account  for  another  8%.\r\n\r\nHence,  compared  with  Hong  Kong, our  remuneration  share  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  is about 60% of Hong Kong's  share,  while  our\r\n\r\nrental share of business costs is only about half.  This is  for\r\n\r\npurpose  of comparison.  Of course, it depends on the  structure\r\n\r\nof  the economy, the kind of industry they have, and so on.   In\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, the manufacturing sector has mostly moved  to  China\r\n\r\nand  even  in  the past, the manufacturing sector tended  to  be\r\n\r\nrather labour-intensive, electronics, garments, toys, and so on.\r\n\r\nSo,  therefore,  their labour cost component  will  tend  to  be\r\n\r\nhigher.   Similarly,  now  with the move  towards  more  of  the\r\n\r\nservice  sector, the cost component again is mainly manpower  as\r\n\r\nwell as rentals.  So in the case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Hong  Kong, rentals are an important factor, more  important\r\n\r\nthan in Singapore.  With the pegging of the Hong Kong dollar  to\r\n\r\nthe  US  dollar which has been maintained so far, and also  with\r\n\r\nthe  high  cost  in  Hong Kong, which used  to  be  higher  than\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I think they are fearful of losing their competitive\r\n\r\nedge.   And  that is one reason why they came out  with  such  a\r\n\r\nstrong plethora of concessions for the economy.  In our case, we\r\n\r\nhave been watching costs very carefully and we are not quite  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  situation.  In fact, I think we are  very  different.\r\n\r\nAnd also our currency has depreciated by about 15% versus the US\r\n\r\ndollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rising productivity, labour costs have moderated in\r\n\r\nSingapore in recent years.  The Unit Labour Cost (ULC) index  of\r\n\r\nthe overall economy rose by 1.1% in 1997, slower than the 4%  in\r\n\r\n1996,  and  3.3% over the 1990 to 1995 period.  The ULC  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector registered flat growth in 1997.  There  are\r\n\r\nseveral  reasons for this.  One, of course, is that the NWC  has\r\n\r\nbeen  recommending  flexi-wages  and  keeping  the  wages  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The Government has also been more flexible in allowing\r\n\r\nin  more workers, both work permit holders as well as employment\r\n\r\npass  holders.   So these have helped to check the  labour  cost\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also one reason why we have such a big number of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  in  Singapore now.   I  think  Dr  Richard  Hu\r\n\r\nmentioned  a figure of more than 450,000.  So this  would  be  a\r\n\r\ngood  buffer for us in terms of employment, in case there  is  a\r\n\r\nsevere downturn and some workers will lose their jobs.  In  that\r\n\r\nsituation,  of course, we have to retrench the least  productive\r\n\r\nworker  first,  but  at  the same time there  will  be  openings\r\n\r\ncreated,  and  if  the Ministry of Labour, by then  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower,  could be more careful in issuing work  permits,  this\r\n\r\nwill  provide  more job openings for Singaporeans.   Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  will have to be prepared to be flexible and not insist  on\r\n\r\nthe  old salaries or the same kind of jobs, but jobs there  will\r\n\r\nbe.   And  our projection so far is that we do not see a  severe\r\n\r\nretrenchment or unemployment.  In fact, in the recent  situation\r\n\r\nwhen  Seagate retrenched some workers, I was given to understand\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  workers  were  very happy.   They  collected  the\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits on one hand, and they got new  jobs  very\r\n\r\nsoon  thereafter.  And the ones who were unhappy were, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  ones  who were not retrenched.  So it is quite  an  unusual\r\n\r\nsituation that we have in Singapore, despite the crisis that  we\r\n\r\nare going through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses to control costs, we have to pay careful\r\n\r\nattention to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, wage costs. The National Wages Council will be\r\n\r\nmeeting  soon  to deliberate on wage guidelines  for  the  year.\r\n\r\nOver  the years, we have built up the annual variable components\r\n\r\nof  salaries to provide for the eventuality that wage costs  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  cut  in a recession.  Now we  are  not  yet  in  a\r\n\r\nrecession.  I hope we will not be.  But when the NWC  meets  and\r\n\r\nbefore it concludes its deliberations by late June, I think  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation will be clearer and I hope the NWC  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  look at the different sectors, the impact,  the  total\r\n\r\nsituation, and come out with guidelines to help us overcome this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Government will also be reducing the\r\n\r\nlevies for skilled foreign workers in the manufacturing, marine,\r\n\r\nconstruction  and service sectors from $200 per  month  to  $100\r\n\r\nwith  effect from next month.  This is for skilled workers.   So\r\n\r\nthe   intention  is  to  lower  cost  and  also  make  it   more\r\n\r\nadvantageous for employers to recruit skilled workers  and  also\r\n\r\nfor  them to train the workers and upgrade their skills.  So the\r\n\r\norientation is towards that area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important factor is of course rentals, and many\r\n\r\nMembers  have spoken about this.  I would like to inform Members\r\n\r\nthat in July last year, after JTC did its annual review, half of\r\n\r\nJTC's  estates  enjoyed a drop in posted rents, while  the  rest\r\n\r\nhave  their  posted  rents frozen.  Many of  JTC's  lessees  are\r\n\r\npaying  rents that are well below market rates.  The reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  is that there has been a cap of 7\ufffd% on the extent to which\r\n\r\nthey can raise their rents yearly.  So as the property market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshot up over recent years and the rises were very sharp, JTC was\r\n\r\nprevented from going up so fast by the cap.  So in fact, many of\r\n\r\nthe companies are enjoying rentals which may be less than 50% of\r\n\r\nthe  posted  rents, and even the posted rents tend to  be  lower\r\n\r\nthan  the market rents.  JTC does surveys of the market and they\r\n\r\npeg  the  posted rent and the tendency has been to peg  it  much\r\n\r\nlower  than the market rate.  As mentioned in the Budget speech,\r\n\r\nJTC  and  HDB  will  be  extending rental concessions  to  their\r\n\r\ntenants and lessees.  The Government will also be giving  a  15%\r\n\r\nproperty tax rebate for commercial and industrial properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor concerns Government rates and fees. In\r\n\r\nthis  area, the rate of increase has moderated since 1995.   The\r\n\r\nUnit  Business Cost Index of the manufacturing sector shows that\r\n\r\nthe  Government rates and fees actually fell by 1.8% in 1997  as\r\n\r\nagainst  a  growth of 5.1% in 1996.  In any case, the  fees  are\r\n\r\nquite a small component of cost and in recent years, in fact, it\r\n\r\nhas  fallen.   But  we  should not  be  complacent.   We  should\r\n\r\ncontinue to watch.  And with Members' comments, it will in  fact\r\n\r\nmake  it easier for MTI to press the other people to keep  costs\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, we do not see a need to further reduce JTC\r\n\r\nrentals  substantially.  Any fall in market rents will be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account at JTC's annual review of posted rents in  May  or\r\n\r\nJune.   If  the  posted rents are reduced  at  the  next  annual\r\n\r\nreview,  new  lessees and tenants will benefit from these  lower\r\n\r\nrates.  The rents for existing lessees and tenants will also  be\r\n\r\nadjusted  downwards accordingly when the current rates  are  due\r\n\r\nfor  their  annual review.  This point may be  a  bit  confusing\r\n\r\nbecause  Government has said in the Budget speech  that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to freeze the posted rent and we are going to moderate the\r\n\r\nincreases for those who are far below the posted rent.  In fact,\r\n\r\nwith  the  freezing, something like 70% of the tenants will  not\r\n\r\nhave  any  rental  increase, even based on  the  current  posted\r\n\r\nrates.  The others will have some increase but this will be kept\r\n\r\nat  certain  levels.  JTC will be announcing the  details  soon.\r\n\r\nBut the point I was just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking  is  that  in addition to that, JTC also does  an  annual\r\n\r\nreview  in May or June and if at that time it is clear that  the\r\n\r\nmarket  rates are below posted rates, then JTC will  adjust  its\r\n\r\nposted rentals down further.  So if we freeze rentals, it  means\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  go up but can come down, depending on  the  market\r\n\r\nsituation.   So  maybe  this  is a bit  of  good  news  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and other businesses, that we are capping rentals,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is  a  possibility of a  downward  adjustment.   The\r\n\r\nadjustment,  if it comes, will of course depend  on  the  market\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Government should refrain from\r\n\r\nintroducing unnecessary rules and regulations that will increase\r\n\r\nthe  cost of doing business.  If the economic situation worsens,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  ready  and prepared  to  implement  further\r\n\r\nmeasures.  We should remember, however, that business costs  are\r\n\r\nonly  half of the competitiveness equation and will continue  to\r\n\r\nreflect  Singapore's  basic  resource  constraints.   While   we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  manage  our  costs, we  must  also  focus  on  the\r\n\r\ncapability  factors and constantly upgrade the  productivity  of\r\n\r\nour  workers  and  companies  so  as  to  sustain  our  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  This is the collective responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the employers and the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the point raised by Mr Tay Beng Chuan on\r\n\r\nwhether we need to set up a Government charges and levies review\r\n\r\ncommittee  to coordinate and review these charges and levies  to\r\n\r\nensure Singapore's competitiveness in the region.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  inform  him that there is already a mechanism  in  place  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  major  fee hikes are coordinated  since  all  such\r\n\r\nincreases   require  the  Cabinet's  approval.    It   is   also\r\n\r\nGovernment's practice to fully explain the rationale behind  any\r\n\r\nmajor fee increase.  The Government has done so on all occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  fees  have been increased.  My Ministry also monitors  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  such increases on both the Consumer Price Index  and\r\n\r\nthe  Unit  Business Cost Index to ensure that Singapore  remains\r\n\r\ncompetitive overall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh spoke on the\r\n\r\nquestion of PSA charges and said that the charges have increased\r\n\r\nthree  times in the last two years.  I presume they meant  three\r\n\r\noccasions.  I was told that this is not quite right.   The  last\r\n\r\ntariff revision was done in January 1996 and there has not  been\r\n\r\nany  revision  since then.  So I do not know whether  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen some misinformation.  Nevertheless, MPA and PSA Corporation\r\n\r\nare  keenly  aware of the need for Singapore to  keep  its  port\r\n\r\ntariffs  competitive.   The  Marine  and  Port  Authority  (MPA)\r\n\r\nreduced  port  dues  for container ships by  20%  in  May  1996.\r\n\r\nFurther,  PSA Corporation negotiates on a case-by-case basis  to\r\n\r\ngrant  rebates for terminal handling and towage charges  to  its\r\n\r\ncustomers.   So  I  can  assure Members  that  PSA  will  remain\r\n\r\nresponsive and make sure that they are competitive in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntheir rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo Wee Khiang and Mr Inderjit Singh made some points\r\n\r\non  the question of subletting of JTC space in situations  where\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  a business downturn and there is  extra  space\r\n\r\navailable.  I can assure them that JTC is flexible in this area.\r\n\r\nJTC did a review of its subletting policy in August last year as\r\n\r\npart of IP 21 and has decided that lessees of JTC land and ready-built  factories are now allowed to sublet up to  30%  of  their\r\n\r\nspace for the first five years of their lease or the first three\r\n\r\nyears  for factory lessees and up to 50% thereafter.   They  can\r\n\r\nsublet  up to 70% if the sub-tenants are related companies.   As\r\n\r\nJTC  tenants  are  on relatively short terms of typically  three\r\n\r\nyears,  they  may also prematurely terminate their tenancies  at\r\n\r\nany   time  if  their  space  requirements  have  changed.   JTC\r\n\r\nrecognises  that  some  tenants may find themselves  in  genuine\r\n\r\ndifficulties and is prepared to consider their special  requests\r\n\r\nfor subletting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I must say that Mr Choo was a bit unfair when he\r\n\r\nsaid  that JTC is inflexible.  I think it is far from the  case.\r\n\r\nThey  have in fact been very flexible and even before the latest\r\n\r\nmoves by the Government as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannounced  in the Budget, they have on their own been  adjusting\r\n\r\ntheir rates down.  So I think we should give due credit to JTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr David Lim's point that current HDB and JTC rules\r\n\r\nmake  it difficult for businesses to streamline their operations\r\n\r\nby  swapping  premises, JTC does allow requests for swapping  of\r\n\r\nunits  by  existing tenants.  The swap will have to be  mutually\r\n\r\nagreeable and the usage compatible with the adjoining users  and\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  the  existing JTC  guidelines.   JTC  is  also\r\n\r\nprepared  to  consider not imposing a rental adjustment  upon  a\r\n\r\nswap  for  bona  fide  cases with valid  reasons,  such  as  for\r\n\r\npurposes of business consolidation.  As for HDB premises, I will\r\n\r\nrefer Mr David Lim's suggestion to HDB for consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Inderjit Singh's suggestion to help start-up\r\n\r\nmanufacturing companies with preferential land pricing,  he  may\r\n\r\nwish  to  note  that there are already several existing  schemes\r\n\r\nwhich  assist start-ups in various aspects of their  businesses.\r\n\r\nJTC  is  planning  to introduce as part of the local  enterprise\r\n\r\nprogramme a plan to help start-up companies which are engaged in\r\n\r\nhigher valued-added manufacturing activities.  More details will\r\n\r\nbe announced in a few months' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most aspects on this topic of cost\r\n\r\nof doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move on to the topic of\r\n\r\nregionalisation.  I am very happy to note that all the  speakers\r\n\r\nwho  spoke on this issue made the comment that we should not let\r\n\r\nthe  current  temporary setback divert our  attention  from  the\r\n\r\nlonger term goal and it is imperative for us to go regional,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  global.  This is one of the strategic thrusts recommended\r\n\r\nby  the  Competitiveness Committee which I am chairing, that  in\r\n\r\nour  Singapore context, because of our resource constraints,  or\r\n\r\nland,  labour, and so on, it is unavoidable that  we  must  move\r\n\r\noffshore.   As we do so, we try and retain the linkages  between\r\n\r\nthese  offshore operations and the Singapore operations so  that\r\n\r\nin the process, we are able to push ourselves upward and be in a\r\n\r\nposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  we  manage the operations, ie, we do the designing  work,\r\n\r\nresearch,  higher value manufacturing, services and so  on,  and\r\n\r\nharness the resources in the region.  So this is something  that\r\n\r\nwe will continue to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the present situation presents opportunities for us\r\n\r\nto  invest overseas, of course, we have to do so with great care\r\n\r\nbecause the situation in neighbouring countries is still  rather\r\n\r\nunclear.  We do not know whether there are any hidden losses  in\r\n\r\nsome of the books, and what is going to happen.  It is time  for\r\n\r\ncompanies with the cash reserves to look around and see how they\r\n\r\ncan  tap  into the region and establish useful linkages  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   But, as I said, they must do so with care  because  if\r\n\r\nsomething happens, there will be no government to bail them out.\r\n\r\nThat  is the basic policy of the Government.  You go in, you  go\r\n\r\nfor  your profits, but if things turn bad, hard luck.  If things\r\n\r\nturn out well, very good, please invest more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan made some comments about having GDP plus\r\n\r\nand  whether we can develop better indicators to help us  assess\r\n\r\nthe  extent of our regionalisation efforts and its contributions\r\n\r\nto our economy.  I think the points are well taken.  In fact,  I\r\n\r\nthink this is one area where she may give me some lessons on the\r\n\r\ndifferent components of GDP and GDP plus, and so on.  But I have\r\n\r\nsome data here that may reassure her on this aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to regionalisation is to build an external economy\r\n\r\nwhich  is strongly linked and beneficial to the domestic economy\r\n\r\nin  a  way  that strengthens Singapore's role as a business  hub\r\n\r\nwithout  hollowing  it out.  Thus, even as  factor  income  from\r\n\r\nabroad  has  increased from 1993 to 1996,  the  contribution  of\r\n\r\nforeign operations to value-added in the Singapore economy  fell\r\n\r\nfrom 12% to 11%.  In other words, the domestic economy continues\r\n\r\nto  grow  and,  in  fact, grew faster even as we  developed  the\r\n\r\nsecond  wing.   That is why the contribution from  the  external\r\n\r\nfactor is, in fact, less than before.  It has gone down from 12%\r\n\r\nto 11%, even as we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvested more and more overseas.  I see Dr Lee shaking her head.\r\n\r\nMaybe I have to go to her for the lesson!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, our export of business and professional services\r\n\r\nhas  expanded due to regionalisation.  It almost doubled between\r\n\r\n1993  and  1996 to reach $2.45 billion.  This is the  export  of\r\n\r\nbusiness and professional services.  A linkages indicator  which\r\n\r\nmeasures  the  percentage  of sales  of  overseas  manufacturing\r\n\r\naffiliates which were channelled back to Singapore shows a  high\r\n\r\nof  20%  or  $4.7 billion.  This is indicative of the extent  of\r\n\r\nlinkages   between  the  parent  companies  and  their  overseas\r\n\r\naffiliates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote regionalisation, Government has put in place a\r\n\r\nnumber  of incentive schemes and bilateral mechanisms to  assist\r\n\r\nour businessmen.  In encouraging businessmen to go regional,  we\r\n\r\nmust   never  mislead  our  companies  to  go  beyond  what   is\r\n\r\ncommercially  prudent.  Whilst there are opportunities  to  reap\r\n\r\nrewards, companies must weigh the risks as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have stated during the main Budget debate that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  allow losses from overseas ventures  to  be  offset\r\n\r\nagainst  Singapore  taxes.  In fact, the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nexplained clearly why this has been the case.  But here, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  point out that when local companies go overseas,  they\r\n\r\ncan, in fact, apply for what is known as the Overseas Investment\r\n\r\nIncentive  Scheme.  This scheme allows companies to  offset  the\r\n\r\ncapital losses arising from the liquidation of approved overseas\r\n\r\ninvestments against the company's other taxable income.   Before\r\n\r\nthey invest, if they apply to EDB for this incentive and if  EDB\r\n\r\napproves  it,  then they have this insurance that in  case  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  liquidate the companies and there are losses suffered,\r\n\r\nthose  losses  can  be  brought back and  offset  against  local\r\n\r\ntaxable income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that tax rebates should be\r\n\r\nprovided  for  families to defray the higher cost of  children's\r\n\r\neducation  overseas.   As explained before,  there  are  various\r\n\r\nschemes to help companies in their drive and there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso   various   tax  incentives.   But  tax   concessions   for\r\n\r\nindividuals  may  not be effective, since these individuals  are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to pay any taxes in Singapore.  If the employees  have\r\n\r\nto  go overseas and they pay more for the overseas schools, very\r\n\r\noften,  it is the employer who is bearing the cost.  So  if  any\r\n\r\nhelp is provided, maybe it is to the employer that we should  be\r\n\r\ngiving the help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singaporeans counting their period of\r\n\r\nabsence  overseas into the minimum occupational  period  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats, MND has informed my Ministry that they have already  made\r\n\r\nprovision  for  this.  Those posted overseas on official  duties\r\n\r\nare  allowed to include the period of subletting their flats  in\r\n\r\nthe  computation of the minimum occupation period, subject to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of three years for direct purchase flats and one  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  years for resale flats.  I hope the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment can confirm this when his turn is due to discuss the\r\n\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Leong Horn Kee have inquired about\r\n\r\nthe  impact  of  the Indonesian economic problems on  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  events  in  Indonesia will have an  impact  on  the  entire\r\n\r\nregion.  Singapore will not be an exception.  However, we should\r\n\r\nnot  speculate on a possible collapse of the Indonesian economy.\r\n\r\nMany  countries including the US, Japan, Australia and ourselves\r\n\r\nhave been discussing measures to help Indonesia towards economic\r\n\r\nrecovery.   Much of our trade with Indonesia is in the  form  of\r\n\r\nintermediate  goods  as part of the regional  supply  chain  for\r\n\r\nfinal  products  for  OECD  markets.  Similarly,  a  significant\r\n\r\nportion  of  our  investments  in  Indonesia  are  manufacturing\r\n\r\ninvestments  situated in the Riau islands linked  to  plants  in\r\n\r\nSingapore which supply products to countries like the US and the\r\n\r\nEU.   In  the financial sector, the House was informed  recently\r\n\r\nthat  as  at 31st December 1997, the exposure of the  six  local\r\n\r\nbanking groups to Indonesia was S$5.4 billion, representing only\r\n\r\n2.3%  of  their total assets.  So while Singapore cannot  remain\r\n\r\nunaffected  by  the  Indonesian economic  downturn,  our  global\r\n\r\nlinkages and diversified economic structure will buffer us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  any  fall-out effects.  Of course, we are hoping that  the\r\n\r\neconomy will recover and there will not be any serious setbacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the topic of the Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Financing  Scheme (LEFS).   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  has\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern that the recent enhancement of  the  LEFS  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to  help  local companies ride  out  the  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial  turmoil.  I wish to emphasise that the  LEFS  is  not\r\n\r\nintended to bail out sick companies but to support viable  local\r\n\r\nenterprises.    The   lending  decisions   are   made   by   the\r\n\r\nparticipating  banks  with the Government sharing  part  of  the\r\n\r\nrisks.  The LEFS has been popular with smaller companies.  As at\r\n\r\nJanuary 1998, over 4,000 smaller SMEs, ie, those with less  than\r\n\r\n100  employees  each,  have  benefited  from  the  scheme.   The\r\n\r\ncoverage  offered by the enhanced LEFS has now been extended  so\r\n\r\nthat SMEs with fixed assets up to $30 million or employing up to\r\n\r\n300  people  can  also qualify.  Government  has  increased  its\r\n\r\nprovision in LEFS loan lines from $760 million to $1.1  billion.\r\n\r\nWith the Government's share of the  risk for working capital and\r\n\r\nfactory  loans increased to 50% and the doubling of  the  limits\r\n\r\nfor  such loans, more assistance will be provided for our  SMEs.\r\n\r\nIt is not feasible to have an IMF-style bail out package for our\r\n\r\ncompanies which are caught in the regional financial turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we sympathise with companies which are selling, for\r\n\r\nexample,  to the Indonesian market and now find that the  market\r\n\r\nhas  practically disappeared in some cases, I think it  is  just\r\n\r\nnot  feasible  for  Government to come  in  and  help  in  those\r\n\r\nsituations.  But if there are companies here which  have  viable\r\n\r\noperations and they have good export orders, and they also  have\r\n\r\ngood  collateral here which can be used to pledge to banks, then\r\n\r\nit  is  up  to  the banks to decide whether to lend them  money.\r\n\r\nAnd  they  can  then  perhaps  use that  money  to  finance  the\r\n\r\noperations  in, say, the Riau Islands.  This is  what  is  being\r\n\r\ndone  by multi-nationals.  They treat their regional plants like\r\n\r\ncost  centres, sub-contractors.  So they do all the sales  here.\r\n\r\nThey do all the purchasing of parts and components here and they\r\n\r\nfeed the regional plants.  So they are able in that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  to  insure those plants and isolate those plants  from  the\r\n\r\nturmoil.  If some of our local companies can do likewise,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  our  banks can consider and where it is viable, they  will\r\n\r\nprovide them with the assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also said something about whether banks,\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  whoever can guarantee the LCs  issued  by  local\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   This point is not very clear to me.  The  problem,\r\n\r\nfor example, in some of the regional countries is that the banks\r\n\r\nwhich  give  guarantees for LCs are no longer  acceptable.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  maybe some banks in Korea may already  be  in  serious\r\n\r\ntrouble.  So foreign lenders do not have any confidence in  that\r\n\r\nbank  and are not prepared to accept LCs from that bank for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of selling them products.  In our situation, our  banks\r\n\r\nare  very  strong and there is no problem for them to issue  LCs\r\n\r\nfor  the  import of materials from overseas.  So I am not  quite\r\n\r\nclear what Mr Singh meant in this situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the question of the small and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises (SMEs).  As Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned,\r\n\r\nthere are some 60 schemes to help our SMEs.  I also get confused\r\n\r\nwith the large number of schemes.  I can assure Members that the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, like  EDB, PSB and so on,  have  been  trying\r\n\r\ntheir  best to help the small and medium enterprises,  and  they\r\n\r\nhave come up with all these different ideas, incentives and what\r\n\r\nhave  you,  to help our companies, to cater for their  different\r\n\r\nneeds.   Maybe  it  is  time now for us to  have  a  relook  and\r\n\r\nstreamline the operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when we debated this issue, there was this\r\n\r\ncomment  that we did not publish the booklet in other languages.\r\n\r\nThe  PSB  has since done so and they are also in the process  of\r\n\r\ntrying to simplify the application procedures, to make the forms\r\n\r\neasier for everybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSB has also set up its first-stop SME centre in the\r\n\r\nPSB  building  in April last year to facilitate  and  coordinate\r\n\r\naccess to all schemes offered to SMEs.  The centre serves  as  a\r\n\r\nfocal point for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nguidance  and  advice  to  SMEs not familiar  with  the  various\r\n\r\nupgrading  schemes.   If our SMEs have any  problems,  they  can\r\n\r\napproach this first-stop centre and get assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also asked about tax deductibility for `Q' plate\r\n\r\ncars.   On  this  issue, the Member may wish to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of `Q' plate cars will be discontinued  under  the\r\n\r\nnew vehicle tax structure that has just been announced recently.\r\n\r\nAll  company cars registered after 1st September this year  will\r\n\r\nbe  subject to the same taxes as for private cars.  This is  the\r\n\r\ninformation we have obtained from LTA.  I hope this answers  his\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the points made by Mr Tay Beng Chuan. He\r\n\r\ncommented about the Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme\r\n\r\n(LETAS),  whether the grant quantum could be increased from  70%\r\n\r\nto  90%  of the allowable cost of engaging external consultants.\r\n\r\nOn  this  point, I wish to inform him that, in  fact,   the  PSB\r\n\r\nalready  allows  90%.  For certain projects  which  benefit  the\r\n\r\nindustry as a whole, not on a company basis, but where it  is  a\r\n\r\nscheme or a study meant to benefit the whole industry group, the\r\n\r\nPSB  does  approve 90%.  A good example of this  is  the  recent\r\n\r\nrelocation of small factories from Woodlands to make way for the\r\n\r\nwafer fabrication plants in Woodlands.  These factories have all\r\n\r\nbeen  moved  to a new multi-storey flatted factory and,  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  PSB  has  to  come in and help them  to  lay  out  the\r\n\r\nfactory,  plan various things and so on.  The funding  for  that\r\n\r\nwas at 90% level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether we could give financial grants to\r\n\r\ntrade  associations to engage professionals.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ninform him that the Government does provide LETAS grants to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Chinese and Malay Chambers of Commerce and Industry to\r\n\r\nimplement projects that upgrade their members' operations.   PSB\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to work with trade and industry associations  on\r\n\r\nworthwhile projects that have industry-wide applications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion that Government provides soft or matching\r\n\r\nloans to finance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoint  investment  projects in ASEAN, the Nominated  Member  may\r\n\r\nwish  to  note that this is available under the Local Enterprise\r\n\r\nRegionalisation  Finance  Scheme  for  machinery  loans.    This\r\n\r\nscheme is administered by EDB and is meant to help our companies\r\n\r\nset  up  factories overseas.  The loans are provided at I  think\r\n\r\nlow  cost or low rates for them to set up factories and  to  buy\r\n\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to reiterate that the granting of loans is\r\n\r\na  decision  that  is best left to banks to make  on  commercial\r\n\r\ngrounds based on prudent assessment of risk and return.  This is\r\n\r\nthe best approach to avoid abuses or misallocation of resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken about the retail industry and\r\n\r\nthe  tourism industry.  I am leaving them to be answered  by  Mr\r\n\r\nTang Guan Seng.  So please bear with me on this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about the Regional Headquarters\r\n\r\nScheme  and whether the Ministry is satisfied with the  progress\r\n\r\nmade so far.  He quoted a figure of 22 companies which have been\r\n\r\ngranted   the   Regional   Headquarters   (RHQs)   or   Business\r\n\r\nHeadquarters (BHQs) status and whether the incentives are enough\r\n\r\nin view of the recent slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform Mr Low that the scheme has in fact worked\r\n\r\nvery  well.  Since the figure that he quoted in 1991, the number\r\n\r\nof  RHQs  has increased very significantly.  I do not  have  the\r\n\r\nactual  figures here, but I think it exceeds 100 companies  now.\r\n\r\nThe contribution to the economy runs into billions of dollars in\r\n\r\nterms  of  expenditure that they incur here.  So it has  been  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  scheme  and  the EDB will continue  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, with the slowdown, it has indirectly led to more\r\n\r\ncompanies  coming here for this purpose.  When  these  companies\r\n\r\npull out from the region, they still want to  have a presence in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, and the natural place is Singapore.  So  we  are\r\n\r\nin  fact seeing some of that flow coming back.  Contrary to  the\r\n\r\nreports recently in some newspapers that we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlosing  people,  we may be losing some of these  expatriates  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas like banking, but we are getting a gain in  other\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked about the target. We do not have any targets,\r\n\r\nthe  more, the merrier.  We have plenty of office space and this\r\n\r\nis  a very good field.  It helps us to control the operations in\r\n\r\nthe  region  and they can source components here and  engage  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment  work and so on. So it is a very desirable  form  of\r\n\r\nhigh  level  activity, for example, international  trading.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  are  doing  trading which  does  not  pass  through\r\n\r\nSingapore.  All they need is a phone, some fax machines and some\r\n\r\nable staff, and, of course, plenty of good contacts overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken about this important topic of\r\n\r\ntraining  and  retraining of our workers.  I can assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  training has always been a top priority for  us,  together\r\n\r\nwith education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong made the point that we only give lip\r\n\r\nservice  to training but where is the money.  Here, may  I  just\r\n\r\nmake  the  point that in fact SDF in a way is also  like  public\r\n\r\nfunds  because in the past, before we had SDF, in  fact  we  had\r\n\r\npayroll  tax.  So payroll tax was in a way converted to SDF  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  it  was  increased to four percentage  points  and\r\n\r\nadjusted  down to 1% now for workers who earn less  than  $1,000\r\n\r\nper  month.  So  he might like to look upon  it  as  a  kind  of\r\n\r\ntaxation which is directed towards training, the idea being that\r\n\r\ncompanies  contribute  to  this fund  based  on  the  number  of\r\n\r\nemployees,  and  the more they train, the more  they  get  their\r\n\r\nmoney back.  This is to encourage and support them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, the Government's other revenues are mostly\r\n\r\ntaxes.   It comes from the whole economy.  The Government itself\r\n\r\ndoes not generate this income.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I want to clarify on this point. The\r\n\r\nSDF  is  not budgeted.  It is not in the Budget.  It  has  never\r\n\r\ngone   into  the  Consolidated  Fund.  Therefore,  it   is   not\r\n\r\nGovernment's money.  It is a fund quite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseparate from Government revenue and Government funds.  In  that\r\n\r\nsense, Government has not contributed any money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Thank you, Mr Chiam. I would not split\r\n\r\nhairs  here.   I  was just trying to make a general  point  that\r\n\r\nthese are public funds, in a way that the Government has imposed\r\n\r\nit  on  the  system in its overall taxation,  as  it  were,  and\r\n\r\ndirected it towards certain uses.  The money is put in the  SDF.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we had in fact payroll tax and this was replaced by\r\n\r\nthe SDF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, not true to say that Government has not\r\n\r\nbeen  spending  money on training.  We have the  ITE  and  other\r\n\r\nschemes which are in different parts of the Budget.  But I  take\r\n\r\nthe  point  that  for  the purpose of the  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme, we have not had any budget yet in this latest  annual\r\n\r\nbudget, the reason being that there was not enough time  for  us\r\n\r\nto  evaluate the scheme fully and come out with a recommendation\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Finance to have it in the  Budget.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to assure all the Members who have spoken  that  we\r\n\r\nsupport the scheme, and my Ministry is evaluating it to see  how\r\n\r\nwe can fund it and expand the scheme, because the scheme fits in\r\n\r\nvery  well with the need to upgrade our older workers.  It is  a\r\n\r\nwonderful  idea  if,  whilst they are  working  in  certain  low\r\n\r\nskilled jobs and there is a threat that they may lose their job,\r\n\r\nwe  train  them in a systematic way with certification  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can be upgraded into higher level and better paying  jobs,\r\n\r\nsay, for example, in the wafer fabrication industry.  Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  must make sure that the training is relevant and that  there\r\n\r\nis  no wastage.  Very often, when you train a young person, say,\r\n\r\nin ITE, he does not apply the training after that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have been adopting this principle that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility is to provide  good  education  and\r\n\r\nskills up to a certain level, ie, 10 years of schooling and also\r\n\r\nskills  in the ITE.  But the employers themselves have to  train\r\n\r\nthe  workers for their own needs. That is the most effective way\r\n\r\nof training. We cannot foresee what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkind  of  industries will come, even though we  know  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain general directions.  And even for different companies in\r\n\r\nthe  same  industry, they may have their own needs.  But  having\r\n\r\nsaid that, I think there is a case for us to upgrade the general\r\n\r\nability level, for example, literacy, computer skills and  other\r\n\r\nskills  of  our workers so that they are  able to do the  higher\r\n\r\nlevel jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am not comfortable about in this SRP is this part\r\n\r\nabout the absentee payroll, because we do not want to get into a\r\n\r\nsituation where we pay workers just to learn.  We think that  it\r\n\r\nis  better that if they are holding a job and they are  learning\r\n\r\non-  the-job.  In  the  situations that  I  have  quoted,  these\r\n\r\nemployees  are  actually still working and contributing  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  employers, but they are pulled out for,  say,  20%  of\r\n\r\ntheir  time to undergo training in ITE either on a part-time  or\r\n\r\nfull-time basis.  On that basis, EDB has supported the programme\r\n\r\nunder  their INTECH  scheme, up to 70% of the absentee  payroll.\r\n\r\nThe  course fees are paid up to 80% via SDF.  Anyway, the  point\r\n\r\nis that we support the scheme.  We are evaluating it and we will\r\n\r\ndiscuss  with  the Ministry of Finance and see how  we  can  get\r\n\r\nmoney for the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the scheme can just push on and money\r\n\r\nwould  be forthcoming, say, from the SDF funds which still  have\r\n\r\nseveral hundred million dollars of resources left.  There should\r\n\r\nbe no need for us to slow down the scheme for reasons of lack of\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Members asked whether we allow the SDF to be\r\n\r\nused  for training foreign workers.  The answer is, yes, we  do,\r\n\r\nespecially if the foreign workers have three-year work  permits,\r\n\r\nwhich  means that they are skilled already, and we feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  useful  for  us  to  upgrade their skills  further.   Within\r\n\r\ncertain  limits, we also allow training of two-year work  permit\r\n\r\nholders.   But here we have a cap because we want to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat the funds are used more to train our own people rather than\r\n\r\ntransient workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to executive training, this is supported if it\r\n\r\nis part of the company's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal  training and development plan.  But for executives, there\r\n\r\nare other schemes.  For example, EDB's INTECH scheme is used  to\r\n\r\ntrain  executives  for  new projects  when  they  have  to  send\r\n\r\nemployees  overseas to train in headquarters so  that  they  can\r\n\r\nbring  back the knowledge and help start up the local operation.\r\n\r\nINTECH  has also been used to send people for training,  to  man\r\n\r\nour regional plants for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked for the percentage support under\r\n\r\nSDF to be increased from the current levels.  Here, I would like\r\n\r\nto say that PSB is generally sympathetic and is aware that under\r\n\r\nthe  current  economic  situation, some companies  may  be  more\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  train.  So maybe there is a need to increase  the\r\n\r\nfunding  level  on  a  temporary basis.  The  general  level  of\r\n\r\nsupport  is  50%  of  fee course.  But for  the  more  desirable\r\n\r\nskills,  the higher skill areas, the PSB does go as far as  80%.\r\n\r\nBut  we  do not want to go too far because it is important  that\r\n\r\nthe  resources are not wasted.  If we go up to, say, 90% and the\r\n\r\nemployer only pays 10%, there is a possibility that the training\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  so well regulated and there could be  wastage.   I\r\n\r\nthink 50:50 is  in fact a good ratio.  But for special cases, we\r\n\r\ncan go somewhat higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say made the point that we should try and\r\n\r\nproject  into  the  future  in terms of  the  kind  of  economic\r\n\r\nstructure  that  we will have and try and assess  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nworkers  will  be needed and prepare ourselves for  that.   This\r\n\r\npoint  is  well  taken.  We will be working  together  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower to see how we can do this.  Of course,  one\r\n\r\nof  our  main concerns is to prepare our workers well, not  only\r\n\r\nthe  young  ones, but also the older ones, so that we  will  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  problem of structural unemployment.  I think the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme fits in very well with the  latter  part\r\n\r\nof the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data from EDB shows that most of the investments coming\r\n\r\nin  now tend to involve more skilled jobs, something like 70% or\r\n\r\nso  for  the newer industries.  So it is very important that  we\r\n\r\nupgrade our workers so that they can fit into those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkinds  of  jobs.  But I would be reluctant to have  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are retrenchments and we provide the workers  with\r\n\r\nwages  for them to train, because in our tight labour  market  - Members  will  be surprised that our markets is  actually  still\r\n\r\nquite  tight  -  there  are plenty of jobs  available.  So  when\r\n\r\nworkers  get retrenched, the best thing for them is  to  find  a\r\n\r\ndifferent   job  quickly,  and  be  prepared  to  adjust   their\r\n\r\nexpectations.  In the process, of course, we will help with  the\r\n\r\ntraining as well.  But they should not expect to sit at home  or\r\n\r\nbe paid just to learn.  That will be carrying it a bit too far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have various schemes to help the housewives and\r\n\r\nretirees to come back to the labour force.  This is known as the\r\n\r\nback-to-work programme and it has been going on well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the point made by Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen.   First,  he asked about the water agreements.   Following\r\n\r\nPM's  visit  to KL on 16th to 17th February 1998, the Government\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  has  agreed to continue the  supply  of  water  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  beyond the expiry of the 1961 Agreement in  2011  and\r\n\r\nthe  1962  Agreement  in  2061 on terms  and  conditions  to  be\r\n\r\nmutually   agreed  upon  between  the  two  governments.    This\r\n\r\nundertaking by the Malaysian Government will be confirmed in  an\r\n\r\nagreement within 60 days of the issue of the Joint Communiqu\ufffd by\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia.  I share his view that this is a  golden\r\n\r\nopportunity for us to try and settle this matter.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians will proceed in a business-like fashion.  It is a win-win  situation; otherwise the water will be going to waste,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  zero value for them. But if we are prepared to buy  from\r\n\r\nthem - it is very important to us, of course - if we can come to\r\n\r\nthis  agreement  in  the near future, this  will  remove  a  big\r\n\r\npsychological  barrier between us.  From then on, I hope it will\r\n\r\nbe  possible  for us to really cooperate.   As close neighbours,\r\n\r\nthere  is  much that we can do together.  As matters  are  still\r\n\r\nunder discussion, I am afraid I cannot go into more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the electricity rates, the recent increase in\r\n\r\nthe  electricity rates has given rise to queries,  both  outside\r\n\r\nand  inside  the House.  And I informed the House  recently,  in\r\n\r\nanswer to an Oral Question, that this increase recently was just\r\n\r\nto  pass  on the fuel cost increase.  There has been a time  lag\r\n\r\nbetween  the  fuel price increase and the tariff  increase,  and\r\n\r\nthis is unfortunate.  Whilst the price of fuel has come down, in\r\n\r\nUS dollar terms, because of the depreciation of Singapore dollar\r\n\r\nversus  the  US dollar, the actual cost in Singapore dollar  has\r\n\r\nactually gone up leading to this increase in the fuel cost.  But\r\n\r\nwe  see a situation of softening of the fuel oil prices, and  if\r\n\r\nthat  continues, then I hope there will be a reduction  in  this\r\n\r\ncomponent in the next round when we review the prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electricity price is composed of two components. There\r\n\r\nis  a  fixed  component  where you have  the  depreciation,  the\r\n\r\noverheads, the wage cost, and so on, and the return,  and  there\r\n\r\nis  this  fuel  component.  The fuel component  is  just  passed\r\n\r\nstraight  through.  Unfortunately, there is a time  lag  between\r\n\r\nthe actual cost and the price adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other components, I think this was debated\r\n\r\nthoroughly  in 1996 when the decision was made to  increase  the\r\n\r\nreturn  on investment of Singapore Power.  At that time, it  was\r\n\r\nfound  that Singapore Power was costing their electricity  on  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  basis.   They did not take into  consideration  their\r\n\r\ncapital which was invested in plant under construction, and they\r\n\r\nwere only basing their return on plant in operation.  So on that\r\n\r\nbasis,  they were earning a return which was adequate under  the\r\n\r\nold  basis, ie, under the World Bank basis, but not adequate for\r\n\r\na  viable  business.  The Government recognises  that  power  is\r\n\r\nactually  a very stable business.  It is not one of those  high-flyer  types  where it goes up and down.  The return  should  be\r\n\r\nreasonable  but on the low side and stable.  So  it  is  a  very\r\n\r\nstable  kind of situation.  The key thing here is to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat our power rates are competitive.  And I want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassure  him  that my Ministry is watching this  carefully.   The\r\n\r\ntariff rates have to be approved by the PUB and we will have  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that this component of cost is kept under control  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok, who is not here, asked about the blackout\r\n\r\nin  New Zealand.  I think the answer has already been given that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  likely  that in Singapore we will  suffer  a  total\r\n\r\nblackout,  like  in Auckland, which happened  to  their  central\r\n\r\nbusiness district.  I understand that some of their cables were,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  very  old  and not designed for  this  unusually  dry\r\n\r\nweather.  As a result, the heat was not carried away fast enough\r\n\r\nand  there  was a trigger effect.  PUB and Singapore Power  have\r\n\r\nassured us that they have taken all necessary precautions and  a\r\n\r\nblackout  of this nature, a total collapse, will not  happen  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave the other questions to my colleagues to\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, can I make a clarification,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, earlier on, the Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned that I made unfair comment on JTC.  Indeed, it was not\r\n\r\ntrue,   because  I  did  not  make  that  comment.   By   saying\r\n\r\n\"inflexible\", I did not mean that JTC has not been  doing  well.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I said that IP21 is actually quite well drawn  up.   I\r\n\r\nmust  declare  that I am a tenant of JTC, and I am  quite  happy\r\n\r\nwith  it.  But whatever I said earlier on were actually comments\r\n\r\nand feedback from friends of mine who are tenants of JTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Minister, salary, wages, rental and\r\n\r\nservice  charges  are the key components of the  cost  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.  But I am sure the Minister is well aware that when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  wages and rentals, it actually equates to cost,  cash\r\n\r\nupfront.  You just have to pay.  And therefore many companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore   are   having   this   problem,   meaning   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  in paying up instalments, and wages.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nearlier on, I had asked if JTC would be prepared to be even more\r\n\r\nflexible to come out with some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial schemes, eg, deferring of payments and lowering of the\r\n\r\nrates, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually quite pleased that the Minister has reassured\r\n\r\nus  that they are quite watchful of costs.  But I hope that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will continue to monitor the costs.  We  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is going to hit us with this turmoil.  So I hope that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  keep on monitoring the costs and  be  even  more\r\n\r\nflexible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point mentioned by the Minister is about the SME\r\n\r\nschemes.   He himself said that there were too many schemes  and\r\n\r\nhe  could  not  recall all of them.  I just  wonder  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould take a fresh approach by seeing how we can actually  help\r\n\r\nSMEs.   Maybe  they can take a global approach  and  restructure\r\n\r\nsome  of the schemes, so that SMEs will be able to enjoy to  the\r\n\r\nfullest the various schemes introduced by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, is about JTC again. I just wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  JTC has come out with some kind of survey to  see  what\r\n\r\nkind  of  grievances there are from the tenants.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,   have  there  been  any  service  performance  indicators\r\n\r\nreflecting the good work put in by JTC?  JTC tenants would  then\r\n\r\nbe  more  than  willing to take the point on  cost  control  and\r\n\r\nreduction, and freezing of the rental charges, and so on and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   I  am  sure with this explanation, they  will  be  more\r\n\r\nperceptible to the complaints on the inflexibility of JTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Clarification, Sir. I accept the reply\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister regarding the electrical power supply charges.\r\n\r\nBut  Mr  Yeo Cheow Tong in 1996 had laid out a programme on  the\r\n\r\nincrease of tariff which will be spread out over three  to  five\r\n\r\nyears,  and  every year it will increase by 5%, on the  average.\r\n\r\nMy  question to him is whether this built-in increase  is  still\r\n\r\ngoing to be implemented, come high or low water.  Would he  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  that in 1998 Singapore will  face  economic\r\n\r\ncontraction  and maybe the danger of recession?   Will  this  5%\r\n\r\nincrease,  to  enable Singapore Power to increase  its  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn on total assets, be continued to be implemented?  Perhaps\r\n\r\nhe will give us a clear answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Choo for his\r\n\r\nclarification.  I take it that he accepts that JTC is  generally\r\n\r\nquite  cooperative, although some friends of his have  told  him\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  rather  inflexible  in  some  ways.   But  my  own\r\n\r\nimpression  of  JTC  is,  in  fact,  that  it  has   been   very\r\n\r\naccommodating  to its tenants, and it is amongst  the  first  to\r\n\r\nmove  to support our industries in the current crisis.   On  its\r\n\r\nown volition, without any pushing from me, it has gone ahead and\r\n\r\nmade various adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the cash flow problem that he mentioned, he may be\r\n\r\naware that JTC has also allowed the payment of quarterly rentals\r\n\r\nto  be done on a monthly basis, instead of quarterly.  So I hope\r\n\r\nthat would be of some help to the tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Dr Wang Kai Yuen's point on the return on\r\n\r\ninvestment, yes, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong did mention a target in 1996.\r\n\r\nIt  slipped  my  mind just now.  I am glad to inform  the  House\r\n\r\nthat, in fact, the target has already been reached.  So that  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  reason for electricity increase because after they  went\r\n\r\nthrough  the process of corporatisation, they have been able  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity.  When I joined the Ministry  early  last\r\n\r\nyear,  they informed me that, in fact, they had already  reached\r\n\r\nthe  target.  So I would like to assure Members that  this  will\r\n\r\nnot be a cause for increase of power charges.  In fact, the cost\r\n\r\nof  power  is  capped.  The fixed component is capped  at  CPI-X\r\n\r\n(where X has been set initially at 1%).  So it means they cannot\r\n\r\njust   increase  rates  at  will.   They  must  pass  on   their\r\n\r\nproductivity to the users.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, he has not answered my question\r\n\r\npertaining  to  SME schemes, whether he is going to  restructure\r\n\r\nthe various schemes that we have now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, as I said, we are looking into how\r\n\r\nto  simplify the schemes and I am in favour of streamlining  the\r\n\r\nschemes,  and not only for PSB's schemes relating to  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises  but the tax incentive schemes  in  general,\r\n\r\nbecause there is a big range of them.  My impression is that  in\r\n\r\nthe  eagerness of EDB and the others to promote investments  and\r\n\r\nto help our industries, they have, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact,  made  the schemes more and more to start with,  and  also\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  generous.   So  I  think,  on  the  whole,  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses here should be very thankful for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, my question was not answered. It\r\n\r\nis  about  the  survey.   Does JTC conduct  any  survey  on  its\r\n\r\nperformance?  How often do they collect feedback from tenants of\r\n\r\nJTC, so that the tenants have better service?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I can assure the Member that JTC is in\r\n\r\nclose  contact with the tenants.  If nothing else,  the  tenants\r\n\r\ncome to them and protest, if anything is not proper.  But I take\r\n\r\nhis  point.  I think it would be a good idea if JTC has  regular\r\n\r\nsurveys.   I  mentioned earlier on that,  in  fact,  the  posted\r\n\r\nrentals are set through surveys.  They measure and find out what\r\n\r\nis  the  market rate.  So even though we have said that we  have\r\n\r\nfrozen the posted rates, in fact, if the market rentals go down,\r\n\r\nthen JTC will follow downwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that at this point, we let my colleagues answer\r\n\r\nthe other points.  If need be, we can come back again on some of\r\n\r\nthe other issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Minister was confused about my\r\n\r\nletter  of credit question.  So I would like to clarify.   I  am\r\n\r\ntalking  about  the  category of companies who  are  fortunately\r\n\r\nstill  able  to  secure sales, but because of the tightening  of\r\n\r\ncredit  financing, they are not able to purchase the goods  that\r\n\r\nthey  could  sell.   I was therefore hoping  for  some  form  of\r\n\r\nbacking  through  any means, banks or Government,  to  back  the\r\n\r\npurchases  that  they  can make for the  sales  that  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  secured.  So it is quite different from those companies\r\n\r\nwho have lost sales or are in trouble because of the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope my question on the entrepreneurship will\r\n\r\nbe answered later on too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Firstly, on the letters of credit, my\r\n\r\nimpression  is that if a trader has a good export order  and  he\r\n\r\nneeds to buy goods, he is able to use this to factor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  export bills with banks, and banks will be willing to lend.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the trader is in a rather shaky position, then the\r\n\r\nbanks will have to evaluate whether it is too risky to lend  him\r\n\r\nthe money and, in some cases, they may require collateral and so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is more pertaining to LCs from the other\r\n\r\ncountries  because in those situations, their LCs are no  longer\r\n\r\nacceptable.   So that is where the problem arises.  Our  traders\r\n\r\nor manufacturers may be selling to the region.  But the LCs that\r\n\r\ntheir importers in those countries want to open with their banks\r\n\r\nare not acceptable to our banks here.  And this is an area where\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been trying to help Indonesia to see how  we  can\r\n\r\nfacilitate this trade through some kind of a guarantee of  their\r\n\r\nBank   of  Indonesia.   Firstly,  the  Bank  of  Indonesia  will\r\n\r\nguarantee  this group of banks which offer the LCs and  we  will\r\n\r\nguarantee  the Bank of Indonesia.  But that scheme is contingent\r\n\r\non  having a multi-national effort involving many countries, and\r\n\r\nat  the moment we are still waiting for response from some other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh raised a very important\r\n\r\nquestion about the promotion of high-tech entrepreneurship.   As\r\n\r\nwe  all know, in the next century, the basis of wealth in  human\r\n\r\ncommunities  will not be in raw materials but will be  in  human\r\n\r\nknowledge.  Those who are close to the sources of knowledge  who\r\n\r\nare  upstream,  they  get much more value  than  those  who  are\r\n\r\ndownstream.  If you were to look at a PC, there is a  very  high\r\n\r\nextraction  of  the  total  value,  first,  by  Intel,  then  by\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.  If all you are doing is welding or assembly work  or\r\n\r\nmetal  bending,  you  are paid commodity  prices.   As  a  total\r\n\r\neconomy,  it  is very important that we promote this  particular\r\n\r\narea of high-tech entrepreneurship in order that we will be able\r\n\r\nto maintain our relative position in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, no one can beat America. The Japanese tried\r\n\r\nbut  they  are  now left far behind.  The centre is  in  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley.  It is a very exciting place and every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  city  in the world tries to re-create Silicon  Valley\r\n\r\nwithin its midst.  But obviously, it is not so easy.  So when Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh talked about promoting high-tech entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, he is really asking a very fundamental  question.\r\n\r\nHow do we try to replicate some of the conditions there in order\r\n\r\nthat,  in  this new world, we will also swim upstream  and  will\r\n\r\nhave our share of the total value of the world's product?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made four specific recommendations which I shall now\r\n\r\nlike to respond to.  First, amending the bankruptcy law in order\r\n\r\nthat  we  be more tolerant of failure and that Singapore  be  an\r\n\r\neconomy  with  many  second chances.  Our  bankruptcy  law  went\r\n\r\nthrough  a  major  reform in 1995 with the new Act  coming  into\r\n\r\nforce  on 15th July 1995.  One of the primary objectives of  the\r\n\r\nnew  law was to encourage entrepreneurship, especially in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere   bankruptcy  had  arisen  from  misfortune  rather   than\r\n\r\nmalpractice,  by  having  a more liberal  regime  in  bankruptcy\r\n\r\ndischarges.   With  the  scheme of easier discharges,  bankrupts\r\n\r\nwere  also  encouraged to work towards early  discharge.   Since\r\n\r\nJuly 1995, close to 6,000 bankrupts have been discharged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Assignee is constantly reviewing bankruptcy\r\n\r\nlaws  and  practices.  In September of the same year, a  further\r\n\r\namendment  was  introduced to enable the  Official  Assignee  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  more  bankrupts by certificate.  Our insolvency  laws\r\n\r\nare  being further studied to determine if additional amendments\r\n\r\nare necessary in the interest of both creditors and bankrupts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with having many second chances is that of\r\n\r\nmoral hazard.  You use other people's money, that money is given\r\n\r\nor  loaned  to you in trust, and if it is so easy  to  fail  and\r\n\r\nsomehow  betray  that  trust, then  we  create  a  very  serious\r\n\r\nproblem.  But we recognise at the same time that in the specific\r\n\r\nfield of high-tech, the investment is often in the nature  of  a\r\n\r\ndebt  and  that  if we are too harsh on the directors  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies,  say, for instance, by preventing them from  becoming\r\n\r\ndirectors  again, then naturally there will be very  few  people\r\n\r\nwho will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared  to become directors of high-tech start-ups  for  which\r\n\r\nthe  failure rate is very high.  These are some of the areas  we\r\n\r\nare   looking  at  and,  if  necessary,  we  will  make  further\r\n\r\namendments to our laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also talked about the rigidity of SESDAQ\r\n\r\nrules.   In  fact, under existing rules, a company applying  for\r\n\r\nadmission  to SESDAQ need not meet any minimum profit  or  share\r\n\r\ncapital  requirements.   Companies  seeking  listing  on  SESDAQ\r\n\r\nusually have three-year operating records, but companies  having\r\n\r\nshorter operating records can also apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an area which the Corporate Finance Committee,\r\n\r\nformed by the Government to study corporate fund-raising issues,\r\n\r\nis  currently  looking into.  The problem is more  complex  than\r\n\r\nthat.   In Israel, where they have many start-ups, they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  their own equivalent of SESDAQ or NASDAQ.  Many  of  them,\r\n\r\nwhen they succeed, they list on NASDAQ.  So they make use of the\r\n\r\nfund  market in the US.  Creative which is listed on NASDAQ  and\r\n\r\nin Singapore has 90% of its stocks transacted in NASDAQ and only\r\n\r\n10%  here.  But we should try.  And if it is possible to somehow\r\n\r\nmake  SESDAQ  an  attractive place to  raise  high-risk  capital\r\n\r\nfunds, we should try to do so, and we need to tweak some of  our\r\n\r\nother  rules and regulations as well, for example, our rules  on\r\n\r\nstock options which are much too restrictive for high-tech start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked about Government helping R&D\r\n\r\nconsortiums.   In fact, the Government has been  supporting  the\r\n\r\nset-up  of industry consortiums.  This is an important  way  for\r\n\r\nindustry, research institutes and universities to come  together\r\n\r\nto  work  on  common R&D projects.  And through  this  approach,\r\n\r\nindustry members benefit from reduced development cost and time,\r\n\r\nas   well  as  from  information  sharing  and  technology   co-development.  The Government facilitates the formation  of  such\r\n\r\nconsortiums and supports their projects through grants and other\r\n\r\nforms  of assistance.  Examples include the Aerospace Technology\r\n\r\nProgramme, the Marine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology Programme and the Intelligent Progressive Die  Design\r\n\r\nand  Manufacturing Software Programme.  Our research  institutes\r\n\r\nand centres are also spearheading a number of other consortiums.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the Institute of Microelectronics and  the  Gintic\r\n\r\nInstitute   of   Manufacturing  Technology  lead  a   consortium\r\n\r\ninvolving  29  industry members from the printed  circuit  board\r\n\r\nassembly  industry.   Individuals or  companies  who  have  good\r\n\r\nproject ideas and are interested can approach NSTB or any of the\r\n\r\nresearch institutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question of venture capital. Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nasked what we are doing to encourage this industry.  Again, this\r\n\r\nindustry  is not as simple as it sounds.  It does not mean  that\r\n\r\nwhen  you  have  the  money, you have the rules,  and  you  have\r\n\r\nventure  capital.  Two weeks before Chinese New Year, I  paid  a\r\n\r\nvisit  to  Silicon  Valley and had many interesting  discussions\r\n\r\nwith  venture  capitalists and lawyers who are  experts  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  in  Silicon Valley.  These are experts.  They  watch  the\r\n\r\nbottom line very closely.  They are very good at sizing up human\r\n\r\nbeings  to  decide whom to place bets on and they also recognise\r\n\r\nthat  many  of these entrepreneurs who all have giant egos  also\r\n\r\nhave failings.  They cannot manage people,  they do not know how\r\n\r\nto  institutionalise the procedures in the  company.   So  these\r\n\r\nventure capitalists, in many ways, help to bring ideas through a\r\n\r\nprocess  of  metamorphosis,  all  the  way  to  IPO.   There  is\r\n\r\nspecialisation at different stages of the process of watering an\r\n\r\nidea and seeing it flower, and eventually bearing fruit.  We are\r\n\r\njust beginning.  In fact, we have brought down many experts  and\r\n\r\nconsultants to help us here.  We will do everything we  can,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, to make our laws and regulations conducive but  these\r\n\r\nare  only  the  preconditions.  Whether or not we  will  succeed\r\n\r\ndepends on something more fundamental.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have not done all too badly. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  been actively promoting the venture capital industry  since\r\n\r\nthe  mid-1980s.   As  at end 1997, there was over  $7.7  billion\r\n\r\nworth of venture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital  (VC) funds managed in Singapore.  Currently,  VC  funds\r\n\r\nenjoy  tax  exemption on the gains from disposal of  investments\r\n\r\nand on certain investment incomes for a maximum of 10 years.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, fund management companies that manage such funds\r\n\r\ncan qualify for pioneer status.  To further encourage the growth\r\n\r\nof  the industry, the Minister for Finance recently announced in\r\n\r\nhis  Budget  Statement that the current 10-year  limit  will  be\r\n\r\nextended on a case-by-case basis, by up to a further five years,\r\n\r\nat a concessionary tax rate of not more than 10%.  And this will\r\n\r\nfurther encourage the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where private funds are not prepared to assume the\r\n\r\nhigh  risks  associated with investing in seed stage  companies,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has stepped in by establishing  venture  funds,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the $50 million Technology Development Fund (TDF) which\r\n\r\nco-invest with private firms to fund early stage ventures.   The\r\n\r\nTDF  has  invested  in  more than 20  local  start-ups  and  has\r\n\r\nattracted  more  than 10 overseas technology  companies.   Other\r\n\r\nsimilar    funds    include   the   $100   million    Technology\r\n\r\nCommercialisation  Fund  and  $100  million  Pharmaceutical  and\r\n\r\nBiotechnology  Growth Fund.  At the same time,  EDB  Investments\r\n\r\nPte Ltd also runs venture capital funds which invest in start-up\r\n\r\ncompanies at various stages of development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have various support schemes to assist\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs  and  innovators, including NSTB's  Technopreneur\r\n\r\nAssistance Centre and PSB's R&D Incubator Programme.  These  are\r\n\r\ninfrastructural aspects.  At the end of the day, what we need is\r\n\r\nto  create  in Singapore an environment which conduces high-tech\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship and the growth of start-ups.  It is not an easy\r\n\r\nthing to do.  It is a complex organic process and we have had  a\r\n\r\nfew  successes.  You take, for instance, Sim Wong Hoo's Creative\r\n\r\nTechnology.  70% of PCs carry his sound card, the Sound Blaster.\r\n\r\nAnd he is quite a big name in Silicon Valley.  I have met people\r\n\r\nthere  who  hold him up as a model to emulate, not in Singapore,\r\n\r\nin Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I visited his facility recently and was very inspired by\r\n\r\nhis  briefing and of his plans for the future.  He has very  big\r\n\r\nambitions.   I asked him this question, \"To what extent  do  you\r\n\r\nowe your success to Singapore?\"  He is Chinese educated.  He  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  university graduate.  He only has a polytechnic  diploma\r\n\r\nand  he  listed six success factors all starting with  \"F\".   He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Well, some of them like hard work and so on.\"  They  are\r\n\r\nSingaporean  factors and he thinks that his Singaporean  origins\r\n\r\nare  very  important and he must maintain his roots in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  is why Creative is listed on our Stock Exchange.  But  he\r\n\r\nsaid  there  are  other aspects like fun and  failure  tolerance\r\n\r\nwhich are more American in character and he wishes that we  have\r\n\r\nmore of them here.  He wants to expand here.  But he also has an\r\n\r\noperation  in  Silicon Valley.  I asked him,  \"Do  you  do  more\r\n\r\ncreative  work  here or in Silicon Valley?\"  He  said,  \"In  the\r\n\r\nValley.   But Singaporeans are very good, very kiasu.   When  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  product  development  and  manufacturing,  debugging,\r\n\r\nSingapore is much better than Silicon Valley.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to take a very realistic view. I do not think\r\n\r\nwe  can ever be like Silicon Valley but we can swim close to it,\r\n\r\nbe  well-connected  there  and, at  the  same  time,  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  here for Asians, for Westerners  who  want  a  good\r\n\r\nwholesome  family environment to locate here and to do  creative\r\n\r\nwork  here.   And  if  we  do  that, then  we  will  succeed  in\r\n\r\ntechnology  entrepreneurship.  If we do not,  then  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to keep up with this very fast paced game in the  next\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to answer the cut on R&D by Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen and Mr Zainul Abidin.  Again, this is an area connected  to\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  just discussed about technology entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nwhich is key.  The problem is we can easily measure inputs.  But\r\n\r\nhow  do we measure outputs?  Mr Zainul Abidin was concerned that\r\n\r\nour  inputs were not sufficient.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen was concerned\r\n\r\nthat  we  were  not  measuring  outputs  carefully  enough   and\r\n\r\ntherefore we might be wasting money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult area. We know that to remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  we  must continually upgrade our  technology  base\r\n\r\nthrough the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromotion  of  industry-relevant R&D and  innovation.   And  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  general  approach to R&D  is  encompassed  in  the\r\n\r\nNational Science and Technology Plan, NSTB 2000.  I do not think\r\n\r\nit is our objective to nurture rocket scientists in Singapore or\r\n\r\nastrophysicists.  But at the same time, on the spectrum  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  process,  from  assembly  all  the  way  to  pure\r\n\r\nresearch, instinctively we know that we must move rightwards  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to keep up in this knowledge game.   We  want  to\r\n\r\ninvest  long  term in projects whose outcomes are uncertain  but\r\n\r\nwhose  results are not so far into the distant future that  they\r\n\r\nare  immeasurable even after a long period of time.  That is the\r\n\r\ndilemma which we face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, NSTB 2000 is progressing quite well. Gross\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in R&D as a percentage of GDP, that  is  the  input\r\n\r\nnumber,  reached 1.35% in 1996.  In 1990, it was only 0.84%  and\r\n\r\nour  aim  is  to  raise  it  to 1.6% by  the  year  2000.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  the private sector share of gross  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nR&D  has  risen  from 54% in 1990 to 63% in  1996,  against  our\r\n\r\ntarget  of  65% by the year 2000.  The private sector  companies\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  answer  to  stockholders.   They  have  quarterly\r\n\r\nreports,  annual reports, so they are much more  careful.   This\r\n\r\nstatistic,  the  fact of their share of a growing  pool  of  R&D\r\n\r\nfunds  in Singapore, shows that we are doing quite well.   About\r\n\r\n79% of the estimated $6.5 billion in sales revenue attributed to\r\n\r\nR&D  performed in Singapore, about 79% of this revenue, was from\r\n\r\ncommercialized  products  and  processes  launched  within   the\r\n\r\npreceding two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another index of success is number of patents. The number\r\n\r\nof  patents  filed  by Singapore companies and  individuals  has\r\n\r\nincreased  from  142 in 1993 to 316 in 1996, an  average  annual\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  of 31%.  This is not bad.  The number  of  patents\r\n\r\ngranted  as  a  result of R&D work carried out in Singapore  has\r\n\r\nalso risen from 20 in 1992 to 91 in 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research institutes and centres, which form part of the\r\n\r\nknowledge infrastructure that supports industry, have also  been\r\n\r\ndoing  well.   To  date, they have participated in  1,000  joint\r\n\r\nprojects with industry, developed 150 new products and processes\r\n\r\nand  signed  76 licensing agreements for technology development.\r\n\r\nAnd some of them have gained a certain international reputation.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  may be instances of specific R&D  projects  not\r\n\r\ndoing  well,  this  is  to be expected.   If  all  projects  are\r\n\r\nsuccesses,  it  means  that  we are  not  taking  enough  risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I fully agree with Dr Wang Kai Yuen that we should\r\n\r\nconduct  regular reviews critically to monitor the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof our investment in R&D.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's policy on international and regional R&D\r\n\r\ncollaboration is to focus on areas which will help  to  build  a\r\n\r\nstrong base of technological capabilities in Singapore.  We have\r\n\r\nbeen  very  active.   We  have  bilateral  activities  with   15\r\n\r\ncountries  including China, India, Israel, Germany, Canada,  the\r\n\r\nUS,  Japan  and the Netherlands.  Activities cover  projects  in\r\n\r\nareas  such  as  biotech, advanced materials, IT,  environmental\r\n\r\ntechnology   and  advanced  manufacturing  systems.   Technology\r\n\r\nbrokerage events are also co-organised with overseas partners to\r\n\r\nestablish and build on networks and linkages that will  maximize\r\n\r\nmarket access opportunities for Singapore-based companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, I opened a new facility in Singapore set up\r\n\r\nby  Genset  from  France.  They are a very interesting  company.\r\n\r\nFor  some  time now, there has been a French team consisting  of\r\n\r\nvery  brilliant scientists whose objective is to completely  map\r\n\r\nthe  human  genome, which means to map the entire DNA coding  of\r\n\r\nhuman  beings.  With computers, it can be done and it  is  being\r\n\r\ndone.   This company sees enormous possibilities in health  care\r\n\r\ntherapies,  in  drugs, in solving many of the  medical  problems\r\n\r\nwhich are genetic in nature.  It is a small facility.  And  what\r\n\r\nthey  produce at the end of the day, in a test tube, is a little\r\n\r\ndrop  of  electrolyte,  a  single  strand  of  DNA  artificially\r\n\r\nsynthesised  from the four amino acids.  This  is  a  new  game.\r\n\r\nWhat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbiotech  means here is the creation of life.  If  you  put  this\r\n\r\nstrand  of  DNA into the primordial soup, it replicates  itself.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  this would eventually pose enormous moral  problems\r\n\r\nfor  human  beings, but the genie is already out of the  bottle.\r\n\r\nEither  we get into this game ourselves or others will get  into\r\n\r\nit and we will be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the areas which NSTB is trying very hard\r\n\r\nto  promote.   The  CEO  of Genset told  me  that  he  had  full\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  Singapore.  He did not even visit  our  facility\r\n\r\nbefore he decided to plonk it there.  And when he came to see it\r\n\r\nfor himself, it was beyond his expectations.  In other words, we\r\n\r\nhave a certain reputation in the world.  We should safeguard  it\r\n\r\nand build upon it, multiply our networks and get into this game.\r\n\r\nBecause  it is this game which will maintain a high standard  of\r\n\r\nliving for Singaporeans, young and old, in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also active in the multi-lateral arena including the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Committee  for Science and Technology,  the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nEconomic  Cooperation  Forum,  the  Association  for  Scientific\r\n\r\nCooperation in Asia and the Asia-Europe Meeting.  What  we  have\r\n\r\nto  do  in the end, like for high-tech entrepreneurship,  is  to\r\n\r\ncreate  an  environment  in Singapore  which  attracts  talented\r\n\r\npeople  from  all over the world to come here.  If  we  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend  upon  local  talent to staff  all  our  laboratories  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  must  surely fail.  If  you  visit  any  of  our\r\n\r\nresearch  institutes, a very high proportion of  the  scientists\r\n\r\nand engineers there are non-Singaporeans.  What we have to do is\r\n\r\nto  create reputation, create a total working environment, which\r\n\r\nmakes it attractive for them to come here.  And as part of  this\r\n\r\nmove,  we  are master planning a Science Habitat in the vicinity\r\n\r\nof the Science Park and the universities in the Ayer Rajah area,\r\n\r\nan  ambience with watering holes which brain workers  will  find\r\n\r\nattractive,  and  well served by schools, public  transportation\r\n\r\nand other facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silicon Valley is, of course, much bigger than the whole of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is sprawling.  It has got highways and  connected\r\n\r\nby  cars.   But  there are not all that many watering  holes  in\r\n\r\nSilicon Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  Silicon Valley, there is a feeling of a small community.  If\r\n\r\nyou  are  a person who matters, everyone knows you and  you  are\r\n\r\nrecognised, even by the waiter.  What we need to do in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  to  create one aspect of us which is like that, where  there\r\n\r\nare  watering holes, where people will retire in the evening for\r\n\r\na  drink,  just to talk, to meet.  We can have electronic  mail,\r\n\r\nbut  there is nothing to substitute for a handshake and  a  chat\r\n\r\nover a glass of beer.  And this is part of the human aspects  of\r\n\r\na   scientific  community,  which  we  must  try  to  create  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Dr Toh See Kiat spoke on\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce.  All of us know that with the growth of the\r\n\r\nInternet, electronic commerce will explode in the coming  years.\r\n\r\nFor  it  to  realise its full potential, there  must  be  money.\r\n\r\nCyberspace  will  not be sustained by window  shoppers,  by  Net\r\n\r\nsurfers.   In  the  end, cyberspace will only  be  sustained  by\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce, by people investing in it and making  money\r\n\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for cyberspace to develop like that, we need\r\n\r\ncontracts.   We  need  protection  of  property.   We  need  the\r\n\r\nenforcement of contracts. We need arbitration.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe need the whole panoply of facilities which are to be found in\r\n\r\nthe real world and they must be replicated in cyberspace.  Right\r\n\r\nnow,  it is a Wild West,    anything goes.  But eventually, like\r\n\r\nthe  Wild West, it will be settled.  I do not think for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime  to  come,  we  are  going to find a  world  government  in\r\n\r\ncyberspace.  But jurisdictions will eventually creep in.  Banks,\r\n\r\ncredit  card companies, bookshops, haberdashers, they  will  all\r\n\r\njump  into  cyberspace.  Today, many of  us  are  familiar  with\r\n\r\namazon.com.  It is a very easy way to order books, quite  cheap,\r\n\r\nvery generous return policy.  It is very convenient, the largest\r\n\r\nbookshop  in the world.  Or you can buy your shirts  from  Lands\r\n\r\nEnd.   If you are not happy with it, you can return it to a post\r\n\r\noffice  in Singapore.  This will grow.  But in order for  it  to\r\n\r\ngrow,  you  need, like in the real world, trust networks,  which\r\n\r\nmeans a way by which transactions are secured, that someone else\r\n\r\nwill not see your credit card number.  And that you are whom you\r\n\r\nclaim you are.  Therefore, identification is important.  We need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectronic signatures.  We need public keys, private keys.  Then\r\n\r\nin  the  event of disputes, whose jurisdiction?  And, of course,\r\n\r\nwe have to keep the taxes light, because trade goes to where the\r\n\r\ntaxes are lightest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our approach towards electronic commerce is a total one,\r\n\r\nnot just to create the bandwidth.  Bandwidth is the least of the\r\n\r\nproblems.   But  if  we  can  create  many  trust  networks   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, with good arbitrators, with good jurisdictions,  then\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce will flourish around us.  And we  will  find\r\n\r\neventually  in  cyberspace,  cyber  hubs  which  are  electronic\r\n\r\ncities, each a collection of trust networks, where if I want  to\r\n\r\nbuy a lottery ticket or I want to make a contract, I say, \"OK, I\r\n\r\nchoose  this  jurisdiction.\"  I may have to pay, because  it  is\r\n\r\nworth paying for good government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are we trying to do in Singapore? We are doing\r\n\r\nmany things.  We are providing infrastructural services such  as\r\n\r\non-line secure payment with credit cards and the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nNet  Trust  which  issues  digital certificates  for  electronic\r\n\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for the first time in the world, the first\r\n\r\nsecured  electronic transaction was carried out in Singapore  by\r\n\r\nVisa.   It  is  still a little cumbersome, a little complicated,\r\n\r\nbut as these things get debugged, as people get used to it, more\r\n\r\nand  more  companies  will  do  a  part  of  their  business  in\r\n\r\ncyberspace,  and  we must position ourselves  for  it.   We  are\r\n\r\npromoting it.  The agency that is pushing this is NCB.  We  have\r\n\r\na  National Information Technology Committee chaired by  Admiral\r\n\r\nTeo  Chee  Hean.    The  adviser is DPM BG  Lee.   And  agencies\r\n\r\nrepresenting  all Ministries are on it, because there  are  many\r\n\r\naspects to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have this thing called the Electronic Commerce Hotbed,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  to try and encourage those in the private  sector  to\r\n\r\nmake use of electronic commerce.  Of course, Government agencies\r\n\r\nare also jumping in.  We are using these Government agencies  to\r\n\r\nspearhead  the effort and to get people used to it.  Of  course,\r\n\r\ninformation technology is changing so fast that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  hard  for us to catch up.   Every 10 years, there  is  a\r\n\r\ngenerational gap.  We must accept this.  Young people will  swim\r\n\r\nin  this  new  environment.  Old people will be frightened  off.\r\n\r\nBut  even  if  our  grandparents are  not  comfortable  in  this\r\n\r\ntechnology,  they  should  at least have  enough  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nenough  wisdom  to want their grandchildren to be familiar  with\r\n\r\nit.   And  so  we  now  find in Singapore many  old  people  who\r\n\r\ninstinctively  know that it is very important  for  their  young\r\n\r\ncharges to be taught the computer.  And, as you know, whether it\r\n\r\nis  schools, whether it is the financial sector, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nSingapore  One, whether it is marketing ourselves to Bill  Gates\r\n\r\nor  to  Netscape  or whatever, we are positioning  ourselves  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for the electronic age.  And we are also providing  a\r\n\r\nconducive  legal  and policy framework to facilitate  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce.   We are preparing a new Electronic Transactions  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  will be tabled in this House to include things like  what\r\n\r\nis  a public key.  What does it mean to be legally identified in\r\n\r\nelectronic  transactions?   What are electronic notaries?   Many\r\n\r\nof these things have got to be defined in clearer detail because\r\n\r\nthe present laws do not quite cover the new technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to legislate to prevent computer misuse, to\r\n\r\nprotect  privacy and to protect intellectual property.  The  key\r\n\r\nis that people must trust the system in Singapore. If they trust\r\n\r\nthe  system  in  Singapore,  if they are  confident  that  their\r\n\r\nproperties  will be protected, that there is a  way  to  resolve\r\n\r\ndisputes,  a  way to collect monies, a way to enforce,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  flourish.  As part of this, we are funding R&D, conducting\r\n\r\nmarket  surveys, and developing our local capabilities. We  have\r\n\r\nschemes in place, which local companies, including SMEs can  tap\r\n\r\nfor   their   ventures.   Funding  for  consultancy,  equipment,\r\n\r\nmanpower and training is available under the Cluster Development\r\n\r\nFund and the Innovations Development Scheme administered by NCB.\r\n\r\nFunding  for R&D is available as well under schemes  managed  by\r\n\r\nthe National Science and Technology Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should go beyond the specialists. We must bring in\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public.   NCB  has  been  working  with  other\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  and  industry  players  to  raise   public\r\n\r\nawareness  and acceptance of e-commerce.  For example,  together\r\n\r\nwith the Singapore Tourism Board, they organised a \"Shop on  the\r\n\r\nNet\"  event  in  July  1997,  the  first  electronic  sales   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   E-commerce  promotion is  also  being  carried  out\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore  One clubs at various community  centres  and\r\n\r\nthrough regular road shows held in shopping malls.  In addition,\r\n\r\nbroad  based  e-commerce training and awareness  programmes  are\r\n\r\nbeing carried out for companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approved cyber trading scheme is part of this total\r\n\r\neffort to position Singapore as a hub for e-commerce.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink that cyberspace will be completely tax free, which is what\r\n\r\nthe  Americans  want.  I do not think it will be completely  tax\r\n\r\nfree because services are being provided and these services have\r\n\r\nto be paid for.  In the end, what we will see in cyberspace will\r\n\r\nbe competing jurisdictions, each levying fees or taxes at levels\r\n\r\nwhich have to compete with each other, according to the level of\r\n\r\nservices  they  provide.   Our job is to  tax  lightly  and  the\r\n\r\napproved cyber trading scheme is precisely to ensure that normal\r\n\r\ntaxation rates do not apply for certain categories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working with other agencies in the world, like\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce  committees  in  the  OECD,  the   European\r\n\r\nCommunity,   the  US  and  the  World  Intellectual   Properties\r\n\r\nOrganisation (WIPO).  It is a complex field.  It is evolving  so\r\n\r\nfast that it is very hard to keep up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked why do we not create a Ministry for\r\n\r\nCyberspace or a Cyber Ministry.  It is not so simple because, if\r\n\r\nwe  think about it, IT will pervade every aspect of our life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Every entity which exists in the  real  world  must\r\n\r\neventually find a reflection in cyberspace.  You do not need one\r\n\r\nMinistry  in  cyberspace.   You  need  every  Ministry   to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented,  which is why Dr Toh's proposal is  not  realistic.\r\n\r\nWhat we are trying to do  is to encourage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  Ministry  to anticipate the new technology  and  to  help\r\n\r\npromote  it, and all agencies and all Ministries.  Many of  them\r\n\r\nalready  allow and encourage members of the public who  need  to\r\n\r\napply for permits or whatever to deal electronically through the\r\n\r\nPC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I have to bring myself back to\r\n\r\nSESDAQ.   Earlier  on, the Minister mentioned about  SESDAQ.   I\r\n\r\njust  want  to know what is the role of MTI in promoting  SESDAQ\r\n\r\nand  how many companies has it helped to push them on to SESDAQ.\r\n\r\nCan  he  give us an assessment about our SESDAQ because  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  around for quite a number of years and how successful have\r\n\r\nwe been?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The idea of the second board is to\r\n\r\nenable companies which need high-risk funds to raise them.  This\r\n\r\nmeans that, on the second board, the criteria are less stringent\r\n\r\nthan on the main  board.  This was the way NASDAQ in the US  was\r\n\r\nconceived.   We  started it in Singapore.   The  rules  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment may be somewhat too rigid.  So SESDAQ has  had  some\r\n\r\nsuccess,  but we need to do much more to make it an  avenue  for\r\n\r\nhigh tech-firms to raise funds through SESDAQ.  It is, of course\r\n\r\nregulated by MAS.  MTI is only interested to the extent that  we\r\n\r\nare  trying to promote high-tech companies in Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\nhelp them raise higher risk funds more readily here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> How successful have we been in\r\n\r\npromoting  fund raising and supporting such high-tech and  high-risk companies in the SESDAQ market?

Investing in high-tech is  quite  different\r\n\r\nfrom  investing  in,  say,  a  sector  like  real  estate.   Our\r\n\r\ntraditional skills are in the traditional areas.

Even then, we are not sure how successful\r\n\r\nit  can be because, as in the Israeli example, they do not  even\r\n\r\ntry  to  create their own second board.  They just make  use  of\r\n\r\nNASDAQ.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask Minister, while we are reviewing the  SESDAQ\r\n\r\nrules, can we also look at the possibility of allowing shares to\r\n\r\nbe  traded  in  a  kind  of grey market.  This  exists  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries  where  the  moment  the company  is  registered,  you\r\n\r\nactually  allow shares to be traded in a grey market.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  values of the shares are listed in the newspapers.   It  is\r\n\r\nperfectly  above board for shares to be traded.  So there  is  a\r\n\r\nkind of a grey market even before you go to the SESDAQ level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am not quite sure what Mr Singh\r\n\r\nmeans.

There is  a\r\n\r\nbig  project  by the Education Ministry to provide one  computer\r\n\r\nfor every two school students.  But there is also the problem of\r\n\r\ntraining the teachers and of getting parents and grandparents to\r\n\r\nbe  familiar so that they can guide their charges along.  We are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  do  different  things in a  fun  way  so  that  this\r\n\r\npsychological  barrier can be broken.  It  is  not  easy.   Till\r\n\r\ntoday,   there  are  still  not  an  inconsiderable  number   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who fear the ATM.  We should try, but it is also in\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of human beings to be conservative.   But  we  must\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  those  who are young  and  do  not  have  this\r\n\r\npsychological barrier are fully raised in this milieu.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the Minister has said in this House\r\n\r\nthat  the ECH Committee has made some recommendations.  I  think\r\n\r\nin  an  earlier  reply  to Dr Lee's question,  there  were  some\r\n\r\nsketches of what the ECH Committee has recommended.  What I  had\r\n\r\nasked  for was whether the Ministry would be willing to consider\r\n\r\npublishing the full report so that the investors and members  of\r\n\r\nthe public can understand where they can position themselves  if\r\n\r\nthey want to innovate in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The NCB and the Committee of the\r\n\r\nNITC are in constant contact with players in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry.

We  have  got  to\r\n\r\npromote   what  we  are  doing,  not  just  locally,  but   also\r\n\r\ninternationally.

The Minister says that the\r\n\r\nfunding  from  the Ministry does go to the consortia.   But  the\r\n\r\nconsortia that he mentioned are largely NUS, NTU, government-led\r\n\r\nand  initiated.  I did ask the Minister in my speech whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry  would  fund a private consortium if  such  a  need  do\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I think we would, if we are in\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the  objectives and we are confident  that  its\r\n\r\noutput will be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade  and  Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng): Sir, on behalf  of  my\r\n\r\nMinister,  I  will respond to the points made by other  Members,\r\n\r\nincluding the point made by Mr Zainul Abidin, which I will reply\r\n\r\nin greater detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first address the point made by Dr Toh See Kiat. He\r\n\r\nrequested  that the Government introduce a Fair Trading  Act  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  interests of the consumers.  He also mentioned  of\r\n\r\ncases  where  companies resorted to scare and cheating  tactics.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, I would like to thank the Member for bringing  up\r\n\r\nthese  cases  because  this  is the  best  way  to  educate  the\r\n\r\nconsumers.  Before I go into it further, I would like to explain\r\n\r\nthe basic approach of the Government on consumer protection, ie,\r\n\r\nour   approach  has  always  been   market-based  with   minimal\r\n\r\ngovernment  regulation.   I think we  should  let  the  consumer\r\n\r\ndecide what product they want to buy.  The Government will  only\r\n\r\nintervene  where  there are safety, health or  moral  issues  or\r\n\r\nwhere there is a market failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh mentioned about newspaper advertisements which were\r\n\r\nmisleading to the consumers.  We did look into this problem  but\r\n\r\nwe  feel that it is practically quite difficult to address  this\r\n\r\nissue.   Basically, it is not easy to prove which  advertisement\r\n\r\nis  misleading or false and also the advertiser can prove it  by\r\n\r\nbringing up only one case.  So it is not easy for the Government\r\n\r\nto  pass legislation to ban this type of advertisement.  But  if\r\n\r\nDr  Toh  has  suggestions to make, we would be very  pleased  to\r\n\r\nconsider them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer watchdog, the Consumers Association of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (CASE) can help safeguard the interests of  consumers\r\n\r\nby  educating them.  The Government is of the view that most  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  in  the  New  Zealand  Fair  Trading  Act  have\r\n\r\nequivalent provisions in our Consumer Protection Act.   That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Government feels that there is no need to introduce  a\r\n\r\nFair  Trading  Act in Singapore.  But I am happy to  learn  that\r\n\r\nCASE  is  preparing a proposal which will be  submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  in  a  few  months' time.   We  will  look  into  this\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh and Mr Goh Choon Kang mentioned about cases\r\n\r\ninvolving  soft  commodity traders cheating the members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   I would like to inform the Members that the Government\r\n\r\nis  aware of such cases.  A Committee, in fact, was formed  last\r\n\r\nyear  to  look  into this problem.  But, currently,  rubber  and\r\n\r\ncoffee  are the only commodities regulated under the Commodities\r\n\r\nFutures  Act  and Regulations.  The Government is  now  studying\r\n\r\nwhether it is also possible to extend the Act to cover the other\r\n\r\ncommodities.   However,  no  regulatory  system  can   guarantee\r\n\r\nreturns for investors in the futures market, nor can regulations\r\n\r\nprotect  investors from making losses.  Investors must therefore\r\n\r\nbe  discerning  in responding to advertising claims  and  should\r\n\r\nstay   away  from  dubious  investment  schemes  which   promise\r\n\r\nunrealistically high returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh has also talked about the problem of the millennium\r\n\r\nbug.   He would like to know whether the private sector is ready\r\n\r\nto   cope  with  this  problem.   I  would  like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  inform  the Member that the  National  Computer\r\n\r\nBoard launched a Year 2000 Conversion Campaign in November  1996\r\n\r\nto raise awareness of the problem and to drive conversion of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's systems.  The Government has targeted  to  complete\r\n\r\nconversion  of all affected IT systems by the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nMinistries,  departments  and statutory  boards  have  completed\r\n\r\ndetailed  impact  analysis  and  have  begun  to  convert  their\r\n\r\nsystems.   The public sector conversion programme is on schedule\r\n\r\nand  all  agencies  are expected to meet the end  of  this  year\r\n\r\ntarget.   Testing and fine-tuning can then be carried  out  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the private sector, NCB has also implemented a\r\n\r\nnumber  of initiatives to increase the awareness of the  private\r\n\r\nsector   and   the  general  public.   NCB  has  supported   and\r\n\r\nparticipated in talks conducted for various industrial  sectors.\r\n\r\nIt has set up a Year 2000 Website.  These provide useful avenues\r\n\r\nto discuss the issues, to share experiences and to seek help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that it is in the interest of the\r\n\r\ncompanies to tackle the Year 2000 issue seriously.  There are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of well qualified IT firms in Singapore which are able to\r\n\r\nprovide  solutions to this problem.  For small and  medium-sized\r\n\r\nenterprises  that face difficulties, they can approach  NCB  for\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance under the Local Enterprise Computerisation\r\n\r\nProgramme.  SMEs can seek assistance to help defray part of  the\r\n\r\ncost of consultancy services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh has also asked about what happens to the financial\r\n\r\nsector.   For  the financial sector, the Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore (MAS) issued circulars in May 1997 and October 1997 to\r\n\r\nall  banks  and  financial institutions outlining measures  they\r\n\r\nshould  take  to address the Year 2000 problem.  All  banks  and\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions are required to complete their Year  2000\r\n\r\nconversion and testing processes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the end of this year.  This is to allow sufficient time  for\r\n\r\nany  rectification  required.  MAS  is  presently  conducting  a\r\n\r\nsurvey   to   assess  the  status  of  financial   institutions'\r\n\r\npreparedness  for the Year 2000 problem.  Our local institutions\r\n\r\nare  on track in their preparations.  Most of the larger foreign\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions have established  global  programmes  to\r\n\r\ntackle the problem.  MAS will liaise with financial institutions\r\n\r\nthat have difficulties in tackling the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now Mr Zainul Abidin brought up the issue of promoting\r\n\r\nIT  culture at the grassroots level.  I would like to give  some\r\n\r\nmore details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one major thrust in IT2000 Plan is to promote an IT\r\n\r\nculture amongst our people so that Singapore will become one  of\r\n\r\nthe  most  IT-literate countries in the world.  To achieve  this\r\n\r\nobjective, NCB has adopted a two-pronged approach of creating IT\r\n\r\nawareness  and increasing IT's usage among Singaporeans.   NCB's\r\n\r\nefforts  since  1995 have met with much success.   There  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of initiatives which are launched by NCB.  Let me cite  a\r\n\r\nfew  examples here: (1) 13 computer road shows have  been  held;\r\n\r\n(2)  A  four-part infortainment programme was televised in 1996,\r\n\r\nand, in fact, for this year, there will be another series of  IT\r\n\r\nTV  programmes over Channel 5 and Channel 8.  Another  programme\r\n\r\nlaunched by NCB is to set up computer playgrounds.  So far,  six\r\n\r\ncomputer  playgrounds  have  been  set  up  that  reach  out  to\r\n\r\nchildren.  For the members of the public, now they can  even  go\r\n\r\nto  community  centres and community clubs  to  have  access  to\r\n\r\ncomputers.   Of  course,  this is only under  a  pilot  project.\r\n\r\nThere  are  only  two CCs involved.  If this  is  proven  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful, it can be implemented in other CCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming months, more programmes will be put in place\r\n\r\nto  reach  out  to more people.  These include  a  permanent  IT\r\n\r\nexhibition to be staged at the Singapore Science Centre from May\r\n\r\nthis  year.   It  will be a fun and interactive exhibition  that\r\n\r\nwill showcase the benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  IT in all aspects of our lives - at work, in school, at home\r\n\r\nand in our recreation pursuits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another programme is a travelling IT coach. This is in\r\n\r\npartnership with NTUC and industrial partners.  And this  is  to\r\n\r\npromote IT literacy training and skills upgrading to workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  factories.  NCB also will be setting up more Singapore  One\r\n\r\nclubs in community centres and selected libraries.  And NCB will\r\n\r\nbe holding more IT awareness seminars for members of the public,\r\n\r\ntogether with the People's Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the questions raised by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Rai on\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of the tourism industry, Sir, although we had 7.2\r\n\r\nmillion  visitors  last year, it was a dip of 1.3%  compared  to\r\n\r\n1996.   With the continued weakness in the regional economy  and\r\n\r\nthe  likely  return  of  the haze, the Singapore  Tourism  Board\r\n\r\nexpects  a further drop in tourist arrivals this year  by  about\r\n\r\n10%.   Mrs  Lim  also  raised the haze problems  which  will  be\r\n\r\naffecting  the  arrival  of  tourists.   The  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  is  working closely with regional  counterparts  to\r\n\r\nminimise  the  problem  or  to prevent  a  repeat  of  the  haze\r\n\r\nsituation  last year.  I think the Minister for the  Environment\r\n\r\nwill be elaborating on these measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the expected drop in tourist arrivals will reduce\r\n\r\nSTB's projected cess revenue for this year, and consequently its\r\n\r\nresources available for tourist promotion.  However, in view  of\r\n\r\nthe need to maintain Singapore's presence in key tourist markets\r\n\r\nand  to  compete effectively against regional destinations,  STB\r\n\r\nwill sustain the previous level of marketing effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to rationalise our promotional efforts\r\n\r\nand  focus  on markets which show greater potential for  growth.\r\n\r\nSTB  has  made  a  strategic shift to  intensify  its  marketing\r\n\r\nefforts in markets like the US, Europe, Australia, Taiwan, India\r\n\r\nand China.  However, STB will remain engaged in markets that are\r\n\r\nexpected  to under-perform as a result of the regional financial\r\n\r\ncrisis, so that we are in a position\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  attract  travellers from these countries when  they  recover\r\n\r\nfrom the economic difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve better results, STB will work closely with\r\n\r\nindustrial  players.   It will continue to promote  key  tourism\r\n\r\nevents  like the Great Singapore Sale, Singapore Food  Festival,\r\n\r\netc.   In  addition,  STB will leverage  on  our  rich  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage  to  attract visitors to Singapore.  For instance,  STB\r\n\r\nhas  packaged various year-end festivals into a three-month long\r\n\r\nprogramme  called  Celebration Singapore.  This  programme  will\r\n\r\nfeature various ethnic festival light-ups as well as the popular\r\n\r\nChingay procession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the Tourism 21 blueprint, STB will also develop\r\n\r\nthe  culturally  and historically rich areas  around  Chinatown,\r\n\r\ninto  a  themed  tourism product.  Within  this  thematic  zone,\r\n\r\nvarious cultural activities, like Chinese opera, will be staged.\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  the  Members that STB will continue  to  monitor\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  the  regional market and  will  come  in  with\r\n\r\nadditional measures to assist the industry, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee is concerned about the performance\r\n\r\nof the retail industry.  The problems faced by the retail sector\r\n\r\nstems  from both structural and cyclical factors.  These include\r\n\r\nkeen  competition  for  the  consumer  dollars,  slower  visitor\r\n\r\narrivals and spending by Singaporeans in regional economies as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  relatively stronger Singapore dollar.   Private\r\n\r\nconsumption  expenditure  may also  be  affected  this  year  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  tighten  their  belts,  following  more   moderate\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place several assistance measures\r\n\r\nto   overcome  the  retail  sector's  cyclical  and   structural\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to help retailers affected by the drop in regional\r\n\r\ntourists,  STB is intensifying its efforts in markets which  are\r\n\r\nrelatively unaffected, such as I mentioned just now ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we might run the risk of\r\n\r\ngetting  out  of  time again.  So can you try to  condense  your\r\n\r\nreply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> All right. The markets which are\r\n\r\nrelatively  unaffected  are USA, Europe, Australia,  Taiwan  and\r\n\r\nChina.   And  SIA and STB, in fact, will jointly  promote  these\r\n\r\nmarkets, especially in Europe and US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in view of the anticipated softer demand, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has, in fact, substantially moderated the  supply  of\r\n\r\ncommercial space under this year's Government land sales.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Government is pursuing various programmes to  raise\r\n\r\noverall  structural  competitiveness of retailers  by  enhancing\r\n\r\nretail  infrastructure, assisting in the upgrading of operations\r\n\r\nand  facilitating  staff training.  For  the  more  domestically\r\n\r\noriented  retail  sector, the Government has several  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes.     I  will  cite  a  few  examples,  like  encouraging\r\n\r\nretailers to join franchises or form economic groupings  and  to\r\n\r\nuse  information  technology to help small  shops  improve  shop\r\n\r\nmanagement through the ShopNet and BookNet schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the recently announced property tax rebate, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance had already mentioned in his Budget  speech\r\n\r\nthat  HDB,  JTC and other Government agencies owning  properties\r\n\r\nwill  pass  on most of the property tax rebate to their  tenants\r\n\r\nand we also want to encourage the private sector to do likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> It has been a long day for MTI.

This is important\r\n\r\nbecause from the Silicon Valley experience which General Yeo has\r\n\r\nmentioned, we see that a lot of brave young men and women,  some\r\n\r\nmight  say  brash young men and women, are the ones  that  start\r\n\r\nthese  companies.  But they do not have the money.  I  think  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  more for them in terms of tax incentives too.

But if the past year is anything to go  by,\r\n\r\nthere  is not much to look forward to by the series of bad  news\r\n\r\nand more bad news.  No one has foreseen that in the last lap  of\r\n\r\nthis  century,  it  will be such a tortuous  one  with  currency\r\n\r\nturmoil  and  unprecedented economic downturn  for  the  region.\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, amongst  others,\r\n\r\nare much affected by the economic downturn.  And so are we.   It\r\n\r\nis  a  new  and indeed unfamiliar phenomenon which  all  in  the\r\n\r\nregion are trying to fathom and cope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this economic downturn is bound to alter the power\r\n\r\nconfiguration and rewrite the strategic equation in the  region.\r\n\r\nIt  will  not be incremental changes, but fundamental shifts  in\r\n\r\nparadigm, realignment and relationship.  In the midst  of  these\r\n\r\nshifts, I would like to ask the Minister for his reading of  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  and how a small country like Singapore can  position\r\n\r\nitself overcome the odds and survive and prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What may I ask are the roles of the United States, the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China and Japan in this new scenario?  Will\r\n\r\nthe  Americans retain their strategic and economic interests  in\r\n\r\nthe region?  I hope they will.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  we will continue to offer the Americans access  to  our\r\n\r\nnaval  facilities in  Singapore.  Will the Japanese expand their\r\n\r\neconomic role?  What impact will the PRC have on this region?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to ask the Minister what positive role can\r\n\r\nSingapore  play  in  this  region.

Prof. Tommy Koh\r\n\r\nis  one  outstanding example.  Earlier this week, we read  about\r\n\r\nAustralia  complimenting our Prime Minister, Mr Goh  Chok  Tong,\r\n\r\nfor  his  role  to alleviate the problems brought about  by  the\r\n\r\nregional currency and economic turmoil.  We also read about  how\r\n\r\nand why the American President and other international financial\r\n\r\nagencies sought the views and advice of our Singapore leaders on\r\n\r\nthe same issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that the full ramifications of the economic\r\n\r\nturmoil  are  yet to unfold, let us not underestimate  the  role\r\n\r\nSingapore can play and the favourable position in which  we  can\r\n\r\ntake  advantage  of  to  play  a constructive  role.   We  must,\r\n\r\nhowever, continue to be sensitive as not to be misunderstood  as\r\n\r\nexploiting   their  plight  and  hardship.   But  within   those\r\n\r\nboundaries   of   sensitivity,  we   should   look   for   those\r\n\r\nopportunities  to play that constructive role that  is  mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial.  In the process, we should also strengthen our  base\r\n\r\nand position, vis-a-vis our trading and business partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of the $5 billion credit backing to Indonesia is\r\n\r\none  example  of  an  initiative that  has  gained  us  enhanced\r\n\r\ngoodwill.   Although  the proposal is now  on  hold,  it  was  a\r\n\r\ngesture   which  was  well-appreciated  and  considered  timely.\r\n\r\nSingapore's strong reserves and potential as an investor will be\r\n\r\nlooked  upon as a source for help.  The MFA therefore  can  help\r\n\r\nidentify more such opportunities to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenhance  Singapore's  active  foreign  policy  through  economic\r\n\r\nimperatives.

I  expect\r\n\r\nsimilar missions and efforts from other countries in the  region\r\n\r\nto do likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see tremendous potential for Singapore to exercise\r\n\r\ndiplomacy  and  enhance foreign relations through  our  economic\r\n\r\nstrength and I hope MFA will continue to take advantage of  such\r\n\r\nopportunities.  After all, Sir, our economic muscle can  be  put\r\n\r\nto  bear  as  an equalising balm for enhanced international  and\r\n\r\nregional relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang is not here.

It was indeed\r\n\r\na difficult passage and a very rough patch in our relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we are off to a better start. Leaders and\r\n\r\nofficials  of both countries have met on a number of  occasions.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that this good trend will generate goodwill and\r\n\r\nit  will yield good dividends.  But it is yet too early to  tell\r\n\r\nwhether  it will be a good year.  Nevertheless, we hope for  the\r\n\r\nbest and wish that both countries will enjoy prosperity together\r\n\r\nas good neighbours in a win-win situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad that the Prime Ministers of Malaysia and\r\n\r\nSingapore met in Kuala Lumpur on 16th February of this year  and\r\n\r\na joint communique was issued.  This communique covered, amongst\r\n\r\nothers,  economic  cooperation,  the  Malayan  Railway  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Pedra Branca.  Most significant of all,  Malaysia\r\n\r\nagreed  to continue the supply of water to Singapore beyond  the\r\n\r\nexpiry  of  the  1961 Agreement in the year 2011  and  the  1962\r\n\r\nAgreement  in  the  year  2061 as well  as  the  1990  Agreement\r\n\r\nconnected with it, on terms and conditions to be mutually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreed between the two governments.

If  Members\r\n\r\nwill recall, that was a very difficult and trying period in  our\r\n\r\nrelations  with  the Malaysians.  However, leaders  of  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries  recognise  that Singapore  and  Malaysia  have  their\r\n\r\ndestinies  closely  intertwined.  At the  end  of  the  day,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that in the final analysis, the future well-being  of\r\n\r\nthe two countries is to a large extent dependent on each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year has since passed and much has taken place. Events\r\n\r\nin  recent months have affected both countries although  not  by\r\n\r\nthe   same   extent.   Invariably,  we  recognise  that   closer\r\n\r\ncooperation between Singapore and Malaysia need not always be  a\r\n\r\nwin-lose situation.  But in many cases, we only win one.   I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to  note that over last year, relations between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia have improved substantially.  The Prime  Ministers\r\n\r\nof  both  countries have met and in a joint communique announced\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  looking  at possibilities  of  closer  business\r\n\r\ncooperation.   And I am also happy to note that  the  Malaysians\r\n\r\nhave  assured us that they will not cut our water supply at  the\r\n\r\nend of the present term of the Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to give this House an\r\n\r\nupdate of the bilateral ties between Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang is not here.

I believe the main\r\n\r\nobject  of  Singapore-Malaysia relationship is to  obtain  water\r\n\r\nsupply  for Singapore on a permanent basis. It is true  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  get  our  water  supply from other  sources  such  as  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and from desalination plants.  But there are  hazards\r\n\r\nand the cost is much higher to get water from Indonesia and from\r\n\r\nthe  desalination plants.  I believe the best way to ensure  the\r\n\r\ncontinuous flow of water from Malaysia to Singapore is to have a\r\n\r\nvery  close  relationship with Malaysia.  I believe the  closest\r\n\r\nrelationship  we can have with Malaysia is to form  an  economic\r\n\r\nunion  with Malaysia.  This is not a new idea.  Singapore formed\r\n\r\na  political  union,  which included  an  economic  union,  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in 1963, but it failed.  An economic union  is  not  a\r\n\r\npolitical union.  In a political union, Singapore has to give up\r\n\r\nits  sovereignty.  But in an economic union, our sovereignty  is\r\n\r\nstill intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not proposing an economic union so that Singapore can\r\n\r\nget  richer.  If we have this intention in mind, I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  Malaysians  would want to have  such  a  union.   The\r\n\r\neconomic union must be for the mutual benefit of both countries.\r\n\r\nEventually, we hope that Malaysia can be as rich as us, so  that\r\n\r\nthe  element of envy, now harboured by many Malaysians,  can  be\r\n\r\nremoved  once and for all.  I believe  only then that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  ensure  of a permanent supply of water without  paying  too\r\n\r\nhigh a price for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, when we met in this House\r\n\r\nfor  the  budget  debate  in  July last  year,  we  debated  the\r\n\r\nrelations  between Singapore and Malaysia.  Both countries  were\r\n\r\nstill  smarting from a few months of bad patch in our  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.  It has since improved.  Since the end of last  year,\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Goh Chok Tong has met his Malaysian counterpart,\r\n\r\nDr Mahathir Mohamed, four times.  There have been meetings among\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  officials, military exercises  and  games  among\r\n\r\ngovernment officials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the second link between Singapore and Johor was\r\n\r\nopened.  It was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopened to traffic not long after we faced problems, and probably\r\n\r\nthe longest period of traffic jam problem on the Causeway at the\r\n\r\nend  of  last  year, arising from the implementation  of  a  new\r\n\r\nMalaysian  customs check on lorries.   I hope we can  truly  put\r\n\r\nsuch  a problem behind us and will not let it recur because  any\r\n\r\nhiccup in bilateral relations such as the one manifested by  the\r\n\r\nCauseway jam, it is the people, the businessmen and the ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens who are affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been saying that we would like to see a long-term relationship with Malaysia that is based on mutual respect,\r\n\r\nmutual  benefit and reciprocity.  We have to hope for  the  best\r\n\r\nand  work  towards  it.   Although, realistically,  being  close\r\n\r\nneighbours, problems may emerge from time to time.   Both  sides\r\n\r\nmust   continue  to  work  hard  to  strengthen  our   bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations,  and grab every opportunity to strengthen  our  close\r\n\r\nbilateral ties while pursuing our respective national interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note the remark made by a Malaysian\r\n\r\nDeputy  Minister that the regional economic turmoil has  brought\r\n\r\nboth  countries closer together.  Like Mr Sin Boon Ann, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister to update Members on the progress that\r\n\r\nhas   been  made  in  our  bilateral  ties  with  Malaysia,   in\r\n\r\nparticular,  how  are  we cooperating with Malaysia  to  jointly\r\n\r\ntackle problems arising from the current regional financial  and\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore-Indonesia relations have\r\n\r\nbeen  close  and  warm ever since President  Suharto  came  into\r\n\r\noffice.   We all know that President Suharto is indeed a  friend\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Indonesia has played a pivotal role in ASEAN and\r\n\r\nPresident Suharto has a moderating and positive influence on the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the moment, Indonesia is beset with economic\r\n\r\nproblems  and subject to wide currency fluctuations.   Singapore\r\n\r\nhas been quick in responding to Indonesia's needs with financial\r\n\r\npackages  and wishing all the best for Indonesia.  We know  that\r\n\r\nwhatever happens to Indonesia, it will have an impact on  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I would  therefore\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister for his reading of the situation  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia and the region, and how best we can help Indonesia  to\r\n\r\novercome these problems.

In an increasingly interdependent\r\n\r\nworld,  what  affects our neighbours may have an impact  on  us.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  realise this.  We should  not  just  confine\r\n\r\nourselves to the well-being of our country without, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  being  concerned  for  what is  happening  in  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries  in the region.  Because the countries in  the  region\r\n\r\nare  so  closely tied together, we must recognise that  regional\r\n\r\nwell-being is as important as national welfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a region that is caught up with the turmoil of events,\r\n\r\ninvestors' confidence would, to some extent, be affected.   This\r\n\r\nlack  of confidence may at some point of time affect us locally.\r\n\r\nUnless we do our part to restore regional confidence, we are not\r\n\r\nessentially  helping  ourselves because regional  confidence  is\r\n\r\nclosely linked to our economic well-being as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia's problems must be resolved by Indonesians\r\n\r\nthemselves.   However, we must understand  that  the  impact  of\r\n\r\ntheir  sovereign decisions would be largely felt by all  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,  not  just financially and economically but socially  as\r\n\r\nwell.  We can only hope that in the name of national resilience,\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesians  will work quickly towards strengthening  their\r\n\r\ninternal  unity  and solving their problems.  We must  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  at  this  moment  in time, there is a  need  for  regional\r\n\r\nsolidarity  within ASEAN.  As a small country, we  must  do  our\r\n\r\npart  in helping our neighbours as much as we can.  We certainly\r\n\r\nhope  that confidence can return soon to Indonesia and  to  this\r\n\r\nregion after the election and once reforms have been implemented\r\n\r\naccording to plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is truly an urgency for Indonesians to reunite and to\r\n\r\nget  back to work to put their economy together, so as to  boost\r\n\r\ninternal  and  external confidence for recovery.

Europe\r\n\r\nhas huge financial and economic interests in Asia.  In 1996, the\r\n\r\nEU  exported US$123 billion worth of goods and services to  East\r\n\r\nAsia,  more than the United States.  The involvement of European\r\n\r\nbanks in Asia amounted to more than US$350 billion, even greater\r\n\r\nthan   that  of  the  US  and  Japanese  banks  added  together.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  Asia's  exports to Europe have  increased  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   Many Asian countries have also invested large  sums  in\r\n\r\nEurope.  However, the recent economic turmoil in Asia  has  made\r\n\r\nmany  people  in  Europe sanguine.  The economic  problems  have\r\n\r\naffected the Europeans to some extent.  It clearly shows that in\r\n\r\nthe  new  interconnected  global  economy,  every  one  will  be\r\n\r\naffected by regional economic problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is whether Europe will continue to take a\r\n\r\ngreater  interest  in Asia, in particular,  in  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nnations.  We need to assure that the Asian ship is still buoyant\r\n\r\nand  steady.  We must ensure that Europe places great importance\r\n\r\nin Asia and continues to increase its links.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their credit, some of the European countries have\r\n\r\nextended help to Asia through the IMF and on a bilateral  basis.\r\n\r\nI think they could do more both on a multi-lateral and bilateral\r\n\r\nbasis.    I  hope more countries in Europe can be  persuaded  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the trade financing scheme proposed by our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister for Indonesia.  I urge the Ministry to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nAsian economic crisis is put on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntop  of  the  upcoming ASEM II meeting in London.  I would  also\r\n\r\nurge  the  Ministry to ensure that the environmental problem  in\r\n\r\nthe region is put on the top priority list for discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent depreciation of the Asian currencies has\r\n\r\nalso  meant cheaper exports from these ASEAN countries.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry will urge the Europeans to keep their markets open\r\n\r\nto  cheaper products from the affected Asian economies, and  not\r\n\r\nimpose  barriers.  It is equally important that Europe be  urged\r\n\r\nto  increase  its  investment in Asia to speed up  the  recovery\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministry will work hard to ensure that ASEM\r\n\r\nII comes out with concrete ideas and programmes to help Asia out\r\n\r\nof its economic problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, despite much criticism and doubts\r\n\r\nand  there  are  many,  the  United Nations  have  expanded  and\r\n\r\nfulfilled to a significant extent its role as a recognised world-wide  forum for countries, big and small.  It has weathered many\r\n\r\nstorms  and crises, the most recent of which is the Gulf crisis.\r\n\r\nThe  United  Nations certainly do not meet all our expectations,\r\n\r\nbut there is none to replace it in the post-cold war world.   As\r\n\r\na  small country, Singapore certainly finds it very useful to be\r\n\r\nrepresented at the United Nations.  We are indeed bidding for  a\r\n\r\nseat on the UN Security Council for the year 2001. A seat on the\r\n\r\nUN  Security  Council, I believe, would give us, especially  our\r\n\r\ndiplomats, an excellent opportunity to learn and appreciate  the\r\n\r\nworkings of the UN Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister on the latest in\r\n\r\nour campaign for such a seat on the UN Security Council and what\r\n\r\ndo  other  nations think of Singapore's role in the UN  and  its\r\n\r\naffiliated bodies.  Will it mean that we will play a more active\r\n\r\nrole in the UN?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, a financial tornado has built up and\r\n\r\nripped  through  the  region,  causing  untold  damage  to   the\r\n\r\neconomies  and  the lives of the people.  The  region  is  still\r\n\r\ncounting the cost and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  storm has not fully subsided.  Much uncertainty remains and\r\n\r\nfurther damage could still occur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is very prudent. We have an honest, hardworking\r\n\r\nand rational system.  Our economic fundamentals are sound by any\r\n\r\nstandard.  We have sufficient reserve to cover our currency many\r\n\r\ntimes  over,  yet we are affected by the regional  economic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  The sad aspect of the crisis is that  it  was\r\n\r\nunnecessary.   It  was  not that we lack the  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\ngenesis  of such financial tornadoes and can therefore claim  to\r\n\r\nbe  surprised by the event.  The writing was on the wall  for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time.  The painful experience of the burst of the Japanese\r\n\r\nproperty bubble remains clear in our mind and the effects of  it\r\n\r\nremain till today.  We have seen it happen also in Mexico,  just\r\n\r\na few short years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is growing smaller, more inter-linked. As\r\n\r\nneighbours, what can we do to share our concerns, especially  in\r\n\r\nmatters  that affect us?  Do we have the means or the mechanisms\r\n\r\nto  convey  our  concerns without being accused of  interfering,\r\n\r\nwithout  incurring their wrath, without being  scolded?   If  no\r\n\r\nsuch  mechanisms  exist, then is it time that they  be  created?\r\n\r\nUnless something is done urgently, otherwise every few years  we\r\n\r\nwill  find  our  follies repeated with much pain, suffering  and\r\n\r\nanguish to our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rai, you can take your two amendment\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Much obliged, Sir. Singapore being a\r\n\r\nsmall  country, we cannot have the luxury of having a very heavy\r\n\r\ndiplomatic establishment.  But the least we could do is to  have\r\n\r\nfriends  all  over the world and I would urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider   maintaining  new  diplomatic  relations,  say,   with\r\n\r\ncountries with which we do not have so far.  This would at least\r\n\r\nbe  an  opening  for  us  to go into these  countries  when  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  arises.   Many  of these countries,  especially  in\r\n\r\nLatin  America, are potential opportunities for us.  The example\r\n\r\nof Mexico is very clear to us how we have in a short while built\r\n\r\nup the relationship.  I think it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the interest of Singapore, like Switzerland, to have as many\r\n\r\nfriends  all over the world.  And when we should apply  for  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations' seat in the Security Council, at least we  will\r\n\r\nhave support from the other countries as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to touch on is Roving\r\n\r\nAmbassador or non-resident Ambassador.  As I have said  earlier,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have a very rich history of foreign relations.   We\r\n\r\njust started from 1965.  But it is a credit to the Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis  officials that we have at least maintained diplomatic ties.\r\n\r\nIf  we  cannot  afford to have an ambassador  resident  in  that\r\n\r\ncountry,  at  least  we  try to have ambassadors  who  are  non-resident  in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerican  countries.   I would urge the business  community  and\r\n\r\nsenior  professionals who can afford it to opt, when  approached\r\n\r\nby  the  Government, to represent Singapore. This is  the  least\r\n\r\nthey  could  do  for  the country.  Of course,  the   Government\r\n\r\ncannot afford to pay them an allowance which probably they  will\r\n\r\nget  elsewhere.  Nevertheless, it is an honour and  prestige  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  one's  country.   So I would  urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\npersuade  as many people as possible to represent Singapore  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  see  whether in those countries  where  we  have  non-resident  ambassadors there is a need now  to  upgrade  them  to\r\n\r\nresident ambassadors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken.\r\n\r\nI  hope they will forgive me if I respond not necessarily in the\r\n\r\norder  in  which the points have been raised, but  it  does  not\r\n\r\nreflect in any way on the importance of the points. But I  think\r\n\r\nit may be more convenient for me to respond in this manner so as\r\n\r\nnot  to  risk being cut by the \"guillotine\" in the midst  of  my\r\n\r\ndeveloping answers on some other topics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose therefore to start by responding to Dr Ong Chit\r\n\r\nChung who asked my views on the changing strategic situation  in\r\n\r\nAsia.  Sir, since July 1997, which was when we discussed foreign\r\n\r\naffairs in the Committee of Supply last,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would  say that the situation in our Asia-Pacific region  has\r\n\r\nbeen  marred  and marked by the regional financial crisis  which\r\n\r\nhas  really  exacted a very heavy toll on most  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.  Having said that, let me add that not all  the  news\r\n\r\nhas  been  bad  in the sense that there have been some  positive\r\n\r\ndevelopments on other fronts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triangular relationships, for example, between the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, China and Japan, have stabilised and  show  some\r\n\r\nsigns  of  improvement.  Over the last six months, we  have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  witnessed high level exchanges amongst leaders  of  these\r\n\r\nthree  major  powers and also visits to and  from  Russia.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  when  we  look  at the United States-China  relations,\r\n\r\nPresident Jiang's visit to the United States in October/November\r\n\r\nlast year was a first in 12 years by a Chinese Head of State and\r\n\r\nis  regarded as signalling the normalisation and enhancement  of\r\n\r\nUnited  States and China relations.  Both sides, of  course,  do\r\n\r\nseem  to  have important differences, but they seem  willing  to\r\n\r\nengage  one  another  and thus provide a  more  predictable  and\r\n\r\nstable  relationship for themselves, which in turn  augurs  well\r\n\r\nfor this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for China-Japan relations, here also, we have to note\r\n\r\nthe exchanges of visits by Prime Minister Hashimoto to China  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1997  and Premier Li Peng to Japan in November  1997,\r\n\r\nwhich have together stabilised Sino-Japan relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for US-Japan relations, the other side of the triangle,\r\n\r\nUnited  States-Japan relationship does continue  to  remain  the\r\n\r\nmost  stable among the regional powers.  Although there will  be\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time economic friction, both sides have shown that\r\n\r\nthey  can  continue  to cooperate closely, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the Security Alliance Understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Russia, we have to note that there have also been\r\n\r\nhigh profile exchanges of visits involving Russia.  For example,\r\n\r\nPresident  Yeltsin visited China in November,  Premier  Li  Peng\r\n\r\nvisited  Russia and Prime Minister Hashimoto visited  Russia  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1997.  We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntold  that  the  Summit between President Yeltsin and  President\r\n\r\nJiang is scheduled for later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the strategic triangle of United States, China and Japan\r\n\r\ncontinues, in our view, to be the foundation of stability in the\r\n\r\nAsia-Pacific region, I think Members will appreciate that it  is\r\n\r\nin  Singapore's interest to see that the three major powers  and\r\n\r\nplayers   are  constructively  engaged  and  their  relationship\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  This will ensure a stable and peaceful balance of\r\n\r\npower in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the other encouraging signs in the strategic\r\n\r\nenvironment?  They include the revision of the US-Japan  Defence\r\n\r\nGuidelines which has reaffirmed the United States' commitment to\r\n\r\nthe  security  in the region.  Second,, cross-straits  relations\r\n\r\nappear to have stabilised and with some positive signs that both\r\n\r\nsides  are preparing for the resumption of dialogue in the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.  Third, prospects in the Korean Peninsula appear to have\r\n\r\nimproved  with the DPRK agreeing to take part in the  Four-Party\r\n\r\ntalks.   The preliminary meeting was held in Geneva in  December\r\n\r\n1997 and is to be followed up by a second preliminary meeting in\r\n\r\nMarch   1998  in  Geneva.   Fourth,  in  the  South  China   Sea\r\n\r\nterritorial  disputes, always a cause of concern  in  the  sense\r\n\r\nthat  it is a potential flash point, we are glad that there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  escalation  of tensions since we last  discussed  that\r\n\r\nmatter  in  this House.  Fifth, I would add that the  successful\r\n\r\ndemarcation  of the Eastern China-Russia border declared  during\r\n\r\nPresident Yeltsin's visit in November 1997 is a factor that  has\r\n\r\nhelped the general stability in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung asked:</b> will the United States retain its\r\n\r\nstrategic and economic interest?  Will we continue to be helpful\r\n\r\nin  affording access to the United States?  I think we  can  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  United  States has historically played  an  important\r\n\r\nstrategic  role in Asia-Pacific, including Southeast Asia.   The\r\n\r\nUnited  States  also  has  an extensive  network  of  trade  and\r\n\r\ninvestment  linkages in the region.  We are confident  that  the\r\n\r\nUnited States will continue to remain engaged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  region.  I say so because, in our discussions with  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States'  leaders and their public  pronouncements,  they\r\n\r\nhave recently reiterated their strong commitment to the presence\r\n\r\nin  the region which, Dr Ong and other Members would have noted,\r\n\r\nalso  included  visits by key Cabinet members from  the  Clinton\r\n\r\nadministration, including Defence Secretary, William  Cohen  and\r\n\r\nCommerce  Secretary,  William Daley.  Singapore's  position  has\r\n\r\nalways  been to welcome and encourage United States' involvement\r\n\r\nand   presence  in  this  region.   Within  the  extent  of  our\r\n\r\nresources, Members also know that we have facilitated  this  and\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to do what we can to be helpful to the  United\r\n\r\nStates to maintain its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having painted this situation of positive factors in the\r\n\r\nbroad  strategic situation, let me hasten to add that we  cannot\r\n\r\nbe lulled into complacency.  The benign, even positive, security\r\n\r\nand  geo-political  environment can  deteriorate  very  quickly.\r\n\r\nWitness  what happened last year with the unforeseen  events  in\r\n\r\nCambodia.  The economic crisis which descended on the region  is\r\n\r\nanother strong reminder to flag this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how this will affect the political equilibrium in the\r\n\r\nregion,  a question which Dr Ong posed, I would say a lot  would\r\n\r\ndepend on how the Asian countries perceive the help rendered  by\r\n\r\nthe  western countries.  If the United States, the EU and  other\r\n\r\nplayers continue to be involved to assist in a positive way, and\r\n\r\nthe  region  is  able  to emerge through the  crisis,  and  they\r\n\r\nrecognise  the assistance and help and the signals of confidence\r\n\r\ngiven  by  these  countries, the political equilibrium  will,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  remain  unchanged.  Relations may  even  be  stronger.\r\n\r\nEveryone  will  benefit.  However, if they cannot  get  off  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  turmoil, and they conclude that the help given  by  the\r\n\r\nwest   is  inadequate  then,  of  course,  there  could   be   a\r\n\r\nreassessment  and perceptions may change.  But I would  say,  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  Dr Ong's specific question that things  are  still\r\n\r\nfluid,  and I would also say that it is too early to say whether\r\n\r\nthe political equilibrium will be affected.  At\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  day,  what is the lesson  to  be  learnt  for\r\n\r\nSingapore?  I would say the lesson for us is that we really have\r\n\r\nto be prepared for sudden strategic shifts.  As a small country,\r\n\r\nwe  will have to remain alert, nimble and sufficiently agile  to\r\n\r\nbe  able to adjust to changing trends and turbulent times in the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have your permission, Sir, I would now like to respond\r\n\r\nto Dr Ong Chit Chung's comments and questions on Cambodia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to his comments, I would say that since we last\r\n\r\ndiscussed in this House last year, the developments in  Cambodia\r\n\r\ninclude, firstly, progress in the preparations for the elections\r\n\r\nscheduled  in July this year; secondly, the return of opposition\r\n\r\nNational  Assembly  members  to  Cambodia;  and,  thirdly,   the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of ceasefire.  But here also the situation  remains\r\n\r\nrather fluid and unpredictable.  The ongoing disputes concerning\r\n\r\nthe  question of Prince Ranariddh remains unresolved.  This  may\r\n\r\ncast a shadow over efforts of the Cambodian government to create\r\n\r\nconditions  that  will be conducive to free and fair  elections.\r\n\r\nAnd  I think it remains to be seen whether the recent initiative\r\n\r\nof   Japan   would  be  successful  in  breaking  the   impasse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  ASEAN  and the international community  continue  to\r\n\r\ncall on the Cambodian government to ensure that all parties  and\r\n\r\npersonalities would be permitted to contest in the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, ASEAN has really tried sincerely to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  resurrection  of  political  stability   in\r\n\r\nCambodia  and,  more  recently,  because  nine  members  meeting\r\n\r\nfrequently  is  not  really practical, we have  established  the\r\n\r\nASEAN troika.  And through the troika we have been liaising with\r\n\r\nthe  Cambodian parties involved in the Cambodian  situation.   I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that Mr Hun Sen's sharp criticisms of  ASEAN  and  of\r\n\r\nindividual ASEAN countries have once again raised some questions\r\n\r\nabout his attitude and receptiveness on the role\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN.  For example, on 13th January 1998, he was quoted  in\r\n\r\nthe  Cambodian Daily as saying, and I quote, \"I am not a  member\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN.   I  need no troika delegation at all.   Please,  all\r\n\r\nASEAN countries, be aware of this.\"  In the same report, Mr  Hun\r\n\r\nSen  also referred to Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar in  rather\r\n\r\nunflattering  terms.  Such statements, to say  the  least,  have\r\n\r\npuzzled  some in ASEAN.  But despite these negative  statements,\r\n\r\nASEAN  continues  to uphold the principle that countries  should\r\n\r\nnot  bring  about a change of government through violent  means,\r\n\r\nand  the  policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs  of\r\n\r\nanother country is also upheld by ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The admission of Cambodia into ASEAN will therefore be\r\n\r\nconsidered only after free and fair elections are held and  when\r\n\r\ncircumstances in Cambodia enable the country to fully assume the\r\n\r\nrights and duties of ASEAN's membership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the conduct of free and fair elections this\r\n\r\nJuly in Cambodia, the UN has agreed, in principle, to coordinate\r\n\r\ninternational observers at the elections.  We in Singapore  have\r\n\r\nnot  received  any  formal  requests from  the  United  Nations,\r\n\r\nalthough  I  understand  it has informally  asked  a  number  of\r\n\r\ncountries,  including  ASEAN members,  to  contribute  electoral\r\n\r\nmonitors.   We  have  to  carefully  consider  whether  to  send\r\n\r\nelectoral monitors within our limited resources when the  UN  or\r\n\r\nthe Cambodian government makes an official request.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I respond now, Sir, to the comments made by Dr Ong and\r\n\r\nothers  on  the  Asia-Europe Meeting.  As Members  will  recall,\r\n\r\nbefore  the Asia-Europe I (ASEM I), Asia-Europe relations lacked\r\n\r\na  multilateral and regularly held forum.  There  was  only  the\r\n\r\nASEAN-EU   Dialogue.   ASEAN-EU  Dialogue  is  a   bloc-to-bloc,\r\n\r\norganisation to organisation dialogue.  And apart from  the  UN,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  other  forum  for Asian  and  European  heads  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  to  meet regularly, say, once in two  years.   Asia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM)  now affords the opportunity  for  these\r\n\r\nleaders  to meet and discuss issues of common concern.  ASEM  II\r\n\r\nmeeting in London, in the first week of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril,  will take place, as was pointed out, against a  backdrop\r\n\r\nof the financial crisis in Asia.  The EMU which is scheduled for\r\n\r\nimplementation in January 1999, and the eastward expansion, will\r\n\r\nabsorb  much  of EU's energies and attention for  some  time  to\r\n\r\ncome.   We know that.  ASEM II will have to discuss among  other\r\n\r\nissues  how we can devise ways and means to sustain and  advance\r\n\r\nthe  ASEM  process and to keep the Europeans interested  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess, and interested in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major issue, yes, is the financial crisis, and\r\n\r\nSingapore  hopes  that  ASEM II will  come  out  with  a  strong\r\n\r\nstatement  of  confidence in Asia's efforts  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.   We believe that Europe can  send  a  strong\r\n\r\npolitical  signal  to the rest of the world, a  signal  that  it\r\n\r\ncontinues to have confidence in Asia's economic potential and is\r\n\r\nready  to help with the financial crisis.  At the same time,  it\r\n\r\nis  also  in  the  interest of the affected Asian  countries  to\r\n\r\nreaffirm  their  commitment  to  implement  the  difficult   and\r\n\r\nnecessary reforms.  Through their engagement in ASEM, I  believe\r\n\r\nAsia and Europe can also send a strong message that despite each\r\n\r\nother's  internal preoccupations - Europe has its  preoccupation\r\n\r\nand  Asia  has  our  own preoccupations -  both  regions  remain\r\n\r\noutward looking and are strongly committed to multilateral trade\r\n\r\nand investment liberalisation.  I believe such a signal strongly\r\n\r\nsent would help to boost market confidence in the region and, in\r\n\r\nthat respect, I hope that European ASEM members will support the\r\n\r\nASEM  partners'  proposals  for  a  separate  statement  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  In fact, the Asian side has proposed  to  the\r\n\r\nEuropeans that instead of the normal Chairman's statement, which\r\n\r\nwill   be  issued,  there  ought  to  be  a  separate  statement\r\n\r\naddressing  only  the  financial  crisis.   We  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nEuropeans will agree to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to sustaining the ASEM process, we think it should be\r\n\r\nsustained  and  advanced.  Dr Ong Chit Chung asked  whether  all\r\n\r\nthis  flurry  of  activities  is a  passing  phenomenon  or  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of a fruitful relationship.  I believe that  the  ASEM\r\n\r\nprocess should be seen in the long term perspective.  And  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think it is a passing phenomenon.  Certainly from my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with Foreign Ministers on both sides,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nclear   appreciation  that  this  relationship  has   tremendous\r\n\r\npotential.   Apart from the leaders' meeting, the  ASEM  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters  have  met; the Finance Ministers have  met;  and  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Ministers  have also their  own  meetings.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  it has become a multi-faceted process, not just a  flash\r\n\r\nin  a  pan  meeting  of Heads of Government,  and  nothing  else\r\n\r\nhappens  in  two  years.  And Dr Ong Chit Chung will  know  that\r\n\r\nimportant   projects  have  emerged  such  as  the   Asia-Europe\r\n\r\nFoundation  which  has taken place.  The  process  is  not  just\r\n\r\nlimited to the politicians.  Because the private sector has also\r\n\r\nmet,  business forums have taken place.  Under ASEM, there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  meetings  of journalists and editors.  So it  cuts  across\r\n\r\nmany areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Dr Ong Chit Chung's questions as to whether\r\n\r\nthe  Europeans  are really interested, I have  no  doubt  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the Europeans are interested and continue  to  have  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in  a  meaningful role in Asia.  I  believe  they  are\r\n\r\ncommitted  to building the bilateral and multilateral  relations\r\n\r\nwith  Asia,  despite their preoccupation with internal  matters,\r\n\r\nlike  the  EMU,  EU expansion, unemployment, and other  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.  I think Europe still perceives Asia to be a region of\r\n\r\npotential, notwithstanding the financial crisis.  The Europeans'\r\n\r\ncommitment to ASEM, therefore, will be a clear manifestation  of\r\n\r\ntheir  interest  to  develop a mutually beneficial  relationship\r\n\r\nwith Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked by Mr Ravindran whether the financial crisis\r\n\r\nwill be given priority.  Indeed, I think the expectation on both\r\n\r\nsides  is, yes, it will have high priority.  As to whether other\r\n\r\nmatters  like environmental matters will be discussed, I believe\r\n\r\nit  is  also  on the agenda and is flagged as one of the  issues\r\n\r\nwhere Asia and Europe can cooperate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now would like your permission, Sir, to respond to Dr Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung's comments on the United Nations.  He is right  that\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  resources, on the part of Singapore,  limits  our\r\n\r\nrepresentations in many places in the world.  Our  participation\r\n\r\nin the UN, therefore, gives us an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity to have contact with and profile ourselves to  other\r\n\r\nparts of the world.  Together with our participation in the  UN,\r\n\r\nthe Group of 77, the Non-Aligned Group, it helps to maintain our\r\n\r\nlinks  with  many other countries, and it touches on the  points\r\n\r\nraised  by Mr Shriniwas Rai, with whom we do not have diplomatic\r\n\r\nmissions or consular missions in their countries or they do  not\r\n\r\nhave diplomatic missions in our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are a small country, we have been rather selective on\r\n\r\nthe  issues in which we have concentrated our efforts to profile\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a responsible member at the UN.  There are  issues\r\n\r\nin which we have selected on the basis of whether we can make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution in that particular topic.  The Law of the Sea is  a\r\n\r\nclear  example  of where we were able to contribute.   Not  much\r\n\r\npublicised, we also have our legal experts on organisations like\r\n\r\nUnited Nations' Commission of International Trade Law where they\r\n\r\nhave made a very good contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had asked: how do other countries think about us. I\r\n\r\nthink   it  would  be  rather  self-serving  for  me   to   make\r\n\r\ncomplimentary remarks about our own diplomats.  But let  me  say\r\n\r\nwith  some humility that over the past 30 years, because of hard\r\n\r\nwork and commitment put in by our excellent diplomats at the UN,\r\n\r\nwe   have  gained  a  certain  reputation  for  responsible  and\r\n\r\nconstructive contributions.  And I hope that we will be able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain that reputation at the UN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate our support for the UN, we have stepped up\r\n\r\nour involvement in activities which are consistent with our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterests  and  which will enable us to gain as  much  political\r\n\r\nmileage  as  possible.  For example, in May 1997, Singapore  was\r\n\r\none  of  a  handful of seven countries to sign a  Memorandum  of\r\n\r\nUnderstanding  with the United Nations on standby  arrangements.\r\n\r\nThis is the provision of observers, officers, medical personnel,\r\n\r\nas  well as helicopters and transport craft standby arrangement,\r\n\r\non  standby  for UN peacekeeping operations.  I think  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmodest contribution, but a contribution that is noted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also sent, as I said, high calibre delegates to the\r\n\r\nvarious   UN  committees.   Other  than  the  Law  of  the   Sea\r\n\r\nConference, we played a constructive leadership role in  the  UN\r\n\r\nConference  on Environment and Development, and we  continue  to\r\n\r\nplay a key role in ongoing discussions in the UN, such as on  UN\r\n\r\nreform,  particularly  on  the  expansion  of  the  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
