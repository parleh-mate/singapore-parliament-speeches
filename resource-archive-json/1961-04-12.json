Some such  action  is  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  there are some people who are  foolish  or\r\n\r\nmisguided  enough to say that this  Plan  has  been\r\n\r\nproduced  for  the  purpose of  the  Hong  Lim \r\n\r\nby-election. This is absolute nonsense. An undertaking\r\n\r\nof  this  magnitude requires months of  preparation\r\n\r\nand considerable amount of thought and judgment and\r\n\r\nmany tedious hours of grinding work on minutiae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, in fact, in October 1959, just over four\r\n\r\nmonths of the P.A.P.'s assumption to office, that a\r\n\r\ndecision  was  taken to prepare a Development  Plan\r\n\r\nfor the term of office of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, many months of labour had been\r\n\r\ndevoted  to  shaping out the multitude of  projects\r\n\r\nwhich  eventually found their way  into  the  Plan.\r\n\r\nSome  of these projects were then already available\r\n\r\nin  rough  form  in  the different  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nDepartments of the Government. But they had  to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  into a more definite stage  before  they\r\n\r\ncould  be  considered  fit  for  inclusion.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  not  only to have ideas about  what  new\r\n\r\nprojects  are desirable. In order to  have  a  Plan\r\n\r\nworthy of the name, it is necessary to work out the\r\n\r\nconsequences that follow from the implementation of\r\n\r\nsuch projects. There will be important matters such\r\n\r\nas  the  effect on future expenditure  and  revenue\r\n\r\nthat   must   be  fairly  closely  estimated.   The\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  economic  strength  of   the\r\n\r\ncountry  or to its social development must also  be\r\n\r\nproperly  assessed. The most important of  all,  an\r\n\r\nestimate  of  our financial and economic  resources\r\n\r\nmust be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for eight months, Ministries and Departments\r\n\r\nof   the   Government  worked  on  the  Plan.   The\r\n\r\npreliminary  draft  was finally completed  in  June\r\n\r\n1960.  It was approved in principle by the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nPublication  was  deferred,  however,  because   of\r\n\r\ncertain unknown factors, particularly the extent of\r\n\r\nfinancial aid that we can get from overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it was decided to defer publication\r\n\r\nof  the  Plan  until the outcome of  the  financial\r\n\r\ntalks  with the United Kingdom Government is  known\r\n\r\nand the attitude of the World Bank towards any loan\r\n\r\napplication from Singapore could be assessed with a\r\n\r\ngreater degree of certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I proceeded to the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nlast  July  and held discussions with  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Members already know  the  outcome  of\r\n\r\nthese  discussions. A certain amount of aid in  the\r\n\r\nform  of grants and Exchequer loans was negotiated.\r\n\r\nBut  they  only  covered the  period  1960-62.  The\r\n\r\nreason  was  that  the British system  of  overseas\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance  was  based  on  a   5-yearly\r\n\r\nbudget,  and it was not possible for them  to  make\r\n\r\nany commitment going beyond 1962. While uncertainty\r\n\r\nin  respect of British financial assistance had not\r\n\r\nbeen completely resolved, at least we knew what  we\r\n\r\ncould get the next two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My visit and discussions with the World Bank had\r\n\r\nproved fruitful in that the World Bank despatched a\r\n\r\nMission  last  September to make  a  study  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial standing of the Government, the soundness\r\n\r\nof  its  financial and economic policies,  and  the\r\n\r\nextent  to  which it is credit-worthy. The  Mission\r\n\r\ndespatched  by  the World Bank had completed  their\r\n\r\nreport.   They  had  forwarded,  as  a  matter   of\r\n\r\ncourtesy,  copies of their report to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. But it is not the practice of the World\r\n\r\nBank  to release the report for publication. I  am,\r\n\r\ntherefore, unable to divulge the contents  of  this\r\n\r\nreport, however pleasant such a task would be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can say that the World Bank is prepared to\r\n\r\nconsider loan operations in Singapore, and to  this\r\n\r\nend  they  would  despatch  a  further  Mission  to\r\n\r\nconsider  which  of the projects  included  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan could be financed by  World  Bank\r\n\r\nloans.  The  Mission will arrive in Singapore  next\r\n\r\nweek.  I am sure that Members will be heartened  by\r\n\r\nthe  willingness  of the World  Bank  to  negotiate\r\n\r\ndevelopment loans with the Government of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the details of the United Kingdom financial\r\n\r\nassistance were known and after there was  hope  of\r\n\r\ngetting World Bank loans, it was decided to  revise\r\n\r\nthe  original 5-Year Development Plan to take  into\r\n\r\naccount these matters. By that time, the best  part\r\n\r\nof 1960 had already passed and therefore it was, in\r\n\r\nthe  first instance, necessary to reduce  the  Plan\r\n\r\nperiod  from five years to four years. It was  also\r\n\r\nnecessary to make minor revisions to some projects.\r\n\r\nThe  technical  work of revision  is  an  extremely\r\n\r\nintricate  and  arduous one. And officials  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance who were responsible for making\r\n\r\nthe detailed and revised version deserve all credit\r\n\r\nfor  the  expeditious and thorough manner in  which\r\n\r\nthey carry out their work. And so it was that early\r\n\r\nthis  year,  proof  copies of the Development  Plan\r\n\r\nwere  sent to the Government Printer, who  accepted\r\n\r\nthis  work  on a priority basis. It was, therefore,\r\n\r\npossible  to present the Development Plan  for  the\r\n\r\napproval of this Assembly today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to be embroiled in the details\r\n\r\nof  the  Plan  itself. They are there in  published\r\n\r\nform for everyone to read. But I think I should set\r\n\r\nout  the  principal  lines along which  fundamental\r\n\r\nthinking on the Plan took.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, it was necessary to examine the\r\n\r\neconomic  structure of our country in some  detail,\r\n\r\nand  to  analyse the principal problems facing  us.\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows that the supreme challenge  is  to\r\n\r\nmatch our population growth with at least a similar\r\n\r\nrate  of  expansion to provide jobs for our growing\r\n\r\npopulation.  In Chapter I of the Plan, the  problem\r\n\r\nis  analysed lucidly and in detail, and I recommend\r\n\r\nall  those  who are concerned with the  affairs  of\r\n\r\nState  to  study  this chapter of  the  Development\r\n\r\nPlan.  It  makes  for  sober  reading.  It  is   an\r\n\r\nexcellent  antidote  to those  given  to  political\r\n\r\neuphoria  to be reminded of the stern and objective\r\n\r\nfacts of our economic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem then having been passed, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to develop a set of solutions. But  there\r\n\r\nis  an  intermediate stage. We must find  out  just\r\n\r\nwhat our sinews are; more simply, how much money do\r\n\r\nwe have in the kitty today. How much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  we can expect to have in the kitty tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWhere  the  contribution from our own resources  is\r\n\r\ninadequate,  how  much can we  get  from  overseas.\r\n\r\nHere, I may perhaps be permitted to digress for the\r\n\r\nmoment to answer some exceedingly foolish criticism\r\n\r\nof  the fact that we go overseas for financial aid.\r\n\r\nThere  is no developing country in the world  which\r\n\r\nspurns   overseas  aid,  be  the  country  in   the\r\n\r\nCommunist world or in the non-communist world. What\r\n\r\nwe  have to ensure is that the aid which we receive\r\n\r\nis  consistent  with our self-respect  as  a \r\n\r\nself-governing  people, that is to say, that no  strings\r\n\r\nare  attached  to  this aid  that  go  against  the\r\n\r\npolicies which we ourselves favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appraisal of our domestic resources is made in\r\n\r\nChapters  III,  IV  and V of the Plan.  Chapter  II\r\n\r\nreviews the past performance of Government finances\r\n\r\nand  Chapter IV attempts a forecast of revenue  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  the Plan period. Those  forecasts\r\n\r\nare  as  close as we can make them, but in an  open\r\n\r\neconomy  such  as  ours,  we  are  exposed  to  the\r\n\r\nfluctuations of world trade generated  abroad.  The\r\n\r\nforecasts  of  revenue are based on the  assumption\r\n\r\nthat no significant recession in trade develops  in\r\n\r\nthe World economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate of our total resources available for\r\n\r\nfinancing the Plan shows that most of the money  we\r\n\r\nneed must come from our own pockets. Out of a total\r\n\r\nneed  of  $871  million, no less than $591  million\r\n\r\nmust  be provided by our own people. These domestic\r\n\r\nsources  of finance fall into three groups.  First,\r\n\r\nthe projected revenue surpluses of $116 million for\r\n\r\nthe  next  four years. Then, there are the  Reserve\r\n\r\nFunds   in  the  Government  and  Statutory  Boards\r\n\r\namounting  to $149 million. Finally, we shall  have\r\n\r\nto float loans in the Singapore market amounting to\r\n\r\n$230 million in the next four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External assistance has been set down at $280\r\n\r\nmillion  or  some  32  per cent.  This  is  not  an\r\n\r\nexcessive amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan itself as summarized in Chapter III\r\n\r\nenvisages a total capital expenditure by Government\r\n\r\nand   Public  Authorities  of  an  amount  of  $871\r\n\r\nmillion. Of this, $508 million contributes towards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrengthening our economy in one way or the  other.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to  say, more than half of  our  proposed\r\n\r\ninvestment  programme  in  the  public  sector   is\r\n\r\nintended  to  increase our economic  strength.  The\r\n\r\nbalance goes principally to social development,  of\r\n\r\nwhich by far the largest item is to house the\r\n\r\nover-crowded  citizens of Singapore. Housing Development\r\n\r\nis  expected to use $154 million in the  next  four\r\n\r\nyears.  The  programme now prepared by the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board will run into 1965 when they\r\n\r\nexpect  to build 51,000 houses at a cost of  nearly\r\n\r\n$200  million.  This  is  an  all-time  record  for\r\n\r\nSingapore and, indeed, I suspect, in the  whole  of\r\n\r\nAsia  there  is no housing project so comprehensive\r\n\r\nas the one we are undertaking, if we relate it to a\r\n\r\npopulation basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education takes a tremendous slice of our Social\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Programme, and nobody can regret  that\r\n\r\nwe  have to do so. What is regrettable is that  the\r\n\r\nparents of Singapore in the last 16 years had  been\r\n\r\nso  prolific in their capacity as parents that they\r\n\r\nhave  created  for the whole country a  problem  of\r\n\r\nalmost terrifying dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to discuss the other contents of\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Plan. I have no  doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  concerned  will have  to  say  something\r\n\r\nabout their own development proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take a broader perspective and set out\r\n\r\nthe methods whereby we can overcome these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need hardly mention that the problem we have to\r\n\r\nsolve  is  how to create more jobs for our  growing\r\n\r\npopulation. This has been repeated ad nauseam. I do\r\n\r\nnot   want  to  say  further  except  to  pose  the\r\n\r\nmagnitude  of the problem. Reduced to the  simplest\r\n\r\nterms, by 1964, we shall have to create 84,000  new\r\n\r\njobs.  How do we get about it? What must we  do  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  country a fair chance of creating  these\r\n\r\nnew jobs? What must we refrain from doing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important that everyone understands\r\n\r\nthe   answers   to   these  three  questions.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment alone is not the sole dispenser of jobs.\r\n\r\nBy our own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefforts,  we cannot solve the problem of increasing\r\n\r\nunemployment unless the people themselves and their\r\n\r\nleaders in their respective spheres of activity, be\r\n\r\nthey  the  labour unions, the entrepot  trade,  the\r\n\r\nindustrial concerns - unless as I said the people and\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  are  prepared to observe  a  code  of\r\n\r\nconduct  that  amounts almost to a code  of  social\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  Unless these things are done,  then  I\r\n\r\nsay  that the Government, by its own efforts,  will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to solve the grave problems ahead.  To\r\n\r\nthis  end,  therefore, we cannot neglect  to  drive\r\n\r\nhome to the people of Singapore the seriousness  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation and the self-control that they  must\r\n\r\nexercise if we are to see this country through  the\r\n\r\ndifficult period ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the solution to our problem is a\r\n\r\nsimple  one.  You  want to create more  jobs.  Your\r\n\r\ntrade in which you depend for your livelihood to  a\r\n\r\ngreat  extent will not increase all that fast.  You\r\n\r\ntherefore industrialise, that is to say, you  build\r\n\r\nnew  factories, thereby giving jobs to your growing\r\n\r\npopulation. That is the theoretical answer. In  its\r\n\r\npractical implementation, however, many snags arise\r\n\r\nand  many bugs have to be ironed out. It is in  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  ironing out the bugs and  overcoming  the\r\n\r\nsnags that a major concerted effort must be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me discuss some of the major problems of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. The first is  that  to  have  to\r\n\r\nbuild  factories we must have the people  who  know\r\n\r\nwhat factories to build and how to build them;  and\r\n\r\nhaving   built   them,  know  how   to   run   them\r\n\r\nefficiently.  This  is an incontrovertible,  indeed\r\n\r\nself-evident, proposition and yet very  few  people\r\n\r\nare aware of the fact that this is one of our major\r\n\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sources of difficulty are many. Our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen are conversant in trade. They have less\r\n\r\nexperience  in  manufacturing.  Where   there   are\r\n\r\nopportunities,  no  doubt eventually  someone  will\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of it. But what we need  now  is  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  accelerated  industrialisation  fast\r\n\r\nenough  to  mop  up our pool of unemployed  and  to\r\n\r\nabsorb  the  young people who will be  looking  for\r\n\r\nwork  in the years to come. The scale of the effort\r\n\r\nthat must be mounted is something that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  unprecedented  in  the  history  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  special measures have to  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nmake   possible  industrialisation  at   the   rate\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain things are necessary for rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  We  must  have  factory  sites,\r\n\r\nsupplies of power, water, roads, communications and\r\n\r\nport  facilities. These are being provided  for  in\r\n\r\nthe  Plan.  But  the industrial estates  you  build\r\n\r\nwould  be  a sheer waste of money unless  you  know\r\n\r\nthat industrialists are willing to set up factories\r\n\r\non your estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local industrialists will be encouraged to\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  extent  to take  advantage  of  these\r\n\r\nopportunities. But in the first phase, at any rate,\r\n\r\nit  is  certain that we shall require manufacturers\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad to invest in industries in  Singapore,\r\n\r\neither by themselves or in participation with local\r\n\r\nindustrialists. But no manufacturer from abroad has\r\n\r\nany  obligation  to Singapore to set  up  factories\r\n\r\nhere.  They  will consider investment in  Singapore\r\n\r\nonly if they see that it is profitable to do so not\r\n\r\nonly immediately, but over a number of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, vital for our survival that we\r\n\r\nmade  the  conditions  attractive.  There  are  the\r\n\r\neconomic  inducements such as the Pioneer  Industry\r\n\r\nLegislation  which exempts certain  new  industries\r\n\r\nfrom payment of income tax for up to five years. We\r\n\r\ncan create favourable conditions for new industries\r\n\r\nif  we  are prepared to set up import duties, which\r\n\r\nmust   have  the  effect  of  raising  prices   and\r\n\r\nincreasing the cost of living. We may try to extend\r\n\r\nour  overseas  markets by various  kinds  of  trade\r\n\r\nagreements with our neighbours. These all  help  to\r\n\r\nmake investment in Singapore attractive both to the\r\n\r\ndomestic as well as the overseas manufacturer.  But\r\n\r\nmore  important than these matters is to  create  a\r\n\r\nclimate  of  economic stability and  confidence  so\r\n\r\nthat  people  who  make  the decisions  whether  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  Singapore or not know for certain  that\r\n\r\nthe calculations which they now make have a reasonable   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchance  of  fulfilment.  One  of  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant elements in this climate of confidence is\r\n\r\nstability in labour-management relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility for maintaining good\r\n\r\nlabour-management relations rests not merely with  labour,\r\n\r\nnot  merely  with management; nor is it the  entire\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government. It  is  necessary\r\n\r\nto have all three parties working towards an agreed\r\n\r\nobjective  and  agreeing also on the means  whereby\r\n\r\ninevitable differences must be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have already known by now the\r\n\r\ngeneral form of agreement which the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. have come to. We have  demarcated  the\r\n\r\nsphere  of  the  economy consisting  of  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises which have a significant export market.\r\n\r\nIn  this  sphere  of the economy,  the  T.U.C. has\r\n\r\naccepted  that  stability in wages is  a  desirable\r\n\r\nobjective  to  attain and they will  do  everything\r\n\r\nthat is possible to contribute to such stability. I\r\n\r\nthink  this is a significant advance in  our  quest\r\n\r\nfor industrial peace with justice which is the only\r\n\r\nbase on which we can build economic stability and a\r\n\r\nclimate of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contribution of the Trade Union movement can\r\n\r\nbe  a valuable one. I think it will be welcomed  by\r\n\r\neveryone who has Singapore's interest at heart. But\r\n\r\nmay  I  say to the employers that it is not without\r\n\r\ndifficulty  that we have persuaded the Trade  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  to  this  working arrangement?  I  expect\r\n\r\nemployers  to respond to this effort of the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nwith   an   equally  understanding   and   generous\r\n\r\nattitude.  It would be a disaster if the  employers\r\n\r\nwere  to  regard this as a signal whereby they  can\r\n\r\nmount an offensive against the workers or the Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  movement.  Any action to take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nunion restraint by provocative action would be  met\r\n\r\nwith  stern  disapproval by the P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nBut if the employers were to respond generously  to\r\n\r\nthe T.U.C.'s policy, then I think we have the basis\r\n\r\non  which  to  build  up  better  labour-management\r\n\r\nrelations  so  that the benefits from this  through\r\n\r\nimproved  productivity can  be  shared  in  a  just\r\n\r\nmanner between capital and labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not regard the agreement whose outline has\r\n\r\nbeen  published today to be the first and last step\r\n\r\nin   our   quest   to   improve   labour-management\r\n\r\nrelations.  The general proposals will have  to  be\r\n\r\nexamined  in  further  detail  so  as  to   produce\r\n\r\nconcrete working rules. But this I wish to  say  of\r\n\r\nthe   trade   union  leaders  with  whom   I   held\r\n\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fully aware of the challenge to the\r\n\r\neconomy  in  general  and  to  the  working   class\r\n\r\nmovement  in  particular that is posed by  mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment.   They  are   also   aware   of   the\r\n\r\nlimitations as regards the means that we can use in\r\n\r\nthe   present   phase   of   Singapore's   historic\r\n\r\ndevelopment to meet these problems. But  they  find\r\n\r\nthemselves in a dilemma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Union movement in Singapore has always\r\n\r\nbeen   a   militant  one.  Aggressive  policy   and\r\n\r\naggressive tactics were necessary in the  past  not\r\n\r\nmerely  because the employers were fully  supported\r\n\r\nby   the  instruments  of  State  power  under  the\r\n\r\ncolonial regime. The Trade Union movement also  had\r\n\r\nto lend its strength to the anti-colonial struggle.\r\n\r\nFurther, a large section of the movement, which  is\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  Chinese working  class,  draws  its\r\n\r\nideological inspiration from revolutionary Marxism.\r\n\r\nA  number  of  union cadres are  being  trained  to\r\n\r\nanalyse the problems they meet in terms of\r\n\r\nMarxist-Leninist concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention here to enter into a\r\n\r\nphilosophic  discourse on the merits  or  even  the\r\n\r\nrelevance  of  these revolutionary  tenets  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of our Island State. All I want to  say  is\r\n\r\nthat, this being the case, the top level leadership\r\n\r\nof the Trade Union movement will need to explain to\r\n\r\nthe  leadership at lower levels and to the rank and\r\n\r\nfile,  the  nature  of  the  changed  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For myself, I think their readiness  to\r\n\r\ndeclare themselves in favour of wage stability as a\r\n\r\ngeneral  condition of our manufacturing  industries\r\n\r\nshows  not  only  a realistic acceptance  of  harsh\r\n\r\nreality,  but  it  also shows a welcome  degree  of\r\n\r\npolitical courage. The Government is aware  of  the\r\n\r\nmany  traps and pitfalls that still lie  ahead  for\r\n\r\nboth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  unions  and  for ourselves. But  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why, if all parties concerned are  prepared\r\n\r\nsincerely  to work towards the objective  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen agreed upon, success cannot be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent some time dwelling on the\r\n\r\nprerequisites   for  successful  industrialisation.\r\n\r\nbecause  the  principal purpose of the  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  is to make possible private investment,  both\r\n\r\nfrom  domestic  and external sources,  on  a  scale\r\n\r\nmassive enough to provide the additional jobs  that\r\n\r\nwe need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from improving labour-management relations,\r\n\r\nthere  are other matters needing attention.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the Government actively to encourage\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of new industries.  I  think  a\r\n\r\nreview  of  our past efforts and future  intentions\r\n\r\nwill be appropriate here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done in this field has been\r\n\r\nprincipally in the way of building up a preparatory\r\n\r\norganisation  and doing the basic  researches  that\r\n\r\nare  necessary.  We  have been  fortunate  to  have\r\n\r\nreceived a tremendous amount of assistance from the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations. They have been extremely  generous\r\n\r\nand   helpful   in  the  supply  of   experts   and\r\n\r\ntechnicians.  The Industrial Survey Mission  headed\r\n\r\nby  Dr Winsemius arrived in Singapore last October\r\n\r\nand  a follow-up team to complete their work is now\r\n\r\narriving in Singapore. The team consists of experts\r\n\r\nin   various   branches  of  industry-shipbuilding,\r\n\r\nchemical  engineering, electrical goods, metal  and\r\n\r\nengineering industries. These experts have prepared\r\n\r\nor  are  in  the  process of  completing  technical\r\n\r\nreports  on  what industries can be established  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in their respective fields, having regard\r\n\r\nto  both  the  economic and technical  limitations.\r\n\r\nThere  is also a powerful team of steel experts  in\r\n\r\nSingapore    under    the   leadership    of    Mr\r\n\r\nSchereschewsky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These technical reports on investment\r\n\r\npossibilities  which  are prepared  by  top-ranking\r\n\r\nworld experts would be of invaluable assistance  to\r\n\r\nus  in  our effort to promote the establishment  of\r\n\r\nnew industries. Industrialisation has often\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  taken as a vague concept. What is needed here\r\n\r\nis  less general talk on industrialisation and more\r\n\r\nconcrete ideas on exactly what type of factories we\r\n\r\ncan  establish in Singapore and how  it  is  to  he\r\n\r\ndone.  Such ideas can only be developed  by  people\r\n\r\nwho   have  experience  in  particular  industries.\r\n\r\nWithout their concrete proposals, we shall still be\r\n\r\nin the stage of vague generalisations, out of which\r\n\r\nthe  bricks  and  mortar and machines  of  industry\r\n\r\ncannot  be  created. The United Nations  Steel  and\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Missions  study  particular  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  in  their opinion are feasible in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand this will give us something to work on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work itself will be carried out by the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board. I have mentioned to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  on a previous occasion that  we  have  at\r\n\r\nlast found suitable top personnel to man the Board.\r\n\r\nThey will be ready for work in six weeks' time when\r\n\r\nthe  Director  and important engineering  personnel\r\n\r\nwill  have  arrived  in  Singapore.  The  work   of\r\n\r\ndrafting   the   Bill  establishing  the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  is proceeding  and  I  hope  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  Bill at the next  session  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have achieved some success in\r\n\r\nestablishing new industries in Singapore, the major\r\n\r\neffort  has yet to be mounted. After two  years  of\r\n\r\narduous  work  and with the generous assistance  of\r\n\r\nthe United Nations technical assistance, we have at\r\n\r\nlast  reached  a  stage where  we  can  mount  this\r\n\r\neffort.  But  let no one be deceived into  thinking\r\n\r\nthat   once  the  Economic  Development  Board   is\r\n\r\nestablished  and technical reports  digested,  then\r\n\r\nfactories  will  mushroom  all  over  the  face  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  overnight.  This  simply  cannot  happen\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  large amount of preparatory  work\r\n\r\nthat must be put in before the factories themselves\r\n\r\nappear.  It must take some time to achieve pace  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Given the most favourable  conditions,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  some years before we  get  into  full\r\n\r\nstride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the problem of mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment can hardly be set aside  to  wait  the\r\n\r\nfruition  of our effort on the long-term programme.\r\n\r\nThe  U.N. Industrial Mission is fully aware of this\r\n\r\nand  has  recommend that over the next few years  a\r\n\r\ncrash    programme   to   create   new   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities be carried out. It has  selected  two\r\n\r\nareas  where  the  creation of  employment  can  be\r\n\r\naccelerated  in  a short space of time.  These  are\r\n\r\nemployment    on   board   ships    belonging    to\r\n\r\ninternational  lines making use of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nport  of call, and, secondly, the expansion of  our\r\n\r\nship breaking industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters of immediate importance, and I\r\n\r\nmay  perhaps  be  permitted to dwell  on  them.  As\r\n\r\nregards  employment on board ships, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  held discussions with the principal shipowners\r\n\r\nand   has   proposed,   for  their   consideration,\r\n\r\nmodifications in the present system of registration\r\n\r\nof  seamen  for  employment on ships.  The  present\r\n\r\nsystem  has the disadvantage of being unduly  rigid\r\n\r\nand  automatic  in  its application.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nchoice  allowed  either to the  seamen  or  to  the\r\n\r\nshipowner as regards the placing of seamen. It was,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  proposed  that  Company  Registers   be\r\n\r\nintroduced  whereby some choice is  made  available\r\n\r\nboth  to  the shipowner and to the seamen.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame    time,   training   facilities   have   been\r\n\r\nestablished  to  increase  the  attractiveness   of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a port of recruitment for seamen. With\r\n\r\nthe  co-operation  of  one of the  larger  shipping\r\n\r\nlines, training courses for saloon workers on ships\r\n\r\nwill  commence this month. The Polytechnic has also\r\n\r\nintroduced  courses  for  marine  engineers,   deck\r\n\r\nofficers  and  wireless operators. Shipping  lines,\r\n\r\nboth local and international, have agreed to employ\r\n\r\nthe  graduates.  By these, and other  measures,  we\r\n\r\nhope   to  increase  the  rate  of  employment   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  seamen on board local and  international\r\n\r\nlines.  Recent  figures have shown  a  welcome  and\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase. The figure for last  month's\r\n\r\nrecruitment  saw  a  50 per cent  increase  on  the\r\n\r\nmonthly average of the previous year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the attractiveness of the port of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  shipping lines, the  Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to introduce round-the-clock port services\r\n\r\nwhich  the shipping lines had asked for. Staff  for\r\n\r\nthe Immigration and Health Departments will have to\r\n\r\nbe  increased  to  provide the additional  services\r\n\r\nwhich  we  hope to introduce by the middle  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be interested to know that these\r\n\r\nmeasures  have been worked out in consultation  not\r\n\r\nonly  with the shipowners, but also with the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress.  This  is  an  example  where \r\n\r\nco-operation  between  Government,  the  Trade   Union\r\n\r\nmovement  and  employers  can  produce  substantial\r\n\r\nbenefits to everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards ship-breaking, our experience has been\r\n\r\nless  happy.  I  held a meeting  with  local  firms\r\n\r\nengaged  in  ship-breaking  and  offered  them  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  facilities and inducement by way of  land,\r\n\r\nsupply  of working capital, assistance in  training\r\n\r\nif  they  would  work  out  a  programme  of  rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion.  Unfortunately,  our  shipbreakers   are\r\n\r\nlimited  in their technical and financial capacity.\r\n\r\nThey  also  lack  the vision that is  necessary  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping an extensive industry which can  compete\r\n\r\nin  the  international market. Accordingly, I  have\r\n\r\ngot  in touch with ship-breaking firms overseas and\r\n\r\nam in the process of discussing with them the terms\r\n\r\nunder  which they could operate in Singapore.\r\n\r\nShip-breaking  is  an  ideal  industry  for  mopping  up\r\n\r\nunemployment, because it employs large  numbers  of\r\n\r\npeople, requires a relatively small amount of fixed\r\n\r\ncapital, and has a ready market for its product.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore feel justified to offer to these overseas\r\n\r\nshipbreakers  extremely favourable terms.  Briefly,\r\n\r\nthese  include  the  supply of working  capital  at\r\n\r\nrates  well below commercial rates. Good land  will\r\n\r\nbe  made  available to them and the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared to bear a substantial part of the cost  of\r\n\r\ntraining  of  workers. They can also be  considered\r\n\r\nfor pioneer industry status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to say something about the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Development Plan is to be  implemented.\r\n\r\nFirst,  of course, we must make sure that  we  have\r\n\r\nthe  money  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  the  Plan:\r\n\r\nestimates   and  forecast  of  revenue   and   loan\r\n\r\npossibilities have been made in the  Plan  and,  if\r\n\r\nthese  are realised, then the financial bottlenecks\r\n\r\nto  the implementation of the Plan would have  been\r\n\r\nsolved. What remains to be done then is to gear  up\r\n\r\nour  administrative  machinery  and  our  corps  of\r\n\r\nengineers, architects and other technicians to  the\r\n\r\nphysical effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that no obstacle is created by\r\n\r\nway  of administrative delays, a reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe   Finance   Ministry   has   been   undertaken.\r\n\r\nDevelopment  proposals will no longer be  processed\r\n\r\nby  Treasury officials as they had been done in the\r\n\r\npast.  Treasury  officials have been  trained,  and\r\n\r\nquite rightly, to regard every application for  new\r\n\r\nexpenditure  with the gravest suspicion.  Obviously\r\n\r\nif  financial approval for development  expenditure\r\n\r\nhas to be processed in this manner, it is likely to\r\n\r\nresult  in  interminable  correspondence  and  even\r\n\r\nacrimonious   disputes.  Some   new   system   must\r\n\r\ntherefore be introduced. We have now established an\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Committee consisting  of  both\r\n\r\nMinisters and senior Government officials. I myself\r\n\r\nas  Finance Minister am Chairman of this  Committee\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister  for National Development  is  a\r\n\r\npermanent   ministerial  member.  Ministers   whose\r\n\r\ndevelopment  proposals are under  examination  will\r\n\r\nattend  as  members  of  the  Development  Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee. The officials will include the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Public Works, the Permanent Secretary (Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment),  and  Assistant  Secretaries  of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Secretariat  which  has   also   been\r\n\r\nrecently set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Secretariat will be a new branch\r\n\r\nof the Finance Ministry. It will concern itself not\r\n\r\nonly  with  the  routine processing of  development\r\n\r\nproposals but also with the checking up of progress\r\n\r\non  the implementation of development projects.  It\r\n\r\nwould,  therefore,  serve as  a  central  reporting\r\n\r\nsystem on the progress made in all fields of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan. The Development Secretariat  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  able to alert the Government  should\r\n\r\nany project lag behind its performance programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Committee will be\r\n\r\nconcerned with matters of policy and priorities. No\r\n\r\nproject   will   be  proceeded  with   unless   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Committee has given its clearance. This\r\n\r\nclearance,   however,   is  subject   to   detailed\r\n\r\nexamination  by a Committee of permanent  officials\r\n\r\nwith  the Director of Public Works as the Chairman.\r\n\r\nThis Committee is known as the Economic Development\r\n\r\nSub-Committee  and will replace the present  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Standing Committee. In order to emphasise the\r\n\r\nperformance aspect of planning implementation,  the\r\n\r\nDirector   of  Public  Works  has  been   appointed\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Committee in place of the Treasury\r\n\r\nofficial  who  took the chair of the former  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Standing Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the administrative changes which are\r\n\r\nnecessary to cut out red tape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided also to strengthen the staff of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Works Department and have  applied  to\r\n\r\nfive countries for assistance in the recruitment of\r\n\r\nengineers, architects, quantity surveyors and other\r\n\r\ngrades  of professional technicians. The number  of\r\n\r\nadditional staff at professional level we now  need\r\n\r\nis  52.  The countries we have approached  are  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan  and\r\n\r\nIsrael.   The  overseas  staff  will  be  recruited\r\n\r\nagainst  supernumerary posts: that is to say,  they\r\n\r\nwill    not   be   held   against   the   permanent\r\n\r\nestablishment  which we reserve as promotion  posts\r\n\r\nfor  our  junior engineers. The Director of  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  has  also been asked to draw up  his  future\r\n\r\nstaff  needs to enable him to cope with the greatly\r\n\r\nenhanced volume of work that the Plan calls for. He\r\n\r\nis  also starting a departmental training scheme to\r\n\r\ntrain junior technical staff in various branches of\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards current performance, I will leave it\r\n\r\nto   the  Ministers  concerned  to  report  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  the progress now being achieved.  I  only\r\n\r\nneed refer to a statement made by Mr Ong Eng Guan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   a  Hong  Lim  by-election  meeting  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment had done nothing beyond building some 26\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. He is reported to have said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  building  no  schools  and  no\r\n\r\nhouses.  This is a calculated and blatant falsehood\r\n\r\nso  characteristic of the former  Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim. I await with interest to see whether his  two\r\n\r\ncompanions  still in the Assembly will be  prepared\r\n\r\nto repeat this outrageous lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval we are seeking in the Assembly or\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Plan does not  mean  approval  in\r\n\r\ndetail  of  each and every item of the  Plan  as  a\r\n\r\nfixed  and  permanent project to  be  carried  out\r\n\r\nduring  the Plan period. As has been emphasised  in\r\n\r\nthe  text  of the Plan itself, there must  be  some\r\n\r\nflexibility in implementation. It may be  necessary\r\n\r\nto  re-examine some projects. It will certainly  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  revise the cost  of  those  projects\r\n\r\nwhose   detailed  planning  had   not   reached   a\r\n\r\nconclusive stage. These amendments to the Plan,  as\r\n\r\nand  when they are made and decided upon,  will  be\r\n\r\nreported  to  the Assembly for its  approval.  The\r\n\r\nmost convenient occasion for such reports would,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  be  the Budget session. Where new  projects\r\n\r\nare  introduced  and  have  to  be  proceeded  with\r\n\r\nwithout;  further delay, then the approval  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  will  be  sought  in  the  normal  manner\r\n\r\nthrough Supplementary Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlast  year, on 30th May, 1960, before the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  went  to the United  States  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited  kingdom to seek loans, I read in the  Press\r\n\r\nabout  a  so-called  Five-Year  Plan.  Very  little\r\n\r\ndetails  were given. Although I was an  Assemblyman\r\n\r\nin the Government, it was the first time I heard of\r\n\r\nsuch  a Plan. There had never been any discussions.\r\n\r\nThat was nearly a year ago. During this long period\r\n\r\nof time, the people never heard anything of this \r\n\r\nso-called  Plan.  Why  was it never published  before?\r\n\r\nWere the authors of this so-called Plan ashamed  of\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at the height of the Hong Lim\r\n\r\nby-election, when the Government is facing the people,\r\n\r\nthe  Five-Year Plan is reduced to a Four-Year  Plan\r\n\r\nand  published. What is the difference between this\r\n\r\nFour-Year  Plan  and the Five-Year  Plan  announced\r\n\r\nnearly  a  year  ago?  The Finance  Minister  then\r\n\r\nannounced - Sir, I would like to refer to  a  cutting\r\n\r\nfrom  the Straits Times dated 30th May, 1960, since\r\n\r\nI do not have the full paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are many other things in the Development\r\n\r\nPlan to be published in a few months' time.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>it  was  never published. Now in the midst  of  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election, we have a new Four-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the course of the last\r\n\r\n22  months,  I  have heard of too  many  plans  and\r\n\r\nbeautiful speeches, but, unfortunately, I have  yet\r\n\r\nto see one Plan implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at this pamphlet published by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture.  It is  called  \"A  Year  of\r\n\r\nConstruction\" based on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nSpeech in June 1960:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`June 1960 to June 1961 will be called a year of\r\n\r\nconstruction,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But,  Sir, construct what? It is now already  April\r\n\r\n1961. Only community centres, as far as I can  see!\r\n\r\nWe  will  support  any plan aimed  at  helping  the\r\n\r\npeople, but such plans should be elastic and should\r\n\r\nbe   meant   for   implementation  and   not   just\r\n\r\nelectioneering stunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope this Government is sincere and honest by\r\n\r\nletting the people know the truth. Show the  people\r\n\r\nsomething, and not just talk. Twenty-two months  is\r\n\r\nnot too short a period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 13 City Councillors did more\r\n\r\nwork  in 15 months than this Government with a  big\r\n\r\nmajority has done in 22 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. I feel it is necessary for me\r\n\r\nto say a few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. came into power, it has shown\r\n\r\nthat  it has an energetic programme. It has exerted\r\n\r\nits utmost to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotect  the livelihood of the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to  resolve all the problems facing  them.  We\r\n\r\nhave a very bright future. We say clearly that  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party is more progressive than  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government.  We are  confident  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  fully support the Plan,  because  its\r\n\r\nsuccess  concerns the livelihood of the  people.  I\r\n\r\nhope the people will be able to understand and  not\r\n\r\nto  construe this Development Plan as a panacea for\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of  ills.  They  must  not  think  that\r\n\r\neverything  can be solved by the Plan  alone.  This\r\n\r\nPlan,  if  it  is  to succeed, will  only  help  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  our unemployment problem.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  period  of this Development  Plan  all\r\n\r\nsigns  of  the colonial era will be wiped  out.  We\r\n\r\nmust   know  that  difficulties  lie  ahead.   Many\r\n\r\ncountries   are   facing  many  serious   problems,\r\n\r\nespecially unemployment. I wish to point  out  that\r\n\r\neven   America   is  facing  serious   unemployment\r\n\r\nproblems.    Therefore,    in    comparison,    the\r\n\r\nunemployment  figures in those  countries  are  not\r\n\r\nless  than ours, but they find themselves in a more\r\n\r\nadvantageous   position  because  they   are   more\r\n\r\nindustrialised  and  they  have  more   scope   for\r\n\r\nexpanding   their   industries.   Moreover,   their\r\n\r\ncolonies are able to give them economic support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the people can understand that our\r\n\r\nFour-Year  Plan  cannot solve every question  and  every\r\n\r\nproblem immediately. We must know that the problems\r\n\r\nof  unemployment  and instability in  commerce  and\r\n\r\nother  fields  are  natural. And  this  colonialist\r\n\r\nclique   is   making  things  difficult   for   us.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the difficulties which we have  to  face\r\n\r\nare  unavoidable. We must not say that we can solve\r\n\r\nevery problem just by carrying out this Development\r\n\r\nPlan.  So  if the people hope to achieve a  happier\r\n\r\nfuture,  they  must unite together in the  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst the colonial economic system in Malaya  and\r\n\r\nalso  create new conditions favourable to a  merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and the Federation  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThis merger will basically solve difficult problems\r\n\r\nin our livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will also point out that the\r\n\r\nreactionaries  in our country are usually  inimical\r\n\r\nto us. They criticise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  Government with ill intentions.  Not  only  do\r\n\r\nthey not encourage efforts towards a good end,  but\r\n\r\nthey  also  unscrupulously spread rumours attacking\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. They use this tactic in order to divide\r\n\r\nthe people. They say that the P.A.P., since forming\r\n\r\nthe Government two years ago, has not done any good\r\n\r\nwork. These are all lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now a Member on the opposite Bench said that\r\n\r\nour present Plan was introduced because of the Hong\r\n\r\nLim  by-election. This is not correct. Let me  show\r\n\r\nhim whether our Government has done anything or not\r\n\r\nin  these  two years. I must point out a few  facts\r\n\r\nhere in order to show that these reactionaries  are\r\n\r\nonly rumour-mongers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of the people's representative\r\n\r\nin  my constituency during the four years under the\r\n\r\npresent  Government  cannot be compared  with  ours\r\n\r\nduring  the past 22 months. The previous Government\r\n\r\nbuilt  only  four rural roads and one of  them  was\r\n\r\nbuilt only when the elections were approaching. But\r\n\r\nwe  have  in  the short period of 22  months  built\r\n\r\nfour,  rural roads. Another road has been  approved\r\n\r\nand  will  be laid by the Urban and Rural  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee. As for other public and social  services\r\n\r\nsuch as standpipes and so on, they will be provided\r\n\r\nin  the  near future. Our achievements  far  exceed\r\n\r\nthose of the last Government. All these facts  show\r\n\r\nthat  they  are part of our programme which  is  of\r\n\r\nconcrete  benefit. Of course, we are not  satisfied\r\n\r\nyet  with all these achievements but will endeavour\r\n\r\nstill further to serve the people well with all our\r\n\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we say that our Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan is not brought out just for the purpose of the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  by-election. Anyone who is irresponsible\r\n\r\nenough  to say that the introduction of this  \r\n\r\nFour-Year  Plan  is for any political purpose is  wrong.\r\n\r\nThe  introduction of this Plan is for the  good  of\r\n\r\nthe  people;  to  solve  the  problems  facing  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We  must  execute the Plan,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nimportant. Therefore, we have brought out this\r\n\r\nFour-Year  Development Plan. If some of the  people  are\r\n\r\nbiased and attack this Four-Year Plan,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are unreasonable and wrong. However, we  must\r\n\r\ndo things beneficial to the people. Therefore, they\r\n\r\nmust  support the Government's Four-Year Plan.  And\r\n\r\nthese rumour-mongers must not further say that  our\r\n\r\nFour-Year Plan is brought out just for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  political  expediency  for  the  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nby-election.  This  Plan has been well considered.  It\r\n\r\nhas not been drafted in just a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nannounced  in this Assembly on the 20th  July  last\r\n\r\nyear  that the Development Plan had been completed.\r\n\r\nThe  final  version of the Plan is now before  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan that is before us is the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty's  Development Plan. This is the  first  time\r\n\r\nthat  we  have this sort of Plan in the history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It concerns very closely  the  workers,\r\n\r\nthe  farmers, the hawkers, the businessmen, and the\r\n\r\nstudents. In simple language, it is a Plan  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. It is not merely a Plan of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party. Its success or failure  will\r\n\r\ndecisively  affect  the  future  prospects  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   It   will  also  pronounce  judgment   on\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy - whether it will succeed  or\r\n\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before the P.A.P. came into\r\n\r\npower, it announced to the people of Singapore  its\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan. Let me quote from  this  Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan, The Tasks Ahead [Part I, page 6]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The plans we have laid down are not\r\n\r\nover-ambitious ones. They are realistic and are based on\r\n\r\nactual existing political and social conditions and\r\n\r\neconomic  circumstances. In drafting our  plans  we\r\n\r\nrecognise   that   an   internally   self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not an independent Singapore  because\r\n\r\ncontrol of our foreign affairs remains in the hands\r\n\r\nof  the colonial office and so in this sense we are\r\n\r\na  semi-colony; we recognise the severe restriction\r\n\r\nof  land  space, a mere 210 square miles,  and  the\r\n\r\npressure  of a population now numbering 1\u00bd  million\r\n\r\nand still growing at the rate of 65,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that our little island has no\r\n\r\nnatural resources and our economy has for the  past\r\n\r\n100  years  been dependent solely on  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  and  has remained static. We recognise  the\r\n\r\ncomplexities  of our multi-racial society  and  the\r\n\r\nspecial problems which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey pose. It is within this framework that we must\r\n\r\nwork.  It is within these limitations that we  must\r\n\r\nconstruct  and lay the basis for a future socialist\r\n\r\nsociety. The next five years will be critical years\r\n\r\nof testing not only for the party but for all those\r\n\r\nwho believe that socialism can be achieved step  by\r\n\r\nstep through peaceful parliamentary democracy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy statement has\r\n\r\nclearly  pointed out and given us  a  very  correct\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the  political, economic  and  social\r\n\r\nsituation and the resources. On the other hand,  it\r\n\r\nalso  points out our immediate task and our  future\r\n\r\nprospects.  If  there are people who  neglect  this\r\n\r\nvivid  reality and who place too high hopes on  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  they will be disappointed. Our Development\r\n\r\nPlan  is mainly based on the nine policy statements\r\n\r\nannounced to the people before the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara, in his speech in the\r\n\r\nSecond  Session  of this Assembly,  said  that  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party has no intention of deceiving\r\n\r\nthe  people  into voting for it by  promises  which\r\n\r\ncannot be fulfilled. It exhorts the people to  vote\r\n\r\nfor this realistic but not over-ambitious Plan. The\r\n\r\noverwhelming vote won by the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nproves  that  the people have accepted its  correct\r\n\r\nanalysis  and its policy. If before the  elections,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. was not prepared to deceive the  people\r\n\r\nwith  promises of getting the stars, the  moon  and\r\n\r\nthe sun, it has even less reason now to offer false\r\n\r\nhopes   to  the  people.  In  some  of  the   Asian\r\n\r\ncountries,  parliamentary democracy has  collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe   reason  is  that  the  Government  in   those\r\n\r\ncountries, anxious to retain their political power,\r\n\r\nhave  adopted demagogic politics at the expense  of\r\n\r\nintegrity  and courage. The Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nalso  said that the Government has no intention  of\r\n\r\ngiving  up  its  policies and its objectives  which\r\n\r\nwere  evolved  over  a long period  with  care  and\r\n\r\ncaution. A responsible government cannot recklessly\r\n\r\nalter its policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party is a\r\n\r\nParty  which honours its promises. Its record  over\r\n\r\nthe  past six years testifies to this. However, the\r\n\r\nex-Member for Hong Lim, the Member for Punggol  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Aljunied said that  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party had not done anything to  better  the\r\n\r\nlot of the people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  that the Four-Year Development Plan is only  a\r\n\r\npaper  tiger.

I think I heard the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa  Chu Kang alleging  that  certain\r\n\r\nMembers   of  this  Assembly  are  afflicted   with\r\n\r\ninsanity. That is an unparliamentary expression  to\r\n\r\nuse of any Member of this Assembly. Will the Member\r\n\r\nplease withdraw the expression?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. I\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the phrase people who are afflicted  with\r\n\r\ninsanity   and   substitute  the  words   `mentally\r\n\r\ndeficient'.  No  doubt there are still  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  no  work.  But they have forgotten  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  not promised that when it  comes  into\r\n\r\npower  it  will  solve their problems  immediately.\r\n\r\nThey  have  supported this Five-Year  Plan  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. May I now ask them to restudy this Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan to see if we have gone back on our words,  and\r\n\r\nsee  if they can find a single sentence which, says\r\n\r\nthat when the P.A.P. comes into power it will solve\r\n\r\nthe problem of unemployment overnight? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  ours is a Party with principles and political\r\n\r\nfaith.  Our  main task is not only centred  on  the\r\n\r\npresent immediate problems, but it also centres  on\r\n\r\nour  long-term  problems. We must not  neglect  the\r\n\r\npeople  just for the sake of our personal fame  and\r\n\r\ninterest. We will never desert the people with whom\r\n\r\nwe  have worked so hard. Our people's faith is  our\r\n\r\nfaith, and our faith is our people's faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all of us are aware that the\r\n\r\nonly  way to alleviate the unemployment problem  is\r\n\r\nthrough industrialisation, although this cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone  overnight.  But  if we merely  shout  slogans\r\n\r\nwithout   creating   the   necessary   prerequisite\r\n\r\nconditions  for industrialisation, we will  achieve\r\n\r\nnothing.  What we must remember is this.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing   which  cannot  be  achieved.   Everything\r\n\r\ndepends  on us. Given the co-operation between  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  the  capitalists and  the  Government,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve we will march towards industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, out of a total expenditure of\r\n\r\n$871  million, agriculture takes up  about  58  per\r\n\r\ncent; and out of this, $53 million will be utilised\r\n\r\nfor  land and agricultural development. The farmers\r\n\r\nand  the rural people are entitled to the care  and\r\n\r\nattention  of the Government under this  Plan.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  they  should get a supply of  electricity\r\n\r\nand  water; good roads and the opening up of drains\r\n\r\nand  other  drainage  work. At present,  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  20,000 farmers who are engaged in  producing\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs   to  meet  the  needs  of   the   local\r\n\r\npopulation.  For example, they produce  pork,  meat\r\n\r\nbirds,  eggs,  vegetables, fruits  and  fresh-water\r\n\r\nfish  and  prawns.  According to  estimates,  their\r\n\r\nannual  production is as follows: 750,000 pigs,  16\r\n\r\nmillion  meat birds, 200 million eggs, 34,000  tons\r\n\r\nof  vegetables,  1,700 tons of fruits;  and  11,000\r\n\r\ntons  of  fish  and prawns. As far as  the  present\r\n\r\npopulation  is  concerned,  our  State   is  \r\n\r\nself-sufficient  in pig and poultry production.  But  we\r\n\r\nstill  have  to  import a great quantity  of  eggs,\r\n\r\nfish,  prawns, vegetables and fruits  from  outside\r\n\r\ncountries to meet the needs of the people. In  1959\r\n\r\nwe  imported  136  million  eggs,  20,000  tons  of\r\n\r\nvegetables  from  the Federation,  96,000  tons  of\r\n\r\nvegetables from countries other than the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, and 29,000 tons of fish and prawns from\r\n\r\nboth  the Federation and other countries. The total\r\n\r\nvalue  of  these  foodstuffs  imported  into   this\r\n\r\ncountry is $73,860,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of the terrific rate of\r\n\r\nincrease  of  the  population, we  have  a  greater\r\n\r\ndemand  for agricultural production. If we  do  not\r\n\r\nincrease  our  production, we will have  to  import\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  from  other  countries,  and  from  the\r\n\r\neconomic  point of view, this is not beneficial  to\r\n\r\nus.  Therefore, our immediate task is  to  increase\r\n\r\nour  agricultural production so as  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs imported from other countries. In  order\r\n\r\nto  increase  production, we have to see  that  our\r\n\r\nagricultural production is mechanised and that  the\r\n\r\narea  for  cultivation  should  be  enlarged.   The\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department of the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Development has carried out a programme to\r\n\r\nhelp  farmers  plough their land; to  provide  them\r\n\r\nwith  fertilisers and veterinary services,  and  to\r\n\r\norganise  seminars on agriculture. All  these  will\r\n\r\nhelp them to increase their knowledge of the method\r\n\r\nof cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase of population, the limited\r\n\r\nland  has  now  been  used  up  to  build  houses,\r\n\r\nschools,    hospitals   and   community    centres.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to acquire more land from  other\r\n\r\nsources.  According to estimates, there  are  about\r\n\r\n10,000  acres of swampy land surrounding the island\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. We must convert the 10,000 acres  of\r\n\r\nswampy  land into good agricultural land so  as  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the area for farming. And during  the  \r\n\r\n4-year  period,  the Government proposes  to  use  $4\r\n\r\nmillion to open up 1,000 acres of agricultural land\r\n\r\nand  1,000  acres  of land for prawn  ponds.  These\r\n\r\nswampy  lands, which have just been reclaimed,  are\r\n\r\nsituated   at  Sungei  Serangoon,  Sungei  Seletar,\r\n\r\nSungei Kranji, Sungei Tengah, Sungei Poyan and  Ama\r\n\r\nKeng. The Government, after a careful survey,  will\r\n\r\nopen up these lands for the farmers. It is expected\r\n\r\nthat  when this survey is completed, there will  be\r\n\r\nan  increase of 1,100 farmers and fishermen.  Other\r\n\r\nthan  these,  there will be 500  workers  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  from this. This 4,000 acres of land,  when\r\n\r\nfully   utilised,  will  produce  10,000  tons   of\r\n\r\nvegetables  and 1,200 tons of prawns  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemands of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  support this Four-Year Development Plan  with\r\n\r\nactual  deeds, so as to enable this Plan to succeed\r\n\r\nin  the time envisaged. We must point out that this\r\n\r\nPlan  is  not  intended for the coming by-election,\r\n\r\nbut for the future benefit of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\non  this  side  have  been waiting  for  the  other\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  make some detailed comments  on  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan,  but since they  have  not  said\r\n\r\nanything  yet,  I have decided that we  should  say\r\n\r\nsomething at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few months we have noticed a\r\n\r\nchange of attitude on the Government side in  their\r\n\r\napproach  to various problem's and in their  public\r\n\r\nutterances. Now, whether this change of attitude is\r\n\r\nalso  a change of heart, only the future can  tell.\r\n\r\nWhether this is a calculated move based on a\r\n\r\nshort-term  policy with a specified objective, or whether\r\n\r\nit  is  really a change of policy based on a \r\n\r\nlong-term programme, we do not know. But five months ago\r\n\r\nin  this House, the Finance Minister in his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech   said  that  economically  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  had done well. The propaganda  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore under the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty had never had it so good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we on this side maintain, from the facts we\r\n\r\nknow  and  from  what we have heard from  the  very\r\n\r\npeople who put them into power, that Singapore  has\r\n\r\ndone   badly.  Anybody  who  goes  to  the  popular\r\n\r\namusement  parks will have noticed  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstalls that are kept closed. On one occasion,  when\r\n\r\nI  asked  the ticket collectors why it was that  so\r\n\r\nmany  stalls were kept closed, the reply was,  \"Not\r\n\r\nmany people have got money to spend nowadays.\" Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday  the  truth is out, and in the motion  before\r\n\r\nthe House, the Finance Minister draws attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  acute  problems  of  unemployment  caused   by\r\n\r\nSingapore's rapid population increase which is  not\r\n\r\naccompanied  by corresponding increase in  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion.  We  have all the time maintained,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the shadow of unemployment is the one spectre\r\n\r\nthat  bedevils the life of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe admission here practically declares that in the\r\n\r\nrace against unemployment, Singapore's economy  has\r\n\r\nslipped backward; that the number of unemployed has\r\n\r\nbeen  on the increase. Sir, I believe that even  at\r\n\r\nthis moment the problem has been underestimated.  I\r\n\r\nbeg  to  refer, Sir, to the Development Plan,  page\r\n\r\n55,  paragraph  634.  The estimate  of  the  total\r\n\r\nunemployed  in 1959 was given as 46,000.  Then,  by\r\n\r\nsome complicated process of calculation, the annual\r\n\r\nestimate  of  the number of unemployed was  somehow\r\n\r\nreduced  so that the total of unemployed  requiring\r\n\r\njobs  at  the end of 1964 is estimated at 84,000.\r\n\r\nSir, in the Straits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTimes of Friday, 31st March, the Prime Minister  at\r\n\r\na  rally  in  Fullerton  Square  gave  a  different\r\n\r\nfigure.  Now, we wonder whose estimate is  correct.\r\n\r\nIt is said here, Sir, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some 40,000 to 50,000 children were born in 1945\r\n\r\nand  they  would reach the age of 17 next  year - and\r\n\r\nthe majority would be looking for jobs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the headline gives the words-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`1962 - JOBS MUST BE FOUND FOR 50,000 MORE: LEE'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister, in the opinion of the\r\n\r\nFinance    Minister,   might    have    given    an\r\n\r\noverstatement, but he used his common sense; and we\r\n\r\nwho  use  our  common sense think  that  if  50,000\r\n\r\npeople are of age to go into the labour market each\r\n\r\nyear,  then naturally even if we exclude those  who\r\n\r\ndo  not want to find jobs, and even if we say  that\r\n\r\nthere are people who retire, we must remember  that\r\n\r\nthere  is the continuous influx of people from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  into  Singapore  looking  for  jobs.  A\r\n\r\nreasonable  estimate would be that at least  25,000\r\n\r\nper  year would be looking for jobs. In four years,\r\n\r\none  would reasonably expect something like 100,000\r\n\r\nwould  be looking for jobs. With a backlog of  some\r\n\r\n46,000,  the number must be a great deal more  than\r\n\r\nwhat  is given in the Development Plan; perhaps  50\r\n\r\nper  cent more, or even 100 per cent more. So  the\r\n\r\npicture is even more serious than has been painted.\r\n\r\nAnother  aspect we must remember is  that  most  of\r\n\r\nthose  who are unemployed would be the young people\r\n\r\nwho,   after   leaving  school,  naturally   expect\r\n\r\nemployment  of  some  kind. If  after  having  been\r\n\r\ntrained they find that the years ahead of them show\r\n\r\nnothing  but  prospects  of  unemployment,  we  can\r\n\r\nimagine their frustration and bitterness. For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  we  are  glad that the Government  is  now\r\n\r\nembarking  on  this Development Plan and  seriously\r\n\r\ntackling  the  problem, even though  belatedly.  We\r\n\r\nhope  that  it is not too late for them because  of\r\n\r\nthe mistakes made in the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, paragraph 2 of the motion says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ALERTS our people to the paramount need to\r\n\r\nexpand employment opportunities,...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, Sir, the Government is alerting the\r\n\r\npeople.

Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Government might inquire from their  employees\r\n\r\nhow   many   people   had  been   thrown   out   of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  because  many  of  these  Government\r\n\r\nemployees  had  to dispense with  the  services  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  helpers, and indirectly many  shops  have\r\n\r\nhad  to  curtail purchases of goods because of  the\r\n\r\nlack  of  demand from those whose buying power  had\r\n\r\nbeen reduced so drastically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good to note that the Government is\r\n\r\nnow  going  to  plan  for an  expenditure  of  $871\r\n\r\nmillion in the next four years.

We have to go on the basis of\r\n\r\nthe  objectives, and the objectives are  desirable.\r\n\r\nSome of us on this side of the House were concerned\r\n\r\nover  the  draft of some of these plans;  over  the\r\n\r\nearlier  establishment of some of the phases,  such\r\n\r\nas   the  establishment  of  the  Polytechnic,  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of low-cost housing  and  such  other\r\n\r\nschemes.  But there are certain paragraphs  in  the\r\n\r\nPlan which call for comment and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your leave, I would like to draw on\r\n\r\nsome of the very important ones. Page 18, paragraph\r\n\r\n1.72. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstructive.  It  is  in language  which  we  find\r\n\r\nstrange  coming  from  the People's  Action  Party.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, we always appreciate a change for the\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`1.72. However because of Singapore's entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  it is necessary that nothing is done  which\r\n\r\nmay   seriously  disturb  the  confidence  of   the\r\n\r\nbusiness community.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing must be done to disturb the confidence of\r\n\r\nthe  business community. Sir, this high regard  for\r\n\r\nmembers of the business community is something new.\r\n\r\nWhen  we consulted a business friend, he liked this\r\n\r\nsentence  but he said, \"But perhaps the  confidence\r\n\r\nof  the business community in Singapore has already\r\n\r\nbeen  disturbed. And so disturbed that it may  take\r\n\r\ntime to recover that confidence.\" Sir, the next two\r\n\r\nsentences  practically contradict their  own  Party\r\n\r\npolicy  as  enunciated in their booklets.  The  two\r\n\r\nsentences run as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Consequently draconic measures successfully used\r\n\r\nin some other countries to give mobility to capital\r\n\r\nis  not  available to the Government of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nCapital  mobilization  for  industrial  development\r\n\r\nwould  have to be a slow process of persuasion  and\r\n\r\ninducement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I for one wish that that had been their policy\r\n\r\nfrom the very start. But I would like to read their\r\n\r\nstatement  of policy in Time Tasks Ahead regarding\r\n\r\nloans.   That  is  another  big  change  in   their\r\n\r\nattitude.  Now  the Minister for Finance  tells  us\r\n\r\nthat  there is nothing wrong in getting loans  from\r\n\r\nforeign    countries.    We    agree    with    him\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly.  We  have  always  said  so,   that\r\n\r\nSingapore's prosperity must depend on the  goodwill\r\n\r\nof  our neighbours and of all countries which trade\r\n\r\nwith  us.  But in paragraph 2 on page  25  of  Time\r\n\r\nTasks  Ahead - the P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan 1959-1964\r\n\r\n(Part 1) under the heading \"Capital\", this is  what\r\n\r\nwe read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. profoundly disagree that the survival\r\n\r\nof Singapore depends on foreign capital and foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  We  say  that  there  are  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate   capital  resources  initially  available\r\n\r\nlocally.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And skipping five lines, it goes on to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is absolute nonsense to say that our survival\r\n\r\ndepends  on  foreigners when so  much  of  our  own\r\n\r\ncapital is invested in foreign countries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And skipping another seven lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our salvation lies in our own hands. There are\r\n\r\nno benevolent foreigners knocking around the world,\r\n\r\nanxious    to    discharge   these    duties    and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities which are rightly our own. Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  face  the  economic problems  in  the  era  of\r\n\r\nfreedom  with  the mental attitudes appropriate  to\r\n\r\ncolonial servitude.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  those  are very strong words. It  practically\r\n\r\nmeans  that  those  who  seek  loans  from  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries have \"the mental attitudes appropriate to\r\n\r\ncolonial servitude\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh: Rubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I echo the word\r\n\r\n\"rubbish\"!  We on this side are glad that  at  last\r\n\r\ncommon sense is coming to Members on the Government\r\n\r\nside and we hope this common sense will remain with\r\n\r\nthem  for  long and that it is not just a  tactical\r\n\r\nmove to attain a temporary objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What temporary objective?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, paragraph 5.23 of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan (page 48) - the third line reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is, therefore, necessary to look abroad for\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then the last line of the next paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Further loans would be sought from the United\r\n\r\nKingdom in late 1962 or early 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Loans have to be sought. It is right that they must\r\n\r\nbe  sought  for  the  sake of the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Sir,  unfortunately during  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears, the atmosphere in the different countries of\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia has undergone quite some  changes,\r\n\r\nand  Singapore  has now to compete for  loans  with\r\n\r\ncountries which offer a better economic climate. We\r\n\r\nread  in  the Straits Times of Monday, 10th  April,\r\n\r\nthat  the  British  Board of  Trade  is  sending  a\r\n\r\ndelegation  to  survey conditions in the  different\r\n\r\ncountries  in  South-East Asia. The Federation  has\r\n\r\nalso a Five-Year Development Plan and they want  to\r\n\r\nspend  the fabulous sum of \u00a3589 million - more  than\r\n\r\nfive  times what Singapore plans to spend.  British\r\n\r\nBorneo  has  also its own plans. So have  Thailand,\r\n\r\nBurma, Indonesia and the Philippines. What do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  offer  to induce foreign countries to  give  us\r\n\r\nloans?  I  hope  we  can  offer  greater  security,\r\n\r\ngreater  stability. I do not know. That is for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to offer. But we do hope that the offers\r\n\r\nmade  will  be such that a great deal of  the  loan\r\n\r\nmoney  will  come this way. In the last two  years,\r\n\r\nhowever,  a great deal of capital has gone  out  of\r\n\r\nthis  country - elsewhere. Anybody who goes to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  and  visits Petaling Jaya  will  have  this\r\n\r\nconviction:  that half of the capital  invested  in\r\n\r\nPetaling   Jaya  should  have  been   invested   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It was very unfortunate that because  of\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  confidence in  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nfuture,  people with capital decided to  invest  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation rather than in Singapore.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to face the stern reality of the problem.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  blind  ourselves. We have to  recover  this\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  we hope that the  Government  will\r\n\r\ntake appropriate measures to ensure that recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, private enterprise was regarded as the key\r\n\r\nto  Singapore's economy before, but ever since  the\r\n\r\npublication of the People's Action Party  booklets,\r\n\r\npeople  involved  in private enterprise  have  felt\r\n\r\nthat  they  must take a back seat, that  the  State\r\n\r\nwould  extend its control more and more until there\r\n\r\nis  less and less scope for private enterprise  and\r\n\r\nthat,  therefore,  they  would  have  to  look  for\r\n\r\nopportunities elsewhere. But I am glad that in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan  presented  today,  there  is   a\r\n\r\nremarkable change in attitude. The last nine  lines\r\n\r\nof paragraph 6.45 on page 58 read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But it should be stressed that this solution\r\n\r\nconsists in inducing a sufficient volume of private\r\n\r\ninvestment in new industries which could absorb the\r\n\r\nlarger labour force.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then skipping two lines, it goes on to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide for 30,000 new jobs in industry\r\n\r\nrequires  a  capital investment of something  like\r\n\r\n$600 million, if we take a ratio of $20,000 a job.\r\n\r\nPrivate  investment  of this magnitude  has  never\r\n\r\nbeen achieved in the history of Singapore and this\r\n\r\nis  what  we  must do to bring about  a  state  of\r\n\r\nnearly full employment at the end of 1964.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, we wish the Government the best of luck. It is\r\n\r\nindeed   a   stupendous  task  to  induce   private\r\n\r\ninvestors to invest $600\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion.   Unfortunately,  Sir,   in   its   policy\r\n\r\nstatement,   the   Government  gave   a   different\r\n\r\nimpression,  and I hope the Finance  Minister  will\r\n\r\nmake  an outright declaration of policy here,  that\r\n\r\nthe  policy enunciated in the Development  Plan  is\r\n\r\nits permanent policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part I of the P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan, page 8,\r\n\r\nthe last paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The planned industrial enterprises will be run\r\n\r\neither by the Board or in co-operation with private\r\n\r\ncapital.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Those were the main categories: either by the Board\r\n\r\nor  by  the  Board  in  co-operation  with  private\r\n\r\ncapital.  Then the marginal opportunities  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven to private enterprise. It goes on to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Purely private capital enterprises will also\r\n\r\nreceive the co-operation of the Board. Although  we\r\n\r\ndisagree that the survival of Singapore depends  on\r\n\r\nforeign    capital    and   foreign    capitalists,\r\n\r\nnevertheless foreign capital business concerns that\r\n\r\nwish  to  establish factories in Singapore will  be\r\n\r\ngiven encouragement and assistance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, the Government realises now that the State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore alone cannot provide full employment  for\r\n\r\nits   people.   It  must  welcome   the   help   of\r\n\r\neverybody - local  and foreign - to provide  employment\r\n\r\nfor our people. After all, Sir, what is merdeka  if\r\n\r\nthe  workers are to be without employment. If their\r\n\r\nrice-bowl is to be broken, it is an empty  merdeka.\r\n\r\nMerdeka  must benefit everybody and not the workers\r\n\r\nin   particular.  It  must  provide  jobs  for  the\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion before the House is indeed\r\n\r\nsignificant  in that paragraph 4 strikes  something\r\n\r\nnew.  It  \"calls on all sections of the  people  to\r\n\r\nunite  in their effort to fulfil the plan\". On  all\r\n\r\nsections! Sir, we were told recently in this  House\r\n\r\nthat the Government side did not care for the views\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition. We thought that the Government\r\n\r\ndid not care for the views of something like 46 per\r\n\r\ncent of the voters who did not vote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  in.  Sir, that is an attitude of intolerance.\r\n\r\nIt  is  wrong. If you want to build a  nation,  you\r\n\r\nhave to have the support of even those who disagree\r\n\r\nwith  you.  But  now the Government  calls  on  all\r\n\r\nsections  of  the  people  to  unite.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  the Hong Lim by-election,  we  notice\r\n\r\nanother  note - speakers on the Government side  call\r\n\r\nfor  unity  and solidarity of the Left-wing  forces\r\n\r\nagainst  the  rest. By implication, Sir,  it  means\r\n\r\nthat  unless  people are members of  the  Left-wing\r\n\r\nforces,  they  have no equality of  status  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture of Singapore. Therefore, the businessmen are\r\n\r\nregarded as enemies of the Left-wing forces. Surely\r\n\r\na  better  appeal would have been a  unity  of  all\r\n\r\nthose who wish to serve the country - the people  and\r\n\r\nthe   workers - of   all  who   are   sensible   and\r\n\r\nconstructive; the unity of all these forces against\r\n\r\nthose  who wish to disrupt and destroy the  economy\r\n\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I put it to the Government that if there is\r\n\r\nreal  co-operation  to ensure the  success  of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan, it cannot be  on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nregarding  labour and management as hostile  forces\r\n\r\nthat must clash, but rather as forces that must\r\n\r\nco-operate  in order that the unemployed of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  provided with jobs. Sir, we welcome  this\r\n\r\nportion of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last portion of the motion indicates\r\n\r\nthat the Government realises its difficulties. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`EXHORTS the workers and trade union movement and\r\n\r\nthe  businessmen and industrialists to  play  their\r\n\r\npart   in  maintaining  a  fair  balance  of  their\r\n\r\nrespective interests so essential to success.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, Sir, if either one of these two is\r\n\r\nunable or refuses to maintain a fair balance,  then\r\n\r\nno  progress  can  be  made.  But  why  regard  the\r\n\r\nrelationship   between  these   two   as   one   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining a fair balance? Sir, we know that  when\r\n\r\ntwo  people who are restive try to maintain a  fair\r\n\r\nbalance, the boat is bound to rock. You cannot have\r\n\r\nthe boat going fast when all the time it is rocking\r\n\r\nnow on one side and now on the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is this: that the essence should\r\n\r\nnot  be  on  maintaining a fair balance first.  The\r\n\r\npriority should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintaining      the     maximum      speed - maximum\r\n\r\nproductivity - and  that the balancing  of  interests\r\n\r\ncould  be  left, if necessary,, and  if  there  are\r\n\r\ndisputes, to a fair and Just Arbitration Court.  If\r\n\r\nthere  are only certain cases or certain categories\r\n\r\n(if there are disputes) that cannot be solved, then\r\n\r\nthose  cases  can  be referred to  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  Why  not  all? - so long as  we  can  ensure\r\n\r\nmaximum  productivity, maximum  speed,  toward  our\r\n\r\nobjective?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to restore the confidence which we\r\n\r\nhave lost to a great extent, the Government has  to\r\n\r\nanswer  many  of  these questions.  Naturally  when\r\n\r\nbusinessmen read in the papers a statement  from  a\r\n\r\nresponsible   T.U.C. official - \"To    hell    with\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace\" - well, balancing of interests  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be difficult. And I suggest that we  must\r\n\r\nget  away  from  this  question  of  balancing   of\r\n\r\ninterests  to another force. Let there  be  maximum\r\n\r\nspeed  and  maximum  productivity,  and  leave  the\r\n\r\nbalancing  of interests not in the hands  of  those\r\n\r\nwho  want to fight but in the hands of an impartial\r\n\r\nand just tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many questions we would like to\r\n\r\nask  about  the various plans, but no doubt  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to discuss details here. We can  foresee\r\n\r\ndifficulties because we know of the acute  shortage\r\n\r\nof  technical personnel so that even now we find we\r\n\r\ndo   not  have  enough  Science  teachers  for  our\r\n\r\nschools, and Science graduates are in demand in all\r\n\r\nthe  States around us. We hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  get over these obstacles  and  really\r\n\r\nsucceed.  We  do hope that this Plan is  not  being\r\n\r\nbrought before the House just to be in time for the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  by-election, but  that  it  is  to   be\r\n\r\nproceeded with with great speed after this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  today self-governing  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nputting  forward for the first time, in the history\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, a just Development Plan. Our Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  has already outlined the main  points  of\r\n\r\nthis  Plan.  It is not necessary for me to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe whole Plan in detail, but I personally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel  that  there are several points  in  the  Plan\r\n\r\nwhich should be brought out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that when we drafted this Plan\r\n\r\nwe   fully  understood  the  present  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  Singapore  today  there  is   still\r\n\r\nincomplete separation from colonial rule. Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  not  yet  discarded the yoke  of  colonialism.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the Plan drafted by us can be said\r\n\r\nto  be  one  which  is in accordance  with  certain\r\n\r\nmeasures. It is a concrete Plan and not a dream. It\r\n\r\nis  a resolute Plan. It will achieve our goals. Why\r\n\r\ndo  I  say  so? First, the most important point  is\r\n\r\nwhat  I have just said: we have not entirely shaken\r\n\r\noff the yoke of colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore is a tiny island and had been\r\n\r\nunder British control for over a hundred years. The\r\n\r\nBritish  colonial policy had produced  a  very  low\r\n\r\nstandard of education. Because of the long  period\r\n\r\nof  oppression  by  the  British  and  exploitation\r\n\r\ngenerally,  the people are poor, and  also  because\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom wants to take advantage of  the\r\n\r\ncentral position of Singapore to convey its  spoils\r\n\r\nderived  here to England. Therefore, Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  centre of entrep\u00f4t trade, and  does  not\r\n\r\nhave   a  foundation  for  industrialisation.   The\r\n\r\nproblems  of  unemployment,  education  and   other\r\n\r\nsocial  and  welfare problems left by  the  British\r\n\r\nneed a solution and we have to resolve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, everybody knows that Singapore does not\r\n\r\nhave  natural  resources. It does not have  fertile\r\n\r\nfarmlands or rich mountains or mines or fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we know that the population increase is\r\n\r\nvery  high - 4.3 per cent. It is the highest  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  The  population of Singapore  today  totals\r\n\r\n1,600,000.  Those under 21 years of age  number  50\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the whole population. Over two-thirds\r\n\r\nof  our population depend on less than one-third of\r\n\r\nthe    population's    labour    and    livelihood.\r\n\r\nApproximately  one  quarter of our  population  are\r\n\r\nschool-going children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the four facts mentioned above, we\r\n\r\nhave  formulated this Development Plan. Also  under\r\n\r\ndifficult  circumstances we have  courageously  put\r\n\r\nforward this Development Plan. But why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  I  say that this Development Plan is one  which\r\n\r\nwould  only solve the problems but does not  tackle\r\n\r\nthe roots of the problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the P.A.P., believe in socialism. Our\r\n\r\nobjectives  are to achieve a unified party  between\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya and Singapore. It is only\r\n\r\nunder  a  socialist society in which  there  is  no\r\n\r\nexploitation  of man by man that we  can  basically\r\n\r\nsolve  the problems of the people's livelihood.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   our  problem  includes  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment. Therefore, this Plan is based on  the\r\n\r\npresent  political, social and economic  situation.\r\n\r\nBut  we can only solve part of the problems. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a Plan which can fully solve all our problems.\r\n\r\nThis point has to be understood by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant point is that this Plan\r\n\r\nintends  to alter the economy of Singapore  from  a\r\n\r\nnon-productive commercial economy to  a  productive\r\n\r\neconomy.  58 per cent of the total investment  will\r\n\r\nbe  used  for  economic development.  This  clearly\r\n\r\nshows  that  our Plan is to fulfil the promises  we\r\n\r\nmade  before the election. We have to lay well  the\r\n\r\nfoundation for industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now many Opposition Members have said that\r\n\r\nour  Plan has contradicted the promises made during\r\n\r\nthe  last  election campaign. They have  also  said\r\n\r\nthat  this Plan has been introduced because of  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim by-election. Therefore, I must now  quote\r\n\r\nfrom  The  Five-Year Plan issued  before  the  last\r\n\r\ngeneral  election. What I have said  just  now  was\r\n\r\nquoted from the fourth book of our Five-Year  Plan,\r\n\r\nat page 15:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How we want to change our non-productive economy\r\n\r\ninto  a productive economy. This means that we must\r\n\r\ncarefully  investigate  all the  possibilities  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore. The existence of  a\r\n\r\nnation depends on whether it can produce goods, and\r\n\r\nwhether it has the potentialities and possibilities\r\n\r\nfor producing goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore does not have the raw materials for\r\n\r\nproduction.   Also  it  does  not  have   a   large\r\n\r\nagricultural   area  for  large-scale  agriculture.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our production has to depend on  how  to\r\n\r\nmobilise our people for productive labour.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Development Plan is realistic, it shows that\r\n\r\nwe  are resolute and courageous. During our term of\r\n\r\noffice, we want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  lay  the  foundation for industrialisation.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in this Four-Year Development Plan, to pave\r\n\r\nthe way for industrialisation is not very easy. For\r\n\r\ninstance, if we start work at the Jurong industrial\r\n\r\nsite  today,  we  may  not  entirely  see  all  the\r\n\r\nfactories  manufacturing at the end of four  years.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are a responsible Government. We  are  not\r\n\r\nutilising  our  term  of office  to  meet  the  \r\n\r\nby-election or any election. We are doing all this for\r\n\r\nthe  good  of  the  future of  all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We are a responsible Government, and our\r\n\r\nPlan is to take into account the long-term good for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that last year I said that in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  economic problems and financial affairs,  our\r\n\r\nstand   was  to  save  expenditure  and  accumulate\r\n\r\nwealth.  We  have  to  carry  out  our  task  in  a\r\n\r\ncalculated  and  planned way. We will  always  take\r\n\r\ninto consideration that Government will not waste a\r\n\r\nsingle  cent.  Any cent spent will get  its  value.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it will be wasting the sweat  and  blood\r\n\r\nof  the  people. Therefore, the basic task  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  to  improve by stages the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving of the people. Of course, what we have  done\r\n\r\nup  till now is still not enough. We must endeavour\r\n\r\nfurther to strengthen our work along this path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir, before I speak,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nanswer  the  criticism raised  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin.  Just  now he criticised  our  Development\r\n\r\nPlan.  Some of his criticisms contradict the facts.\r\n\r\nActually he was driving at something else with some\r\n\r\nulterior  motive. Just like in the fable, when  the\r\n\r\nfox  cannot get the grapes, he says the grapes  are\r\n\r\nsour.  That  is  my  answer to  the  criticism  put\r\n\r\nforward by the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gladly support the Four-Year Development Plan\r\n\r\nput  forward  by  my colleague,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.  Ever  since  the  publication   of   this\r\n\r\nhistoric   Development  Plan,  it  has  been   well\r\n\r\nreceived by the public. In this House, my colleague\r\n\r\nhas  further analysed the Plan, but there are  some\r\n\r\npoints  which I wish to stress. Why must  I  stress\r\n\r\nthese points?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay I mention the reasons why I should stress these\r\n\r\npoints? In this blue book, there are many proposals\r\n\r\nwhich  deserve our close attention. But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  touch on all the aspects of the  Plan.  I\r\n\r\nwish only to talk on two points. The first point is\r\n\r\nthe increase of employment opportunities. The other\r\n\r\npoint is the expansion of the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me say\r\n\r\nsomething on the first point. In the present  state\r\n\r\nof  affairs  in Singapore, it is very necessary  to\r\n\r\nformulate  a Development Plan. This is because  the\r\n\r\nstate of affairs in Singapore is like that of a big\r\n\r\nfamily. In matters of economics, it is just like  a\r\n\r\nfamily which has a piece of cloth to dispense with.\r\n\r\nIf  the parent does not calculate and make a proper\r\n\r\nallocation beforehand, it is impossible  for  every\r\n\r\nmember of the family to get a suit of clothing.  If\r\n\r\nhe  can  make  an estimate and a proper  allocation\r\n\r\nbeforehand, even if not every member of the  family\r\n\r\nwill  get  a suit of clothing, at least he  can  be\r\n\r\nassured  that he will avoid waste. Looking  from  a\r\n\r\nrealistic angle, whenever we pass by a secondary or\r\n\r\na primary school, before the school starts or after\r\n\r\nschool, whichever school you pass by, you will  see\r\n\r\na  surging  crowd  of students  emerging  from  the\r\n\r\nschool  premises.  It is not difficult  to  imagine\r\n\r\nthat after a few years these pupils will enter  the\r\n\r\nlabour market to seek their livelihood. Sir, may  I\r\n\r\nquote  from an editorial of the Nanyang Siang  Pat,\r\n\r\ndated the 3rd of April? I believe this paragraph in\r\n\r\nthe  editorial is unbiased.

Let me quote from the Nanyang Siang Pau\r\n\r\neditorial of 3rd April:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Another characteristic feature of the Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan  is  the increase  of  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities. When this Plan is achieved, it  will\r\n\r\nprovide  about 40,000 jobs for the people. That  is\r\n\r\nto say, about 8,000 jobs in the public service will\r\n\r\nbe  available, and other economic institutions will\r\n\r\nabsorb  about  12,000 people.  If  in  the  process\r\n\r\nprivate  investors invest their money in  industry,\r\n\r\nthere  will be another 30,000 jobs, and  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  jobs  available  then  will  solve  the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem of thousands of people. But in\r\n\r\n1964, the number of people who are looking for jobs\r\n\r\nwill  be  83,600.  Other than  the  31,000  jobless\r\n\r\npeople  at  present, there will  be  an  additional\r\n\r\n52,600  people  looking  for  new  jobs.  Even   if\r\n\r\neverything  is going on smoothly and  according  to\r\n\r\nour  Plan, by the end of 1964, there will still  be\r\n\r\n13,600  people  who will be looking  for  jobs.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, if the Plan fails, we will  be  faced\r\n\r\nwith a more serious and grave situation and crisis.\r\n\r\nBecause   of   the  above-mentioned  factors,   two\r\n\r\nconcepts can be arrived at. On the one hand, we are\r\n\r\nglad  and  cheered by our prospects. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it cannot help to be worried. Why should  we\r\n\r\nsay  so?  Because we are hamstrung by our objective\r\n\r\nsituation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote again from the\r\n\r\nlast paragraph of the editorial which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is one fundamental weakness in Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy. That is the lack of natural resources. But\r\n\r\nthe  most  important  problem is  the  increase  of\r\n\r\npopulation.  Every year, there is  an  increase  of\r\n\r\n65,000  people.  After a few years, the  population\r\n\r\nwill  stand at about 2,000,000 people. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, not only are most of the population under the\r\n\r\nage  of  18, but there is one-fourth of the  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  under  the age of 5 or 6.  If  one  looks\r\n\r\nfurther, one will see the problems and difficulties\r\n\r\nfaced  by  Singapore and the situation will  become\r\n\r\nserious  year  by year. For example, if  there  are\r\n\r\n86,000  people  who cannot get jobs in  1964,  then\r\n\r\nafter two or three years, the figure for unemployed\r\n\r\npeople   will  increase.  Although  the   Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan cannot solve all our problems,  it\r\n\r\nwill  lay  the  foundation for further development.\r\n\r\nGiven  the co-operation of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nit  is  expected that we will be able to  turn  the\r\n\r\ntide and go on to the path of prosperity. The \r\n\r\nFour-Year Development Plan is a Plan which concerns  all\r\n\r\nof us, because.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

According to the reactions to the Plan,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve all partriotic citizens will do their  best\r\n\r\nto support this Plan without any hesitation to make\r\n\r\nit a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me touch on another\r\n\r\nproblem, i.e., the expansion of the public service.\r\n\r\nEveryone is aware that Singapore has been built  up\r\n\r\nslowly  in  the past decades. We have come  to  the\r\n\r\nstage  where  many  of the facilities  are  not  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  our present needs. To rectify  this,\r\n\r\nthe  Development Plan has many proposals to improve\r\n\r\nthe facilities. Now, let me quote an example. If we\r\n\r\ndo  not  do something to improve our situation,  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  only  be confronted with  a  very  acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of  housing, but we  may  also  have  the\r\n\r\nproblem of a shortage of roads. For the sake of the\r\n\r\nfuture of this country, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly this Four-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nmotion  by the Minister for Finance, we have  heard\r\n\r\nspeeches  from  the Government side  welcoming  the\r\n\r\nState of Singapore's Four-Year Development Plan. On\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Opposition, I would like to speak  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the points raised by the Government\r\n\r\nregarding  the  difficulties in  implementing  this\r\n\r\nPlan.  I  think my colleague the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nhas   touched  upon  the  mistakes  made   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  since  the  time they  assumed  office,\r\n\r\nwhich  difficulties  they are faced  with  now.  We\r\n\r\ncannot blame anybody in this respect. If I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  asked, I would say that the blame lies  on  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  the  Government  implements  its\r\n\r\npolicies,  which has resulted in an  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\ninsecurity in the community of Singapore. I do  not\r\n\r\nwish to dwell further on that matter except to urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  future  to  learn  from  their\r\n\r\nmistakes  for  the  betterment of  the  people  who\r\n\r\ncomprise the multi-racial society in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwho   owe  their  allegiance  to  this  State.  The\r\n\r\ndifficulties which we are confronted with  are  not\r\n\r\nmerely  those which Government is faced  with,  but\r\n\r\nthey  affect each and every single citizen, whether\r\n\r\nhe  is  rich, or whether he is a worker, even  more\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed,  the number of  which  is  on  the\r\n\r\nincrease  as  a  result of our  depressed  economic\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs; and no security is given to  the\r\n\r\nfamily  to  plan its future livelihood. We  realise\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is a small island not more than  224\r\n\r\nsquare  miles, and its population has grown  to  1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion as mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Finance. The  population  now\r\n\r\nnumbers 1,600,000, and the number of unemployed has\r\n\r\nincreased  day  by day. Similarly the  increase  in\r\n\r\nchildbirth  has posed another big problem,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  consider their future livelihood.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis problem should not only be the concern of this\r\n\r\nAssembly  alone. We should find ways and  means  of\r\n\r\nguaranteeing  a livelihood for the future  citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Development Plan, which is a step forward,\r\n\r\nshould  get  the  support of every section  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation,  although it is only on paper  at  this\r\n\r\nstage. But we have no other alternative and we have\r\n\r\nto work and work from now on to ensure a livelihood\r\n\r\nfor  the  people.  Differing  political  ideologies\r\n\r\nshould  be  set  aside  as this  Plan  affects  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of all the people of Singapore. However,\r\n\r\non the question of launching this Development Plan,\r\n\r\nwe  are  aware that we are short of money  and,  as\r\n\r\npointed out by my colleague the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the stand taken by the Government to  gain\r\n\r\nthe   confidence   of  the  capitalists   will   be\r\n\r\nmaintained. Bombastic and high-sounding  words  are\r\n\r\nof  no  use. What is needed is the facing  of  hard\r\n\r\nfacts   so  that  we  will  be  able  to  guarantee\r\n\r\nSingapore's prosperity in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst, may I just reply to a couple of remarks made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for Aljunied and  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied made a speech just like\r\n\r\nthe  speeches  he  made  on  the  platform  of  the\r\n\r\nIndependent  candidate, Mr Ong Eng  Guan,  in  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim by-election. He made a lot of allegations\r\n\r\nand  half-truths merely to belittle the Government.\r\n\r\nAll  of  them  have  been repeatedly  and  suitably\r\n\r\nanswered at our street corner meetings in Hong Lim,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not  think  there is  any  material  in\r\n\r\nwhatever he has said that needs further rebutting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Tanglin, he said that\r\n\r\nhalf  the investment that should have been made  in\r\n\r\nSingapore went to Petaling Jaya instead,  and  that\r\n\r\nthis  was  due  to  non-confidence  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Let  me ask him one  simple  question.\r\n\r\nWhen  was  the  Petaling Jaya  scheme  started?  It\r\n\r\nstarted  long,  long before the  P.A.P. came  into\r\n\r\npower. It started during General Templer's time; in\r\n\r\nfact,  at a time when the Progressives, the \r\n\r\nLabour-Fronters  and  the S.P.A.s were  all  in  power  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  taking  his argument  on  its  face\r\n\r\nvalue,  it  would  only  mean  that  the  lack   of\r\n\r\nconfidence  and lack of trust would be entirely  on\r\n\r\nthe   previous  Government.  I  would  advise   the\r\n\r\nschoolmaster not to spit into the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of these allegations and unprincipled\r\n\r\ndisparaging remarks, I still rise to add my littlie\r\n\r\nvoice to the shower of approval and praise that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Four-Year Plan has  received  from  all\r\n\r\nalike  in Singapore - bankers, industrialists, trade\r\n\r\nunionists,  workers  and the ordinary  men  in  the\r\n\r\nstreet.  Foreign  investors are keenly  interested,\r\n\r\nand  favourable  comments have  come  in  from  all\r\n\r\nsides.  This, Sir, is no surprise to us. For  after\r\n\r\n140 years of colonial domination, this is the first\r\n\r\ntime  that  any  local government has  attempted  a\r\n\r\nplanned  expenditure based on socialist principles,\r\n\r\nhowever limited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  scope, in Singapore. You will recall, Sir, that\r\n\r\none  of the faults of the capitalist system  is  in\r\n\r\nits  unplanned economy, depending on the whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies of capitalists and on how much profit  they\r\n\r\ncan  squeeze  out  of  consumers  by  high-pressure\r\n\r\nadvertisement   in   inducing  consumers   to   buy\r\n\r\nsomething  which they do not need  or  want.  Ideas\r\n\r\nhave  since travelled very fast, and we  in  Malaya\r\n\r\nand  especially in Singapore are not slow in trying\r\n\r\nour level best to do away with, or at least improve\r\n\r\non,  the  evils  and the haphazard economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncapitalist   system.  Historical  development   has\r\n\r\nplaced  Singapore in a situation where the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  has become the lifeblood of the people.  Our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade is almost entirely dependent on  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill and help of the Western world, which means\r\n\r\nthat,  unless we trade and do business in  a  setup\r\n\r\nthat  harmonises with the Western world  capitalist\r\n\r\nsystem,  we  shall  find  it  difficult  indeed  to\r\n\r\nmaintain, to say nothing of improving, our  present\r\n\r\nlevel   of   prosperity  and  living  standard   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Truly has the Minister for Finance said,\r\n\r\n\"The  world does not owe Singapore anything  for  a\r\n\r\nliving.\"  I may even add, if anything, that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  other  way  round.  We almost  owe  the  world\r\n\r\noutside  for  our  living  in  Singapore.  With   a\r\n\r\ngovernment based on a Socialist philosophy,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  unexpected  that we believe in  planning  and,\r\n\r\nwherever  possible,  a  controlled  economy.  Since\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  small  island  with  no   natural\r\n\r\nresources to speak of, and since our prosperity  so\r\n\r\nfar  has  been  entirely dependent on our  entrepot\r\n\r\neconomy, as I have already indicated, there is very\r\n\r\nlittle  likelihood  of our being  able  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncontrolled  economy; but so far as we  can,  within\r\n\r\nthe limits of our capability, we are trying to make\r\n\r\nit a planned expenditure. Long before we formed the\r\n\r\nGovernment, we had already made it quite clear that\r\n\r\nwe had our Five-Year Plan. Now it has been expanded\r\n\r\nand   elaborated  into  the  Government   Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan. This only shows our determination\r\n\r\nin  pursuing  our  plans  to  help  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to a better life and to a more equal  and\r\n\r\njust society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall also, Sir, that the Opposition\r\n\r\nhad  occasion  to  call themselves Socialists  when\r\n\r\nthey wanted to court the goodwill of the people and\r\n\r\nto gain votes. During the general election in 1959,\r\n\r\nthey  had  this  as their slogan, which  translated\r\n\r\ninto  Chinese  would read \"Work for  everyone,  and\r\n\r\nrice for everyone.\" Of course, the people were  not\r\n\r\ndeceived,  but it might be pertinent at this  point\r\n\r\nto  ask the S.P.A. this. If they were to honour the\r\n\r\n\"Work  for everyone and rice for everyone\"  slogan,\r\n\r\nhow  was  it that they had no Development Plan?  If\r\n\r\nthey  call  themselves Socialists, how is  it  that\r\n\r\neven now, after so many years of name-changing  and\r\n\r\nprecarious  existence, they still do not  know  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  a  planned socialist  economy?  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant,  therefore, that we distinguish  clearly\r\n\r\nwhere   we  stand  in  this  Assembly  as   regards\r\n\r\nplanning. The proof of the pudding, they say, is in\r\n\r\nthe  eating, and we on this side of the House  can,\r\n\r\nwith   confidence,  say  that  we  are  a   genuine\r\n\r\nSocialist   Party.   The   Government's   Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan is irrefutable proof of  planning\r\n\r\nbased  on a Socialist philosophy. A by-election  is\r\n\r\nbeing held in Hong Lim, and it might be interesting\r\n\r\nto  note  also that even speakers on the Opposition\r\n\r\nplatform  have  praised  our Four-Year  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  and have wished the Plan success, which  only\r\n\r\ngoes  to  prove  that in Singapore even  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  cannot  deny that this Government's \r\n\r\nFour-Year  Development Plan is really  a  Plan  to  help\r\n\r\nSingapore survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been made abundantly clear all\r\n\r\nthrough  the Blue Book, the Plan is not  a  panacea\r\n\r\nfor  all ills. It is only an attempt to solve  some\r\n\r\nof  the problems that face Singapore. The nature of\r\n\r\nour   problems  has  been  fully  investigated  and\r\n\r\nbrought home to the people. Anyone reading the Plan\r\n\r\ncannot  help  but  feel the pressing  urgency  for\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities that have to  be  created\r\n\r\nfor  our  fast-growing population. Even if everyone\r\n\r\nshould  practise  family  planning,  the  immediate\r\n\r\nproblem  would  still be there.  Large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nschools,  houses  and other health facilities  will\r\n\r\nhave to be provided for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrapidly  increasing population, and  the  thousands\r\n\r\nthat  leave  school every year will  have  to  find\r\n\r\ngainful employment. But how do we go about  it?  As\r\n\r\nthe  Plan  points  out, the only solution  lies  in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Plan does not envisage the Government\r\n\r\nbecoming the fountain of all industrial development\r\n\r\nor even the main industrial entrepreneur...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's task in this Plan is mainly to\r\n\r\ncreate    the   conditions   which   would   induce\r\n\r\nsubstantial private capital into industries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this purpose, Government has undertaken \"to\r\n\r\nprovide  adequate supply of cheap power and  water,\r\n\r\nto  lay  out  industrial estates, which would  have\r\n\r\nthese  facilities in addition to good communication\r\n\r\nwith   the   port,   and  to  provide   good   port\r\n\r\nfacilities.\" And wherever necessary, Government may\r\n\r\neven  invest in enterprises to inject stimulus into\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of the Plan have already been\r\n\r\ntouched   upon  by  various  speakers.   The   most\r\n\r\nimportant and most immediate impact would  fall  on\r\n\r\nthe   building   and  construction  industry.   The\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  houses,  factories,  roads,  wharves,\r\n\r\nsewers,   clinics,   schools,  bridges   would   be\r\n\r\ninitiated and stimulated and 40,000 new jobs  would\r\n\r\nbe   created  as  a  result.  This  would  not   be\r\n\r\nsufficient to solve the problem, however, and there\r\n\r\nwould still be considerable unemployment. And  this\r\n\r\nis where private industries come in. If the Plan is\r\n\r\nto  succeed,  it must find response in the  private\r\n\r\nsector. The Plan is meant only, I quote, \"to  spark\r\n\r\noff an increase in the rate of private investment\".\r\n\r\nAnd  if the spark goes to a damp squib, then  there\r\n\r\nwill  be no responsive fire. On the other hand,  if\r\n\r\nthe spark goes to a responsive combustible mixture,\r\n\r\nthen  we  can  be assured of a chain reaction  that\r\n\r\nwill    start    the   engine   that    leads    to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  Let us hope our  industrialists\r\n\r\nand entrepreneurs will be responsive. They have all\r\n\r\nthe  things  in their favour - the Plan, the  initial\r\n\r\npublic   outlay, and   Government   policy    and\r\n\r\nencouragement.  And  now we  know  the  T.U.C. and\r\n\r\nGovernment  have come to an agreement on industrial\r\n\r\npeace. Indeed, the industrialists and entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nhave never had it so good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from all that has been said, you will see\r\n\r\nthat  the success or failure of the Plan will  have\r\n\r\nan  intimate bearing on each and every one of us in\r\n\r\nSingapore. For those now unemployed and  for  those\r\n\r\nfresh   from  school,  success  will  mean  gainful\r\n\r\nemployment.  For those now employed,  success  will\r\n\r\nmean  better  opportunities, better  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice, and better security. For taxi drivers  and\r\n\r\nhawkers, success will mean thinning of their  ranks\r\n\r\nand  less competition, as more will find better and\r\n\r\nmore  highly  paid  employment in  industries.  For\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,    success    will    mean     greater\r\n\r\nopportunities and more trade. For the  man  in  the\r\n\r\nstreet, success will mean more homes, more clinics,\r\n\r\nmore   schools,  more  transport  and  recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities.  And for Singapore as a whole,  success\r\n\r\nwill   mean  an  expanding  economy  with   greater\r\n\r\nprosperity  for  all.  Let  us  hope  that  all  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   will  support  the  Development   Plan.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  the unemployment problem  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill never be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I fully agree with the Four-Year Plan\r\n\r\nof our Finance Minister. We all know that education\r\n\r\nis  very  important to nation building. It is  like\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  which is also  very  important.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the Four-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 110, we see that we have 658 Government\r\n\r\nand  Government-aided schools. In 1960  there  were\r\n\r\nabout 340,000-odd students, and in the coming years\r\n\r\nthe  figure will be bigger than this. We  all  know\r\n\r\nthat  under the old Government, whatever  they  did\r\n\r\nthey  had no plan at all. They never had any  \r\n\r\nlong-term  plan. They had no plan for education at  all.\r\n\r\nIn the past, under the old Government, we could see\r\n\r\nmany corrupt incidents and events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us deal with the year 1959. There were 4,000\r\n\r\nstudents for Primary I. After registration they had\r\n\r\nno  places and therefore could not join any school.\r\n\r\nIn   the   Secondary  School  Entrance  Examination\r\n\r\nconducted by Government, those who could  not  pass\r\n\r\nthe examination did not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  any chance to join school again, and so  they\r\n\r\nroamed  about  the streets. We could see  that  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  school-leavers  who  passed  could  only\r\n\r\nbecome  white-collar  workers.  All  this  was  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  old  Government's  rule.  And  the\r\n\r\nleakage  of  examination questions  under  the  old\r\n\r\nGovernment  had left a very bad impression  on  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  They had no confidence at  all  in  that\r\n\r\nexamination.  From all this, we can judge  and  see\r\n\r\nclearly for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since we took over control, we have improved\r\n\r\nall  this.  We  have not allowed  these  things  to\r\n\r\nhappen.  Let  us  consider a  few  more  facts.  In\r\n\r\n1960-61  all students of registrable age can  enter\r\n\r\nschool.  This shows that our educational policy  is\r\n\r\nin keeping with the increase of population. We want\r\n\r\nto  give  them a good education. Since our  coming\r\n\r\ninto power, we have carried out our new educational\r\n\r\npolicy  to allow children to attend school  in  all\r\n\r\nthe four languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us again look at the Four-Year Plan. In\r\n\r\nregard  to  education, we have decided  that  every\r\n\r\nyear  we  will  build 19 schools, of  which  7  are\r\n\r\nprimary schools. 7 post-primary schools, 3 ordinary\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools,  and 2 technical  schools.  All\r\n\r\nthis  shows that we have a plan to build 19 schools\r\n\r\nevery  year. In these four years we will  be  doing\r\n\r\nthe same thing - building the same number of schools.\r\n\r\nAll  this  shows  that the new Government  is  very\r\n\r\nconcerned with the education of the people in order\r\n\r\nto  let  all the people and their children  receive\r\n\r\neducation.  You will also note that  these  schools\r\n\r\nare  not  like those under the old Government.  The\r\n\r\nnew  schools  must not be English  schools  or  any\r\n\r\nother schools according to a rigid formula. We have\r\n\r\nto  take into consideration all the factors  before\r\n\r\ndeciding  whether the schools should be English  or\r\n\r\nChinese  or any other kind of schools, and we  have\r\n\r\nto  see whether there is a need for them. If  there\r\n\r\nis  such  a  need, then we will build  schools  for\r\n\r\nmixed races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, since we became the Government, we have\r\n\r\ntaken  into  consideration the problem of  over-age\r\n\r\nstudents.  In  the past, the old Government  kicked\r\n\r\nthem out from schools. But since we took\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover,  we  have  built  two  schools  for  over-age\r\n\r\nstudents.  One  is  the  Jurong  Special  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool  and the other is the River Valley Secondary\r\n\r\nChinese  School. This shows that we  are  not  only\r\n\r\nconcerned with the over-age students but also  with\r\n\r\ntheir education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our adult education classes are meant to\r\n\r\neradicate  illiteracy.  We  have  an  enrolment  of\r\n\r\nseveral  thousands of youths in these  classes,  so\r\n\r\nthat  in  their spare time, after their work,  they\r\n\r\ncan  have  a  chance to be educated and  gain  more\r\n\r\nknowledge in all respects. From the Plan we can see\r\n\r\nthat  not only do we want to establish these  adult\r\n\r\neducation  classes,  but we  also  intend  to  have\r\n\r\nevening secondary classes. At the moment, there are\r\n\r\n6,000  students. In future, we intend  to  have  an\r\n\r\nevening  college. So all these classes will provide\r\n\r\nprimary education or middle school education  right\r\n\r\nup  to  University standard. Why do so many  people\r\n\r\njoin these evening classes? It is because they have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the new Government. In the past,  the\r\n\r\nstudents  who  took  part in the  joint  Government\r\n\r\npublic examination had no confidence. But under our\r\n\r\nnew  Government they all show their  confidence  in\r\n\r\nand  respect  for  the common examination  for  all\r\n\r\nschools. And those youths who have left school  are\r\n\r\nnow  joining these evening classes in order to  sit\r\n\r\nfor the Government-sponsored public examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our teachers want to study further. We can\r\n\r\nsee  that  in the Teachers Training College,  there\r\n\r\nare  1,500  teachers who have  passed  the  Std.  I\r\n\r\nexamination in the national language.  A  few  days\r\n\r\nago there were about 1,000 teachers who set for the\r\n\r\nStd.  II examination in the national language.  All\r\n\r\nthis  shows that since the new Government took over\r\n\r\npower, everyone is very keen and has confidence  in\r\n\r\ntaking   the   examinations   conducted   by    the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do we want most of the children to\r\n\r\nreceive an education, but we also want to give them\r\n\r\na  good  education. That is why  we  want  to  have\r\n\r\ntechnical schools. We provide post-primary  classes\r\n\r\nfor those students who have not already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassed  the primary examination. This is  something\r\n\r\nwhich is well planned. According to our policy,  we\r\n\r\nhope  the four streams of education can come  to  a\r\n\r\nconfluence and can mix together. According  to  our\r\n\r\npolicy,  we have two integrated schools. There  are\r\n\r\nalso  a few integrated primary schools in the  four\r\n\r\nstreams.  This will help to break down the barriers\r\n\r\namong them and enable them to have more chances  of\r\n\r\nco-operation  and  to  instil  into  them   a   new\r\n\r\nconsciousness  in  order  to  build  a  new  united\r\n\r\nnation,  so  that people of all races  can  have  a\r\n\r\ncommon school to attend, can be in one common\r\n\r\nclassroom, and be able to live together. This is what we\r\n\r\nhope  for. In all the schools of all races, we have\r\n\r\nconducted sports meetings to enable the students of\r\n\r\nall  races to mix together. In another respect,  we\r\n\r\nhave  adopted Malay as our national language.  This\r\n\r\nis  correct because, through the national language,\r\n\r\nstudents in every stream of the educational  system\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  express  their  thoughts   and\r\n\r\ncommunicate with students of other races,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe differences among them will be lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government comes from the people. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  have to heed the opinion of the people.  During\r\n\r\nthe 22 months of our taking office, we have had the\r\n\r\nEducational  Advisory Council and other  Committees\r\n\r\nrelating to educational work. The members of  these\r\n\r\nCommittees  are  representatives  from   the   four\r\n\r\nlanguage  streams, and the Advisory Council  is  an\r\n\r\nadviser  to  the Minister for Education.  In  these\r\n\r\nCommittees,  the  members can use any  language  to\r\n\r\nexpress  their opinion. They have ample opportunity\r\n\r\nto   express  their  opinion  in  their  respective\r\n\r\nlanguages.  All  this  shows  that  we  take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration   the  views  of   all   the   people\r\n\r\nrepresenting every race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that the Committees concerned\r\n\r\nare  formulating a common syllabus for all  schools\r\n\r\nand  other related work for all schools so that  we\r\n\r\nwill teach all the students according to the common\r\n\r\nsyllabuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also look at our children. We are not\r\n\r\ndoing those things that have been done in the past.\r\n\r\nWe are not merely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducing  clerical staff or white-collar  workers.\r\n\r\nThat is why we have tried to have technical schools\r\n\r\nand vocational schools. We have built technical and\r\n\r\nvocational schools and we have built two-year\r\n\r\npost-primary  schools. This shows that we emphasise  the\r\n\r\nimportance of manual work and science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the duties of teachers. We know\r\n\r\nit  is  not an easy task to build a united  country\r\n\r\nbecause  all along in the past the four streams  of\r\n\r\nschools  carried on in their respective ways.  They\r\n\r\nwere  isolated from one another. They pursued their\r\n\r\nrespective system of education. We want to create a\r\n\r\nconstructive  path  and channel all  the  different\r\n\r\nstreams  into  one common confluence.  We  must  go\r\n\r\naccording to our educational policy. This is a very\r\n\r\ndifficult task. But we have confidence and we  have\r\n\r\nthe  courage  to  fulfil our Four-Year  Development\r\n\r\nPlan. The fulfilment of this Plan depends on the\r\n\r\nco-operation  of  the  workers,  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. In the same way, our educational policy\r\n\r\ndepends   on  the  co-operation  of  the  teachers,\r\n\r\nstudents   and   parents,   either   directly    or\r\n\r\nindirectly.  They must all exert their  energy  and\r\n\r\neffort to achieve the aims and objectives envisaged\r\n\r\nin the educational policy as contained in the \r\n\r\nFour-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in matters relating to\r\n\r\ndevelopment which we are facing and which  we  will\r\n\r\nface  in  the State of Singapore, as the Government\r\n\r\nelected   by  the  people  and  with  a  sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  I  would  like  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  as contained in the Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan  are bold and positive. Before I touch on  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of the Four-Year Development Plan,  first\r\n\r\nlet me emphasise that the Plan has been drawn up on\r\n\r\nthe   election  pledges  made  by  the  P.A.P. as\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the booklet The Tasks  Ahead,  which\r\n\r\nalso embodied the P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan if it was\r\n\r\nreturned   to  power.  Based  on  that  plan,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the day submits its Four-Year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan  which is being  debated  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it cannot be repudiated that governments, prior to this Government, for obvious\r\n\r\nreasons,  fought shy of openly facing the  problems\r\n\r\nand  dangers  which the people of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  would face. It is possible that if each  and\r\n\r\nevery  problem  and  danger, which  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  face in the  years  to  come,  was\r\n\r\nfaced, then the result would be that there would be\r\n\r\na  sense  of  fear among the people,  because  such\r\n\r\ngovernments did not have definite or positive plans\r\n\r\nto  meet  these problems. However, as a responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is our duty to study and analyse the\r\n\r\nhard  facts based on a broad understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nfacts and conditions as exist at present, and  tell\r\n\r\nthe  people those facts. Mr Speaker, we should not\r\n\r\nmake   sweet   promises  to  the   people   without\r\n\r\nconsidering  matters affecting  their  welfare.  We\r\n\r\nshould  put the true picture to them, although  the\r\n\r\npeople  may take it with a sense of fear. I believe\r\n\r\nthat only by such methods could we instil into  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  a  sense  of  consciousness\r\n\r\nwhereby they will be able to meet the challenge  of\r\n\r\nthe  time. So the sense of responsibility which  we\r\n\r\nexpect from the people has prompted us to tell them\r\n\r\nthe  truth  of  the  problems which  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  face if we are not  equipped  with\r\n\r\nwell-planned  proposals. Mr Speaker,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nguilty  if  we  hide  from the  people  the  facts,\r\n\r\nbecause we do not wish to spout hot air whilst  the\r\n\r\npeople  are hungry and their pockets are empty.  By\r\n\r\nhiding  the  true facts from them, we are  inviting\r\n\r\ndanger  to  the State. Based on these  facts,  this\r\n\r\nFour-Year Development Plan was drawn up in order to\r\n\r\novercome, within our capabilities, the difficulties\r\n\r\nwhich  we  face. It cannot be denied also that,  in\r\n\r\nview  of the size of Singapore in relation  to  its\r\n\r\npopulation, which is on the increase, and since the\r\n\r\nrate of childbirth is also growing at a rapid pace,\r\n\r\nevery human being must live, and everyone needs the\r\n\r\nbasic  requirements, such as a house, a  job,  etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we are without a proper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan, I believe Singapore in the  years\r\n\r\nto come will face a crucial time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in debating the Four-Year Development Plan immediately after the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance had delivered his speech,  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Aljunied  explained  that  the   Plan\r\n\r\nannounced  by  the  Minister was presented  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of  the coming by-election in Hong Lim.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied directly accused that the \r\n\r\nFour-Year  Development  Plan provided  capital  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  win  the by-election in Hong  Lim.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we hope there will be no other people  who\r\n\r\nare  suffering from nightmares during the  daytime,\r\n\r\nbecause  to  draw up such a gigantic plan  as  this\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan is not an easy task. It  requires\r\n\r\ncareful  analysis and study within the  context  of\r\n\r\nthe  present conditions in Singapore. It is not  as\r\n\r\neasy  as  had  been  clone by the  ex-Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  who drew  up  his  Five-Year\r\n\r\nhousing plan, which incurred an expenditure  of  $5\r\n\r\nmillion, merely on tine sheet of paper. We  need  a\r\n\r\nplan  which  has been thoroughly studied,  and  not\r\n\r\nwhat  I have said earlier on. However, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nit  would appear that the Member for Aljunied,  who\r\n\r\nhas  had occasion during this period leading up  to\r\n\r\nthe by-election in Hong Lim to proclaim himself  as\r\n\r\na  champion of the people on matters such as these,\r\n\r\nhas not touched on the contents of this Development\r\n\r\nPlan which has been tabled today, as though this is\r\n\r\na  small matter. The big issue is Hong Lim. This is\r\n\r\nonly in the mind of the Member for Aljunied. It may\r\n\r\nbe  that, because he is engaged in the coming  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  by-election in order to ensure victory, he has\r\n\r\nhad  no  time  to  go through the blue  book.  This\r\n\r\nclearly  indicates that he himself has no  interest\r\n\r\nin  the  welfare of the people, because this  \r\n\r\nFour-Year  Development Plan affects all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, then I heard the Member for Tanglin saying that industrial peace is non-existent and he\r\n\r\nputs  the blame on the Government. Mr Speaker,  if\r\n\r\nthere are people who think like this, then I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay to them that I deny such an accusation, because\r\n\r\neveryone knows that the non-existence of industrial\r\n\r\npeace  in Singapore should be put squarely  at  the\r\n\r\ndoor  of  several  political leaders,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose who were in power before the P.A.P. came into\r\n\r\npower  and  who are today sitting on the Opposition\r\n\r\nbench.  We  know  chat the policy of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment   was  a  biased  one.  The   Government\r\n\r\npampered  the capitalists but exploited the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  who  struggled for better  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.  For that reason, the P.A.P. is constantly\r\n\r\nfighting  for the betterment of the working  class.\r\n\r\nThe   Opposition   exploited   the   situation   by\r\n\r\ndisseminating  false  propaganda  during  the  past\r\n\r\nelection to frighten the capitalists from investing\r\n\r\ntheir  capital  in Singapore. The effect  could  be\r\n\r\nseen clearly because, as I have said just now, this\r\n\r\nparticular   group  is  closely  related   to   the\r\n\r\nemployers.  Actually  the  P.A.P.,  which  won  the\r\n\r\nelections,  constantly fight for the betterment  of\r\n\r\nthe  State  of Singapore, because it realises  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is merely an entrepot port and a  trading\r\n\r\ncentre.  Other  means  to  improve  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  non-existent. For that  reason,  we\r\n\r\nconstantly welcome the investment of capital, be it\r\n\r\nlocal  or  from abroad. But in this connection,  we\r\n\r\nonly hope this: let them invest as much capital  as\r\n\r\nthey  like,  but they must treat the working  class\r\n\r\nproperly.   It  is  hoped  that  on   this   mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  the  expansion  of  industry   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to make progress. We restate  our  policy\r\n\r\nwhich we proclaimed when we assumed office - that  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  pamper  one  lot whilst  exploiting  the\r\n\r\nother;  whilst fighting colonialism, which  is  our\r\n\r\nenemy  No. 1, we will always continue to be  guided\r\n\r\nby  the principle of justice to all sections of the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, it has been mentioned\r\n\r\nby the Member for Tanglin just now in this Assembly\r\n\r\nthat this Government is moving a motion calling  on\r\n\r\nall  sections of the people to unite to  make  this\r\n\r\nPlan  a  success.  But in the Hong Lim  by-election\r\n\r\nspeeches, the call is - let all the Left-wing  forces\r\n\r\nunite.  The issue is simple. I am sure even  school\r\n\r\nchildren   can   understand  and   appreciate   the\r\n\r\nsituation. He will be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstand  a  Left-wing  Party  because  Left-wing\r\n\r\npeople  are  asked to unite at all  times,  because\r\n\r\nthis   group   is   firm  in  its   fight   against\r\n\r\ncolonialism. The P.A.P. is a political Party  which\r\n\r\nopposes colonialism. For that purpose, we urge  all\r\n\r\nLeft-wing political Parties to unite in the  common\r\n\r\nstruggle   against  colonialism.  Besides  fighting\r\n\r\ncolonialism,  we are also striving  to  uphold  and\r\n\r\nmaintain law and order and economic stability. Some\r\n\r\ngroups  are biased, and they are inclined to  flirt\r\n\r\nwith  colonial  interests. However,  we  constantly\r\n\r\nremind  them  and all those people  who  are\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  to  be  careful in  their  fight  against\r\n\r\ncolonialism  so as not to be deceived by  the \r\n\r\npro-colonial groups by using political opportunists  as\r\n\r\ntheir tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have talked at length on matters which have been raised by the Opposition Members.\r\n\r\nLet  me  touch upon matters concerning my Ministry.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, my Ministry is responsible for solving\r\n\r\nthe  problems of the daily livelihood of the people\r\n\r\nof    Singapore.   According   to   the   Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan, land development and agricultural\r\n\r\npolicy come under economic development, whether  it\r\n\r\nrelates   to   the   housing   problem   or   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Concerning the  housing  problem,  we\r\n\r\nshould not overlook the fact that the rapid changes\r\n\r\nthat  have been taking place in Singapore over  the\r\n\r\nlast  100  years have resulted in the concentration\r\n\r\nof  the  population  in the  city  area,  with  the\r\n\r\nresultant   acute  overcrowding  of   people.   The\r\n\r\nexpansion was unplanned, with the result that  most\r\n\r\nof   the   existing   buildings   are   shop-houses\r\n\r\nconstructed  to  meet  the  requirements   of   the\r\n\r\nimmigrant  commercial community. Mr  Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of  these  shop-houses  are  very   old.\r\n\r\nAlthough land values are high, there has been  very\r\n\r\nlittle redevelopment in the central area because of\r\n\r\nthe  operation of rent control which pegs rents  at\r\n\r\ntheir  pre-September 1947 levels. A survey  of  the\r\n\r\nhousing needs of Singapore indicates that over  the\r\n\r\nnext  10 years, at least 147,000 housing units will\r\n\r\nbe   necessary   to  provide  for  the   increasing\r\n\r\npopulation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the former S.I.T. was responsible for much of the public housing since the years 1947\r\n\r\nto 1959. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  managed  to  build,  on  the  average,  1,700\r\n\r\nhousing   units  a  year,  although  in  its   peak\r\n\r\nyear - that  was  1958 - the S.I.T. completed  roughly\r\n\r\n3,841   housing  units.  In  order  to  grasp   the\r\n\r\nsituation, I will classify the development  o, the\r\n\r\nvarious  phases.  I will quote figures  of  housing\r\n\r\nunits built by the S.I.T. from 1955 to 1959. In the\r\n\r\nfirst phase in 1955, about 2,795 housing units were\r\n\r\nbuilt;  in  1956, 1,275; in 1957, 1,300;  in  1958,\r\n\r\n3,841; and in 1959, 1,517. The total for this \r\n\r\nfive-year  period was only nearly 10,000 housing  units.\r\n\r\nThis  includes work that was completed by  Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nEng Guan when he was the Manager of the S.I.T. from\r\n\r\nJune 1959 to January 1960, during which period  794\r\n\r\nhousing units were built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the second stage, that is,\r\n\r\nfrom  February l960 to April 1961, a total of 2,112\r\n\r\nhousing units were completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third stage, that is, the current\r\n\r\ndevelopment  stage, a total of 7,832 housing  units\r\n\r\nare being built: in Queenstown, 4,056 housing units\r\n\r\nare  being constructed; in Tiong Bahru at the  fire\r\n\r\nsite,  about 280 housing units; in MacPherson Road,\r\n\r\nabout  1,320  housing units:  in  the  Tiong  Bahru\r\n\r\ncemetery  site,  1,360 housing units;  and  in  St.\r\n\r\nMichael's  Estate, 816 housing units.  This  brings\r\n\r\nthe  total  to  7,832  housing units.  About  7,200\r\n\r\nhouses  will be completed by December  this  year.\r\n\r\nThis  means that from 1955 to 1959, the S.I.T. was\r\n\r\ncapable  of  building  only 10,728  housing  units,\r\n\r\nwhilst  from  1960 to 1961, the Housing Development\r\n\r\nBoard completed 9,312 housing units. The comparison\r\n\r\nis  10,000  housing units in five years as  against\r\n\r\n9,000  housing units in two years. This is  clearly\r\n\r\nshown by facts and figures, and we leave it to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first stage, according\r\n\r\nto  our  Four-Year Development Plan, in the current\r\n\r\nyear  it is estimated that $194.1 million has  been\r\n\r\nallocated  for  the construction of housing  units.\r\n\r\nThis includes expenditure now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  incurred of approximately $34.1 million  for\r\n\r\nthe  year 1961. As I said earlier, by December this\r\n\r\nyear, about 7,200 housing units will be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth phase will begin from 1962. In 1962,\r\n\r\nabout  $40.7  million has been set  aside  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of housing units. We propose to build  in\r\n\r\nQueenstown, 7.395 units; in Kallang, 1,420; and in\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, 920; making a total of 9,735  housing\r\n\r\nunits.  In 1963, expenditure to the tune of roughly\r\n\r\n$33.8  million  will be spent on  the  building  of\r\n\r\n9,690 housing units in Toa Payoh. In 1964, the cost\r\n\r\nof  the  building  programme will amount  to  $44.5\r\n\r\nmillion for the erection of 3,570 housing units  at\r\n\r\nMacPherson Road: 6,120 at Toa Payoh; and  3,060  at\r\n\r\nThomson; making a total of 12,750 housing units. An\r\n\r\namount  of $44.5 million will be spent. After  this\r\n\r\nfour-year  period, we shall have to  continue  with\r\n\r\nthe  housing programme in order to meet the housing\r\n\r\ndemand. We will have to spend $41 million for  1965\r\n\r\nto  erect 11,760 housing units: at MacPherson Road,\r\n\r\n1,930; at Toa Payoh, 9,690; at Covent Garden,  544;\r\n\r\nmaking a total of about 11,760 housing units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not hastily carry out our\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme. The plans have been formulated\r\n\r\nwith  care and according to our design. In  future,\r\n\r\nwe  hope to build one-room units at a capital  cost\r\n\r\nof  $2,000  per unit; two-room units at $3,700  per\r\n\r\nunit; and three-room units at $4,700 per unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese   costs,  however,  make  no  provision   for\r\n\r\nexpensive piling or land cost. The new units to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in 1962 and thereafter will comprise 30  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  one-room units, 40 per cent  of  two-room\r\n\r\nunits,  and  30 per cent of three-room  units.  The\r\n\r\nquestion will arise why so many two-room units  are\r\n\r\nbeing  built. The reason is that an average  family\r\n\r\nhas  at  least  five persons, and  with  the  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  population, it is  possible  that  each\r\n\r\nfamily  will  have  about  ten  persons.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason, we are building more of two-room units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main item in the Development Plan for housing\r\n\r\nover   the  period  of  the  Plan  will   be   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51,031 public housing units on land which has  been\r\n\r\nacquired  and  held  for  the  purpose  of  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment  by  the Government.  There  are  1,300\r\n\r\nacres of this land spread over the west, north  and\r\n\r\ncentral  sections  of  the City.  They  are  mainly\r\n\r\nconcentrated  around the Kampong  Bahru,  Alexandra\r\n\r\nand  Queenstown areas in the west; around  the  St.\r\n\r\nMichael  and  Toa  Payoh areas in  the  north;  and\r\n\r\naround  the  MacPherson Road, Kallang,  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nand  Tanjong  Rhu  areas in the centre.  The  major\r\n\r\nbuilding   activities  will  be   concentrated   in\r\n\r\nQueenstown  where  two  neighbourhoods  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt; and in the Toa Payoh area, some 500 acres of\r\n\r\nland  have  yet  to  be  cleared  of  settlers  for\r\n\r\nhousing.  A few contracts for building multi-storey\r\n\r\nblocks  of  flats have already been given  out  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown. It is proposed to develop the Toa Payoh\r\n\r\narea over a period of four years in eight phases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder,   Sir, It  would  appear  that   what   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary is saying is just  a  Malay\r\n\r\ntranslation  of  Chapter  X.

This will  go  a  long  way  to\r\n\r\nameliorate the slum areas in the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt at length on the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  housing. Now, I will move  on  to  the\r\n\r\nsubject   of  rural  development.  What  were   the\r\n\r\nproposals  that had been implemented by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  or  whether these proposals  could  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out? In this blue book, the proposals  for\r\n\r\nthe  use  of land concerning rural development  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  rearing of poultry will amount to  $26.15\r\n\r\nmillion. Mr Speaker, before we go on to the future\r\n\r\nproposals,  let us see what has been  done  in  the\r\n\r\npast   which  has  prompted  us  to  present   this\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan for the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, the expansion of existing services and\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of new  schemes  and  services\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  the  P.A.P. Government  since  it\r\n\r\nassumed  office  in  June 1959 have  benefited  and\r\n\r\nassisted the farmers and fishermen in the following\r\n\r\nways.  Farmers  can  get  their  land  ploughed  at\r\n\r\ncheaper  rates. Their young chickens below the  age\r\n\r\nof  six weeks can now be protected against ranikhet\r\n\r\nby  nasal  inoculation. Some  1,300  pigs  of  good\r\n\r\nstrain  have  been  sold to them to  improve  their\r\n\r\nstock.  Mr Speaker, more young fishermen  can  now\r\n\r\nget  training in fishing techniques. We  have  been\r\n\r\nable   to  give  advice  and  instruction  on  farm\r\n\r\nsanitation. Good husbandry practice, including  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  and treatment of diseases of farm animals,\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  available to  them  at  their  own\r\n\r\nvillages.  A  more  efficient  chicken  inoculation\r\n\r\nservice   as  well  as  a  more  efficient  disease\r\n\r\ntreatment service have been made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Four-Year Development Plan, the above\r\n\r\nservices   will  be  continued  and  much   further\r\n\r\nimproved.  In  addition, the farmers  will  benefit\r\n\r\nfurther  in  the  following ways. They  can  get  a\r\n\r\nlimited number of day-old chicks of good strain  at\r\n\r\nreasonable prices. A lot of effort has been put  in\r\n\r\nin  order to produce a good strain of chicks.  More\r\n\r\ngood farmland, more fish ponds and more prawn ponds\r\n\r\nwill   be   made   available  for  increasing   the\r\n\r\nproduction of farmers and fishermen as a result  of\r\n\r\nswamp  reclamation work. Fishermen in the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  can  start rearing goats  with  Government\r\n\r\nassistance to increase their income. Films will  be\r\n\r\nshown  at  villages  and fishing  villages  in  the\r\n\r\nfarming areas, to show them the improved and latest\r\n\r\ntechniques. Farmers also can get advice on  how  to\r\n\r\ncontrol pests and diseases of vegetables and  fruit\r\n\r\ntrees and on haw to control their soil. Details  of\r\n\r\nthese schemes and services are as explained in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New schemes and services started since June 1959\r\n\r\nwhich   will   be  continued  in  the   course   of\r\n\r\nimplementing the Four-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Cheap ploughing service: This service was\r\n\r\nstarted  towards the end of 1959 with  one  tractor\r\n\r\n(35  h.p.)  to assist farmers to plough their  land\r\n\r\nwith  mechanised equipment in order  to  cut  their\r\n\r\ncost of production and to increase their productive\r\n\r\ncapacity.  This service has proved so popular  that\r\n\r\nin  August  1950 two additional tractors (52  h.p.)\r\n\r\nwere  added.  The Primary Production Department  is\r\n\r\ncharging from $25 to $35 per acre depending on  the\r\n\r\nnature  of the land ploughed, as against  the  high\r\n\r\nrate charged by commercial tractor services of  $55\r\n\r\nto  $60 per acre. This is very much more than  that\r\n\r\ncharged  by  the Primary Production Department.  In\r\n\r\n1959  a  total of 10 acres were ploughed, while  in\r\n\r\n1960 about 160 acres were ploughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Nasal chick inoculation service: In the past\r\n\r\nthe  inoculation against ranikhet disease in  fowls\r\n\r\nwas  carried out by using hypodermic needles  only,\r\n\r\nso that only chickens of more than six weeks of age\r\n\r\ncould be inoculated. As a result, chickens of under\r\n\r\nsix  weeks  of age were not protected against  this\r\n\r\ndisease.  A  new  scheme has been  implemented  for\r\n\r\ninoculating day-old chicks with vaccine through the\r\n\r\nnasal  cavity, and this service was started towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1960. This will protect them from  the\r\n\r\nday-old  stage. This service has been  welcomed  by\r\n\r\nthe farmers, and it helps them to cut their cost of\r\n\r\nproduction.  So  far, 205,000  chickens  have  been\r\n\r\ninoculated during the first three months since  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Distribution of pigs of improved strain:\r\n\r\nExperimental work is being carried out continuously\r\n\r\nto produce improved strains of pigs and poultry for\r\n\r\ndistribution  to  farmers. Since  June  1959,  over\r\n\r\n1,300  pigs  of improved strain have been  sold  to\r\n\r\nfarmers to assist them to improve their stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Fisheries training courses: In order to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the need to provide employment for youths  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas and to prepare young fishermen for\r\n\r\nthe expansion of off-shore and deep-sea fishing,  a\r\n\r\npilot fisheries training course was started at  the\r\n\r\nMalay  school  at  6\u00be m.s. Pasir Panjang  to  teach\r\n\r\nyouths, among other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubjects,  the  maintenance and repair  of  fishing\r\n\r\nboat  engines,  the  construction  and  repair   of\r\n\r\nfishing  gears and fishing boats and the  `rule  of\r\n\r\nthe road at sea'. This is only a preliminary course\r\n\r\nand  more advanced courses will be conducted  later\r\n\r\nunder this Four-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in addition to the problems of the farmers, in order to assist them to improve their\r\n\r\ntechniques in animal husbandry, a series  of  talks\r\n\r\nhas  been  started early this year, 1961, by  rural\r\n\r\norganisers  of  the Primary Production  Department,\r\n\r\nwith  a  veterinary  officer in  attendance.  These\r\n\r\ntalks deal with the most important aspects of  farm\r\n\r\nsanitation    and   animal   husbandry   practices,\r\n\r\nincluding the control and treatment of diseases  of\r\n\r\nfarm  animals. These talks have been well  attended\r\n\r\nby  farmers  and attended also by their  wives  and\r\n\r\nchildren.  These  talks have  been  useful  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, besides introducing new schemes since June 1959, the Government has also expanded\r\n\r\nmany existing services to benefit more farmers  and\r\n\r\nto  give  them  improved  services.  The  following\r\n\r\nservices have been expanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chick inoculation service by hypodermic\r\n\r\ninjection:  This  service, Mr  Speaker,  has  been\r\n\r\nstreamlined   and   expanded  by   employing   more\r\n\r\ninoculators  so  that the farmers will  get  prompt\r\n\r\nservice.  A system of registration for the  service\r\n\r\nhas been formulated and is implemented strictly  so\r\n\r\nas to ensure that there is no favouritism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farm animal disease treatment service: Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  prior  to  June 1959,  the  treatment  of\r\n\r\ndiseases of pigs and poultry in the rural areas was\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  the field by only one  veterinary\r\n\r\nofficer.  Since then this service has been improved\r\n\r\nand  expanded  by utilising the services  of  three\r\n\r\nveterinary  officers for the purpose. This  ensures\r\n\r\nthat  the  service  for the farmers  is  much  more\r\n\r\nprompt than during the period prior to June 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free stud boar service: This service provides for\r\n\r\nthe  farmers the service of high quality stud boars\r\n\r\nin  order to improve the strain of the pigs.  Since\r\n\r\nJune 1959, a new veterinary extension centre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  established at Jurong where  seven  stud\r\n\r\nbears  are kept for the free use of the farmers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  areas.  Mr Speaker,  those  were  the\r\n\r\nservices and schemes which were implemented  during\r\n\r\nthe past year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new schemes and services under the Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan are as under. Since the Government\r\n\r\nassumed  office in June 1959, careful and  detailed\r\n\r\nplans have been drawn up to cater for the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe   farmers  and  fishermen  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nfollowing plans have already been finalised, or are\r\n\r\nalready  being implemented, or will be  implemented\r\n\r\nunder our Four-Year Development Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Improved stud boar service: Increased\r\n\r\nproduction  of stud boars has already been  put  in\r\n\r\nhand at the Government Animal Husbandry Stations so\r\n\r\nthat in a year or two, many more stud boars will be\r\n\r\navailable for the free use of farmers all over  the\r\n\r\nState,  and  some of these boars will  be  sold  to\r\n\r\nfarmers at very reasonable rates. This is in  order\r\n\r\nto improve the strains of pigs in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Improved strains of poultry: Improved strains\r\n\r\nof  poultry  are also being produced at  Government\r\n\r\nstations, and it is expected that towards  the  end\r\n\r\nof  1961  the  sale  of better strains  of  day-old\r\n\r\nchicks  to  farmers could be started on  a  limited\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are being drawn up to reclaim 4,000 acres\r\n\r\nof  swamp  land so that about 1,000 acres  of  good\r\n\r\nfarming land, 2,000 acres of fish ponds, and  1,000\r\n\r\nacres  of  prawn  ponds will be made  available  to\r\n\r\nfarmers  and fishermen to increase their production\r\n\r\nto meet the needs of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Four-Year Development Plan, we have concentrated on Government Animal Husbandry\r\n\r\nStations  and also on the distribution of goats  to\r\n\r\nthe  Southern Islanders, about which plans are  in\r\n\r\nprogress, and the islanders have now been asked  to\r\n\r\ngrow  grass  in  order to provide  food  for  their\r\n\r\ngoats.  The  Film  Unit will also  be  improved  to\r\n\r\nenable the farmers to learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soil testing and spraying service will also be\r\n\r\nprovided. Mr Speaker, despite the fact that we are\r\n\r\nshort of land, yet we can be proud of the fact that\r\n\r\nour  farmers and fishermen have shown their ability\r\n\r\nto produce and rear poultry with good results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is no exaggeration to say that this Four-Year Development Plan is not merely a\r\n\r\nfilm  show  to entertain the audience - in this  case\r\n\r\nthe  voters  or the people of Singapore - or  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to winning the election. But as a responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it is our duty to bring  home  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore the problems which we are faced\r\n\r\nwith;  and  we  hope that the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith  a  sense  of  responsibility,  in  order   to\r\n\r\nmaintain economic stability, will give their \r\n\r\nwhole-hearted  support  in  implementing  this  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan. Mr Speaker, I fully support this\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been\r\n\r\nsitting still listening to the election speeches of\r\n\r\nthe  Back-benchers from the Government side. It  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a  pity  that the motion on  a  very  sober\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan presented by  the  Minister \r\n\r\nfor Finance  in  this blue book, and in a speech  which\r\n\r\nwas  just  as sober, should have been used  by  the\r\n\r\nBack-benchers of the Government as an occasion  for\r\n\r\nmaking  election speeches. Sir, I cannot understand\r\n\r\nwhy,  after such a very able and sober presentation\r\n\r\nby  the Minister for Finance, who has called on all\r\n\r\npeople to put their shoulders to the wheel and work\r\n\r\nfor  the  good  of  the people of Singapore,  there\r\n\r\nshould be Backbenchers of the Government who do not\r\n\r\nheed  his call, why they should indulge in election\r\n\r\nspeeches   and  yet  in  their  enthusiasm   forget\r\n\r\nthemselves and try to say, as they are always  wont\r\n\r\nto do, how bad the past Government was and how good\r\n\r\nthe present Government is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is true!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But surely, Sir, even in this\r\n\r\nblue   book,   it  has  been  said   that   certain\r\n\r\nlegislation  was introduced; and may I  remind  the\r\n\r\nBack-benchers  on the Government benches  that  the\r\n\r\nlegislation referred to by the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nis   legislation   introduced   by   the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and that if we had been  returned,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  put into practice what we had  already\r\n\r\nprepared.  We are not here, Sir, to make  political\r\n\r\nspeeches, because we are not interested in the Hong\r\n\r\nLim by-election at all. But when the seriousness of\r\n\r\nthe situation presented by the Minister for Finance is  being twisted by Government Back-benchers  into\r\n\r\npolitical  speeches, saying how good they  are  and\r\n\r\nhow  bad  other people are, I must, as a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, stand up and correct them and  say\r\n\r\nthat  this is not the time. If they really mean  to\r\n\r\ncall   on   the  co-operation  of  all  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   this   is  not  the   time   to   cast\r\n\r\nrecriminations,  although  such  recriminations  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular case are unjustified. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture still maintains the stand that\r\n\r\nthe  views of the Opposition are of no value to the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and he still could not care  less  how\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition votes. If so, one could excuse  the\r\n\r\nBack-benchers. But one finds it difficult when  two\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries, one in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and the other in the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, indulged in the same kind of  election\r\n\r\nspeeches.  How  bad  we  were  in  our  educational\r\n\r\npolicy!  How  crooked we were and how  honest  they\r\n\r\nare!  May  I  tell them this: their honesty,  their\r\n\r\ngood work, all that they say that they have done in\r\n\r\nthe  past two years will be judged in Hong Lim?  We\r\n\r\nare  not judging them. The people of Hong Lim  will\r\n\r\njudge  what  they have done in the past two  years.\r\n\r\nThey  do not have to try and say. \"We are so  good.\r\n\r\nThe others are so had. They are so dirty. We are so\r\n\r\nclean.\"  If  it  makes them any happier,  they  can\r\n\r\nclaim they are as clean as they want to. But I  say\r\n\r\nthat  what they think of themselves does not count.\r\n\r\nIt  is what the people think of them that counts in\r\n\r\nparliamentary    democracy.    The    Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nhas overlooked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  fact that, for the first time, we are  working\r\n\r\nunder  a  self-governing  Constitution,  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the day has full powers in so far  as\r\n\r\ndomestic   problems  are  concerned.  The  previous\r\n\r\nGovernments  were  nothing  but  partial   colonial\r\n\r\nadministrations.  During my time the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, known as the Financial Secretary,  was  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate   officer   and  a   colonial   servant.\r\n\r\n[Laughter] The Prime Minister may well laugh,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  the Prime Minister must have been aware of the\r\n\r\nrestrictions   of  the  Rendel  Constitution,   and\r\n\r\nbecause  we  were so aware of the restrictions,  we\r\n\r\ngot  an All-Party delegation to go to London to get\r\n\r\na  new  Constitution, and this is the  Constitution\r\n\r\nunder  which they are now working. During our time,\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council was a separate authority.  There\r\n\r\nwas  their great ex-comrade, the great ex-Mayor  of\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council against whom they  are  fighting\r\n\r\ntoday  in  a  by-election. The City Council  was  a\r\n\r\nseparate authority. We had no control over it in so\r\n\r\nfar  as  its development was concerned. The  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nwas  an  autonomous body. It was  not  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  as  it  now is. It had its own  autonomy  in\r\n\r\nplanning   housing.  The  Harbour  Board,  another\r\n\r\nauthority,  had  its  own plans,  and  so  had  the\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board.  But, Sir, the  reason  why  this\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan was not introduced at  that  time\r\n\r\nwas  that  there was then no necessity to introduce\r\n\r\nit.  There was no such unemployment problem  as  we\r\n\r\nhave today. But we were aware that such a situation\r\n\r\nwould arise in the years to come. That was why  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government introduced legislation to  pave\r\n\r\nthe way for the industrialisation of Singapore. The\r\n\r\npresent   Government   is  now   benefiting   under\r\n\r\nlegislation  introduced by the previous Government.\r\n\r\nYet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  said that  we  were \r\n\r\nafraid - \"afraid\" was the word he used. We were not  afraid.\r\n\r\nWe  were restricted. Yet we were wise. If we had in\r\n\r\nany  way  helped the P.A.P. towards  drawing  up  a\r\n\r\nDevelopment Programme, we ask for no credit. We say\r\n\r\nwe  serve the people. Let the people judge.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot  have to make election speeches 17 days before\r\n\r\nPolling Day in Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary said that during our time we were a pro-capitalist Government. Yet today\r\n\r\nthey   are   working   under   labour   legislation\r\n\r\nintroduced by the previous Government. Yet, if they\r\n\r\nremember  rightly, during our time when  they  were\r\n\r\nleading  the trade unions in a militant  form,  did\r\n\r\nthey  not  get what they wanted? Did they  not  get\r\n\r\njustice  done when strikes took place and they  had\r\n\r\nconciliations taking place in my Ministry  at  that\r\n\r\ntime?  Did  we not give justice to the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore? Do not call us pro-capitalists. We would\r\n\r\nnot  like  to  describe the P.A.P. as something  or\r\n\r\nother,  although they cannot deny  that  they  have\r\n\r\nLeft-wing   adventurers  and  so-called   Communist\r\n\r\nsympathisers in their Party. We would not call them\r\n\r\nthat.   We   say  they  are  a  genuine  democratic\r\n\r\npolitical Party. Before you ask the people to  work\r\n\r\ntogether,  do not slap them. Today, the P.A.P. ask\r\n\r\nfor  capital - more and more investment. But what did\r\n\r\nthey  say, Sir, during the general elections? \"Down\r\n\r\nwith capital! I will throw you into the sea if  you\r\n\r\ndo  not  co-operate with us. But if you  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith  us, you can at least still carry on for  five\r\n\r\nyears.\" And yet the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development said  we  drove\r\n\r\naway capital. We drove away capital? Yet he said we\r\n\r\nwere  pro-capital. That we drove away our  friends!\r\n\r\nSir,  a lot of mistakes and blunders have been made\r\n\r\nby  the  Party in power. They themselves admit  it.\r\n\r\nThey   say  that  rectification  is  taking  place.\r\n\r\nBecause  there was a rectification in the dismissal\r\n\r\nof the Minister for National Development, there was\r\n\r\na heave of relief that a genuine rectification took\r\n\r\nplace;  that  perhaps the P.A.P., now  knowing  the\r\n\r\nerror of their ways, are learning that in this game\r\n\r\nof  running a government one must play fair to  all\r\n\r\nparties.  But  no. When it suits  them,  they  say,\r\n\r\n\"Down with capital! Out with the British! Kick them\r\n\r\ninto  the sea!\" When it no longer suits them,  they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Please  help  us  to help  ourselves.\"  They\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  the doctrine of slapping a man  first,\r\n\r\nthen  going down on their bended knees to  ask  for\r\n\r\nassistance. That is not the way to run a government\r\n\r\nto serve the people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Serving the people of  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nsacred  task.  The  livelihood  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is in the hands of the Government. It  is\r\n\r\na  sacred  duty  and they should not play  politics\r\n\r\nwith that sacred duty. We were prepared to stand up\r\n\r\nand  say  today that the Plan is a good plan;  that\r\n\r\nany  decent government, any government that  claims\r\n\r\nto  be  Socialist, has to introduce such a plan  in\r\n\r\norder to meet the growing unemployment problem. But\r\n\r\nwe  did not stand up to speak immediately after the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Minister for Finance, because he said\r\n\r\nthat  his  Ministerial colleagues  will  be  making\r\n\r\nknown  in  this House what they have done and  what\r\n\r\nthey propose to do. Surely, Sir, being a handful of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, we must before we  speak  give\r\n\r\nrespect  to  Ministerial speeches, so that  we  can\r\n\r\nstand  up and tell them, \"Well done!\" or tell them,\r\n\r\n\"Look  here,  that  is not the way  to  carry  on.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I did not speak. I waited and I  thought\r\n\r\nthere  would have been gems of wisdom. There  would\r\n\r\nhave  been sober speeches saying, \"We are dedicated\r\n\r\nto  the  service of the country.\" Instead of  which\r\n\r\nthey  say,  \"We,  the  P.A.P., - the  lightning - will\r\n\r\nstrike and strike capital away!\" And we are blamed.\r\n\r\nToday, the Government call on us to work with them.\r\n\r\nKick  a man down and then say. \"You are my friend.\"\r\n\r\nI tell the Government that they still have a lot to\r\n\r\nlearn,  that  in this sacred duty of looking  after\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of the people of Singapore,  politics\r\n\r\nmust  not  be played, and the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nknows  it very well. The motion is worded  in  such\r\n\r\nlanguage  as to appeal even to those who are  \r\n\r\nanti-P.A.P. We were quite touched by such an appeal.  We\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to say, \"Aha, here is  a  Government\r\n\r\nthat  has  learnt  the error of  its  ways  and  is\r\n\r\ncalling on all people to work together for the good\r\n\r\nof  the country.\" Instead of which they slap right,\r\n\r\nleft, centre, jeer, and ask us to vote and say, \"We\r\n\r\nsupport.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this motion there is exhortation to the\r\n\r\nworkers   and   trade   unions,   businessmen   and\r\n\r\nindustrialists.  May I hope,  Sir,  to  exhort  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   a   better   sense    of    their\r\n\r\nresponsibility: that if they want co-operation from\r\n\r\nthe people, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould first of all deserve that co-operation? They\r\n\r\nshould  not  go  out insulting the people,  kicking\r\n\r\nthem  about  and  saying. \"We  require  your  help.\r\n\r\nWithout you we cannot work this Plan.\" That is  not\r\n\r\nthe  way.  This blue print fortunately is  in  very\r\n\r\nsober  language,  and  fortunately  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in helping in the industrialisation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be guided by this blue  book.  They\r\n\r\nwill not be guided by the speeches made by the\r\n\r\nBack-benchers  of the Government, because they will  not\r\n\r\nhave  the time nor the desire to find out  what  is\r\n\r\nbeing  said  by  the  Back-benchers.  I  hope  not.\r\n\r\nBecause if they do, the Government can be sure they\r\n\r\nare not coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, the Minister for Finance has to\r\n\r\nsay  a  little bit about what has been said by  the\r\n\r\nopposing  candidate  in  Hong  Lim.  That  we   can\r\n\r\nunderstand. That we will overlook. But  when  other\r\n\r\nMembers from the Government side speak with an  eye\r\n\r\non  the  coming Hong Lim by-election, it  makes  me\r\n\r\nfeel that perhaps there might be some truth in  it.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance in his speech  said  that\r\n\r\nearly  this  year  proof copies of the  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  were sent to the Government Printer. This  is\r\n\r\nApril.  Early  this year could be, at  the  latest,\r\n\r\nFebruary. Why hold this up until April, Sir, if  it\r\n\r\nwas  really  sent to the Government  Printer  early\r\n\r\nthis  year?  I will not say that they are  holding\r\n\r\nthis  up for a purpose. But I do say that they  are\r\n\r\nnot  giving the Opposition a fair chance. They sent\r\n\r\nthis  book  out and we received it on the  31st  of\r\n\r\nMarch.  At the last sitting of this Assembly,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Leader  of the House moved that  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nstood adjourn till today, we were not aware of  any\r\n\r\nbusiness for today's sitting. We received notice of\r\n\r\nthis  very important motion for the welfare, \r\n\r\nwell-being and livelihood of the people of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  poor  unemployed only at 3.30 p.m. on  Monday.\r\n\r\nThat  is  about  two  days  ago.  Of  course,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment sent in the notice within the stipulated\r\n\r\ntime,  that is to say, by Saturday. And because  we\r\n\r\nreceived  it late on Monday afternoon, it could  be\r\n\r\nthat  they sent it almost at the very last  minute.\r\n\r\nWhy  must  it  be  so, Sir? Perhaps the  Ministers,\r\n\r\nparticularly the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, were so involved  in  seeing\r\n\r\nthat they do not lose Hong Lim to Mr Ong Eng Guan.\r\n\r\nBut  even so, the Minister for Finance must realise\r\n\r\nthat  on  an  important issue  of  this  kind,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  must be given a fair chance,  at  least\r\n\r\nlonger notice, to study this Development Plan so as\r\n\r\nto  be  able  to  contribute intelligently  to  the\r\n\r\ndebate. Fortunately for us and fortunately for  me,\r\n\r\nI  at  least  know  what this Plan  is  all  about,\r\n\r\nbecause  part of this Plan was our Plan. I  had  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  But  I must tell the  Government  that\r\n\r\nwhen they require the co-operation and help of even\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition,  that  co-operation  is  willingly\r\n\r\ngiven if it is in the interest of the country.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  they  ask for that co-operation, they  should\r\n\r\nremember that they must give the Opposition a  fair\r\n\r\nchance of contributing to this debate. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance in his speech has said that some of the\r\n\r\nprojects  which  he  inherited  from  the  previous\r\n\r\nadministrations  were already in rough  form.  Even\r\n\r\nthe  blue  book says so. And yet we have the \r\n\r\nBack-benchers on the other side saying that when we were\r\n\r\nin  the government, we were a rotten government and\r\n\r\nthey for the first time in the history of Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  introduced a Development Plan. I am  prepared\r\n\r\nto pay them credit. Because of the scrapping of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council,  because  of  the  creation  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board,  because of the  Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  and  the Telephone Board being brought  more\r\n\r\nunder their control, they are at least able,  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to present an overall picture.  During\r\n\r\nour  time we could only do what was good with  what\r\n\r\npower  we  had  under  the Constitution.  The  City\r\n\r\nCouncil had a great Mayor who did what he wanted to\r\n\r\ndo and was greatly acclaimed by the P.A.P. He is no\r\n\r\nlonger acclaimed. He is being spat at and called  a\r\n\r\nliar  openly.  We  had  no control  over  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  We  had  no  control over  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust.  Moreover,  we  had  a  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister who was a colonial official. So even if we\r\n\r\nhad wanted to draw up a Development Plan, how could\r\n\r\nwe?  But  as I have said earlier, and I  seek  your\r\n\r\nindulgence,  Mr Speaker, Sir, if  I  repeat  again\r\n\r\nthis,  because we knew that such a thing must  come\r\n\r\nand  has  to come, we laid the foundation.  So  the\r\n\r\nPioneer Industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance is now on the statute book. The Extension\r\n\r\nof  Industries Ordinance was introduced by us. Also\r\n\r\nthe  Control of Manufacture Ordinance and even  the\r\n\r\namendment to the Customs Ordinance whereby power is\r\n\r\ngiven  to the Minister to introduce straightaway  a\r\n\r\nprotective tariff to see that any industry that  is\r\n\r\ngiven  pioneer status in the country is  not  being\r\n\r\njeopardized  by  the import of  goods  coming  from\r\n\r\nforeign countries. All these were laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, a government which is to be\r\n\r\nworthy  of  its  name - and the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\nworthy  of  its  name - has to present a  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  at this particular juncture. It has to. There\r\n\r\nis   no  other  way  of  solving  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem. But it knows its limitations, it has to go\r\n\r\nand  borrow about $501 million. So even  if  we  as\r\n\r\nindividuals are to go and borrow money, there  must\r\n\r\nbe  some  goodwill.  May I ask  what  goodwill  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government has as a result of  its  present\r\n\r\nutterances?  I must admit the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nis doing a very, very tough job indeed, but all his\r\n\r\nefforts  are being, if I may say so in this  House,\r\n\r\ndamaged by some of his Ministerial colleagues. Here\r\n\r\nis  the  Minister for Finance saying, \"Let us  work\r\n\r\nand  stand  together. Let us see  that  everybody's\r\n\r\ninterest is properly and fairly represented.\"  Then\r\n\r\nwe have the Minister for Labour and Law saying, \"If\r\n\r\nyou  do  not do this, I shall detain you under  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.\"  What is this? You want the  goodwill  of\r\n\r\nemployers,  and yet you threaten to use a  security\r\n\r\nOrdinance   meant   for  subversives   against   an\r\n\r\nemployer.  There are instances where  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law has ticked trade unions off; but\r\n\r\nwhere they have been ticked off, I can assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that they are not P.A.P. trade unions. Where\r\n\r\nthen  is the justification? If it is a P.A.P. led\r\n\r\ntrade  union, \"Ah, good, the P.P.S.O. against  the\r\n\r\nemployer.\"  If it is not a P.A.P. led trade  union,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you are wrong; go back to work.\" Sir, that\r\n\r\nis  not  the  way  to get the co-operation  of  all\r\n\r\npeople.  In  this  game of life  and  death,  there\r\n\r\nshould be no party politics. The Government will be\r\n\r\njudged  even without its saying, \"We are the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWe  gave you this.\" If after four years, this  Plan\r\n\r\nsucceeds, there is no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  for  them to run down any previous government\r\n\r\nby  saying  that  they are a good  Government.  The\r\n\r\npeople  will know, how to vote. If they  have  done\r\n\r\nwell,  they  do not have to start playing  politics\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even this blue book says that the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan is just a little scratch  on  the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem - just a little help.  But  what\r\n\r\nis  more  important  is  the  industrialisation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and we agree with them. Everybody agrees\r\n\r\nwith  them. Industrialisation is the only solution,\r\n\r\nand  this  Development Plan is aimed at  increasing\r\n\r\nthe   facilities  for  industrialisation.  To  that\r\n\r\nextent,  it  is  a good Plan. It must  receive  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  all  right-thinking  people.  But  the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  of Singapore is  another  thing,\r\n\r\nSir. When the P.A.P. came into power, what did  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance  say?  \"Oh,  the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not even think of some bright  idea\r\n\r\nlike  the Common Commodity Market\", although during\r\n\r\nmy  time  we  had  discussions with the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  how  we should  not  step  on  each\r\n\r\nother's  toes.  Insofar  as  industrialisation   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, there should be a Pan-Malayan  Committee\r\n\r\nadvising  on the opening up of factories.  If  this\r\n\r\nCommittee  is to advise that soap factories  should\r\n\r\nbe  in the Federation, then there should be no soap\r\n\r\nfactories  in  Singapore; and if  a  steel  factory\r\n\r\nshould  be  in Singapore, then there should  be  no\r\n\r\nsteel factory in the Federation. And that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What helps?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And still they say we had no\r\n\r\nidea.  But  the  Common  Commodity  Market  is  the\r\n\r\nanswer.  Today one would have expected the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  to  say something  about  the  Common\r\n\r\nCommodity Market. But not a word. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  said that without a Common  Commodity\r\n\r\nMarket, industrialisation will fail. Has he told us\r\n\r\nwhat  has  happened to the Common Commodity  Market\r\n\r\ntalks   with  the  Federation?  If  they  are   not\r\n\r\nsuccessful  or if they are still proceeding,  could\r\n\r\nhe  give us some idea? \"Oh, no, it is a bad  thing.\r\n\r\nWe must cover up because it is no good. There is  a\r\n\r\nby-election  in  Hong Lim. 29th  April  is  Polling\r\n\r\nDay.\" That is not the way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   handle  a  very,  very  serious  problem.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance himself has admitted  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse that unless we have an understanding with the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  on  the  Common   Commodity\r\n\r\nMarket,  industrialisation will fail in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  he  has changed his views. But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink   he  can  say  this,  Sir.  He  is  a   very\r\n\r\nresponsible  Minister and he knows the  urgency  of\r\n\r\nhaving  an agreement with the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation  cannot  succeed   in   Singapore\r\n\r\nunless   there   is  an  understanding   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. There are certain reasons why\r\n\r\nhe  cannot  succeed. Of course,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  can  say that although Singapore  has  1.6\r\n\r\nmillion  people and the Federation has 6.5  million\r\n\r\npeople,  yet  the  purchasing power  is  the  same.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if factories were to open in  Singapore\r\n\r\nit   would  be  quite  all  right.  But  does   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   not   realise  that   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   already   started    plans    to\r\n\r\nindustrialise   Johore  Bahru   just   across   the\r\n\r\nCauseway? Does the Government not realise that  the\r\n\r\nfactories  in  Bukit Timah today  could  simply  go\r\n\r\nacross to Johore Bahru where they have at least the\r\n\r\nknowledge that they do not have a Government  which\r\n\r\nsets  upon  them at times and then calls upon  them\r\n\r\nfor their co-operation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nsuddenly  walks in and chips in \"employers\".

If it  is  a\r\n\r\nbait,  do  not think that that is the way to  serve\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Singapore.  We  should  not  play\r\n\r\npolitics with the livelihood of unemployed  people.\r\n\r\nThere are 80,000 of them today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How many? You have not read\r\n\r\nthe Plan. It is not-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Some Members on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side  have not been present  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  speech of the Member for Cairnhill. So perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  have  lost track of what he has said.  But  I\r\n\r\nmust, in any event, prevent any repetition of  what\r\n\r\nhas been said in the past. Even though Ministers on\r\n\r\nthe  Government side have not chosen to be  present\r\n\r\nduring  the  speech  of the Member  for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nthere must not be any tedious repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I was saying that\r\n\r\nindustrialisation cannot succeed  if  there  is  no\r\n\r\nunderstanding with the Government of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  As  it  is today,  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Government of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  are  competing  in their  industrialisation\r\n\r\nplans and each of them is trying to get as much  as\r\n\r\nthey  can on the same market. Unless there  can  be\r\n\r\nthat understanding, and if the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ncan  say  that the Common Commodity Market idea  is\r\n\r\nnow  a  reality,  then I think there  is  hope  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before an industrialist starts a factory in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   he   wants  to   know   his   consumer\r\n\r\npotentiality. The consumer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotentiality  for  Singapore is  just  1.6  million\r\n\r\npeople,  whereas  if he opens his  factory  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,   just  in  Johore  Bahru   - which   is\r\n\r\nseparated  by one mile of the Causeway - he  has  6.5\r\n\r\nmillion  plus  1  .6  million  (the  whole  Malayan\r\n\r\nmarket)  at  his  disposal. So which  industrialist\r\n\r\nwill  want  to open a factory in Singapore  if,  by\r\n\r\ndoing  so in the Federation, he also has the market\r\n\r\nin Singapore? Therefore, some understanding or some\r\n\r\narrangement is desirable and vitally necessary with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. Again, if one says that\r\n\r\nthere  is  the export market potentiality,  surely,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  is such a thing as consumer prejudice.\r\n\r\nIt  is  hard to introduce a new brand of goods  and\r\n\r\nexpect to sell them overnight. You cannot do  that.\r\n\r\nUnless  it is a well-established brand, it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to have an export market for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
