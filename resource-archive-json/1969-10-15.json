For\r\n\r\nmedical and surgical patients, the daily ward\r\n\r\ncharge is as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     Class A  -  $45 per day\r\n\r\n     Class B  -  $20 per day\r\n\r\n     Class C  -  A token charge of $1 per day.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>The charges for psychiatric patients are different,\r\n\r\nbeing  $20  and  $10 per day for A  and  B  classes\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Service charges may be taken as charges for\r\n\r\ntreatments, investigations and other services which\r\n\r\nare charged according to the type of service given.\r\n\r\nThese services would be too long to describe here.\r\n\r\nThe service charge for delivery in the maternity\r\n\r\nhospital, e.g., is $200 for A Class and $100 for B\r\n\r\nClass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Charges for outpatients are made on the\r\n\r\nbasis of each attendance and vary according to the\r\n\r\noutpatient services provided. At the travelling\r\n\r\ndispensaries, the charge  is  20  cents  per\r\n\r\nattendance; at the outpatient dispensaries, it is 80\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncents  per  attendance on week days and  $1.50  per\r\n\r\nattendance on Sundays and public holidays.

It does not come any way  near  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost of the services provided. It is only  a\r\n\r\nconsolidated   charge  for  the  various   services\r\n\r\nprovided,  which include the professional attention\r\n\r\nof  doctors,  nurses,  laboratory  technicians  and\r\n\r\nothers, the provision of medicines and the carrying\r\n\r\nout  of  investigations.  Thus,  it  will  not   be\r\n\r\npossible  to  agree to a waiver  of  these  nominal\r\n\r\ncharges  merely because the patient  may  not  have\r\n\r\nseen  the  doctor when attending the dispensary  to\r\n\r\nhave  his  dressing changed. There are still  costs\r\n\r\nfor  the  services provided by the nurse and  other\r\n\r\nincidental expenses which could be accounted for in\r\n\r\nthe nominal charge levied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Consequently,   the    Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDivision  decided that an anomalous situation  will\r\n\r\narise  if  cultural  organisations  and  charitable\r\n\r\nbodies were not charged advertising fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale behind Treasury's ruling is that\r\n\r\nfrom  the cost effectiveness point of view,  it  is\r\n\r\nessential that departments and statutory boards  be\r\n\r\nable to show the results of its efforts in the true\r\n\r\nlight   of   costs.  This  rationale   is   equally\r\n\r\napplicable to cultural organisations and  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government departments now pay for their\r\n\r\nadvertising   by  journal  adjustments.

It   is   therefore  essential   that   the\r\n\r\nsuppression  of  secret societies in  the  Republic\r\n\r\nshould  go on relentlessly, especially in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe possible involvement in racial disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MONEYLENDERS (AMENDMENT)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Moneylenders Ordinance, 1959 (No. 58 of 1959)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented for the Minister for Social Affairs by his Parliamentary Secretary (Mr Chan Chee Seng);\r\n\r\nread the First time, to be read a Second time on\r\n\r\nthe next available sitting of Parliament, and to be\r\n\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STATUTE LAW REVISION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to provide for omissions, amendments and\r\n\r\nadditions considered desirable by the Law\r\n\r\nRevision Commissioners in their preparation of a\r\n\r\nrevised edition of Acts pursuant to the\r\n\r\nRevised Edition of the Laws Act, 1966 (No. 16 of 1966)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E.

The summary is on the  last\r\n\r\npage   of  the  Paper.  There  are  two  heads   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure and amendments in respect of both heads\r\n\r\nstand on the Order Paper Supplement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 71 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 71 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting to note from Paper Cmd. 24\r\n\r\nof 1969 that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In conjunction with the celebrations in\r\n\r\ncommemoration  of  the  150th  Anniversary  of  the\r\n\r\nFounding of Singapore, stereophonic broadcasts have\r\n\r\nbeen commenced in the Republic this year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would, therefore, mean to me, Sir, that there\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  no  stereophonic  broadcasts  if\r\n\r\nSingapore had not celebrated its 150th anniversary.\r\n\r\nIn fact, stereophonic music has been here for quite\r\n\r\nsome  time.  I  think  it  must  have  struck   the\r\n\r\ningenuity of someone in the Broadcasting Department\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  a  novel idea to  introduce  such  a\r\n\r\nservice.  It  means  buying  a  radio  set   or   a\r\n\r\ntransistor  radio set with an FM stereophonic  band\r\n\r\nin  order to receive such broadcasts. Sir, I stress\r\n\r\non  the FM stereophonic band because I remember the\r\n\r\nFM  station has already been in existence for quite\r\n\r\nsome   time.  If  a  listener  wishes  to   receive\r\n\r\nstereophonic broadcasts, he must buy a set that has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  band,  otherwise he will continue to  receive\r\n\r\nmusic  without stereophonic effects. Therefore,  my\r\n\r\nconclusion is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I shall be grateful to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  if  he will inform the House  whether  any\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration was given  in  all  respects\r\n\r\nbefore  introducing such a service, and  whether  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  has  been made to establish the  number  of\r\n\r\nlisteners tuning in to such a service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I would ask the Minister if a\r\n\r\n$10  token  provision in the Development  Estimates\r\n\r\nmeans the provision of a further sum of $50,000. If\r\n\r\nsavings  in  the current Development Estimates  can\r\n\r\nwarrant increased expenditure, I would like to  see\r\n\r\nmore   urgent  items  of  expenditure,   like   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  abattoirs  in  the  rural  areas,\r\n\r\ntreated with the same priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek elucidation from the\r\n\r\nMinister  regarding the actual  source  of  savings\r\n\r\namounting  to  $14,990.  Did  it  come   from   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates pertaining to his Ministry or\r\n\r\notherwise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1967 Radio Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen  operating  four radio channels  on  frequency\r\n\r\nmodulation,  commonly known as FM.  These  channels\r\n\r\nwere  an  addition  to the four existing  amplitude\r\n\r\nmodulation, commonly called AM medium wave channel.\r\n\r\nThe  four channels were radiated without the device\r\n\r\ncalled the encoder to enable a receiving set with a\r\n\r\ndecoder  to receive such broadcasts in stereophonic\r\n\r\nsound. It was felt that the time had come for  such\r\n\r\nFM  broadcasts  to be improved to the  level  where\r\n\r\nstereophonic sounds can be radiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  in connection with the source of  savings,\r\n\r\nthe  token  provision  of $10  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for this year was made for the  purchase\r\n\r\nof  stereophonic equipment.

An\r\n\r\noverall  survey of listeners and their  preferences\r\n\r\nis   being   planned   and,   when   carried   out,\r\n\r\nstereophonic broadcasts will certainly be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,000 for Head 71 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart   of   the   First  Supplementary  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1969, to 31st March, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 102 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 102 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanatory note to this subhead clearly\r\n\r\nstresses  the need for more vehicles  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nincreasing   demands   of  the   public   cleansing\r\n\r\nservices.  I would have thought that with assiduous\r\n\r\nplanning, the need of more vehicles for the  public\r\n\r\ncleansing   services  would  have   received   high\r\n\r\npriority  when the \"Keep Singapore Clean\"  campaign\r\n\r\nwas mounted last year. In other words, there should\r\n\r\nhave  been forward planning to enable the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health to meet immediate requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence I would be grateful if the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  could enlighten the House on the date  when\r\n\r\nsuch  vehicles  were ordered,  and  also  how  many\r\n\r\nworkers  are  manning them. I would  have  imagined\r\n\r\nthat   these  vehicles  would  have  already   been\r\n\r\npurchased  and  are now on the road  serving  their\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I would like to suggest to the Minister to\r\n\r\nlook   into   the  possibility  of  introducing   a\r\n\r\ncleansing service either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  night or in the early hours of the morning,  as\r\n\r\nthere is less traffic during, those hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister also look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof   increasing  the  frequency  of  clearing  away\r\n\r\nrubbish  and trade refuse from our bin centers?  To\r\n\r\nillustrate, Sir, I notice that at two bin  centers\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency, namely, at Punggol Road  8\ufffd m.s. and Upper Serangoon Road 6\ufffd m.s., the bins\r\n\r\nare cleared in the morning, but by evening they are\r\n\r\nfull to the brim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first point that the Member\r\n\r\nfor Punggol made is the need for more public health\r\n\r\nvehicles,   and  that  this  must  be  given   high\r\n\r\npriority.  I cannot agree with him, more.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  very  reason  why we are here  today  debating\r\n\r\nthese supplementary estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refuse load at present handled by the public\r\n\r\ncleansing services is, approximately 1,200 tons per\r\n\r\nday.  This is quite a marked increase compared with\r\n\r\n800  tons  per day formerly handled, by the  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Division.  I  am  glad  to  say  that  this\r\n\r\nincrease  in  refuse  removal  does  indicate   the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  the  \"Keep Singapore  Clean\"  campaign\r\n\r\nwhich  was  launched last year and  is, continuing\r\n\r\nthroughout this year as well. Although this  result\r\n\r\nwas  welcomed, it was quite unexpected  because  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  planning you do not normally  expect  a\r\n\r\nsudden  jump from 800 tons, to 1,200 tons per  day.\r\n\r\nYou  need additional equipment. As a result,  there\r\n\r\nwas, an  urgent  need  for  more  refuse  removal\r\n\r\nvehicles.  The Member for Punggol also  asked  when\r\n\r\nthese  vehicles  were ordered.  They  were  ordered\r\n\r\nimmediately  after  the  Treasury  approved   their\r\n\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which he made was, the request\r\n\r\nfor  greater frequency in the removal of refuse  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I do not know what he means by that.  At\r\n\r\nthe moment, we have daily removals, in other words,\r\n\r\nonce  every  day.  As a matter of fact,  since  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  of the Employment Act,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  introduce refuse removal on Sundays and  public\r\n\r\nholidays as well, resulting in an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of removals per week. I do not know if  the\r\n\r\nMember  is  advocating that we should increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  removals from once to  twice  or  three\r\n\r\ntimes a day. To put him in proper perspective,  may\r\n\r\nI  bring to his attention the fact that in many big\r\n\r\ncities  in  Europe  and America they  remove  their\r\n\r\nrefuse  only  three times a week, or  even  once  a\r\n\r\nweek. Even in the big city of New York, they remove\r\n\r\ntheir refuse only three times a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Why are\r\n\r\ntwo   markets   being  built   in   Taman   Jurong?\r\n\r\nApproximately how many residents are there who will\r\n\r\nbenefit from the construction of these two markets?\r\n\r\nWhere are their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexact  locations?

It has one market which is adequate\r\n\r\nfor Punggol's purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that in the original\r\n\r\nplanning for the provision of markets in the Jurong\r\n\r\narea,  especially in the proposed town  centre,  it\r\n\r\nwas  considered  that the provision  of  two  small\r\n\r\nmarkets instead of one would render better and more\r\n\r\neffective  service  for  the  expected  population.\r\n\r\nThere is not only the need to tie them in with  the\r\n\r\nphases of development in Jurong Town, but there  is\r\n\r\nalso the need to allocate markets within convenient\r\n\r\ndistance  for  the residents of this  new  township\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be more extensive in area when  it  is\r\n\r\nfully developed. That indirectly answers the Member\r\n\r\nfor Punggol's point when he asked whether there was\r\n\r\nany  need  for  two markets. As the  Member  knows,\r\n\r\nJurong  is going to be a big satellite town.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  even these two  markets  will  be\r\n\r\nsufficient   when   Jurong  is   eventually   fully\r\n\r\ndeveloped. But at the moment we consider  that  the\r\n\r\ntwo markets are sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a few figures pertaining to the number of\r\n\r\nstalls and the number of stalls occupied will  give\r\n\r\nhim an idea whether the two markets are going to be\r\n\r\nfully  used.  In Taman Jurong Market I,  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  stalls  is 122; the  number  of  stalls\r\n\r\nlicensed  and taken up, up to date, is 95  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of stalls vacant is 27. In the market itself\r\n\r\nthere  are  a number of open pitches. These  number\r\n\r\n112.  The number of pitches licensed and taken  up,\r\n\r\nup  to date, is about 103 and the number vacant  is\r\n\r\nnine.  This  does indicate that the  market  is  in\r\n\r\nreasonable  use at the moment. But, of  course,  we\r\n\r\ncannot expect it to be fully occupied because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  will depend on the occupation of the area  by\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taman Jurong Market II, the total number of\r\n\r\nstalls  is about 122, and up to date the number  of\r\n\r\nstalls licensed and taken up is 108. The number  of\r\n\r\nvacant stalls is only 14. The total number of  open\r\n\r\npitches  is 65, and the number taken up is 56.  The\r\n\r\nnumber vacant is nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his general question about whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has any project to  construct  any\r\n\r\nmore new markets in the future, this is a point  of\r\n\r\nconsiderable interest to the Ministry of Health. In\r\n\r\nfact, the Ministry has always advocated that in the\r\n\r\nlong-term  plan, all hawkers should  conduct  their\r\n\r\nbusiness from within premises. In a count  made  in\r\n\r\nDecember  last  year,  there  were  24,845   static\r\n\r\nhawkers  in Singapore, of whom 15,135 were  engaged\r\n\r\nin  the  sale of market produce. Only 7,711 hawkers\r\n\r\nof  all  types  were accommodated within  premises,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  markets and hawker centres. The remaining\r\n\r\n17,000  hawkers were scattered all over the island,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the urban areas - in streets, foot-ways  and back-lanes. The resiting of hawkers  into\r\n\r\nmarkets  and other premises is a project of mammoth\r\n\r\nproportions, requiring careful planning and follow-through   action  by  the  planning  and   building\r\n\r\nauthorities   of   the  State.  The   location   of\r\n\r\nappropriate  markets  and hawker  centres  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in the light of the overall development\r\n\r\nplanning for the island, and is not a matter within\r\n\r\nthe  sole  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.\r\n\r\nSubstantial capital cost will also be required. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health proposes to take the matter  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  appropriate agencies  and  is  presently\r\n\r\ncompiling the necessary data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy with the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply.

It  deals\r\n\r\nwith  some  amendments  to the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, any change - however\r\n\r\nminor - to the rate of stamp duty can only be  done\r\n\r\nby  amending the Stamp Ordinance in Parliament. The\r\n\r\nexperience of the last revision of stamp duties  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1968  has  proved  this  process  to   be\r\n\r\ncumbersome  and unsatisfactory. Hon.  Members  will\r\n\r\nremember  that the revision of the rates  of  stamp\r\n\r\nduty  was  announced  by the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nduring his Budget Statement, but the revision could\r\n\r\nnot  be effected until January 1969, because of the\r\n\r\nneed to amend the Stamp Ordinance. In the meantime,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  rush to the Stamp Office  as  people\r\n\r\ntried  to  jump the gun by getting their  documents\r\n\r\nstamped  before the increased rates were  effected.\r\n\r\nThis  resulted not only in a loss of revenue,  but,\r\n\r\nalso  a  congestion  at  the  Stamp  Office,  which\r\n\r\nprompted  an  hon.  Member to  ask  a  question  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this experience, it is now proposed to\r\n\r\nadd  a  new section to the Ordinance to enable  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  impose new duties or  to  revise  the\r\n\r\nrates  of existing ones by an Order to be published\r\n\r\nin  the  Gazette.  This amendment  will  bring  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance in line\r\n\r\nwith  the  other revenue Ordinances,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nCustoms Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will remember that in my  answer  to\r\n\r\nthe question on the congestion at the Stamp Office,\r\n\r\nI  said  that the Government was looking  into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of allowing more documents to be  stamped\r\n\r\nby  franking machines so as to relieve the pressure\r\n\r\nat  the counter of the Stamp Office. I am happy  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the Government has now decided to  allow\r\n\r\ninsurance policies and contract notes to be stamped\r\n\r\nby  postal franking machines. Clause 2 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nseeks to effect this. At the same time, power  will\r\n\r\nbe given to the Minister to extend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe number of instruments on which duty may be paid\r\n\r\nby franking machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fee for a Certificate to Practise for an\r\n\r\nadvocate   and   solicitor  has  been  specifically\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the Legal Profession Act,  this  duty\r\n\r\nwill  be removed from the Stamp Ordinance. This  is\r\n\r\nstated in clause 14 (b) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to clarify the position of\r\n\r\nstamp  duty  in  relation to receipts,  letters  of\r\n\r\nguarantee,  payment of stamp duties on  shares,  by\r\n\r\nremoving   the   ambiguities.   The   other   minor\r\n\r\namendments include deletion of rates from the  main\r\n\r\nbody  of  the  Ordinance,  renumbering  of  various\r\n\r\narticles,   and   consequential  changes   to   the\r\n\r\nSchedules of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr\r\n\r\nTang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL SPORTS PROMOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BOARD BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill as found in the\r\n\r\nExplanatory   Statement  is  to   incorporate   the\r\n\r\nNational Sports Promotion Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered that the time has\r\n\r\ncome for sports to be organised and co-ordinated in\r\n\r\na  more  efficient way than hitherto if  it  is  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  its  primary role of not  only  creating  a\r\n\r\nphysically rugged population\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut   also  promoting  national  consciousness  and\r\n\r\nidentity in our multi-racial nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past ten years since the present\r\n\r\nGovernment   came   to   power,   recognising   the\r\n\r\nimportance of sports and games as a unifying factor\r\n\r\nof our nation made up of diverse races of immigrant\r\n\r\nstock,  Government  has actively encouraged  sports\r\n\r\nand  games as part of the activities of the network\r\n\r\nof  community centres spread throughout the  island\r\n\r\nand  of  the  extra-mural activities of  the  half-million school-going population.

Besides    the\r\n\r\nExtracurricular  Activity  Centre  built   by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education and the numerous school halls\r\n\r\nand  fields  to cater for sports and games  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  school  children, Government,  realising  that\r\n\r\nsince  a  large percentage of our urban  population\r\n\r\nare  residing  in  Housing  and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats,  has  found  that it would  be  logical  for\r\n\r\nsports  fields, swimming pools and other facilities\r\n\r\nto  be  sited  in  the housing estates  themselves.\r\n\r\nPlans  have therefore been made by the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to construct sports stadiums  and\r\n\r\nswimming  pools  in  its large housing  estates  of\r\n\r\nQueenstown and Toa Payoh Housing Estate as well  as\r\n\r\nits  other  large  housing estates.

This will be done by the modification  of\r\n\r\nthe objects of the Singapore Olympic Sports Council\r\n\r\nto  be  renamed as the Singapore Olympic  Committee\r\n\r\nand  concerned  only  with  the  participation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore at international games, such as the  SEAP\r\n\r\nGames, the Commonwealth Games, the Asian Games  and\r\n\r\nthe   Olympic  Games,  and  the  abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports  Council, an  ad  hoc  Government\r\n\r\nSports  Council  set up by the Ministry  of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs,  and also the absorption of the  functions\r\n\r\nof the Sports Division by the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude by saying that whilst sports must\r\n\r\nhave  the  active recognition and encouragement  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government,   it  should  not   be   directly\r\n\r\ncontrolled  and run by the Government and  be  just\r\n\r\nanother  portfolio  of  a  Government  Ministry  or\r\n\r\nDepartment.  The interest in sports,  participation\r\n\r\nin  it and support for it must come from the people\r\n\r\nand  the  private sector to a large extent.  It  is\r\n\r\nwith this in view that the proposed National Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion   Board,  in  motivation,   organisation,\r\n\r\nobjective and activity, is structured to perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I fully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  this Bill. Undoubtedly it has  very  grand\r\n\r\nobjectives.  When it is implemented, I  believe  it\r\n\r\nwill  have  a very decisive effect on the promotion\r\n\r\nof  sports in our country and on the raising of our\r\n\r\nstandard in sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  already  described, is to set up the  National\r\n\r\nSports Promotion Board. Its tasks can be said to be\r\n\r\nquite  comprehensive,  with such  functions  as  to\r\n\r\nencourage, develop and promote sports on a national\r\n\r\nbasis   for   both  competitive  and   recreational\r\n\r\npurposes;   to   co-ordinate  the   activities   of\r\n\r\nvoluntary  sports organisations;  to  organise,  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  national sports  organisations,\r\n\r\nincluding the National Olympic Committee,  national\r\n\r\nand  international competitions and games;  and  to\r\n\r\nfoster  research and study in sports  and  physical\r\n\r\neducation  and  to  provide  for  the  training  of\r\n\r\ninstructors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><B>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER in the Chair]</B></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these functions will ensure that this Board\r\n\r\nplays  an important part in the promotion of sports\r\n\r\nin  our  country. Because of the various  important\r\n\r\ntasks  entrusted to the Board, it  will  have  very\r\n\r\ngreat  responsibilities, such as co-ordinating  the\r\n\r\nvarious   sports  organisations  and  raising   the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  the  various sports and  popularising\r\n\r\nthem. In carrying out these responsibilities, there\r\n\r\nare  questions to look into and matters to be taken\r\n\r\ncare  of.  In  working  to achieve  the  objectives\r\n\r\nenvisaged   in   the  Bill,  the  National   Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion Board will, I am confident, do  its  best\r\n\r\nto live up to its expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe you will agree with me that in\r\n\r\npromoting  sports, there are three main  objectives\r\n\r\nwhich should be well recognised. They are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To train our people to have healthy and\r\n\r\nstrong  bodies so that our country will be able  to\r\n\r\nshoulder the heavy task of nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Through the various sports tournaments and\r\n\r\ncompetitions, the people will be able to enjoy some\r\n\r\nrecreational activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To raise the competitive standard of the\r\n\r\nvarious kinds of sports, our national teams  should\r\n\r\nbe  sent abroad to take part in regional as well as\r\n\r\ninternational tournaments in order to  gain  honour\r\n\r\nas  well as publicity for our country. So these are\r\n\r\nvery  grand  objectives  and  high  ideals  in  the\r\n\r\npromotion of sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine the progress of sports over\r\n\r\nthe past few years. Undoubtedly through the efforts\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Social Affairs and with the help\r\n\r\nof  various  sports  circles,  we  have  had  great\r\n\r\nachievements  in  many fields of  sports,  such  as\r\n\r\nbasketball,  badminton,  football,  table   tennis,\r\n\r\nswimming,   and   weightlifting.   They   are   now\r\n\r\nflourishing.  Now and then we see  many  youngsters\r\n\r\ntraining  or taking part in tournaments  either  in\r\n\r\nschool  grounds  or  in  community  centres.  These\r\n\r\nactivities were never seen before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are a small country, our standard of\r\n\r\nsports is not far below that of other countries. We\r\n\r\ncan be said to be comparable to them. This has been\r\n\r\nproved in the results we achieved at the last Asian\r\n\r\nGames  and  the  SEAP  Games. But  we  should  also\r\n\r\nrecognise that in certain kinds of sports  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  done  as  well  as before. For  instance,  our\r\n\r\nbasketball  team brought back a \"big zero\"  in  the\r\n\r\nlast   international  competition.  Our   badminton\r\n\r\nstandard has dropped even further. A few years  ago\r\n\r\nwe  claimed  to be the champions of  the  world  in\r\n\r\nbadminton,   but  just  about  a   month   ago   we\r\n\r\nunexpectedly lost to an unknown national team  from\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand. Is this not a pity? How did this come\r\n\r\nabout?  We  must  examine  the  reasons  for   this\r\n\r\ndropping of standard and take remedial measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote sports, particularly to raise\r\n\r\nthe standard of our national teams, I would like to\r\n\r\nmake    four   suggestions   for   the   Minister's\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To engage international coaches of repute.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All national team members should be given\r\n\r\ncertain  safeguards in respect of their employment,\r\n\r\nso  that  they can have peace of mind while  taking\r\n\r\npart in sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Once a year there should be a definite\r\n\r\nprogramme for centralised group training. This will\r\n\r\nhelp   the   team   members  to  attain   all-round\r\n\r\nimprovement,  in addition to improvement  in  their\r\n\r\nphysique, their  spirit and their  standards.  And\r\n\r\nwhile they are taking part in group training,  they\r\n\r\nshould continue to draw their salaries if they  are\r\n\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We should inculcate into them the spirit of\r\n\r\npatriotism in order to win honour for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of all these measures needs a\r\n\r\nlot of money. But the Minister has pointed out that\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision  for the  setting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Sports Promotion Fund to receive donations\r\n\r\nfrom    various   sources,   such   as   commercial\r\n\r\norganisations  and individuals, to  meet  expenses.\r\n\r\nThese donations will be tax free. I believe this is\r\n\r\na  good  measure, and with the setting up  of  this\r\n\r\nFund,  we will be able to have more funds to  carry\r\n\r\nout  our  sports activities. Here I would  like  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  sports enthusiasts, particularly  those\r\n\r\nwho  are rich, to donate generously to help promote\r\n\r\nsport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I take part in sports\r\n\r\nactivities, and therefore I am concerned  with  all\r\n\r\nmatters connected with sports. I fully support this\r\n\r\nBill.   In   order  to  meet  our  future  economic\r\n\r\nchallenge, our people will undoubtedly have to have\r\n\r\nstrong physiques and better endurance. A strong and\r\n\r\nhealthy  physique  can  only  be  acquired  through\r\n\r\nsports.  At the same time, through sports, we  will\r\n\r\nalso  acquire  a strong national consciousness  and\r\n\r\nalso   we  can,  indirectly,  fulfil  the  aim   of\r\n\r\nachieving racial harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, the introduction of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  to  provide for  the  planning  and\r\n\r\npromotion of national sports activities and  to  do\r\n\r\naway  with whatever duplication there has  been  in\r\n\r\nthis   field.  The  result  is  that   all   sports\r\n\r\nactivities   will  be  planned,  co-ordinated   and\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  a  centralised body  consisting  of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the Singapore National  Olympic\r\n\r\nCommittee, the Sports Division of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs,  the Ministry  of  Education,  the\r\n\r\nArmed   Forces,   the  police  and   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  In this way, it is hoped  to  promote\r\n\r\nsports  activities and raise the standard of sports\r\n\r\nin  this  country. These are lofty and praiseworthy\r\n\r\naims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to raise the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  our  sports and  to  achieve  greater\r\n\r\nprestige  for  our  country, the  following  points\r\n\r\nshould  not be overlooked. During the past  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  years, the various sports organisations  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  Singapore Sports Council  have  done\r\n\r\ntheir  very best to obtain the services  of  expert\r\n\r\ncoaches  for the more popular sports activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These  organisations  have  also  tried\r\n\r\ntheir  very  best  to  look  out  for  talent   and\r\n\r\npotential  sportsmen so that under a proper  system\r\n\r\nof  training  they will be nurtured  and  developed\r\n\r\ninto State players. These are praiseworthy efforts.\r\n\r\nHowever,  some doubts have been expressed  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.  They  have  given  rise  to  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are  able to obtain the  sympathy  and\r\n\r\nsupport of other countries in supplying the  first-class  coaches  that we require. If the  answer  to\r\n\r\nthis question is in the negative, the next question\r\n\r\nwill  arise. Are we prepared to accept second-  and\r\n\r\nthird-class  coaches to train  fourth-  and  fifth-class players? Perhaps the Minister will give  some\r\n\r\nconsideration to a more economical approach to this\r\n\r\nproblem  and plan an extensive programme  to  train\r\n\r\nour  players  and  thus obtain the  instruction  by\r\n\r\ncheaper  means.  One  of  the  ways  is  to  get  a\r\n\r\nplentiful  supply of films showing how  first-class\r\n\r\ncoaches  train  sportsmen in order to  reach  international standards. By showing these films  to  our\r\n\r\ntrainees, we will be able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindirectly  to  train  our  own  people,  short  of\r\n\r\ngetting  expert coaches from abroad.  Our  trainees\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to learn from watching these  films;\r\n\r\nhow  they should train and what are the points they\r\n\r\nshould bear in mind when they are in training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is the extension\r\n\r\nof  the  age  limit  for sports  training.  At  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment, most of the sports activities  are\r\n\r\nconfined  to our school-going population. In  order\r\n\r\nto  raise  our  sports standard, we must  not  only\r\n\r\npopularise  sports activities among  students,  but\r\n\r\nalso  extend  them outside the schools.  This  work\r\n\r\nmust be done by the various sports organisations in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the  commercial  and  industrial\r\n\r\nsectors. These sectors should also be encouraged to\r\n\r\nmake a contribution to sports. In other words,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, it is our hope that they  will  at\r\n\r\nleast  shoulder some responsibility  by  taking  in\r\n\r\nsportsmen who have graduated from schools and other\r\n\r\ninstitutions of higher learning. They  should  also\r\n\r\nallow  such  people to continue with  their  sports\r\n\r\nactivities  when  they are working.  In  this  way,\r\n\r\ntheir  skill and standard will be maintained. There\r\n\r\nare  people  who have to give up sports  activities\r\n\r\nbecause  of their employment. We have lost a  large\r\n\r\nreservoir  of  talent because of the hard  economic\r\n\r\nfacts  of  life.  When sportsmen leave  school  and\r\n\r\nhappen to be employed in a very small company which\r\n\r\nis  not prepared to allow them to take time off for\r\n\r\ntraining,  or  does  not provide  any  facility  or\r\n\r\nencouragement  for them to carry  on  their  sports\r\n\r\nactivities, the loss of such talent to  sport  will\r\n\r\nbe  complete. In order to earn their living,  these\r\n\r\nsportsmen  will  have to accept the  hard  economic\r\n\r\nfacts  of  life  at  the expense  of  their  sports\r\n\r\nactivities and the talent that they have developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish to stress that the present\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities  for sportsmen  are  more  or\r\n\r\nless  of  a  spontaneous and voluntary nature.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have  a centralised body, such as  a  sports\r\n\r\ncollege, to shoulder the responsibility of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining our sportsmen. In this way, we will have\r\n\r\nbetter hopes of our sportsmen achieving higher\r\n\r\nstandards. Furthermore, the establishment of a\r\n\r\nsports college will provide employment\r\n\r\nopportunities for those who are active in sports.\r\n\r\nIn other words, those who are good in sports\r\n\r\nactivities will be able to find employment in the\r\n\r\nsports college and they, in turn, will have the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of training other sportsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as the Member for Sembawang has just\r\n\r\nsaid, State players should receive the attention of\r\n\r\nthe State. Perhaps the Minister's answer to this\r\n\r\nquestion will be that, as the State is faced with\r\n\r\nits economic problems, it does not have the\r\n\r\ncapacity or the ability to look after our sportsmen\r\n\r\nin terms of finance. But it is my view that since\r\n\r\nour Armed Forces and our Police Force have the\r\n\r\nmeans and the ability to maintain brass bands,\r\n\r\nwhich consist of more people and cost much more\r\n\r\nmoney than, for example, a normal basketball team,\r\n\r\nhow is it that we find ourselves unable to maintain\r\n\r\na team of State players? Of course, it is not my\r\n\r\nproposal to ask the State to feed the players. My\r\n\r\nproposal is that the Government should do all it\r\n\r\ncan to absorb these sportsmen into the various\r\n\r\nGovernment departments so that while in employment\r\n\r\nthey will also have the time to continue with .\r\n\r\ntheir sports activities. Thus, in both ways they\r\n\r\nserve the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if the Minister will bear all these\r\n\r\npoints in mind, he will surely find some solution\r\n\r\nto the problems raised. It is my belief that just\r\n\r\nas we have been able to raise our standard of\r\n\r\nhealth and hygiene, we should be able to raise our\r\n\r\nstandard of sports. In view of the compactness of\r\n\r\nour island Republic, I sincerely believe that we\r\n\r\nwill be able to achieve our aims. Let me reiterate\r\n\r\nmy full support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I have just a brief comment to make on this Bill\r\n\r\nwhich is now before the House for its Second\r\n\r\nReading. The Minister has mentioned that he will co-opt people from various organisations, such as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narmy, the police, the Ministry of Education and the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association,  to serve  on  the  National\r\n\r\nSports  Promotion  Board. It  appears  to  me  that\r\n\r\ncolleges  and  universities have been omitted.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, you are well  aware  that  in\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries college and university students\r\n\r\nplay a very prominent part in sports activities. In\r\n\r\nfact,  most of the outstanding sportsmen have  come\r\n\r\nfrom colleges and universities. In this respect,  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Minister for Social Affairs not  to\r\n\r\noverlook   appointing  representatives   from   our\r\n\r\ncolleges  and  universities.  This  will  at  least\r\n\r\nenable  our  college  and  university  students  to\r\n\r\nparticipate actively in the promotion of sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree with me that our younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  must not only be intelligent  but  they\r\n\r\nmust  also  be rugged and robust. It is, therefore,\r\n\r\nimportant that our college and university  students\r\n\r\nmust  excel in all forms of sports and, in time  to\r\n\r\ncome, they will become outstanding sportsmen and be\r\n\r\nable  to  make a name for the Republic of Singapore\r\n\r\nin the world of sports.

We can look into that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sports training to be extended\r\n\r\nnot only to the school-going population but also to\r\n\r\npersons  outside our schools, if I am not mistaken,\r\n\r\nthe   Pioneer  Industries  Union  have   a   sports\r\n\r\ndivision.

Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that this Bill\r\n\r\nwas  referred to Select Committee on  the  22nd  of\r\n\r\nMay, 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, which is novel in concept and\r\n\r\npotentially far-reaching in its social and economic\r\n\r\nimpact,  has  aroused  a  considerable  amount   of\r\n\r\ninterest  and it has been a subject of  much  well-informed comment. This interest is evident from the\r\n\r\nnumber  of representations that were made to Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. In all, thirteen written representations\r\n\r\nwere received and the Committee heard oral evidence\r\n\r\nfrom ten of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  representors. Representations  came  not  only\r\n\r\nfrom  landlords,  tenants and developers  but  also\r\n\r\nfrom    interested   professional   and    business\r\n\r\nassociations,  such as the Singapore Advocates  and\r\n\r\nSolicitors  Society,  the  Singapore  Real   Estate\r\n\r\nValuers  Association,  the Singapore  Planning  and\r\n\r\nUrban  Research  Group and the Chinese  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce.  Apart  from the representations  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Advocates and Solicitors Society,  which\r\n\r\nconfined  itself to the technical legal aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  almost  all  the  representations  were\r\n\r\nconcerned  either with the scope of the legislation\r\n\r\nor  with  the compensation formula that is proposed\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill. There was much difference of opinion\r\n\r\nin the representations on both these aspects of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Despite this, or maybe because of it, almost\r\n\r\nall  the representations had something of value  to\r\n\r\ncontribute and gave the Select Committee much  food\r\n\r\nfor  thought. In the result, as Members may observe\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Report,  many  of  the  suggestions  and\r\n\r\nproposals in the representations have been  adopted\r\n\r\nand are written into the Bill, and undoubtedly have\r\n\r\nimproved it\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Bill as tabled does not provide the\r\n\r\nperfect  solution  to some of the problems  raised,\r\n\r\nand  although  it may in regard to the compensation\r\n\r\nformula  lack the sort of legal precision to  which\r\n\r\nlegislators would aspire, I would suggest  it  does\r\n\r\nprovide  a  satisfactory  framework  in  which  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Bill may be carried out  and  under\r\n\r\nwhich   the  interests  of  landlords  and  tenants\r\n\r\naffected by the Bill will be adequately protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report was presented on the 13th\r\n\r\nof  June,  1969,  as Paper Parl.  3  of  1969.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Bill as now tabled  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  incorporates  the  recommendations  of   the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee. Members will  observe  from  the\r\n\r\nReport  that fairly detailed statements  are  given\r\n\r\ntherein  explaining the reasons for  accepting  all\r\n\r\nthe  major amendments. I need not burden the  House\r\n\r\nby  repeating them. It may, however, be of interest\r\n\r\nto Members if I refer to a basic provision in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Bill upon which representations were  made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee and which the Committee  were\r\n\r\nunable to accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to clause 3 dealing with the application\r\n\r\nof  the Bill. Certain representations, particularly\r\n\r\nthose  from developers, proposed that the whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be designated as  a  development\r\n\r\narea  or, alternatively, that any landlord may make\r\n\r\nan application for the area in which his controlled\r\n\r\npremises  are situated to be declared a development\r\n\r\narea. It is not difficult to see that the effect of\r\n\r\naccepting either of these proposals would  be  that\r\n\r\nthe  Tenants' Compensation Board would  be  flooded\r\n\r\nwith  applications for possession of  premises  and\r\n\r\nthe  whole of the provisions of the Control of Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance  would be nullified, for  all  controlled\r\n\r\npremises  in Singapore would potentially be  liable\r\n\r\nto   decontrol.  This  was  not  the   purpose   of\r\n\r\nGovernment in introducing this legislation. On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  if Government had decided  that  it  was\r\n\r\ntime  to nullify the effect of the Control of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance, it would not have adopted this  backdoor\r\n\r\nmethod  of  doing  so.  It  was  precisely  because\r\n\r\nGovernment considered that the time was not as  yet\r\n\r\nopportune  for an outright repeal of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nthat it was considered that, in the general context\r\n\r\nof  Government's policy to promote  development  in\r\n\r\nthe private sector, the approach in this Bill of  a\r\n\r\nlimited  and phased form of de-control with payment\r\n\r\nof   compensation  to  dispossessed   tenants   was\r\n\r\nadopted. If and when the time comes for the  repeal\r\n\r\nof this Ordinance, it would by no means follow that\r\n\r\ncompensation would be paid to tenants who would  be\r\n\r\nobliged to leave their premises because they  could\r\n\r\nnot pay the resulting increases in rent. The reason\r\n\r\nbeing  that  if Government decided to  repeal  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  it  would be because the  economic  and\r\n\r\nhousing  situation as it affected protected tenants\r\n\r\nwould  be  such as to persuade Government  that  no\r\n\r\nfurther  control over rents was necessary. In  other\r\n\r\nwords, this category of persons would then be  able\r\n\r\nto   pay   an  economic  rent  or  obtain  suitable\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the Control of Rent Ordinance\r\n\r\nconfers protection upon the poorer sections of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  and although Government is fully  aware\r\n\r\nof   the  price  that  has  to  be  paid  for  this\r\n\r\nprotection in terms of unsightly buildings and slum\r\n\r\ntenements   and  the  discrimination  against   one\r\n\r\nsection of the community at the expense of another,\r\n\r\nwhich is inherent in the present system, Government\r\n\r\nconsiders  that we have not yet reached  the  stage\r\n\r\nwhen  this protection can be thrown overboard.  The\r\n\r\nrepeal  of this Ordinance would have the effect  of\r\n\r\nrendering   homeless  thousands   of   persons   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and, though much has been done to provide\r\n\r\nlow-cost housing for these poorer sections  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  we  are not as yet  in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nrehouse  all  the persons that would  be  affected.\r\n\r\nHowever,  everyone is aware of Government's  policy\r\n\r\nto  encourage home ownership, and there is no doubt\r\n\r\nthat the time will come when this Ordinance may  be\r\n\r\nsafely  repealed - at first in part and then  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  I can assure the House that Government  is,\r\n\r\nin   fact,   giving   very  serious   and   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration   to  the  question  of   decontrol;-perhaps  commercial or business premises  could  be\r\n\r\ndecontrolled in about five to seven years' time and\r\n\r\nresidential premises in 10 to 12 years'  time,  but\r\n\r\nthere will be complications where premises are used\r\n\r\nfor  mixed purposes unless a just solution is found\r\n\r\nor  some  equitable  formula arrived  at.  For  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  it  is Government's intention  to  advance\r\n\r\nslowly and in an orderly manner in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CATTLE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  of this House will recall  that  in\r\n\r\nNovember  1964, this House passed the  Cattle  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  subsequently  became the  Cattle  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1964  (No.  15  of 1964). The Cattle Ordinance  has\r\n\r\nsince  proven  to  be an extremely effective  legal\r\n\r\ninstrument  in attaining our objective  of  raising\r\n\r\nour environmental standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, cows and buffaloes roaming unchecked on\r\n\r\nour  arterial roads, traffic circuses and rampaging\r\n\r\nprivate property are conspicuous by their absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cattle sheds are now licensed and are\r\n\r\nsituated  in  well-defined  and  demarcated   \"non-restricted\"  areas.  These measures  have  in  turn\r\n\r\nsolved all the outstanding problems caused by stray\r\n\r\ncattle  in  respect of health and traffic  control.\r\n\r\nThe  cattle  nuisance has, once and for  all,  been\r\n\r\ndealt with by the Ministry of Health armed with  an\r\n\r\neffective piece of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the rapid and intensive\r\n\r\nurbanisation  and  physical  development  that  are\r\n\r\ntaking  place  around us today in Singapore,  other\r\n\r\nsub-standard  environmental  health  conditions  in\r\n\r\ncertain  slum  and  squatter areas  have  now  been\r\n\r\nbrought  into focus. The unfavourable environmental\r\n\r\nhealth conditions in such areas are intensified  by\r\n\r\nthe   rearing   of  domestic  animals,   the   most\r\n\r\noutstanding  of which is the rearing  of  pigs,  or\r\n\r\nwhat are legally termed \"swine\". These animals  are\r\n\r\noften  to be found being reared in pockets of  slum\r\n\r\nareas  in  insanitary pig-sties and these pigs  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  stray and roam at will. These  animals\r\n\r\ndefecate  all  over the place and create  appalling\r\n\r\ninsanitary  conditions  in  the  areas  and   their\r\n\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, such places are usually\r\n\r\nsituated  just adjacent to newly-developed  housing\r\n\r\nestates,  both public as well as private, and  even\r\n\r\nin  the  immediate vicinity of the precinct of  our\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar International Airport. The roaming about\r\n\r\nof  these  animals from their insanitary  pig-sties\r\n\r\ninto the more developed and hygienic environment of\r\n\r\nthe neighbouring areas has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the past brought numerous cries of protest  and\r\n\r\ncomplaints from the public. It is now time  for  us\r\n\r\nto  introduce more effective legislation  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  the  rearing of these pigs is  controlled  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  nuisances caused by them are eliminated,\r\n\r\njust as it was in the case of the cattle nuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law governing the rearing of pigs,\r\n\r\nwhich is in the form of by-laws, was made under the\r\n\r\nrepealed  Municipal Ordinance, as is  the  case  of\r\n\r\nmost of our old laws. The concepts embodied in this\r\n\r\nlaw  are  now  outdated and have been overtaken  by\r\n\r\nevents around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose to deal with this outstanding\r\n\r\nenvironmental   health   problem   of    insanitary\r\n\r\npiggeries  and  the roaming of pigs  in  a  similar\r\n\r\nfashion  as in the case of cattle. This, in  short,\r\n\r\nis the purpose of this Cattle (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is not aimed at any specific group of\r\n\r\npeople, nor is it intended to cause hardship to any\r\n\r\none. Let me make it clear that it is certainly  not\r\n\r\nthe purpose of the Bill to prohibit the rearing  of\r\n\r\npigs. Indeed, it seeks to ensure that farmers breed\r\n\r\npigs  in  well-defined areas and in as  sanitary  a\r\n\r\nmanner as it is possible to do and without creating\r\n\r\nenvironmental health hazards, as well  as  being  a\r\n\r\nnuisance to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Bill seeks to extend the\r\n\r\nexisting  definition  of  \"cattle\"  in  the  Cattle\r\n\r\nOrdinance  by  including swine as well.  This  will\r\n\r\nenable  the authorities to apprehend the stray  pigs\r\n\r\nthat  are a public nuisance and turn them  over  to\r\n\r\nthe  slaughter-house  to be turned  into  meat  for\r\n\r\ndistribution   among   our  charitable   homes   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to institute effective enforcement\r\n\r\naction  when necessary, a new section 5A is enacted\r\n\r\nto  empower  the Commissioner of Public  Health  to\r\n\r\ndelegate his powers to any public officer and, with\r\n\r\nthe approval of the Minister, to any officer of any\r\n\r\nstatutory board to deal with the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain consequential changes are also made in\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"officers\" so as  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nCattle  Ordinance  in line with  the  Environmental\r\n\r\nPublic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Act, 1968 (No. 32 of 1968).

The tragedy, however, is greater where  the\r\n\r\nperson  concerned  belongs to the  under-privileged\r\n\r\nclass  of manual workers whose very limbs  are  the\r\n\r\nmeans of supporting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  their families. I may  safely  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not only a tragedy but also a calamity\r\n\r\nfor  a  worker  to have an accident to  his  limbs,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  his low level of wages and because  of\r\n\r\nhis  invariably having little or no savings at all.\r\n\r\nAdded  to  the  physical agony  and  pain  of  his\r\n\r\ninjuries,  he has to suffer a great deal of  mental\r\n\r\nagony and anxiety regarding his own future and  the\r\n\r\nfuture of his wife, children, aged parents perhaps,\r\n\r\nand  other dependants. His worries and fears  about\r\n\r\nthe   future   are   very  real  and   substantial,\r\n\r\nparticularly if he is the sole bread-winner.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom the productive use of his God-given limbs,  he\r\n\r\nhas  no  other means or savings to depend upon  for\r\n\r\nhis  livelihood. The plight of such an  unfortunate\r\n\r\nvictim  deserves not only compassion and  sympathy\r\n\r\nbut  also whatever help that can be given to enable\r\n\r\nhim  to  face the future with a certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nhope and confidence\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in bringing up this matter of\r\n\r\nartificial aids for persons with amputated limbs, I\r\n\r\nam  prompted by the need to rationalise  the  basis\r\n\r\nfor  determining the type of artificial aids to  be\r\n\r\nsupplied and the amount of charges to be levied, if\r\n\r\nthe  aids  are  so supplied. As an illustration,  I\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the  case of a Public  Works  Department\r\n\r\nlabourer who was admitted to hospital in  February\r\n\r\nthis  year for diabetic gangrene of the left  foot,\r\n\r\nresulting in his left leg being amputated below the\r\n\r\nknee.  The hospital decided to fit him with a pylon\r\n\r\nor  a  wooden peg, and not with an artificial limb.\r\n\r\nThe  reason for this decision seemed to be  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  ground:  as  a Government  employee,  he\r\n\r\nwould  be fitted with a wooden peg free of  charge,\r\n\r\nbut if he wanted to have an artificial limb fitted,\r\n\r\nhe   would  have  to  pay  the  full  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nartificial limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  terms of money, it means that he would have  to\r\n\r\nfind $250 to pay for the cost of such an artificial\r\n\r\nlimb,  which is made locally. Knowing the financial\r\n\r\nposition  of  this  P.W.D. labourer,  I  need  not\r\n\r\nelaborate on his difficulty in finding this sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members in this House may want to know  what\r\n\r\nis the difference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  an  artificial limb and a wooden  peg.  An\r\n\r\nartificial  limb  has  certain  advantages  over  a\r\n\r\nwooden  peg,  namely,  a  patient  fitted  with  an\r\n\r\nartificial limb will look in appearance  very  much\r\n\r\nlike  a normal person with natural limbs, and after\r\n\r\nsome  time  he  will be able to  move  about  quite\r\n\r\neasily. But a patient fitted with a wooden  peg  is\r\n\r\nlikely to feel dejected perpetually because of  its\r\n\r\nunnatural  appearance and will, in  addition,  find\r\n\r\ngreater  difficulty in moving about. An  artificial\r\n\r\nlimb is certainly far more superior to a wooden peg\r\n\r\nin terms of function and appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patient by reason of his being poor is not\r\n\r\nlikely  to be given a chance to be fitted  with  an\r\n\r\nartificial  limb,  simply  because  there   is   in\r\n\r\nexistence   at   present   a   puzzling    hospital\r\n\r\nregulation.  The paradox of the whole situation  is\r\n\r\nthat if his condition requires him to have a wheel-chair, he is entitled, as a Government employee, to\r\n\r\nbe supplied with one free of charge. I am sure hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  agree with me that it  is  extremely\r\n\r\nparadoxical that, as a Government servant, while he\r\n\r\nis  entitled to a free wooden peg which costs about\r\n\r\n$100,  and  a wheel-chair which has to be  imported\r\n\r\nfrom  the United Kingdom at a cost of $300,  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  entitled to an artificial limb which  is  made\r\n\r\nlocally and which costs $250.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for such a paradox is that there is a\r\n\r\nhospital  regulation  which  classifies  artificial\r\n\r\nlimbs  under the heading \"Prosthesis\",  and  wooden\r\n\r\npegs    and   wheel-chairs   under   the    heading\r\n\r\n\"Appliances\".  According  to  this  regulation   or\r\n\r\nstipulation, items such as artificial  limbs  under\r\n\r\nthe heading \"Prosthesis\" can only be supplied to  a\r\n\r\nthird-class  patient if he pays the  full  cost  of\r\n\r\nsuch items, irrespective of whether or not he is  a\r\n\r\nGovernment employee. But such items as wooden  pegs\r\n\r\nor  wheel-chairs under the heading \"Appliances\" can\r\n\r\nbe supplied to a third-class patient free of charge\r\n\r\nif   he  is  a  Government  employee,  and   at   a\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate of 20 per cent  of  the  actual\r\n\r\ncost if he is not a Government employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to follow the logic behind\r\n\r\nsuch  a  stipulation.  To  a  layman  particularly,\r\n\r\nartificial  limbs,  wooden pegs,  or  wheel-chairs,\r\n\r\nprosthesis or appliances all mean one thing,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nartificial aids for a patient who has had his limbs\r\n\r\namputated. To split hairs by classifying  one  item\r\n\r\nunder  the  heading \"Prosthesis\"  and  other  items\r\n\r\nunder  the heading \"Appliances\" might be convenient\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of administration, but certainly in\r\n\r\nthis  instance  it  is  not to  the  advantage  and\r\n\r\ninterest of a third-class patient who has  had  his\r\n\r\nlimbs amputated. This absurd stipulation deprives a\r\n\r\npoor  patient  of  a chance to be  fitted  with  an\r\n\r\nartificial  limb which, as I said earlier,  is  far\r\n\r\nmore superior to any other artificial aids in terms\r\n\r\nof  function  and  appearance,  simply  because  he\r\n\r\ncannot  find the money to pay the full cost  of  an\r\n\r\nartificial limb that the hospital wants  to  charge\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I hope you will allow me at this\r\n\r\njuncture  to  mention in passing that, with  regard\r\n\r\nto  this  P.W.D. labourer whose case  I  have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned,  the  National  Trades  Union   Congress\r\n\r\ndecided  to pay for the cost of an artificial  limb\r\n\r\nto  enable  him  to be fitted with one  instead  of\r\n\r\nwith a wooden peg. The decision of the N.T.U.C. is\r\n\r\nonly  a  symbolic gesture to ring out  the  cry  of\r\n\r\ndistress of this labourer and all those who  happen\r\n\r\nto  suffer the same misfortune. However, this  must\r\n\r\nnot  be  taken  to mean that the N.T.U.C. has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  turned into a philanthropic organisation.  It\r\n\r\njust  does not have the financial resources to dole\r\n\r\nout  assistance  to  all those who  need  help  and\r\n\r\ncharity -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> What about the hospitals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> - especially at a time when it needs all its own\r\n\r\nresources  to strengthen the Singapore trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.

Dedicated\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  nurses have also done  their  bit  by\r\n\r\nproviding them with the best medical treatment  and\r\n\r\nattention  possible. Let there be no hospital  rule\r\n\r\nor  regulation  that is harsher than is  necessary.\r\n\r\nLaws  and rules are made to serve mankind,  not  to\r\n\r\nenslave them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister for Health to give his urgent\r\n\r\nattention  and  sympathetic  consideration  to   my\r\n\r\nproposal   to  rationalise  the  various   hospital\r\n\r\nstipulations  governing the  supply  of  artificial\r\n\r\naids to orthopaedic patients, and to take steps  to\r\n\r\nsupply artificial limbs on the same basis as wooden\r\n\r\npegs  and  wheelchairs are supplied to patients  in\r\n\r\nthird-class wards, whose limbs have to be amputated\r\n\r\nas  a  result of an accident or events beyond their\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I sympathise with the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein when he makes a request for the supply  of\r\n\r\nartificial  limbs. This is a matter  of  aftercare,\r\n\r\nbecause if a worker meets with an accident and  has\r\n\r\nto  have one arm or leg amputated, he will have  to\r\n\r\nfit  himself  with an artificial limb in  order  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on his daily activities so as to look  after\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of his family. This brings me to the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  better methods of safety in industrial\r\n\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been serious cases recently of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents. According to the  statistics\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour  for 1968, there was a total of 8,147 cases,\r\n\r\nof  which  109 were fatal. A total of  195  persons\r\n\r\nhave become permanently disabled, and 1,343 persons\r\n\r\nhave  been  disabled to the extent  that  they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to work further. From these statistics  you\r\n\r\ncan see the seriousness of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is peaceful. We have no wars. However,\r\n\r\nevery  year, unfortunately, we find that more  than\r\n\r\n100  people  lose their lives and  limbs.  This  is\r\n\r\nreally  a  very serious matter and is a problem  to\r\n\r\nponder on. So a more practical attitude is not just\r\n\r\nto  discuss the supply of artificial limbs  but  to\r\n\r\nadopt  better  effective  measures.  I  think   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour should engage more inspectors to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the factories and other places of  work  to\r\n\r\nmake routine or surprise inspections to see whether\r\n\r\nthe facilities there are safe and without hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Teong, the\r\n\r\ndebate  is  on  the  question  of  the  supply   of\r\n\r\nartificial  limbs to injured workmen. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health  will  be  in  no  position  to  answer\r\n\r\nquestions  such as increasing the strength  of  the\r\n\r\ninspectorate, which should properly be directed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour. Can you  please  confine\r\n\r\nyour  remarks to the supply of artificial limbs  to\r\n\r\ninjured workmen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand your ruling, and I\r\n\r\nwill  cut short my speech. As I have said just now,\r\n\r\nI  feel that artificial aids are very necessary for\r\n\r\nthese unfortunate people. But if the cost is to  be\r\n\r\nborne  by  the  workers  themselves,  it  might  be\r\n\r\nimpossible for them to get artificial limbs because\r\n\r\nthey   draw   a   very   low  pay.   According   to\r\n\r\ncalculations,  an  artificial  limb   costs   about\r\n\r\n$2,000.  If the worker happens to be working  in  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  department, I feel that the authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned should look into the matter and try to do\r\n\r\nall   they  can  to  enable  him  to  maintain  his\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and the livelihood of his family.  This\r\n\r\nis what we,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas a Government that looks after the welfare of the\r\n\r\npeople,  should  do  to  help  him  discharge   his\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite understand the\r\n\r\nunfortunate  plight of the victims  who  have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  limbs.  I personally do feel compassion  and\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  them. But I would  like  to  clarify\r\n\r\ncertain  points which have been brought up  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Moulmein. He seemed to convey  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse the impression that artificial limbs are  not\r\n\r\nsupplied  free  to the unfortunate victims  by  the\r\n\r\nhospital    authorities   because   the    hospital\r\n\r\nadministrators  are splitting  hairs  and  want  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between a peg-leg  and  an  artificial\r\n\r\nlimb.  He  said  they  are  slaves  to  rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations.  That is not the case. First  of  all,\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations must be there and they  must\r\n\r\nbe  applied.  Obviously rules and regulations  have\r\n\r\nbeen drawn up because there is a - and I underline it -\r\n\r\nrationale on which they have been drawn up. Perhaps\r\n\r\nif  I  may  just explain, it will clarify  matters.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the difference between an artificial  limb\r\n\r\nand  a peg-leg or a pylon? As far as these aids are\r\n\r\nconcerned, they are an artificial substitute for  a\r\n\r\nlost limb. According to the experts, as far as peg-legs and pylons are concerned, they are the minimum\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for a lost limb, whereas an  artificial\r\n\r\nlimb  is  something  much  more  sophisticated  and\r\n\r\nelaborate.  Of course, the sophistication  and  the\r\n\r\nelaboration of artificial limbs can vary from  type\r\n\r\nto    type.   Some   artificial   limbs   can    be\r\n\r\nelectronically operated. But as far as the hospital\r\n\r\nrules and regulations are concerned, they are based\r\n\r\non  the  policy  that  a  peg-leg  is  the  minimum\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for a lost limb, and that is  what  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  are  providing at  a  subsidised  price.\r\n\r\nArtificial limbs are something more than a  minimum\r\n\r\nsubstitute. Of course, in any case, we must draw  a\r\n\r\nline  somewhere.  If  you say  that  a  patient  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to  a free artificial limb, then  he  may\r\n\r\ndemand  an  artificial limb which is electronically\r\n\r\noperated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I wish to point out\r\n\r\nto  the  Member for Moulmein - if he has  not  been\r\n\r\naware of it, although he is a trade unionist. Under\r\n\r\nsection   15  (3)  of  the  Workmen's  Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance, workmen who are injured are entitled  to\r\n\r\nartificial limbs, but the price must be paid for by\r\n\r\nthe  employers. Why should the Government  be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  supplying a free artificial  limb\r\n\r\nwhen,  under the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nit  is the employers who should be liable to supply\r\n\r\nit?  After  all,  they are the people  who  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit,  whereas  the Government does  not  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit.  Of  course,  if  the  Government  is   the\r\n\r\nemployer, it is a different matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which hinges on policy is this. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Moulmein said that in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. labourer, the N.T.U.C. had contributed  some\r\n\r\nfunds  and, as a result, the labourer is now  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to have the artificial limb. He also added\r\n\r\nthat  the  N.T.U.C., although  it  helped  in  this\r\n\r\ninstance, was not indicating that it was  going  to\r\n\r\nturn  itself into a philanthropic organisation.  On\r\n\r\nthe  same basis, I would say that a hospital is not\r\n\r\na philanthropic organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> It is a State organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> A State organisation is different from a\r\n\r\nphilanthropic  organisation.

Perhaps\r\n\r\nif  I  may bring up certain points, it may  clarify\r\n\r\nthe  matter. According to the regulations,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment, a peg-leg or a pylon, which will cost about\r\n\r\n$100, will be supplied to a \"C\" class patient  (who\r\n\r\npays $1 per day) at 20 per cent of the cost of  the\r\n\r\npeg-leg; that is, he will have to pay $20. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  it is subsidised; whereas if an \"A\" or  \"B\"\r\n\r\nclass  patient wants a pylon or a peg-leg, he  pays\r\n\r\nthe  full  price of $100. However, I wish to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  even  the $100 is an economic  cost. In\r\n\r\nother words, no profit is being made by Government.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$100  is the cost of the production of the peg-leg\r\n\r\nor the pylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  has missed some of my points in his reply.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  quarrelling over the fact  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

What I am talking  about  is\r\n\r\nthe  rationale  of  the case. The  rationale  here\r\n\r\nseems to be a bit cock-eyed simply because, on the\r\n\r\none  hand,  the  Government allows  a  wheel-chair\r\n\r\ncosting  $300 to be given free and, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it does not allow an artificial limb  which\r\n\r\ncosts $250 to be given free.

I have made it\r\n\r\nquite clear just now that the rationale behind\r\n\r\nthe rules and regulations is that, as far as the\r\n\r\nhospitals are concerned, they will give an\r\n\r\nartificial aid which will be the minimum\r\n\r\nsubstitute for a lost limb.

Further improvement in the\r\n\r\nperformance of workers can be expected following\r\n\r\nthe introduction of a scheme of monetary awards to\r\n\r\nbe given to those who are hard working and who\r\n\r\ncontribute towards greater efficiency and\r\n\r\nproductivity in the services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of the norms\r\n\r\nfor labourers were also undertaken by the Public\r\n\r\nCleansing Branch and many of the labourers' beats\r\n\r\nare being lengthened. This is possible due to\r\n\r\nbetter disposal of litter and refuse into\r\n\r\nreceptacles by the public. An increase in\r\n\r\nproductivity and savings in manpower will result\r\n\r\nfrom this exercise of lengthening the beats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
