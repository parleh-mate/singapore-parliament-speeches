Only 5.4% live alone. A similar proportion, 95.2%, are mobile and only 0.6% are confined to bed. 65.7% of the senior citizens are unemployed. Of these, only 3.5% are looking for work. A list of the activities of senior citizens is in the Annex (Cols. 743 - 744) given out by the Clerk. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1986/19860922/19860922-HA-0480743.htm\">Annex - INVOLVEMENT OF SENIOR CITIZENS IN ACTIVITIES BY PERCENTAGE (Cols. 743 - 744)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey also showed that senior citizens engage in meaningful interaction with the children they live with and maintain frequent and meaningful contacts with the children living apart from them. They are confident that they can rely on their family for help when they are ill or have other problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our senior citizens cannot be said to be lonely. Neither do they lack opportunities for interaction. Nonetheless, my Ministry has drawn up a number of programmes to help promote interaction among the aged and prevent boredom and loneliness. These include the setting up of Senior Citizens' Clubs by the Residents' Committees, Citizens Consultative Committees, the People's Association, Day Care and Health Care Centres, health screening and exercise programmes. Details of these have been given by me in this House previously. The programmes are geared to helping the senior citizens to help themselves while those who live alone are given help through the Befriender and Home Help Schemes and the Home Nursing Foundation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has initiated a comprehensive range of activities for the aged. More will be done when necessary. If Members of Parliament have any additional suggestions, they are welcome to send these to me and we will be happy to look into their feasibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> May I ask a clarification from the Minister. He said 3(r)% of these old people were looking for work. Is it 3(r)% of the 6%, or 3(r)% of the total number? I am not clear about this point, Mr Speaker. If it is 3(r)% of the 6%, it becomes 50% of the old people are looking for work.

Will the Minister enlighten us as to whether in the various constituencies facilities are provided for the senior citizens to meet among themselves and to have some recreation among themselves, apart from mixing with the rest of the citizens in the constituency? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I mentioned that there are senior citizens' clubs in the various constituencies organized by the Residents' Committees, the CCCs, the PA, and so on. There are altogether about 111 senior citizens' clubs. Senior citizens can join these clubs. There are now about 27,000 members in these clubs. In addition, there are also other facilities like the day care centres and health screening centres in a couple of the constituencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Acting Minister, by way of a supplementary question again, Sir.

They will have it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am asking for it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>11.12 am. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a straightforward Bill which is exclusively consequential in nature for it makes amendments to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Constitution which are consequential to the recent amendments to the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) (Amendment) Act, 1986. Members will recall that that Act, inter alia, confers on this House the power of expelling a Member in line with similar powers which are to be found in the UK House of Commons and other independent Commonwealth Parliaments. In view of this new power of expulsion, it is necessary to amend Article 46(2) of the Constitution to make it clear that the effect of an expulsion would be to create a vacancy in the seat of the Member who is expelled. Article 46(2) specifies the various circumstances whereby the seat of a Member will become vacant. Clause 3 of this Bill adds a new paragraph (f) in Article 46(2) to provide that the seat of a Member will become vacant if he is expelled from Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment, which is also consequential, relates to Article 9 of the Constitution. The Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) (Amendment) Act, 1986, which we recently enacted, now empowers the House to commit to prison a person who has committed contempt of Parliament. Under Article 9(3) and (4) of the Constitution, a person who is arrested is given the right to be represented by a legal practitioner of his choice and has the right to be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That constitutional provision actually envisages situations of arrest by Police of offenders. It is, therefore, not appropriate that both these requirements should apply to a person who is arrested for contempt of Parliament. In the United Kingdom, persons accused of contempts of Parliament are not, as a rule, allowed to be defended by counsel and leave from the House must be obtained for counsel to be heard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament can, of course, give such leave in appropriate cases, as indeed we in this House did in the recent hearings of the Committee of Privileges. However, it is proposed that the strict legal requirement and position in the United Kingdom with regard to representation by counsel should also be made applicable here. As regards the production of a person arrested for contempt of Parliament before a magistrate, clearly this would not be apt. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> A magistrate would not be in a position to determine whether such a person is to be detained or released. Accordingly, clause 2 of this Bill will amend Article 9(5) of the Constitution so as to exclude the application of clauses (3) and (4) of that Article to any person arrested for contempt of Parliament pursuant to a warrant issued under the hand of the Speaker. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, this Bill is consequential and straightforward, and I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister, in moving this Bill, says that it is consequential upon the passing of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) (Amendment) Act. I can understand that it is so when one looks at clause 3 of the proposed Bill which seeks to amend Article 46(2) of the Constitution to provide that a Member of Parliament shall vacate his seat when he is expelled from Parliament in the exercise of its power of expulsion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do not understand is how clause 2 of the Bill is consequential on the passing of the earlier Act. Clause 2 seeks to deprive a Member of Parliament who has been expelled of a constitutional right which is accorded to every citizen in this country. It is spelt out in Article 9 (3) of the Constitution, and it reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where a person is arrested he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that he need not be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest because he should know the ground if he is arrested on the orders of the Speaker or Parliament for contempt of Parliament. But it is the second limb of that sub-article providing that he \"shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice\" that I am concerned with. As I said, it is an Article in the Constitution. But it is more than that. It is something which is now recognized universally in all countries which apply the rule of law - that anyone who is arrested shall have the right to consult a legal practitioner. Why is a Member of Parliament, albeit an expelled Member of Parliament, be denied this right which is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> accorded to every citizen? I can understand that perhaps he may not be able to challenge the expulsion in court. He may, in some cases, be able to challenge it if he is able to show that the expulsion is procedurally wrong. He may not be able to challenge it on the grounds of the merits or the reasons for the expulsion. But even if he is unable to challenge it, why should he be denied the right to consult with a legal practitioner? He may wish to present a petition to Parliament upon his expulsion and he may need a legal practitioner to help him with that petition. What is the great objection to him being allowed to consult a legal practitioner? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, it violates this basic right which is recognized in all countries which observe the rule of law that a man should not be denied his right to legal advice. Perhaps the Minister might explain why we have sought to deny the expelled Member this basic right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in replying to the Member for Anson, much as I would like to avoid it, I would have to repeat some of the points which I mentioned in my statement, for the reasons were given. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Article 9, clauses (3) and (4) envisage cases of arrest by the Police in the normal arrest cases. Secondly, we are following the position which applies in the United Kingdom. Thirdly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the court will not be in a position to determine if the person should or should not be detained because Parliament, in exercise of its inherent powers, would have decided to punish a person for contempt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point made by the Member for Anson that this is a basic right which applies in all countries, I think he should do his homework. I would only refer him to the position in India where they also have a written Constitution. They also have a Parliament based on Westminster traditions, and I quote from a judicial decision in India which says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where a person has been convicted and sentenced for contempt by the Legislative Assembly, his production before a Magistrate would be absolutely futile. The Magistrate would have no power either to release \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> such a person on bail or to make any other order or provision regarding his custody. The Constitution makers --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to finish what I have to say. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Constitution makers could never have intended that an empty formality should be gone through which would serve no useful purpose.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of the Indian Constitution which was invoked in that case, according to the court, was not intended to apply to a case of detention following conviction and sentence by the Legislative Assembly. The court accordingly held that to be the case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Parliament exercises its prerogative and inherent rights of punishing persons for contempt, what is important is that the punishment of this Chamber must be implemented speedily and expeditiously to give effect to the decision of this House that there has been contempt. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is really by way of clarification. I am afraid the Minister has completely missed the import of my objection. The Minister spends all his time, in replying, in referring to clause (4) of Article 9 where it requires the person arrested to be produced before a magistrate. I was not pleading for that. I was confining my speech to the protection in clause (3) that he shall be allowed to consult a legal practitioner of his choice. That is my question: why cannot he be allowed to consult? He may be in prison, I am not saying that he should be released, but why cannot he ask for the services of a lawyer to consult the matter of his expulsion? I think the Minister has completely missed the point of my objection and refers to production before a magistrate. That is not my point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he talked about the UK rule. May I, first of all say, I do not know why it is necessary for us to follow the UK rule even if there is such a rule. But is there a legislative enactment in the United Kingdom that any Member expelled by the House of Commons will not be allowed to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consult a legal practitioner of his choice? Is there a legal enactment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made it clear that we are following the practice in the United Kingdom. If he now asks why we should follow the practice in the United Kingdom, perhaps he should ask his colleague, the Member for Potong Pasir who not long ago said, \"Sir, if we cannot find a precedent here, we should look to the English precedent.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is there a law? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson must know that the law of privileges in Parliament is not codified in the Constitution or statutory enactment, and I have mentioned to him and to the House that in the law in the United Kingdom, in the implementation of any decision of the House of Commons on contempt, there is no prior right or inherent right to counsel --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is there a denial? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The question is, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether in implementing the decision of this House there is a prior condition for right to counsel, and I have already stated what the position is. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Division will be taken to ascertain that the Second Reading of the Bill is supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total number of Members of Parliament, which is 53, pursuant to Article 5(2) of the Constitution.

Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Legal Profession Act in two main aspects. First, it will bar a legal practitioner convicted of offences involving fraud or dishonesty or who has been suspended from practice for six months or more from holding office as a member of the Council of the Law Society, which is the governing body of the Law Society. Secondly, it will make significant amendments to the provisions dealing with the disciplinary processes of the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, as in most countries, there are certain key professions which, on grounds of public interest, are regulated by law. Why is this so? This is so because of the fact that these professions are very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> important to the functioning of society. The services which the members of these professions render are essential to modern society and the public must rely and expect certain minimum standards of integrity in the reliance they have to place on such professionals. Therefore, laws are enacted to prescribe minimum qualifications for those who want to enter these professions. And the laws also establish the structure of the professional body and also set out procedures to discipline and punish errant and delinquent members. The legal profession is one such key profession in Singapore. And before the present Legal Profession Act, there were previous legislations such as the Advocates and Solicitors Ordinance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good and competent lawyers together with a strong and independent Judiciary are necessary foundations for Singapore's further development as a banking and financial centre. We all know that lawyers represent individuals as well as corporations in their dealings with others. In fact, members of the public have very little choice but to engage the services of lawyers in a wide variety of situations - whether in civil or criminal cases, whether as defendants or plaintiffs, or as accused persons or as parties in commercial or land transactions, matrimonial disputes and so on. In other words, members of the public have no choice really but to place their problems, their difficulties, their fortunes, their liberties and, in some cases, even their lives in the hands and the trust of lawyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the legal profession, not surprisingly, is described as an \"honourable\" profession. All Advocates and Solicitors, under section 83 of the Legal Profession Act, are described as \"officers of the Supreme Court\". And it is from the ranks of the legal profession and the Legal Service that our Supreme Court judges are selected and appointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important, therefore, that the public have the utmost confidence in the ethical standards, financial and personal integrity of lawyers. Fortunately, the majority of the members of our legal profession are honourable and practise their profession conscientiously and in accordance with the ethics of the profession. But, unfortu- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nately, in recent times there have been increasing instances where the integrity of members of the Bar, including senior and well established lawyers, have been cast into doubt. Lawyers have been convicted of cheating, criminal breach of trust, of making false statutory declarations and some lawyers have taken their client's money. Recently, a lawyer, then a partner in a leading firm, was found to have participated in a scheme to defraud members of the public who desired to trade in commodity futures. Unfortunately, his conviction was quashed on appeal because of a technical error in the proceedings. He is still in practice, unpunished because of a technical or procedural error in his trial. In another case, a former President of the Law Society had to be severely reprimanded and admonished by the Chief Justice for gross overcharging of his client. Not surprisingly, Sir, the standing of the profession as a result has been damaged by such deplorable conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary responsibility for punishing such black sheep in the profession is in the control of the Judges of the Supreme Court. This responsibility is shared by the Council of the Law Society. Under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee, which is a standing committee of the Law Society, conducts preliminary investigations into complaints or allegations of misconduct by a member of the Bar. If this Inquiry Committee finds that there is cause for further investigation, then the matter is referred to a Disciplinary Committee comprising three lawyers appointed by the Chief Justice. This Disciplinary Committee has to ascertain the facts and then report whether there is a case strong enough or grave enough to warrant disciplinary action. When a Disciplinary Committee finds that there is such a case, the matter is brought before the Judges of the Supreme Court. Only they have the power to suspend or strike off an advocate and solicitor from the roll. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the persons who sit on the Inquiry Committee and the Disciplinary Committee are all lawyers. The errant member is therefore judged entirely by his peers. This is based on the traditional British practice of self-regulation which grew up in guilds of people in a particular \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> trade, historically. In recent times, the permissive attitude of these self-regulating bodies have created doubts in their willingness to police themselves or to discipline members of their own kind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one case, a Disciplinary Committee recommended merely a reprimand for an advocate and solicitor who was convicted of cheating. In another case, a Disciplinary Committee refused to inquire into certain charges preferred against an advocate and solicitor. In addition, in another recent case, no action whatsoever was taken on information referred to the Law Society by the Attorney-General even though the information on the face of it disclosed grave misconduct on the part of a prominent lawyer. These cases diminish the standing of the legal profession and raise grave doubts as to their will or resolve to police themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must add that most of these cases of misconduct which I have referred to, have become public knowledge only because they have been brought before our courts. Many other instances of misconduct go unnoticed and unreported as to how they are leniently disposed of by the Inquiry or Disciplinary Committee in which there is no representation for the consumer or public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal profession does not disclose the number or the nature of complaints received. Neither is the general public informed of how all these complaints are dealt with. The public can only come to know of these instances of misconduct when the proceedings are brought before a Court of three Judges. We have no knowledge, for instance, of cases where lawyers have been found guilty of misconduct but were merely reprimanded or fined without being brought before a Court of three Judges. But, as I have said, we have seen that even with regard to instances where an errant member of the Bar is brought before the Court of three Judges, there were considerable delays in the investigations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the confidentiality which surrounds the investigations by the Bar and because all persons involved in the investigations are themselves members of the Bar, surely dissatisfied members of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> public would have good reasons to question the manner of such investigations. This is a grey area. It is faulty with respect to the present structure for the discipline of lawyers, and it must be put right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the amendment concerning eligibility to hold office, the present system of self-regulation under the Act entitles any advocate and solicitor, regardless of his conduct, to hold office as a member of the Council. It was never imagined, Sir, that a body of honourable members of the legal profession would choose from amongst themselves those who have been found guilty and punished for unprofessional conduct. It could never have been imagined because to have flawed members to sit on the Council to govern and maintain standards in the profession is really a preposterous notion. It is like having an ex-drug addict or drug trafficker or other notorious criminal being appointed as a judge. It is like appointing a poacher as head game-keeper. But this has in fact now happened. Self-regulation has become a farce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that the absurdity of this can be appreciated if I draw Members' attention to section 79(1) (a) in the Act concerning solicitors' clerks. This little provision prohibits any person who is convicted of \"an offence involving dishonesty\" from being employed by a lawyer. Unless there is an order of Court, such person is permanently barred from such employment. Here we are talking about an ordinary person with 'O' level or 'A' level results who wants to work in law firm. He is permanently barred from even working for a law firm. But, on the other hand, a lawyer convicted of such offence can serve on the Council! I repeat, the disqualification was never spelt out in the Act because it never occurred to the legislators that a body of lawyers would elect flawed men to guard the standards of their profession and punish others, like themselves, who have violated the trust placed in them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this happens, what is the responsibility of the Government? The Government has a duty to the public to put an end to such scandalous professional mis- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> behaviour. And this is why these amendments are being moved. The President and members of the Council must be untainted men, capable of discharging their duties because their own integrity and personal conduct have never been called into question. They are the persons who set the moral tone for the profession. And tainted men do not and cannot command moral authority over other fellow professionals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these amendments put lawyers on notice that if they do not clean up their own house, then the Government will do so. Former wrongdoers surely cannot police other wrongdoers in this profession. The disciplinary processes of the profession cannot be dilatory and lax. And the inclusion of lay persons or non-lawyers in the Disciplinary Committee will stop the belief that self-help and mutual forgiveness is the way lawyers maintain standards of professional conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to the amendments to the disciplinary proceedings. There are really three main amendments. First, the maximum membership of the Inquiry Committee is increased to 15. These 15 members can work through panels of three members each. In other words, five panels can function at any one time. This will enable speedier disposition of complaints and make it less onerous on the Committee of the whole. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Disciplinary Committee will now comprise a legal practitioner, an experienced Legal Service officer and a lay member who represents consumer interests. The inclusion of non-lawyers and of people who are regular users of the services of lawyers will help allay some of the apprehensions caused by the present in-house nature of the disciplinary processes. We have, however, retained the practice of only members of the Bar deciding on the norms of proper conduct of the profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, amendment to section 90 concerning application to appoint a Disciplinary Committee. The amendment does not alter the existing position whereby the Inquiry Committee reports to the Council of the Law Society which then makes a determination if there should be a full formal investigation. That is retained. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> However, the Bill provides for two other situations where the Law Society Council shall apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a Disciplinary Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Government has also taken this opportunity to introduce amendments to the Act to put right certain provisions of the Act which have been subjected to an overly restrictive interpretation by the Privy Council in the case of James Chia v. The Law Society of Singapore. If I may explain, Sir. That decision now prevents the Attorney-General as well as the Law Society from taking steps to have a finding of a Disciplinary Committee reviewed, although the person who made the complaint may bring about such a review. It is considered that, for the future, it should be open also for either the Law Society or the Attorney-General, to apply for a review of the finding. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to commit this Bill to a Select Committee so that an opportunity can be given for members of the public, and in particular the Law Society, to make known their views. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Koh Lam Son -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Koh Lam Son (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Amendment Bill and also to take the opportunity to say a few words. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that the amendment to the Legal Profession Bill has come about following certain action of the present Council of the Law Soceity. Through their own doings, the Council members have placed themselves in disrepute. Do they act as leaders of the legal profession, or do they have political motives in issues they recently raised with the Government? I think it is clear to many of us that there was political posturing, both in manner and tone, of the public attack on the Government on the recently amended Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Act, and in the publicity they gave to their Sub-Committee's work on the question of the need to change the Legal Service Commission and on the constitutional implications of an elected President. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legal profession plays a vital role in carrying out justice and protecting the rights of the people, and the Law Society represents the legal profession. Membership is compulsory for all practising lawyers. The Society handles all the affairs of the lawyers and speak on their behalf. Their leaders are therefore expected to be men of irreproachable character. The Society, Sir, is not a private club. It is a body passed by an Act of Parliament. Parliament sets out the objectives and requirements, and therefore Parliament is ultimately responsible for the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to this Bill, I had thought that the cause for public concern was the question as to whether we should allow people who are politically motivated from using a non-political body such as the Law Society as a political-shooting station. This was, in fact, the attempt made by the present Council of the Law Society. However, Sir, the proposed amendment has not taken cognizance of this problem, and I would like to ask the Minister for Law to explain this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do understand the predicament of some members in the Law Society and in other non-political organizations who may feel that they have a political cause to expound, but they are not prepared to stand up and be counted. We cannot, however, allow these people to exploit non-political organizations and put them in disrepute. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Amendment Bill seeks to preclude those members who have committed offences from joining the Council of the Law Society. Some lawyers, including the Member for Potong Pasir, have said in the press that such high moral standards as spelt out in the Amendment Bill are not necessary. And they argued that if a member has paid his penalty and has been allowed to practise law, he should be fit to stand for election in the Council. I find that this argument is more motional rather than rational. Surely, Sir, there is a difference between the way we judge erring lawyers and the way we appraise outstanding lawyers aspiring for leadership roles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill, in fact, does not seek to elevate the moral standard of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Council members but it seeks to preserve standards. And the question is, if members of the Law Society choose to relax standards, would this not affect the high standing of the Law Society in the eyes of the public? Sir, had this moral requirement of Council members been incorporated in the original Professional Bill, nobody is likely to query it but because the timing of the Bill may affect the office or the term of office of the incumbent President of the Law Society, some members, obviously his supporters, find themselves arguing against it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Amendment Bill. \n  <br>12.06 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak on this Bill, may I say that I have no direct personal pecuniary interest. But I certainly have an interest because I am a member of the Society and I am an advocate and solicitor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I also make it quite clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the Law Society or any group. I am speaking here as a Member of Parliament and expressing my own views on this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not that the Bill is devoid of any merit. I can find one particular amendment which commends itself to me and I think it should commend itself to the public at large, and that is, that there should be somebody outside the legal profession sitting on the Disciplinary Committee when it makes a formal investigation into a complaint against a member of the Law Society. I think it may be perhaps judicious that we should apply this generally now to all professions, and I would like to commend to the Minister and to the Government that perhaps they should set up a professional tribunal panel consisting of memebers who would be called upon from time to time to sit on Disciplinary Committees or other committees inquiring into the conduct of professionals. And at least one member should come from a profession outside the profession of the member who is inquired into. So it is completely not without merit, Mr Speaker, Sir. But nevertheless I oppose this Bill and I do so, Mr Speaker, Sir, vehemently. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My opposition to this Bill springs largely from the motives for the introduction of this Bill. I question the motives and I think it is necessary that the Minister should explain the real motives for this Bill and not hide behind platitudes. Nobody, Mr Speaker, Sir, questions the need for the public to repose the utmost confidence in any professional grouping. It is not only just lawyers, but doctors, accountants, architects. It is necessary that the public should be protected from errant members of these professions who service the public. So no one questions that need. I do not think the lawyers have ever questioned that need. But it is not as though there has been no protection for the public against errant members of the legal profession, and I shall, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the time allotted to me, show that there is ample protection at the moment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it not be forgotten that the legal profession is the one profession where its members are controlled and disciplined not by the members but by a body completely outside. The control and discipline of the members of the Law Society lie with the Judges of the Supreme Court. I shall show that the Minister is wrong when he says that the Council shares this responsibility. The Council does not share the responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment there is ample protection for the public in the measures outlined in the Act relating to complaints against members of the Law Society, against the members of the legal profession. So what has prompted this Bill? I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is quite plain to anyone that this Bill has been prompted purely for one reason, and one reason only. Just as I said about the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) (Amendment) Bill, that it was prompted only for one reason and that it had nothing to do with the decorum and dignity of the House. This Bill has been prompted simply because the Law Society has done the unforgivable thing in Singapore. In the past, the Law Society had somehow carried out its functions in a manner that the Government approved or accepted. If it had any recommendations or any communications to make, it made it direct to the Government. So that was all right. The public were not told. But sometime this year when the Newspaper and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill was introduced, the Law Society took upon itself to fulfil one of its roles, and I say that it is one of the roles of the Law Society. It is a role that the Society should discharge to members of the public. It is a role that any professional society should discharge to members of the public, and that is, to voice their criticism or fears of any impending legislation, or indeed of any issue that might concern and affect the citizens generally. And that is what the Law Society did. But that was unforgivable. The Government took umbrage when a government in any other democratic country, a government which respected its citizens, a government which trusted its citizens, would have welcomed the criticism of the Society or the group. But not in Singapore. In Singapore, no one, I repeat, no one can stand up and voice his criticism and especially so if that criticism carries some weight, as indeed the criticism by the Law Society did, because it was voicing the criticism of the members of the legal profession. And we had, immediately following the criticism by the Law Society, statements by the Ministers that the Law Society was entering into the political arena, that the President of the Law Society was politically motivated - all quite uncalled for. A society which voices criticism is not necessarily thereby entering into the political arena. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallacy which I have said outside is that this Government says that it is open to any individual member of the society to voice any criticism. But it says he cannot do it with 10 others together. That is the fallacy. I have said, if the Government says quite seriously that any member of the public can voice his criticism, then that right must be given or recognized, whether the person says it individually or whether he says it with 10 others. Freedom of assembly is an integral part of the freedom of speech, and that I am afraid this Government fails to grasp or recognize. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Government has no faith, no trust. I said, in speaking on the Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill, that the Government would appear to have no trust or faith in the judgment of its citizens and it was necessary to regulate and con- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> trol their reading. Now it would appear that the Government has no faith or trust in the members of the legal profession. That, this Government has made quite plain from its inception in 1959. It had no trust, no faith in its own citizens, and I say, Sir, in all sincerity and with all force, that a government which has no faith, which has no trust in its citizens, and particularly in its professionals, has no moral right to govern. If you do not have any faith in the citizens, then you have lost your right to govern the citizens because government can only proceed upon mutual trust and confidence, ie, mutual trust of the citizens in the government and mutual trust of the government in the citizens, and particularly of the professions. But if that is lacking, then you have lost your right to govern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is intended to humiliate the members of the Law Society. Again, as the Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill was intended to humiliate our citizens, this is intended to humiliate the members of the Law Society. And so I ask the question that I asked then: why does this Government take it upon itself to ridicule and humiliate our people? What right does the Government have? Not long ago, we had the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office making a completely unwarranted attack on the professions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been accused here of having made a scurrilous comment on the Chief Justice. I have asked, what is my scurrilous comment? What about the comments made by the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office? If mine was scurrilous, what were these comments? Pure abuse of the profession and at a time when we need the people outside Singapore to repose confidence in Singapore and Singaporeans. But here is the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office branding all professionals in Singapore as crooks, swindlers, and what have you. So what will an investor think before he decides to come to Singapore? A man with money to invest, what will he think? He will say, \"I have got to think twice. Here is the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office giving me plain warning that Singapore is full of crooks.\" I hope the Government realizes the damage that has been done by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humiliation is that before this Bill was introduced in Parliament, the Council of the Law Society was never consulted. No views of the Council were sought on this Bill and yet this Government speaks time and time again of consultation, of feedback. After the 1984 elections, it was recognized that there was a need for consultation and they set up the Feedback Unit. What happened to the Feedback Unit when this Bill was thought of? Why were the lawyers not consulted? Why were their views not sought? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may mention by way of contrast, Mr Speaker, Sir, there was another Bill, not concerning lawyers, but concerning the gentlemen in the stockbroking industry. We were told this year in March, I think, that as early as the middle of last year or the beginning of last year, the Government had proposed to introduce a new Securities Industry Bill to give the MAS more powers over the stockbroking industry. We were told that the draft of that Bill was sent to the Committee of the Stock Exchange sometime at the beginning of last year or the middle of last year. And we were told by the Minister that the gentlemen in the Committee of the Stock Exchange were not very happy about the Bill, and so nothing was done. It was not introduced in Parliament until, of course, these gentlemen in the Stock Exchange Committee and others had brought ruin to thousands of Singaporeans by the Pan-El crisis, leading to the closure of the Stock Exchange for three days. After they had wrought the damage, simply out of pure greed, then the Government decided that it could not wait any more for their views. It decided to rush through the Securities Industry Act, with or without their views. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there you have it, by way of contrast. The Government sought the views of the Committee of the Stock Exchange in 1985, but not the Council of the Law Society on this Bill. Why, may I ask, was a distinction made? Why were the members of the Committee of the Stock Exhange treated in a preferential manner? What clout did they have? Would the Minister try and explain? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> I ask again the Minister to be honest and tell us what is the reason for the Government introducing the Bill. Has there been any public outcry? Has there been any public disquiet that members of the Law Society, the lawyers, are getting away unpunished, or is it just merely in the mind of the Government and its Ministers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I propose to show what control now exists over the members of the legal profession. As I said a little while ago, the disciplinary control is not exercised by the Council. It is exercised by Judges of the Supreme Court, and what better protection than that can the members of the public have? By section 85 of the Act, Mr Speaker, Sir, the members of the Inquiry Committee are appointed not by the Council, and this is why I think the Minister was not altogether truthful when he said that the Council shared the responsibility. He was omitting this - that the members of the Inquiry Committee are all appointed by the Chief Justice. He selects them. The Council has no hand in the appointment of Inquiry Committee members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, by section 86 of the Act, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Council is required to refer all complaints to the Inquiry Committee from any member of the public or any public application. The Council has no discretion. It must go to the Inquiry Committee. And by section 87, the Inquiry Committee is required, it is mandatory, to report within two months. They cannot drag their feet over any complaint and I thought there were some vague allusions or insinuations that things were being covered up. I shall show that there is no possibility of any cover-up, and I do regret that the Minister should have chosen in this House to smear the whole of the legal profession in the manner he did. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inquiry Committee must report whether a formal investigation is necessary and, Members of the House, that means that the matter should be referred to a Disciplinary Committee, or the Inquiry Committee can report that a formal investigation is not necessary, or it can report that the Council itself can take action on it. Then once the Council receives the report from the Inquiry Committee, the Council must determine within one month what it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> proposes to do. If the Inquiry Committee recommends a formal investigation, the Council has no choice in the matter. It must go to the Disciplinary Committee. But the Council is allowed to disagree with the Inquiry Committee if it proposes no formal investigation. The Council can, nevertheless, still refer the matter to the Disciplinary Committee even when the Inquiry Committee says no formal investigation is necessary. And then by section 91 when the matter is referred to the Disciplinary Committee, the members who sit on the Disciplinary Committee are all appointed by the Chief Justice. The Council has no choice. It does not select any member to sit on the Disciplinary Committee. The Chief Justice does it. It is his decision and his decision alone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if we look at section 94 of the Act, you find that the Disciplinary Committee decides whether the member should be made to show cause. It makes a recommendation to that effect. But the important thing is this: that the report of the Disciplinary Committee does not go only to the Council, it also goes to the Chief Justice because it reports to him. And in cases where the Disciplinary Committee recommends that no sufficient gravity exists to ask the member to show cause, the Chief Justice can still direct the Council to apply to the Court by way of Originating Summons for the member to show cause. So there you have it. Even where the Disciplinary Committee says, \"We don't think it is necessary for the member to show cause\" after their formal investigation, the Chief Justice can disagree. Of course, the Council cannot, but the Chief Justice can and he can direct the Council to apply to the High Court for an order to show cause. So I hope I have made it quite clear that the real control lies with the Chief Justice, not with the Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you have sections 96 and 97 of the Act. By these sections, Mr Speaker, Sir, any applicant who is not satisfied (by an applicant, of course, I mean a member of the public who has complained about the conduct of a member of the Society) if he is not satisfied with the decision of the Inquiry Committee that it should not go up to a Disciplinary Committee or, again, if he is not satisfied with the report of the Disciplinary Committee that the member \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should not be asked to show cause, he still has a remedy. He can himself take out an application in the High Court before a Judge and ask the Judge to direct that the Inquiry Committee's findings be set aside and the matter be referred to the Disciplinary Committee, or that the Disciplinary Committee's findings be set aside and that the man should be made to show cause. We have had instances of that in the recent past. So the public are adequately protected and, at the risk of repetition, the control vests with the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look, Mr Speaker, Sir, at some of the figures over the last five years of reports made to the Law Society and what action has been taken in those cases. I have culled these figures from the reports of the Inquiry Committees which were presented along with the annual reports of the Law Society. The Law Society, like every other society, presents an annual report, and attached to the annual report is a report of the Inquiry Committee. So the figures are taken from those reports. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year October 1980 to September 1981, there were only 29 complaints which were investigated by the Inquiry Committee. Out of these, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Inquiry Committee held that 21 either had no grounds for complaint or that they should be dismissed. So out of 29, 21 were dismissed by the Inquiry Committee. And, as I said, the person who made the complaint could have taken it up if he had any qualms about the decision, and again the Chief Justice could have taken it up if he had any qualms or doubt about the decision. Fines were imposed only on six lawyers, and only in one case was a Disciplinary Committee appointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to the year October 1981 to September 1982. There were 38 cases which were inquired into by the Inquiry Committee. I have only got the figures for dismissals. About 15 were dismissed and only in four cases were Disciplinary Committees appointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year October 1982 to September 1983, there were 40 complaints and the Inquiry Committee held that 27 of them either had no grounds or that there was not enough evidence to justify the complaint. So 27 were dismissed and fines \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were imposed on six and Disciplinary Committees appointed in seven. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if you look at the October 1983 to September 1984, 33 cases were inquired into by the Inquiry Committee. Of these, 22 were dismissed and fines imposed on eight, and Disciplinary Committee appointed in only three cases. I should perhaps explain, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of Members, that a fine is the discretion given to the Council where the Council agrees with the view that no sufficient gravity exists for the member to be asked to show cause but nevertheless feels a fine should be imposed, and under the Act, the Society may fine any member up to $5,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if you come to the last year for which I have the figure, and this is October 1984 to September 1985, there were 25 cases inquired into by the Inquiry Committee, of which 21 were dismissed, fines imposed on three and Disciplinary Committee appointed in one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the position up to 1985. I do not have the figures after that. Do they show, Mr Speaker, Sir, an alarming state of affairs in the legal profession? Mr Speaker, Sir, we have more than 1,000 members in the legal profession. I think the latest count would probably be about 1,350 or more. And the number of complaints does not come up to 5% in any year. May I say that is a remarkably low figure - complaints from members of the public - because if you look at the position in the United Kingdom, for example, again of course, they have got far more solicitors, you will see the complaints there come up to quite a big figure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why has the Government suddenly come up with this Bill? The Minister has not explained to this House why he considers the present sections in the Act inadequate and what is wrong about them. As I said earlier, we are left then with only one reason, and that is, the Law Society and its members have to be put in their place, and their place is not to criticize the august Government, however gently they may do it; their place is simply to obey; that the Government was the embodiment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of all that is good for Singapore, and that nobody should be allowed to deviate from the Government's embodiment of what is good for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Government decided that the Society and the President had to be punished. The President of the Law Society, under the amendment, will have to vacate his office. It is quite clear to me that once this Bill becomes law, he can no longer remain as President of the Law Society. If one looks at clause 3, one finds that section 59(1) which deals with members of the Council vacating their office, is amended by deleting the existing paragraph and substituting the new paragraph (a) which reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'he has been struck off the roll or suspended from practice for a period of 6 months or more or has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty;' So it seems to me patently clear that the President will have to vacate his office. And this is a slap in the face for the members of the Law Society. They elected him and the Government decides that they should not have elected him. This is gross interference with the rights of the members of the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a section in the Act which says that all members of the Society shall enjoy the same privileges and rights. Of course, for the period of the suspension, the member does not enjoy the same rights and privileges. But once the suspension is over or he is restored to the roll of advocates and solicitors, then he enjoys the same rights and privileges. Why should he be denied this right and privilege to stand for election to the Council of the Law Society? The Minister says that it came as an utter surprise, to the utter amazement of the Government, that the members of the Law Society should be so foolish, should be so unwise, had gone out of their minds perhaps, to elect as their President someone who had been suspended at one time from the membership of the Society. May I ask the Minister whether any squeak was heard from the Government when he was elected? Did the Government express any regret? Did the Minister for Law express regret? Nothing. We heard nothing about it. But, of course, the position changed when the Law Society committed the unforgivable sin in Singapore of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> speaking against the Government on a proposed Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is necessary to expose the hypocrisy behind this Bill. I say that the motives are not genuine and it is brought simply because the Government has decided it is time that the Law Society should be punished. And this, of course, is in line with the entire manner in which things have been done in Singapore. In 1973, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was a member of the Council of the Law Society, and so was Mr Dennis Murphy a member of the Council of the Law Society. But I was told, after it happened, that the Prime Minister had summoned all the members of the Council, excluding me and Mr Murphy. He did not want to see us. He had summoned all the other members of the Council and had told them how they should run their affairs. And it was there, I was told, that the Prime Minister said that he was going to deal with me outside. That was why I was not there before him. But this is it, this desire, this insatiable thirst, to control every activity in Singapore. No one can be allowed to regulate their own affairs and to run their own house but the Government must control it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet one other incident, Mr Speaker, Sir, before I sit down and which comes to mind is this summoning by the Prime Minister of the pilots of the Singapore Airlines. There they were complaining, they were involved in a wage dispute with the company over their pay and the matter had been referred to the Industrial Arbitration Court. And I think the Industrial Arbitration Court is equated to the High Court. Notwithstanding that the matter was before the Court, the Prime Minister summoned the executive body of the Pilots' Association and gave them a dressing down and they were asked to withdraw all their demands. As I said, this is all in line; it is part of a pattern, a pattern that was set when the PAP took office in 1959. And it makes nonsense of all their protestations after 1984, of listening to the people, of a desire to relax and let the people have their say. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, may I just run through one or two points made by the Minister. One of his points was that the Law Society does not disclose the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> number of complaints. As I said, they make a report. The Inquiry Committee furnishes a report every year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> They do not make it public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is in the annual report. It is available. The Chief Justice will have it. The Minister for Law, if he calls for it, I am sure the Law Society will send it to him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to know, please, Sir, is: why is the present procedure faulty? The Minister says the present procedure is faulty. In what way does he find the present procedure faulty? I cannot find anything that is faulty about the present procedure. As I said, it is the only profession whose members are controlled by the Judges of the Supreme Court. Does he find that faulty? Does he think that somebody else should control the members of the Law Society? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says self-regulation has become a farce. The point is that the Council does not regulate. The regulation is now left to the Judges of the Supreme Court. So may we have clear details about all the statements made by the Minister? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one section on which I must speak, Mr Speaker, Sir, and that is on clause 8 which seeks to amend section 91 of the principal Act and which deals with the appointment by the Chief Justice of the members to the Disciplinary Committee. At present, it is all members of the profession who are appointed to the Disciplinary Committee. This amendment seeks to bring in somebody from outside the profession, which I commend. I think it is a step in the right direction. But what I do not understand is the inclusion of a legal officer who has at least eight years' service. If a complaint is made by the Attorney-General against a member of the Law Society, is it right and proper that a legal officer should be sitting on the Disciplinary Committee inquiring into the charge or complaint made by the Attorney-General? In any case, why is it necessary to have a legal officer? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1979, there was an amendment to bring in three Government appointed members on to the Council. The Minister \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> was given the power to nominate three members on to the Council. May I say, Members of the House, that over the Causeway, they trust their lawyers. They allow their lawyers to regulate, and I think they discharge their duties. But not here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made about suspended members not holding office. As the Member for Potong Pasir said, I think in a press statement, that apparently does not disqualify someone being appointed by the Government to a high office. So I find so many inconsistencies and contradictions in this Bill. And one is left with the feeling, I repeat, that the whole purpose of this Bill is simply to humiliate our legal brethren here, members of the Law Society. And why? Because they have spoken. They have discharged their duty to their fellow members of society. That is the unforgivable thing that they have done. They have at last woken up to their duty and they tried to discharge it. But lo and behold, the Government comes down upon them. It is for this reason, Sir, that I will oppose this Bill, and I give notice that I shall be calling for a division. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to suspend this sitting now and will take the Chair again at 2.30 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 1.00 pm until 2.30 pm.</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 2.30 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> May it please you, Mr Speaker. It is typical of this Government sometimes when there is no danger in any situation, this Government will make out one, and where there is no need of a law the Government will go ahead and implement one. This particular Bill is a good example. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I am not convinced at all by the Minister. I cannot see one valid reason why I should support this Bill. The Minister has said that in recent times there has been an increasing number of lawyers \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> guilty of misconduct. I think he also said something to the effect that the Bar Council believes in self-help and mutual assistance and it is reluctant to punish its own members. Both these statements are furthest from the truth. As has been pointed out by the Member for Anson, the statistics were in fact taken from the Report of the Law Society which shows that there is a drop in the number referred to the Disciplinary Committee, ie, the Committee that punishes defaulting lawyers. Over the last five or six years, in fact, from 1982-83 period to 1984-85 period, there has been a tremendous drop from seven members to one having been referred to the Law Society. That is a drop of over 80%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the rationale? There is no rationale at all to amend the Legal Profession Act as it stands. There are enough provisions to keep lawyers, so to say, in line. The Minister has said that Singapore is an important banking and commercial centre. We all know that. And the lawyer has played his part to make it that way. So if there is really no valid reason to amend this law in the public interest, we should find what are the reasons. Perhaps a clue has already been given by the Member for Telok Blangah and also by what has transpired in the press. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Society has been accused of meddling in politics. That is furthest from the truth, again. It is the duty of pressure groups in Singapore, like the Law Society and other professional bodies, to take part in issues which are of public interest. And, of course the amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act is one such issue. Whether or not we are going to change the style of government in Singapore to that of a Presidential type of government, or whether we are going to have a Westminster type of government, I think all persons in Singapore should have a say, not only professional people. But, of course, I would imagine the Minister bringing out his own set of statistics to show that, in fact, there has been an increase of lawyers defaulting. If that were the case, then there would be two sets of statistics. I wonder which set is the truthful one. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason seems to be political. Anyone who criticizes the Government, anybody who dares to speak against any Government policy will have to be silenced. There must be a deterrent for every situation. That is the new philosophy of the PAP. But, of course, we must always take note that it is not always that the interest of the ruling party must be upheld. The interest of the country and the interest of the people are equally important. Is it good or not for bodies in Singapore, ie, associations, professional bodies, business people, to regulate themselves? I think this question is an important question. In fact, it has to be highlighted and debated. From the Government's point of view, the Government does not think that it is pursuing its paternalistic policy, ie, everybody has to be regulated in Singapore. As has been pointed out by the Member for Anson, this is part of the pattern of governance of the PAP - regulation. In fact, there is already over-regulation, and it is high time the Government realized that this kind of a policy is leading Singapore to a dead end, as we are experiencing now. Neighbouring countries are still enjoying positive growth, whereas ours have gone to a minus. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. Would the hon. Member tell us which countries in Southeast Asia are enjoying positive growth? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You are an economist and I think you know the answer. It is high time the PAP sought new formulae to rule the country. Discard your old ways. Control and more control is bad for Singapore. This Bill is in line with that kind of a policy. Why tell professional people what to do? Because at the moment there is no solid ground for the Minister to amend this Act. As they say in the temperate countries, \"One swallow does not show that Spring is coming.\" So one or two people in the profession, or members of the public, who have defaulted like in the --- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> One swallow does not make a Summer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Well, of course, Spring comes before Summer! I think the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> last amendment to the Housing and Development Act is in the same pattern. We get four cases in a year of people just dropping something out of their window, and they are slammed down with a sledgehammer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is also the same. We have got here a complaint by the Attorney-General, whom we have been told, is a Government man. A complaint from him, and the Disciplinary Committee straightaway has to take action, bypassing the Inquiry Committee. Why the need for that? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Who says so? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Well, read the Bill. So unless the Minister can come out with some valid reasons, I think one Member has already said, there is a lot of loose and ludicrous legislation going through this House. This is one of the ludicrous and loose legislation. Half-way through, they say, \"Ha, all kinds of errors are coming in. Put it to a Select Committee.\" Why does not the Government sit down and look at it properly? There is the Law Society whom they can consult. There is no better body to consult than the Law Society. Consult them. I think consultation is perhaps a duty of the Government, and the Government has forgotten this over these last 25 years. It has taken the role of \"the Government knows best\" attitude. Again, this is another point which the PAP must change. This is their old style of governing Singapore. They must change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say of this Bill, after it has gone through Select Committee, that they will probably find that there are, in fact, no good points in it at all. Therefore, I am not supporting this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin (MacPherson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on this Bill as a person who had been in Government for many years and before that in legal practice for more than eight years and now back in legal practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was in Government, I had cognizance of the shortcomings of the legal profession. I am therefore not surprised that things have now come to a head that the Government has considered it necessary to introduce the amendments to the Legal Profession Act which are before us. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> It is a rather sad reflection on members of the profession as a whole. In my view, this sad state of affairs has come about because the vast majority of the members of the profession,especially the senior members, have been so busy attending to their legal practice, that they have no time to be involved in the affairs of the profession. As a result they have --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As a result, they have, by and large, allowed a minority group of activists to run and dictate the affairs of the profession in their name. And when the majority in the profession also fail to take action or to dissociate themselves from the activities of the delinquent few, then the public must inevitably conclude that the misdeeds of the few are accepted as the norm by the whole profession. This must seriously tarnish the good name of the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of the legal profession to the well-being of our society is a crucial one. There is no aspect of our everyday life that is not affected in some way or other by the law. Lawyers interpret the law and give advice to their clients who are members of the public. Members of the public act on their advice and stake their lives, careers and fortunes on the word of their lawyer. In many instances, because of the requirements of the law, people must place their monies in the hands of their lawyers. Because of such heavy responsibilities, it is absolutely vital that every member of the profession must not only be a person of the highest integrity and trustworthiness but must also be seen to be so. The lawyer must, like Caesar's wife, be above suspicion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, if the legal profession is rather tardy in correcting their shortcomings and is unconcerned with protecting the good image of the profession, the Government is duty bound in the public interest to intervene and put things right. I was there- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fore rather curious to know why, when the Government first announced the introduction of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill, there was an immediate strong reaction on the part of 62 members of the profession who came out against it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why don't you go there and speak? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> They called for an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Law Society --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Get your members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That's right.

I think we must have some decorum in the House. The Member for Anson spoke for one hour and he was not interrupted. Why cannot he give the same courtesy to other Members of this House? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I meant to ask him to go before the members tonight. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Stop interrupting, Mr Jeyaretnam. You had your say. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, he has not learned his lesson. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore curious, Mr Speaker, Sir, to know why, when the Government first announced the introduction of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill, there was an immediate strong reaction on the part of 62 members of the profession who came out against it. They called for an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Law Society to deplore the Government's action. Among the reasons they gave was that the Bill deprived a member, whom the Supreme Court considered fit to be reinstated as an advocate and solicitor after his period of suspension, the right to stand for election and to hold office. To me, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is rather spurious logic because it does not follow that a member found to be fit to practise and to earn his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> living is in the same category as those who are elected to hold office. This is because the office-holders not only set the standards of behaviour and ethics of the profession but they also reflect the public image of the profession. Office -holders must therefore have an unblemished character. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small group of activists also complained that the Bill would deprive the lawyers of their independence, ie, their right of self-regulation. I wish to point out the misconception of their claim that without self-regulation there cannot be a strong Bar to safeguard the rights of all persons. The fallacy of their claim of inviolability of self-regulation is clear enough when we look at the record of the legal profession in Singapore in setting proper standards and policing its members. From what I know, the record of the Law Society in this respect is rather disturbing. And this knowledge is quite well known among members of the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me cite some of the examples apart from those already cited by the Minister. In one case that I know of, a complaint was made against a lawyer in 1982 alleging that he deceived a magistrate into granting a postponement of a case. A Disciplinary Committee was appointed in April 1983. Nobody knows whether today, after a lapse of three years, the Disciplinary Committee has submitted its report. It is generally believed that it has not. There is even one case of a Disciplinary Committee investigating into the misappropriation of client's monies by a solicitor which did not make any finding at all in its report. It had to be reminded to make a finding. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I must say that the majority of cases brought before the Disciplinary Committee were processed satisfactorily. But there are sufficient examples which have been cited of undue delays in the conduct of proceedings and the tardiness in policing that make it clear that the system of self-regulation has failed and should not be allowed to continue. May I also point out that the cases I have cited are the known ones. What about the other cases which we do not know because they never went beyond the Inquiry Committee stage? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare, Mr Speaker, Sir, the position of the legal profession with other professional bodies, the legal profession is in a much privileged position. The Law Society is the only professional body in Singapore where Government officials are excluded from its governing council. On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the Medical Council, which is the governing body of our doctors, has the Director of Medical Services sitting as the ex-officio member of the Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-regulation, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a privilege which carries a corresponding responsibility. It has a responsibility to prescribe proper standards of conduct for its members which must be sufficient to instil the confidence of the public. The growing size of the profession and its relative youth places added responsibility on the more senior members of the profession who must set high standards of conduct. The principle of self-regulation of the legal profession was introduced by the British. However, even in England today, there has been much apprehension over the principle of self-regulation. This is because the situation there is largely the same as that in Singapore. In England, non-lawyer members already sit on the regulatory bodies of the legal profession. There have also been calls for complaints against solicitors and disputes with clients to be dealt with by a body outside the Law Society and for a legal ombudsman to be set up to protect the interests of the general public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, Sir, what has in fact finally brought matters to a head is not only the lapses on the part of the legal profession to discipline their errant members and to maintain high standards of professional conduct but this negative impression was compounded by the fact that the Law Society has now elected as its President a member who has been disciplined not once but three times. He has been reprimanded once and suspended on two occasions, for one year and six months respectively. This act, Mr Speaker, Sir, has clearly demonstrated the utter disregard and unconcern for maintaining the good public impression of the profession on the part of those responsible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a minority group of activists has also chosen to take on the Government by calling an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Law Society to pass fierce resolutions against the Government. This group comprised only 62 members. Perhaps quite a number of them are members supporting the Member for Anson or the Member for Potong Pasir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What's wrong with that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is 62 members out of a total of 1,335 practising lawyers. This has brought about a situation which no responsible government can let it pass in the public interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has good reasons to deal with this situation firmly. In fact, the present amendments have only made a small inroad in self-regulation. The main structure of the Legal Profession Act has not been touched. In fact, the Law Society and the legal profession as a whole should know that it is being given a second chance to show that it can regulate itself and deal with the errant members adequately, efficiently and expeditiously. I am confident, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the vast majority of the lawyers who have chosen to remain silent will generally support the principles behind the amendments to the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker. The Member for MacPherson is a member of the Bar. He says that there was a complaint in 1982 involving a magistrate; it went before the Disciplinary Committee and probably no report has been made. He is a member of the Bar and I want to ask him: what has he done about it himself? Or has he just come to this House to air his Party's point of view? Now, as a member of the Bar, I am asking him what has he done? And he says there are a few activists \"taking the Government on.\" These are very strong words talking about his own members in the Law Society. Again, I ask him: if he is really that concerned, has he reported this matter to the Bar Council? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not for me to report to the Law Society Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You are a member. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> These matters have already been reported and no action has been taken. That is the reason why I have mentioned it. I believe the Member for Potong Pasir is rather naive as not to have understood what I said. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, by way of clarification again. Is the Member not aware that if the Disciplinary Committee drags its feet over anything, he can write to the Chief Justice who can command the Disciplinary Committee to report immediately what progress it has made? That is the whole point of the Member for Potong Pasir's question. Here is a Member who says he is concerned about it. He has been, by now, 20 months a member of the profession. What has he done? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern is not for individual lawyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You mentioned one case. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> But my concern is that the Law Society, the leaders of the Law Society, have not acted the way they should. That is my point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You are a member. What have you done? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think in answer to the last query --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Member for MacPherson is capable of answering. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, this is all explained very carefully in the Explanatory Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I wish to say is, I totally disagree with the Member for Anson's views. He insinuated that there is a political motive behind this Amendment Bill. He does so by way of asking an innocuous question that the Hon. Minister should, and I quote him, \"explain the real motives for this Bill and not hide behind platitudes.\" Sir, then he asserts that it is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> quite plain to everyone, his words. And he goes on further to make a preposterous suggestion that this Bill is, again I quote him, \"prompted for one reason only.\" And it is because, again I quote him, \"the Law Society has done the unforgivable thing in Singapore\" to criticize openly the Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill. Therefore, again he said, \"the Government took umbrage\" over the criticism. This is absolutely untrue because one needs only to take a look at the Amendment Bill before the House. It lists in page 6 all the reasons, whys and wherefores, from (a) to (i) inclusive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore, in the course of my contribution, I shall be making reference to these. In some ways also I shall be at the same time making rebuttals on the points made by the Member for Potong Pasir. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the move to have this Bill referred to a Select Committee after its Second Reading. In my view, it is primarily because a certain amount of adverse reaction is foreseen, that the Government, by referring this Amendment Bill to a Select Committee, would give ample opportunity to the public, and most certainly, Sir, to the legal profession, to come forward and air their views be they suggestions or criticisms. Let it not be said that this Government introduces changes in a high-handed manner without consulting the people or that the Government sweeps things under the carpet. Let us be open about this and have a free exchange of views. Notice, Sir, I used the word \"exchange\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience, I have noticed that it is the dissenters who are the ones to come forward to strongly express their dissent and, to some extent, try to impose their views on others which form the majority. Such people who voice their dissent are normally in the minority. As can best be illustrated by the statement from my learned Friend, the Member for MacPherson --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Your learned Friend? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, he is a lawyer. I call him my learned Friend, what's wrong with that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what about the silent majority, those who are in full support? I would urge them to come forward to express their agreement so as to reflect a more realistic and fair response. If the majority choose to remain silent, then only the dissenters will be heard and the result is that an erroneous impression will be created. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, that is, to allow exchange of views, may I suggest to the Hon. Minister that a comprehensive explanation presenting a complete picture of the necessity for this Amendment Bill be given through the mass media when referring the Bill to a Select Committee, so that everyone, including the man-in-the-street, may understand and participate in the exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, suffice to say, I give my support for this particular amendment as being very necessary, namely, the disqualification of members of the Council of the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. Professional integrity is vital to Singapore's development as a Centre of Excellence in the field of communications, business, finance, trade and professional services. There must be no doubt whatsoever in anybody's mind, whether that of an investor, amulti-national corporation, our trade partners or our neighbours, that we Singaporeans can render clean, honest and competent services here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since honesty and integrity cannot be enforced on individual professionals in the course of their work, surely we can at least require that their representatives should not have a conviction of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty as it would put a question mark against the good name of their profession. It does not speak well of a professional body to be represented by persons whose honesty and integrity have been proved to be not beyond question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted there are bound to be a few delinquents, recalcitrants or black sheep in any profession. But the vast majority can safely say that their professional integrity has never been questioned before or has never been undermined by a conviction of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. It follows then that representatives of that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> profession can be chosen from amongst this vast majority. This must be the case, is it not? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot think how the overall interests of Singapore can be best served if professional bodies are led, managed and represented by members whose professional integrity has been called to question. Here, I am speaking generally; I am not speaking of any professional body in particular. In this respect, I would like to suggest to the Hon. Minister again that similar criteria be extended to all professional bodies in order that we are not seen to suggest that it is only the legal profession that we are more concerned with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not about time that the Government conduct a comprehensive review of all professional bodies in line with this year's motto \"Together - Excellence for Singapore\" and also looking ahead to the Vision of 1999? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at the amendments objectively with the national interests uppermost in our minds. I do not think it is too much to require members of the Council of the Law Society to be persons whose good name and professional honesty and integrity have never been besmirched by a conviction of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. I have always held the view that the legal profession is a very noble profession among others. It has its own very commendable and strict code of conduct and etiquette. Since the members of the legal profession are already bound by their own code of conduct and etiquette, this Bill does not impose new values on them. This Bill merely ensures that the Council of the Law Society comprises members who have not breached their own code of conduct and etiquette. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would categorize the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill as introducing changes mainly in three ways: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) by adding a new disqualification for those members of the legal profession who hold or who wish to hold office as a member of the Council of the Law Society; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) by expediting the disciplinary process at the Inquiry Committee stage; and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) by making various technical improvements upon the present system, in particular to fill the lacuna recently brought to light in the case of James Chia versus the Law Society of Singapore, as contained in (g) of the Explanatory Statement in the Amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall not concern myself with the second and third changes as I feel that there are others more qualified than I who could offer their views on them. Therefore, I shall confine my remarks to the first area of change which concerns the disqualification of members from holding office in the Council of the Law Society who have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. This I foresee will create more than a few ripples in certain quarters of the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, may I seek further clarification from the Hon. Minister on clauses 2 and 3 of the amendment Bill. To me, Sir, it is not clear enough. Does it mean that the period of 6 months is at any one time or an aggregate of suspension that was imposed previously? Because reading clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill together with sections 51 and 59(1)(a) of the Act, I get the impression that the period of 6 months is still ambiguous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, whilst I give this Bill my full support, I also hope that the public in general and those interested in particular, would make their contributions so that the Select Committee, in their deliberations, will benefit from them before they finally present their Report to Parliament for the Third Reading of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your point of clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Member talked about delay in the Inquiry Committee proceedings. Is he not aware that in the Act, the Inquiry Committee must report within two months? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chandra Das. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to commend the Second Minister for Law for committing the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill to a Select Committee after today's Second Reading. Sir, it is important that the proposed amendments in the Bill are fully discussed and debated by all interested parties and that they be given this opportunity to express their views and make appropriate recommendations. This will also give the legal fraternity another opportunity apart from the Extraordinary General Meeting scheduled for tonight. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from the legal fraternity, there have also been discussions on this subject by other professional groups. So it is my hope that many people will come forth and make their views known. Notwithstanding the commitment of this Bill to a Select Committee, I would like to make my comments on two issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point refers to what the Society in Singapore in general expects from our professionals. And secondly what I believe our professionals owe to Society. As we all know, professionals are well respected and trusted by society at large because of their training, competence and, most of all, their integrity. Professional bodies are set up, among other things, to ensure that this trust and respect is maintained at all times. This applies to all whether they are lawyers, architects, accountants or engineers. If professional bodies are to supervise the conduct of its members, Mr Speaker, Sir, I firmly believe that it is necessary for such bodies to be led by men who are above the slightest possible reproach. This, I believe, is an accepted norm in any society and I do not think any rational man can quarrel with this accepted standard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, Sir, only disqualifies a member from holding office in the Law Society if he has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. Sir, I repeat, it only disqualifies anyone convicted of fraud or dishonesty. The question to ask is: Do we want our professional societies to be led by men who have been convicted of fraud or dishonesty? Sir, if the answer is yes, then something is gravely wrong. Surely, if one is convicted of fraud or dishonesty and subsequently allowed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to practise his profession, does this then become a testimonial for holding high office in the professional body? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe a distinction must be made between allowing a person to practise one's profession after conviction to earn a livelihood and that of becoming a leader-man of the professional body. The Member for Potong Pasir, I think it was reported in the newspapers, had accused the Government of applying double standards as regards Mr David Marshall. I think the Member for Potong Pasir has done a great disservice to Mr Marshall who retired as an eminent member of the Bar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an important point. It should be clarified. Could the Member please look at the amendment under clause 2? It says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A member who has been struck off the roll or suspended from practice for a period of 6 months or more or has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty ...'. \"Or\", that is disjunctive. Please read it carefully before you make your accusations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> I am not accusing. I am just saying that you have done Mr David Marshall a great disservice. That is all I said. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. This amendment here says \"6 months ...\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> I am not denying. I am just repeating what you said as reported in the newspapers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is it not a fact or a justification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Let me finish and then you can have your chance. Sir, I still think the Member for Potong Pasir has done Mr David Marshall a great disservice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> A point of order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Sir, I am not giving way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have every right to say that and he is saying that I was wrong.

If the Member for Potong Pasir has a point in reply to the Member for Chong Boon, he can have his say later. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But this is an important point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I am saying is that Mr David Marshall can continue to serve Singapore in other areas. He did not seek office in the Law Society. That is the only point I am trying to make. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reminds me of the case of a British Cabinet Minister who had to resign from his Defence portfolio because he lied in Parliament. He resigned and he never contested any elections. And instead, he spent all his energies on social work. I think it was a couple of years ago that the Queen found it necessary to bestow an honour on this particular former Minister for his public service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my second point refers to the provision for a wider representation in the Disciplinary Committee. I welcome this move to bring in other professionals such as accountants, engineers and doctors to the Disciplinary Committee. While self-regulation may have served us well in the past, I think the time has come for us to change it. The Singapore Stock Exchange, as was previously alluded to, is a case in point where self-regulation led to a number of problems and adequate measures had to be taken to put this right. I am also told that the accounting profession in the United Kingdom has \"lay observers\" in its Investigating Committee as well as in its Disciplinary Committee. And by having such lay observers or laymen, not totally members of the legal \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> profession, this will allay any public fears of trying to hide things under the carpet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the work of professionals involve most sectors of our society and it is only reasonable that disciplinary proceedings of professionals must not only be fair but also be transparent. This transparency, I believe, Sir, will be provided with the appointment of non-legal members on the Disciplinary Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also appeal to the Front Bench that while these amendments are meant for the legal profession, I think similar provisions should be looked into for other professional bodies. \n  <br>3.27 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my support to this Bill and to offer some comments as a layman who might be hurt by unscrupulous lawyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the representatives of the legal profession in this House, one can evidently see a wide spectrum, from people of very base quality to people who are brilliant and have great integrity. I do not need to mention names. I think Members know well who I am referring to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What are you afraid of? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The two Members of the Opposition as usual put the worst possible construction on the motives behind the Bill as on other Bills. And as usual, they try to confuse the public. In this case, they are trying to confuse the public as between two issues. One is the political role of professional bodies and the other is the standards that should govern the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have written to the press on the matter of political role of professional bodies, particularly the legal profession. And my view is very simply that professional bodies have a responsibility, a duty, to maintain high professional standards. Their job is to defend the interests of their bodies in order to function properly as professionals. But if they want to use these bodies which are constituted for profes- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sional reasons, use them or misuse them for political reasons, then they should register as political parties. Or else they can speak out as private individuals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Law Society is concerned, I think hon. Members who are non-lawyers, like myself, may be wondering why should these people called lawyers be given a special privilege. Why should they be entitled to special legislation on their behalf? Why can they not be registered like other professional bodies under the Societies Act which, I understand, is much more stringent? If one wants to talk of control, this Societies Act has very stringent controls on who may hold office in various societies which are so registered. So I want to make this point very clear, Sir. That it is because the contributions of the legal profession are acknowledged, recognized, by the Government, that the Legal Profession Act was brought into force to give this special body of professionals a special recognized standing in society, a position of honour that must not be abused. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my PAP colleagues who spoke earlier have mentioned that Singapore is a society that is based upon the rule of law. That is something that we should always bear in mind. Law governs the society. The way the society is run, the way contracts are drawn up, the way rights and responsibilities are balanced in this society, and one would expect that the members of the legal profession, particularly the practitioners of law, should themselves be law abiding. And, Sir, I am somewhat surprised when the Member for Anson made the allegation that this particular amendment seeks to humiliate members of the legal profession. I would have thought, Sir, that people who have been convicted of fraud or criminal offences or else been suspended from their professional activity for some time would already have felt the humiliation. If I were a lawyer and if I were convicted of fraud or dishonesty, CBT or whatever, or some criminal act, I would not know where to hide my face. I would not want to stand for election in the Law Society as a President of the Law Society and make pretentious pronouncements on policies in Singapore and hoping that people would look to him as a potential leader. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon.

The Member for Anson brought out some statistics on the percentage of crooks in the legal profession. I wonder how comprehensive his statistics are and I wonder whether any Members in this House are included therein. What would be of interest to this House and to members of the public is this, Sir. What is the percentage of crooks in the legal profession compared with the accountancy profession, compared with doctors and other professions? That will be an interesting statistic to get, and I think somebody should produce these statistics. I think it will be of interest to us because if it is shown up that the legal profession has the highest percentage of crooks, then we are all in trouble in Singapore. I think we ought to do something. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I am not giving way, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think he cannot make insinuations against the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, he was not referring to you. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will allow him to clarify if he feels guilty. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> He cannot insinuate against the legal profession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on, Dr Tan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> So I assume he is guilty.

Let us have order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. Some people interpret immunity as impunity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may refer to clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill. What surprises me, Sir, is that, first of all, members of the legal profession are still allowed to practise in spite of convictions and suspension in the past. I think there should be a list drawn up of all lawyers who have had previous convictions and suspension so that the public knows who to avoid in future. They should not be allowed to make money at all. Secondly, why do we only exclude those who have been suspended in practice for more than six months? To me, if any member has been suspended for any length of time, even one day, it speaks of standards which are not befitting the profession. I would not allow them to practise at all, let alone stand for election as a member of the Council of the Law Society. I would like to add another category to the list for the hon. Minister. I would like to add that people who are expelled from Parliament, suspended from Parliament, or thrown into jail by the Speaker, should also be prohibited from practising law and from standing for election to the Council of the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I in clarification say that when I talked about \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the humiliation of the members of the Law Society, I was referring to the introduction of the Bill in Parliament without any consultation or discussion with the members. That is the humiliation I was talking about. I know it will be referred to a Select Committee, but that is completely a different thing. There was no consultation with the members before the Bill was introduced. That is the humiliation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, in reply I would only say that only those who are proud and exalt themselves will feel humiliated if they are not consulted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Irrelevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.40 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first move a procedural motion.

I would like to remind Members that, as I have said, it is the intention to refer this Bill to the Select Committee. I therefore will confine myself, in reply, to broad points and not go into the detailed drafting of the specific provisions which will be the job of the Select Committee to look into. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted the comments made by the Member for MacPherson, the Member for Punggol, the Member for Chong Boon and the Member for Whampoa. With regard to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the specific points that they have raised, the Member for Punggol asked whether clauses 2 and 3 raise an ambiguity, whether it refers to a period of six months or more, or whether there can be an aggregate of periods. My reading of the Bill suggests that there is no ambiguity and it refers to a period. Otherwise a different wording \"period or periods in the aggregate\" might have been used. But this is a point which can be looked into by the Select Committee. If there is ambiguity, it can be tightened up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Members whilst supporting the Bill referred to the fact that perhaps it should not only be the legal profession but other professions should also be reviewed. This point is noted, although I might add that the problem has arisen with regard to the Law Society. With regard to most of the other professions, as far as I know, the appointment of the Council members is either at the nomination or approval of the Government or at least, for example, with regard to the Medical Council, the President or the Chairman is appointed by the Government. Nonetheless, I have noted the Member's suggestion that the questions of principles which arise may call for a review of the other provisions. And I take the point with regard to, for example, the provision for lay representation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to the views expressed by the Members for Potong Pasir and Anson. First, they have made the point that this whole Bill is connected with the Law Society's pronouncements on the amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, and therefore the Member for Anson develops his theory that there is some hidden motive. I would like to make it clear that had the Law Society not come out with any statement on the Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill, this Bill would still be moved in Parliament today. Because what was never envisaged has happened. A person with a tainted record has been first elected to the Council, and the Council then has elected him as President of the Society, a high office which sets the tone and standards for the rest of the profession. Something unprecedented has happened. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have read the Bill. We have not made any provision in the Bill to restrict the kind of statements which the Law Society can make. Members of Parliament as well as Ministers, including the First Deputy Prime Minister, have already stated what the Government's position is, on a group of persons taking over the Law Society leadership for purposes of venturing into political pronouncements. That has already been made clear. This Bill deals with a different matter, but the fact that the Council did elect a person with such a record to the Presidency does indeed reveal their motives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next point which both Members from the Opposition gave a lot of emphasis was that there was no prior consultation. Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to that, let me say the following. First of all, a copy of this Bill was sent to the Law Society even before hon. Members had seen the text of the Bill. Secondly, I have mentioned --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I seek clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> May I finish what I have to say? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The Member has a propensity to interrupt when he himself is not interrupted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I want clarification. That is all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has already indicated that it is the intention to send this Bill to Select Committee where the views of all concerned, and particularly the Law Society, can be made known, discussed and deliberated. I would like to make a third point. That point is this: that, in my view, the present leadership of the Law Society has forfeited its right to prior consultation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have made it a point, a practice with the previous Council, of sending them Bills on areas where they would have an interest - legal profession, administration of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> criminal justice, even amendments to the Constitution. I have gone out of my way to inform the Council that I would send them Bills in advance and, in fact, I have sent them Bills even before hon. Members receive them. I think there was a basis to do so. I conveyed this also to the present Council. But consultation by its very essence must be a two-way process. Sometimes the Government may have a reasonable basis to seek information from the Law Society Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me mention, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when the President of the Law Society issued a statement on the Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill and, in that statement, made the claim, and I quote, \"A brief survey was conducted by the Law Society which showed that the effects of the Bill would be minimal\", we were very interested to know what were the findings of the survey. The Permanent Secretary (Law), on the direction of the Minister, wrote to the President of the Law Society and asked if the Council could make available to the Ministry of Law the dates, raw data and analyzed results of the brief survey which shows that the Bill would have only minimal effects. After some foot-dragging, the Council informed the Ministry of Law that it was \"unable to accede to your request.\" The Ministry of Law (its Permanent Secretary) then wrote to the President of the Law Society and said, \"What conceivable basis could there be not to cooperate and give information on a survey which the Law Society itself had made reference to in public?\" The Permanent Secretary even suggested to the President of Law Society that if they were worried about confidentiality, then they could either seek the consent of whosoever had been surveyed, for disclosure, or the Law Society need not supply to the Permanent Secretary (Law) the identity of whoever was surveyed. So the confidentiality can be preserved. Back came the final reply: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am directed to inform you that since the relevant information was obtained on a confidential basis, the Council regrets that it is unable to accede to your request.' A survey where public reference was made. As I said, this is a Council which claims, and on whose behalf it is now claimed, that they have a right to prior \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consultation. I say that that Council, this present Council, by that action, has forfeited its right to prior consultation. Mr Speaker, Sir, nevertheless we sent them the Bill the moment it was published, even before hon. Members received them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was really astounded to see the Member for Potong Pasir and the Member for Anson opposing this Bill. What is the conclusion that we must draw from their total opposition to this Bill? The Member for Anson was prepared to support the lay representation part but the Member for Potong Pasir found there was no part in it at all which he could support. Both of them oppose this Bill. What is the implication of their opposition? It must be that they condone and they approve the idea that a person, who has been convicted of an offence of fraud or dishonesty, can be elected to the leadership position in the professional organization. This must be the irresistible conclusion. Both of them are in support of that idea that such a person with such tainted record can be elected to the Council of the Law Society, leave alone the No.1 post of President. What does this show of the importance that they place on integrity? Don't they attach any importance to the element of integrity? Don't they have the slightest regard for safeguarding the interests of the public? Don't they have any priority placed on responsibility, while they talk about rights of individual advocates and solicitors? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By what they have said, they are therefore placing themselves on record that they condone and approve of the Law Society electing a person, who had been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty or fraud, into office. I think that speaks for itself and therein lies the difference between the Members of the Opposition for Potong Pasir and Anson and the Government. Because the Government places highest priority to integrity. The Government places highest priority in safeguarding the interests of the public who have no choice but to use lawyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked: why bring this Bill suddenly? Because this situation has never happened before. That is why. And it is not just the legal profession. If the Government did not act now to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> make it clear that there must be this disqualification, then this disease will spread to the other professions. Perhaps the Members for Potong Pasir and Anson will applaud when it spreads even to the Legislature and persons convicted of fraud or dishonesty are elected to the Legislature. Probably they will applaud because they have not in their speeches shown any regard for honesty and integrity as a criterion, not for practice, for leadership positions in the Law Society. But the Member for Whampoa made a point which I think the Government also will have to consider. He said: should we not also consider whether such persons with such records even ought to practise? That is a very good point, and indeed it is a point which the Government will have to consider. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to say that the Member for Anson in his speech has clearly given a very false and misleading representation of the provisions of the present Act. First of all, he says that it is not true that the Law Society Council shares the disciplinary function with the Judges of the Supreme Court. He says everything lies in the hands of the Chief Justice. This is totally untrue and totally false. The Law Society must deal with complaints at the Inquiry Committee level before it goes to the Disciplinary Committee and thereafter to the Judges of the Supreme Court. If the Inquiry Committee finds that there is no cause for formal investigation and the Council agrees, then it cannot go on to the Disciplinary Committee and to the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instance where he has misled is when he told us that the Chief Justice can at any time intervene if he disagrees with the findings of the Inquiry Committee or disagrees with the findings of the Disciplinary Committee. This is false. The Chief Justice or a Judge of the Supreme Court, under the present Act, cannot intervene and cannot step in on his own volition. This is not allowed by the Act. He can only intervene if a formal application is made by the individual complainant. He did not tell us that. He gave us the impression when he said that the Chief Justice can at any time step in and therefore everything is in the control of the Chief Justice. It is because of that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> inadequacy that we are seeking to amend section 97 to provide that a finding of the Disciplinary Committee can be reviewed not only at the instance of the individual complainant but also at the instance of the Judge and, we have also added, at the instance of the Law Society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson says there is no need for the Act. The public is adequately protected. Does he really expect the public to believe that? Does he expect the public to believe that their interests are adequately protected when the Council elects as its No.1 leader a man who has been disciplined on three occasions and a man whom the courts, the Chief Justice, had to say, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Was guilty of grossly improper conduct in discharge of duties, whose conduct was wholly deplorable, as being dishonourable of him as a man and dishonourable of his profession.' And the Member for Anson expects us and the public to believe that their interests are adequately protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, and to some extent the Member for Potong Pasir, made the point that this has something to do with the rights of advocates and solicitors. The Member for Anson made much ado about the fact that all members enjoy the same privileges and rights. Once he has been convicted and punished, thereafter he has a right, presumably a right to be elected President. This shows a complete lack of regard to the interests of the public and a lack of regard for responsibility. Whose rights are we talking about? When the Council elects a person with such a flaw as President, is it a question of their right to elect whosoever without intervention by us? Or is it not also a question of responsibility, having in mind the interests of the public? We are not saying that such a person should never be allowed to practise his profession, although the Member for Whampoa has made a forceful point. The issue is not whether he can continue to practise, the issue is whether such persons ought to be in a leadership position of the governing body of a profession which so many members of the public resort to and must have confidence in facing. I would like to ask the Member for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Potong Pasir and the Member for Anson: If there is a child molester, convicted child molester or rapist, --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> How can you compare apples and oranges? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Of course, that person cannot be barred from holding any job, he has a right to employment. But would you appoint him in charge of a childcare creche? If a member, an individual, has been convicted of criminal breach of trust or corruption, would it be all right to appoint him as your Accountant-General? This is the issue, the issue of integrity and the issue of responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the point therefore is: we are talking about leadership position in a council which (a) is to regulate and police errant and delinquent members, and (b) Council members to set the tone and the standards for others to follow. How can either of these objectives be achieved when Council members who are elected are themselves as errant and delinquent as those they are supposed to police and discipline? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised some red herrings. Apparently, the Prime Minister in 1973 had a discussion with the Law Society Council. Well, I do not know the background to it. But I have no hesitation in saying that I see no reason whatsoever why the Prime Minister of a country cannot call up the Law Society or any other professional body if he is concerned with the state of affairs. In fact, this only goes to show that the Prime Minister and the Government were concerned about this as long ago as 1973. I think his real complaint is that the Prime Minister excluded him from the consultation. Likewise, again I do not know the background, I see nothing wrong with the Prime Minister calling up a group of pilots if he, as the head of Government, feels that their action is going to bring about the downfall of an airline or going to bring about loss of confidence in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I need to spend more time on the other points. I think I have dealt with the main points. In short, this Bill is necessary not only for the legal profession but we have to act now if we want to make it clear that there must be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> certain standards of integrity and made essential pre-requisites for leadership positions in the Law Society; and if we want to make sure that this point is also registered with other professions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am much obliged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask in clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You can surely ask this in Select Committee. There is the Select Committee coming up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, Sir, but here, at the Second Reading, because in his speech the Minister has accused me of misleading. I would like to clarify that. And, secondly, he has just said that I have misled the House on certain sections. I have to put that right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right, clarify. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Firstly, it is this question about sending a copy of the Bill to the Council. My point was that before the Bill was introduced on the 25th August in this House, there was no reference of it to the Council. The Minister says I have misled. But he comes back and he says even before Members of the House saw the Bill, he had sent it to the Council. The question simply is this: did the Minister send it to the Council before the Bill was introduced in Parliament? That was the point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the President this morning and he said there was no communication whatsoever to him before the Bill was introduced in Parliament. So would the Minister put this right and not try and mislead the House? He says the first communication was a letter of the 15th September from the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister accuses me of misleading. If he looks at section 94(2) of the Act, the Minister will find that if the Disciplinary Committee determines that no cause of sufficient gravity exists, the court can direct further action, notwithstanding the report of the Disciplinary Committee. This is where I said the Chief Justice has control over the whole proceedings. And I said the report of the Disciplinary Committee must also go to the Chief Justice. So he does not have to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> accept the report of the Disciplinary Committee, regardless of whether the Council accepts it or not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do think the Minister was unfair to me in accusing me of misleading because I specifically referred to sections 96 and 97 of the Act. I said where the Inquiry Committee does not recommend a formal investigation, the applicant can still apply to the Court and the Judge can then direct that the matter be sent to the Disciplinary Committee. Similarly, I said section 97 where the Disciplinary Committee concludes that there is no case, the applicant can still go to the Court and get the Judge's ruling on it. So I would like to know where have I misled the House when I referred to all these sections. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I have the correspondence with me here. But if what the Member for Anson says is that the Law Society received the communication only on 15th September, then I think this is not quite correct although --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I was told by the President. I do not know whether this is correct or not. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may just have a moment to look through my notes. Suffice it for me to say, Sir, that a copy of the Bill was sent to the President of the Law Society either on or before the date of introduction in this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Before the 25th August? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Either on 25th August or before. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I must check. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> You can check on it. But certainly not as late as 15th September. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will check that with him because I spoke to him this morning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Yes. The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is what the Member for Anson said, and which I claimed he was misleading and I still stand by it, is that in his speech he maintained that if the Chief Justice disagrees with the findings of the Disciplinary Committee or the Inquiry Committee, the Chief Justice can step in at \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> any time. His thesis was everything is within the control of the Chief Justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Section 94. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> And I pointed out that it is only when the applicant makes a formal complaint or application that the Chief Justice can step in. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What about section 94(2)? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am now talking about what the Member for Anson said. If he now corrects the position to say that the applicant --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, no. I am referring to section 94(2). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am talking about a disagreement with the findings of the Inquiry Committee or the Disciplinary Committee.

The relevant dates are as follows. On 25th August, Mr Hochstadt, Permanent Secretary (Law), wrote to the President of the Law Society forwarding a copy of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill and informing him that the Bill would be introduced in Parliament on the 25th. A second letter dated 15th September is a separate matter informing the Law Society of the intention to commit the Bill to Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CIVIL DEFENCE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.20 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the raising, maintenance and discipline of a civil defence force to be known as the \"Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)\" which may exercise its functions and powers during a state of emergency or a state of civil defence emergency. It also provides for various civil defence preparations to be carried out during peacetime such as the conduct of civil defence training and exercises for the civilian population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is this Bill needed? First of all, the existing legislation under which the SCDF operates, namely, the Vigilante \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Corps Act (Chapter 80), is inadequate and inappropriate. For example, there are no provisions for civil defence officers to exercise disciplinary powers over national servicemen and reservists. Instead, the present arrangement is for designated police officers to enforce discipline using the limited provisions of the Vigilante Corps Act. This Bill therefore provides civil defence officers with the appropriate disciplinary powers to make them more effective in their role as trainers and administrators of national servicemen and reservists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason, Sir, is that existing legislation does not provide for the discharge of essential civil defence functions in emergencies. These will include the management of air-raid shelters, rescue, enforcement of blackout measures, provision and co-ordination of medical services, fire-fighting, emergency assistance in restoring and repairing indispensable public utilities and so on. To carry out these functions effectively, civil defence officers must have the legal powers to direct human and material resources to critical areas to save lives. This is another important objective of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is an existing Civil Defence Act (Chapter 228), that Act is also unsuitable. For example, it does not provide for the raising of a force of national servicemen and reservists for training and deployment, and its general provisions are inadequate for the nature of civil defence duties in war situations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly then, there is a need for a comprehensive legislation to enable the civil defence force to carry out its duties efficiently and effectively in peacetime disasters as well as in war. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the organization of the SCDF, the Bill provides for the SCDF to consist of public officers, national servicemen and persons who are recruited to serve as auxiliary members on a part-time basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word about the auxiliary members. These would be those who are formally recruited part-timers similar to the Volunteer Special Constabulary in the Police Force. They will have to serve the SCDF on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a regular basis, be in uniform and be subjected to disciplinary rules. These auxiliary members will therefore be distinct from, and are not meant to replace, existing civil defence volunteers in the constituencies. The reason why we have made this provision is for long-term needs for auxiliary members so as to be comprehensive and to cater for future needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also gives recognition to the concept of civil defence volunteers and also authorizes the conduct of exercises for the purpose of civil defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major part of the Bill is to provide for the discipline of members of the SCDF for service offences. The concept of service offences is designed to ensure that members observe a code of discipline and conduct befitting members of a uniformed organization. As most of these offences, including desertion, violence on a superior, assault on subordinates and so on are already to be found in the SAF Act 1972, I shall not discuss these provisions in detail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to those Parts of the Act dealing with special powers during a state of civil defence emergency, Members will note that Part XII of the Act provides for civil defence officers to have the powers which are necessary to direct manpower and material resources to save lives or limit damage to property in an emergency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers can be exercised in two situations. First, when the Minister for Home Affairs under section 102 declares a state of civil defence emergency, if it appears to him that a civil defence emergency has occurred in any part or district of Singapore. A civil defence emergency is defined as any happening (whether or not because of an attack by an enemy or any war-like act) that causes loss of life or injury or destruction of or damage to property or which in any way endangers the safety of the public. Examples, of course, which will come to Members' minds would be major industrial accidents or collapse of high-rise buildings. The second situation is where a state of emergency is proclaimed by the President of the Republic pursuant to Article 150 of the Constitution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to civil defence volunteers, Mr Speaker, Sir, they can play a vital role \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in civil defence as the Hotel New World rescue operations showed. But it is necessary to give volunteers some legal protection. Under the Bill, therefore, volunteers are protected from personal liability when acting in good faith under the order or instruction given by a member of SCDF whilst participating in any civil defence measures or whilst in training. They will also be compensated for personal injuries or loss of life as a result of participating in civil defence training or being engaged in civil defence measures under the authority of the Commissioner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also provides for fair and reasonable remuneration to any person who, in compliance with an order during a state of civil defence emergency or a state of emergency, renders assistance to SCDF to save lives in immediate danger. Any person who suffers loss of or damage to his property as a result of a member removing or breaking into his place in the cause of exercising the special powers during a state of civil defence emergency or a state of emergency will also be entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for the loss of or damage to his property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is long overdue. It will put our civil defence organization and plans on a firm legal basis. May I say, in conclusion, that a comprehensive civil defence law in itself does not and cannot ensure total civil defence preparedness in responding to any emergencies. The cooperation of the people is fundamental to effective civil defence. And judging by the overwhelming public concern, public spiritedness and acts of assistance and cooperation shown during the Hotel New World disaster, I have every confidence that all Singaporeans will take civil defence seriously as it is an integral part of Total Defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Phua Bah Lee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the passing of the Civil Defence Bill, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) takes on a new \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dimension. It is now better equipped to handle human and physical resources in the Civil Defence preparations of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly, 34,000 SAF reservists will be transferred to the Singapore Civil Defence Force. These SAF reservists are well-trained soldiers. They are operationally ready. They are matured, experienced, physically fit and knowledgeable. They have discharged their duties reliably and diligently over the years in their military capacity. They have been trained to engage the enemy in times of crises. To them, I would like to record a word of thanks for their sacrifice and dedication. Their role in the SAF was in military defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their transfer to the Singapore Civil Defence Force, they perform a different role, but their mission remains the same. Their wealth of knowledge in military defence will enable them to adopt their civil defence role with great ease and facility. They will be equipped to perform their civil defence duties. They will be trained in skills related to fire-fighting, first aid, rescue operation, coping with oil spills, flood, storm and other disasters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the two roles are different, both are a sacred mission in the total defence of the country. Their new role is neither less laudable nor less superior. The SAF reservists deserve the full support of the nation and the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these 34,000 SAF reservists are transferred to the Singapore Civil Defence Force, I hope that the SCDF will make good use of their experience, maturity and dedication that the SAF had imbued in them. After all, the SAF and the Singapore Civil Defence Force are both organized and disciplined forces. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that the Singapore Civil Defence Force should continue to motivate and upgrade these reservists, and to put greater meaning to their sense of mission and of commitment in discharging their sacred duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only when we can continue to provide a sense of purpose for our SAF reservists, can we amply justify the transfer of such precious manpower to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore Civil Defence Force. They are particularly precious because not only are they a specially trained force but that Singapore will face a manpower shortage in the years to come owing to zero population growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, from the way Singapore Civil Defence Force has managed its functions and responsibilities, as evidenced by the Hotel New World disaster, and the infusion of the civilian population into the various civil defence activities at the constituency levels, it is clear that the SCDF has evolved into a very important and capable force. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with more than 22,000 members of the public volunteering their services in the Singapore Civil Defence Force, it is a good sign of the support the SCDF is receiving. In view of this, I have no doubt that the Singapore Civil Defence Force will find new meaningful roles for the SAF reservists to play in order for them to discharge their duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Singapore Civil Defence Force continues to develop its infrastructure, training, equipment and organization, it must not forget a basic need. It needs a proper home. The present Singapore Civil Defence Force HQ at Bendeemer Road may no longer fit the image that it now has. The HQ needs to be upgraded or even redeveloped in order to keep pace with its new mission. The present structure is no longer consistent with its enhanced responsibilities and expanded functions. I have no doubts that every assistance will be given to the SCDF to find a new home. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Siglap):</b> Sir, it has been five years now since the SCDF was first formed. During these years it has crystallized itself in image, shape and function as a force to be noticed. It is now, I think, poised to assume a greater and expanded role in the Republic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rising in support of this Bill, I wish to make some observations, especially on three provisions of the Bill. One is on clause 23 which spells out the Service offences and penalties under this Bill. Sir, we have read and heard of the undesirable acts of looting in other countries during civil disorders and during the war. And certainly we would not like this to happen here, and especially so, by those from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whom the public expects help and especially so during times of disaster and tragedy. It is therefore appropriate that the public should be adequately protected against such acts and the gravity of these offences be impressed upon those in the SCDF. I am, Sir, therefore, all for a deterrent sentence and am glad that such a provision has been included in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, is the provision of clause 102 which empowers the Minister to declare a state of civil defence emergency. Sir, we need not remind ourselves that ours is a small country. By its very size, an incident or tragedy in one part of the island has a greater chance of spreading to or affecting other parts of the island and in very quick time too. It is therefore necessary, Sir, for such incidents or tragedies to be contained and dealt with swiftly and effectively with minimum of destruction to the general population. The recent Hotel New World collapse, Sir, is a case in point. So there is therefore the need for effective mobilization of resources or the removal of obstacles so that rescue or salvage operations could be carried out as expeditiously as possible. At the same time, Sir, I am also glad that there is a protection against loss of employment or its benefits for anyone carrying his civil defence duties during an emergency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, Sir, I come to what I consider a very sensible approach in encouraging the population to become civil defence volunteers or to acquire civil defence skills. Sir, these skills are among those which we hope we will never get to put into practice. For to do so would mean that an ugly incident or tragedy has taken place. But still, just as we hope we will never have to go to see a doctor, it is reassuring and useful to know that the doctor is available as and when we need him or her. So it is indeed a good idea to get as many of our residents as possible, especially those living in highrise flats, to acquire civil defence skills and to participate in civil defence exercises for their own safety and that of their neighbours. But people may be discouraged from doing so if they find that they will be somehow disadvantaged because of personal injury or personal liability if they do so. Therefore, I am indeed gratified that provisions have been \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> made for adequate compensation for injury, for loss of life and for protection against personal liability for acts carried out in good faith during trainingor during civil defence exercises. And I certainly hope, Sir, that these provisions would encourage more people to become civil defence volunteers and to take civil defence more seriously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I would like to say that I support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like my colleagues before me, I rise in support of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just five years, our civil defence has become an important component of Singapore society. I think, if nothing else, the Hotel New World disaster has reinforced in a limited way the necessity and role of civil defence in Singapore. Therefore, as a result, civil defence has come to be accepted by all Singaporeans. I think the Bill is a very timely one. When passed, this Bill which is a very comprehensive one as mentioned by the Minister, will signify that civil defence have come of age in Singapore in its own right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provisions of the Bill are related to the enforcement of disciplinary action of errant members of the force. I think for it to be an effective and efficient uniformed organization, a code of conduct and a proper organization is therefore necessary. Naturally to go with it there must be the necessary rules and, of course, the necessary provisions to enforce this code of conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today civil defence is a permanent feature to the civilian population. All over Singapore many volunteers are undergoing training in different aspects of civil defence at one time or another. Moreover, no weekend goes by without civil defence exercises being conducted in one constituency or another. Since civil defence is such a pervasive feature in our people's lives, especially those who are volunteers in civil defence, I would like to take up one or two provisions which relate to volunteers in civil defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the hon. Member for Siglap, naturally I welcome the clauses which seek to protect volunteers from personal liability when they participate in civil defence activities and under orders of civil defence force. There is also a provision for compensation to be paid for loss of life or permanent injury. These main provisions would help to allay apprehensions of volunteers and potential volunteers. Hopefully, this will encourage more people to participate in civil defence activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are no provisions in the Bill to define the powers and the authority of volunteers in civil defence during a civil defence emergency. Clause 103 confers such authority and powers only to the Commissioner, a member or a police officer. A member, as defined in the Act, is not a volunteer. I wonder what would happen if the volunteer on his own initiative directs any action under clause 103 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e). Clause 103, sub-clauses (1)(a) to (e) defines several measures which are necessary for the preservation of life or property during a civil defence emergency. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on this particular clause. Also on clause 103, I would like to comment on sub-clause (1) (a) and sub-clause (4). Sub-clause (1)(a) states that any person who is directed by the Commissioner or a member or a police officer to render assistance to the Force to save life in immediate danger and any person who is directed to do so must do so without due regard for his own safety. Moreover, if he disobeys, subclause (4) spells out the penalty if such an order is not obeyed. In my view, subclause (1)(a) should perhaps be reworded. Alternatively, if there is such an order where we have to direct a person who may be endangering his life, this kind of order should perhaps be given only by the Commissioner and not just by any member of the Civil Defence Force. This is to ensure that lives are not further unnecessarily endangered during an emergency. If such action is deemed to be necessary, I think it must be a well considered and calculated one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the only points I have, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.46 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Civil Defence Bill is timely and necessary. It is timely because I feel that it charts another milestone of growth in our total defence programme. We need to create a safer and secure environment for Singaporeans. As such, I think the Bill enhances the Civil Defence Force to be able to garner and mobilize resources which are essential for the provision of a safer and total defence environment. It is also timely because I feel that it will provide an impetus to the Civil Defence Force to grow and develop into a force which can be reckoned with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essentially necessary because the Bill provides a basis for civil defence matters to be organised in an environment like ours. We live in a high-rise environment - a very compact environment and in such an environment there are a lot of events which we cannot predict and we need to meet exigencies of nature or emergencies from time to time. So the Bill will develop the capacity of the Civil Defence Force to organize the necessary resources to deal with emergencies and situations that are beyond our control. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Civil Defence Bill will also enhance the status of the Civil Defence Force. On too many an occasion people think that the Civil Defence Force does not have this credibility. It is seen as a 'Dad's Army' in a sense, but with the passing of this Bill, it will give the Force the status, the image and the credibility to be able to discharge the necessary functions. Sir, the Bill also provides for the organization, mobilization, deployment and the effective management of the Civil Defence Force and I think this is essentially necessary because it provides the teeth and the instrument for the Force to be well organized. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recognizing that the Civil Defence Force requires the support of the civilian population, it must therefore seek to mobilize the participation of people in the various neighbourhoods or housing estates. I feel that it is necessary for the Ministry to look at the possibilities of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> providing logistics support and resources, essentially more resources, to the various Civil Defence units that are supported by our volunteers working side by side with our full -time personnel. This is essentially necessary because I find that unless sufficient resources and logistics are deployed at the neighbourhood we may not be able to mobilize an effective volunteer force at the various housing estates to be able to meet emergencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question which I would like to seek clarification of the Minister is that I see that under clause 111 the Government will provide compensation for volunteers who suffer loss of life or injury whilst on active duty. I am wondering whether this provision does cover people who suffer from temporary disability or partial disability as a result of their active service whilst undergoing training or called for duty. I feel that additional provision of welfare support should be given to volunteers because they form, to some extent, the backbone of our Civil Defence Force. I also think that it may be necessary to consider some form of insurance to cover, I suppose, against risks of such members who participate in CD movement. I hope the Minister will be able to look at this provision and provide for further extension of support and protection for volunteers whilst they are engaged in civil defence activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken, and I think all of them were supportive of the Bill which makes my task much easier. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer, first, to the Member for Tampines who is also the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Defence. I think his point was that about 34,000 reservists would be transferred to the Singapore Civil Defence Force shortly and I would like to assure him in response to his comments that they will be deployed in important tasks for the total defence of our country. The SCDF and the SAF, in fact, have been discussing how SAF reservists can be best deployed in civil defence. Many of them are, in fact, trained leaders and specialists and therefore the SCDF is badly in need of their services. I am therefore confident that SAF reservists will find \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their stint in the CD useful. In fact, many of the CD units have roles for which SAF reservist training will prove very relevant. Examples are leaders for our rescue forces, crane and heavy plant operators, medical auxiliaries and so on. I am sure that they will show the same commitment in civil defence as they have done in SAF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note of the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's point about getting new upgraded premises and I hope that at the appropriate time, when submission is made, he will give us the necessary support by speaking also to the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for Siglap for his comments and, in particular, his comments on clause 23 and clause 102. I might mention that, since he referred to clause 23, that provision is very similar to and based on section 17 of the SAF Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Radin Mas raised two questions which require response. The first is clause 103(1)(a) which, again, we are very much influenced by models in other countries and I think this was based on comparable legislation in Queensland. His point was whether clause 103(1)(a) can be worked only upon order or direction of the Commissioner of Civil Defence. I take note of his concern but for all practical purposes it is going to be very difficult because in an actual emergency, especially one which is spread over a wide area, the Commissioner cannot be in many places at the same time. So there must be some delegation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his question as to whether volunteers can be given power to call upon individuals and direct them to do this and that, I am not sure whether (a) the volunteers would feel comfortable in being entrusted with such wide powers; (b) there would also be a problem of accountability. For the present, what we have done is to have a role for volunteers which augments the official powers given to the SCDF. The SCDF, as you know, consists of regular enlistees to the Force, reservists and, if you look at clause 5, members of the auxiliary units for which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provision has been for the long run. Looking ahead it may be possible to think of a situation where, after we have made considerable headway with the volunteers, you can develop a core of volunteers who may want to sign up as auxiliary members and they then would have the jurisdiction and powers which the Act confers officially to carry out functions referred to in clauses 102 and 103. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bo Wen referred to clause 111. I think, upon reading of that provision, it does cover the situation that he referred to. But I take his point that we must not close our eyes to the various other incentives and other measures to encourage greater participation and back-up for the volunteers. His point is noted, and I am sure the SCDF will not fail to think of other measures in addition to the financial and monetary compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned to a date to be fixed.\" - [Prof. S.

But, first of all, may I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker and Members, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that this is not an appeal on behalf of myself or a cry for help from me because I would be thought to come into this category. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, speaking on behalf of persons who have been convicted in the courts and served their sentences and then released. And I am speaking of the difficulties and problems that they encounter in our society after their release. Before I speak of their particular problems, may I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, without attempting to deliver a long lecture on this, that rehabilitation of the offender into the society is the main object or, if that is not accepted, one of the main objects of an enlightened penal policy, quite apart from deterrent and other objects. It must be the rehabilitation of the offender back into the society. And the rehabilitation of the offender is best achieved by the offender made to feel that he is accepted as a member of the society and that he is not disbarred for life from any right or privilege that other members of the society may enjoy. After all, he has paid the penalty, the price, for his wrongdoing. And upon payment of that price or penalty, he should be accepted. To try and continue to deprive him would be continuing the punishment and would be completely unjust and harsh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the Minister for Home Affairs a Question for Written Answer on the 31st October 1985, and his answer was: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government does not as a rule exclude persons with previous convictions from seeking employment in the Civil Service or Statutory Boards. Generally, an enlightened policy is adopted towards convicted persons who apply for jobs in the public sector. Each case will be considered on its own merit. The seriousness and nature of the offence as well as evidence of rehabilitation and likelihood of recidivism and the nature of the job applied for need to be considered.' That as a statement of principle is perfectly acceptable. But it does not do enough for this class of persons. I do not know what the number is and it would be useful if we could have some idea (I don't suppose we will get it this evening) of the number of persons who are in this category. The answer given to that question seems to adopt or take a negative line - We do not as a rule exclude persons from seeking employment in the Civil Service or Statutory Boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have had people coming to see me who want to make amends, who want to get back into the society and who find themselves completely shut out at every effort they make to get back into the society. The only way they can get back into the society is if they can find gainful employment. I have had people who say that the moment they apply, they are told they would be considered and then later on they are told, \"We can't take you on because of your previous convictions.\" It does not matter how many years past, these previous convictions were sustained. And so the man is under a lifelong disability, it would appear, from ever seeking any employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is to this that we must address ourselves and see whether it is right, and whether we should now take some positive steps to see that these persons are rehabilitated and accepted into the society. I do not know what the policy is. But perhaps the Minister can tell us, or whoever is replying to this, as to whether previous convictions are now released to every enquiry from a prospective employer. I can well understand that persons who are to be employed as cashiers or to have custody of money should not be persons who have previously had two or three convictions for embezzlement. But I cannot see why they cannot be employed in other occupations. So I would like to know whether the previous convictions of offenders are made known readily to all and sundry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wonder whether the Ministry would consider, even in cases where they are made known, whether this should be limited to a period of time for a few years, say, where the persons have been convicted within the three years preceding the enquiry and not disclosing any offences where the person had kept away from crime, had proved himself to have taken the necessary steps to keep away from crime for three years or more. It would be sort of, as it were, he has undergone a probationary period after his release and has shown himself to be able to resist any propensity to crime. I would ask the Minister to consider this because some of them have told me that although they have been out of the courts and the prisons for three to five years, the convictions sustained by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> them 10 years earlier or eight years earlier are still held against them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask whether the Ministry would consider advising statutory boards and the Government to extend some positive help to these people by going out of their way to employ them, particularly where they have been out of employment for a number of years. I say they need help and they are crying out for help and they say they are not getting it. They are, may I say, still members of the society and they are entitled to some respect and consideration even though they may have gone astray in time past. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question that I wish to ask, and that is, the fact of the identity card numbers of certain persons who have been convicted of, perhaps, the graver offences, crimes, being altered by the addition of another number onto it. I am told that where a person has been convicted of certain scheduled offences, upon his release another number is added on to his identity card number. I have asked the Commissioner for Registration of Persons for the legislative authority for this and he was unable to help me. Perhaps I have not been very fair to him because I only rang him up this morning. And at one o'clock when I went back, he was still unable to help me with this. So perhaps the Minister could tell us about this legislative authority whereby persons who are released are given a different identity card numbering which immediately identifies them as criminals or persons with past records. The Commissioner for Registration did not seem to be aware of it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from employment, Sir, I have had two instances of persons applying for licences. They have been told that they cannot get their licences. These two instances relate to licences for driving public service vehicles. I had a man who came to see me in May last year. He was a taxi-driver for some years. Then he was convicted by a court and fined $1,000. I believe the offence was because he had attacked a woman passenger in his taxi. Then his taxi licence was immediately revoked by the Registry of Vehicles and the man was thrown out of a livelihood. He \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> says, subsequently he applied to the Singapore Bus Services to be taken on as a bus driver. The company was prepared to take him as a bus driver but when the application was made to the Registry of Vehicles for a vocational driver's licence to enable him to drive a bus with the Singapore Bus Services, that was denied him. So the man has been without a job now, since 1984. I wrote on his behalf on the 8th May to the Registrar of Vehicles and I have not, to this date, received any reply from the Registrar of Vehicles. He came to see me only on the 17th of this month again, and he is desperate. He says, \"All that I can do is to drive. I can drive a taxi or a bus but I can't get a job.\" And to make matters worse for him, the Housing and Development Board has slapped a notice on him saying that he owes the Board something like $2,586 in arrears for instalments due on the flat and threatening to acquire the flat for non-payment of the instalments under section 48. So there you have a human situation, of a man who did not go to prison but who was just fined $1,000 and now completely deprived of any livelihood or of the livelihood that he knows. He cannot be employed as a bus driver. I, really for the life of me, cannot see why he cannot be employed as a bus driver, if it is felt that he cannot be a taxi driver because he might be left with a passenger alone in the taxi. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another case and this time of a man who applied for a taxi driver vocational licence. He has a very casual job at the moment and he wishes to drive a taxi and I think he has a job available. But he again applied to the Registrar of Vehicles for a taxi driver vocational licence and he has been refused. Because he tells me that he was charged and probably convicted, I think, in court in 1979. I wrote to the Registrar of Vehicles and I had a reply in this case, and the reply is, \"He does not have a clean record, therefore we cannot give him a licence.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is these sort of cases, I think, which show the complete harshness of the rule. As I said, if they have been made to pay the penalty or the price and they have paid it, then they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should be accepted into the society again. They may not be accepted into responsible positions but at least they should be accepted back into society, into positions of employment, so that they can lead a useful life. If we still continue to deprive them of any gainful employment, the answer surely must be that we are driving them back into crime. I hope the Ministry takes notice of that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Acting Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Community Development (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson raises this question of the plight of people who have served sentences. He has raised this question, in fact, a number of times over the years in Parliament and he has been given the answers. It shows that he is still not satisfied with the answers. He said at the beginning that he has no personal interest in what he is raising today despite the sentence that he has to serve if his appeal fails at the end of next month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad he also said that an enlightened government should have rehabilitation as its main feature in its penal policy. Sir, this is indeed what the Government is doing. Imprisonment of an offender is not something invented by Singapore. It is a practice as old as the hills. But imprisonment has two purposes, incarceration of an offender and rehabilitation. I will show how much effort the Government spends in rehabilitating a prisoner, and in helping, counselling, assisting him, after he has been discharged from prison. And I will also show that society generally does not have prejudice against such people unless, of course, these people repeatedly commit crimes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has a Prison Welfare Service. The Prison Welfare Service takes care of prisoners, long-term prisoners as well as those under statutory supervision like young offenders and habitual offenders. The Ministry of Home Affairs takes care of the criminal law detainees and drug offenders through the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) and the Central Narcotics Bureau's job placement unit. And there are also a number of voluntary organizations, for example, the Singapore After-Care Association (SACA), helping in the rehabilitative effort of the ex-prisoners. SACA will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> visit the prisoner one or two months before his release. The Prison Welfare Officer deals with the prisoner the moment he is in and if he falls into the category of prisoners to be serviced by the Prison Welfare Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in prison, the Prison Department through SCORE provides skills training, vocational training and academic training to those who can benefit from such training. Everything possible is done to make the prisoner's reintegration into society easy after his release. Just as an example, SCORE provides vocational training and work programmes, including VITB approved training courses in electrical wiring, general welding, industrial training in furniture, metal, electronic products, bakery, cane products, laundry, tailoring and printing. Those who do not take up vocational training but have an inclination for academic studies attend classes leading to the 'O' level examinations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the prisoners under the criminal law category as well as those who are serving short-term sentences of six months or less, or those with long-term sentences but have six months more to serve, will take part in day-release schemes where they go out and work, receive pay like any other worker, so that they can eventually reintegrate into society when they are released. All these activities prepare them for acceptance into society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the special category of prisoners, the young and habitual offenders, after-care for the other kinds of discharged prisoners is voluntary. It depends very much on the willingness of the prisoner to receive help and to seek assistance from the Prison Welfare Service. But not all of them take advantage of this because some want to shed off their past and have nothing more to do with official attention. Others are capable of looking after themselves and getting into the mainstream of society. Still others would like to enjoy the flush of freedom which is set upon them and they do not seek help until they are in trouble again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who do not come to the Community Development Ministry or the Home Affairs Ministry for help, they can \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> still go to the Labour Ministry which does not distinguish whether or not a person has a prison record before it offers help. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some examples and statistics on how discharged prisoners fare under the care of the Prison Welfare Service. As at 31st August, there are 412 discharged prisoners. These are the voluntary cases who come to us for help. We found that 56% of them are working, gainfully employed; 25% of them are not employed because they were just recently released from prison or they have recently ceased employment; 1% could not be employed because they are disabled or because they are studying; and 5% are doing national service. We do not know what happened to the remaining 14% because they did not follow up with us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the other category of prisoners under statutory supervision, these are the young offenders and the habitual offenders, we have 148 of them on our record. Of these, as at 31st August, 55% of them are working, 22% studying, 5% in national service, only 7.6% unemployed because they have been released recently or awaiting placement. The last 11% was suspended from supervision because they have breached the supervision rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see the Government has taken on the rehabilitative efforts of the prisoners and spends a great deal of effort in them. Altogether, there are about 100 full-time staff employed by the Home Affairs and Community Development Ministries as well as SCORE in helping these prisoners and discharged prisoners. There are also more than 1,000 voluntary after-care officers helping these people to readjust into society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Government jobs, the Member asked? Well, the answer has already been given by the Minister for Home Affairs as well as the Minister for Finance on previous occasions, ie, that it depends on the individual merit of the discharged prisoner. As you know, jobs in the civil service require integrity and honesty. But some jobs are open to people with prison records and it is up to the Permanent Secretary to decide, especially \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> if they are the lower division jobs. When it comes to senior positions where officers have access to sensitive information, naturally the public service would be a bit more careful. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that taxi drivers are not allowed to drive if they have committed an offence and he quoted the example of a resident of his who has a record of molesting a woman passenger. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Not my resident. Somebody else's. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Do we not know the seriousness of an offence like this, of a taxi driver alone in his vehicle and has a female passenger in the vehicle all by herself, not being able to defend herself if she is offended or molested by the taxi driver? Surely we want to protect our public from such people. I think, when weighing the individual rights of a person with criminal records in seeking public appointments or in this kind of public service jobs, we need to take into account the wider interest of the public. We must protect the interest of the public. This person claims that he can only drive a bus or a taxi. But I am sure with a pair of hands, he can do many things as well in addition to just driving. So if he wants to work, I am sure he should have no difficulty in finding employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other categories of jobs which should not be open to people with convictions for serious offences, eg, in security agencies. Security agencies' staff are employed by their clients to look after property or sometimes even life. For a person who has been convicted of a serious offence, do we want to place the public's interest, the client's interest, in his hands if he has such a record? I think we must ask ourselves: whose interest should we protect? The wider interest of the public or one person's interest? \n  <br>5.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Five o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half an hour, Mr Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Half-past Five\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1986/19860922/19860922-HA-0480743.htm\">Annex - INVOLVEMENT OF SENIOR CITIZENS IN ACTIVITIES BY PERCENTAGE (Cols. 743 - 744)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
