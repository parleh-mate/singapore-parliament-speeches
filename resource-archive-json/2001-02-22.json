The top-up was given in\r\n\r\nappreciation of Singaporeans who have accepted the CPF cut to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singapore  overcome  the  challenges  of  the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.   Singaporeans  aged 21  years  and  above  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  at  least a total of $100 to any  of  their  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts between 1st January 1998 and 31st December 2000  are\r\n\r\neligible for the top-up.  Those who did not already meet this\r\n\r\n$100   minimum  contribution  requirement  at  the  time   of\r\n\r\nannouncement had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout 4 months to make voluntary contribution to qualify  for\r\n\r\nthe  top-up.  Of the 2.13 million Singaporeans eligible, 1.94\r\n\r\nmillion (or 91%) qualified for the top-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 200,000 (9%) Singaporeans who did not qualify for\r\n\r\nthe top-up, 69% are aged below 55, 8% are between the ages of\r\n\r\n55  and 65, and 23% are aged 65 and above.  33% of them  stay\r\n\r\nin  1-  to  3-room  HDB  flats, in homes  or  are  on  public\r\n\r\nassistance,  27% in 4-room HDB flats and 40%  in  5-room  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  or  private housing.  55% are females.

The interest of\r\n\r\nSGX's  shareholders and the \"public interest\" as  represented\r\n\r\nby  traders  and users of the Exchange are more aligned  than\r\n\r\ndivergent.   An  exchange  seeking to  attract  listings  and\r\n\r\ninvestor interest benefits from sound regulation as  well  as\r\n\r\neffective  enforcement mechanisms.  It is in  the  commercial\r\n\r\ninterest  of  SGX to have a sound regulatory  framework  that\r\n\r\nprovides  the  basis for a healthy, vibrant  marketplace  for\r\n\r\nsustained business success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before its demutualization, members of the then\r\n\r\nStock Exchange of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  (SES)  had to set their own in-house  rules  which\r\n\r\ncould  compromise their short-term commercial  interest,  and\r\n\r\nSES   had  to  supervise  its  own  members,  who  owned  and\r\n\r\ncontrolled the Exchange.  This made it necessary for  MAS  to\r\n\r\nbe quite involved in the affairs of SES.  SGX now has a wider\r\n\r\nand    more   diverse   pool   of   shareholders,   including\r\n\r\ninternational shareholders.  Having a wider investor base has\r\n\r\nremoved  some of the earlier potential conflicts of  interest\r\n\r\nfor  members.  However, the demutualization of  the  SGX  has\r\n\r\naccentuated  and  made  more explicit the  issue  of  whether\r\n\r\nmaking profit is consistent with good regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has defined more clearly an enhanced role for itself\r\n\r\nin   overseeing   SGX's  regulatory  responsibilities.    The\r\n\r\nExchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act 1999 gives MAS the\r\n\r\npower  to issue directives to SGX in the interest of ensuring\r\n\r\nfair  and  orderly  markets  and  the  proper  management  of\r\n\r\nsystemic  risks.  The Act also provides for MAS  to  directly\r\n\r\nregulate  SGX's  position  as a company  listed  on  its  own\r\n\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS recently, on 16th February 2001, issued a press\r\n\r\nstatement,  and  the  Deputy Managing  Director,  Mr  Tharman\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam, made a speech which set out MAS' position  in\r\n\r\ndetail.    SGX  will,  in  the  main,  retain  the  frontline\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of   regulating  market   participants   and\r\n\r\ncompliance  with  its  own  rules.   MAS,  as  the  statutory\r\n\r\nregulator,  will  assure itself that SGX  is  performing  its\r\n\r\nregulatory   functions  competently  and  responsibly.    For\r\n\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. SGX defines and enforces its Rules and Bye-Laws.\r\n\r\nHowever,  SGX must continue to obtain MAS' approval  for  any\r\n\r\namendments thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Whilst SGX ensures that listed companies make\r\n\r\ntimely  and complete disclosure of material information,  MAS\r\n\r\nwill  conduct  the  civil prosecution of offending  companies\r\n\r\nwhich contravene the disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. SGX conducts direct surveillance of the market, and\r\n\r\nMAS  will  assure  itself that this is done  effectively  and\r\n\r\nresponsibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has\r\n\r\nencouraged  the financial industry to embark on a  number  of\r\n\r\nprojects  to  improve the efficiency of the current  payments\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  including the cheque  truncation  and  other\r\n\r\nelectronic  payment  systems.  The MAS  is  also  considering\r\n\r\nappropriate    legislative   changes   to   facilitate    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of these new systems and processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Today only currency notes are legal tender. As\r\n\r\ncashless  forms of payment become more widespread, the  Board\r\n\r\nof  Commissioners  of Currency, Singapore (BCCS)  is  looking\r\n\r\ninto the need to legislate for electronic payments to also be\r\n\r\naccepted   as  legal  tender.   Merchants  covered   by   the\r\n\r\nlegislation must then accept electronic payment, if tendered.\r\n\r\nElectronic  tender will reduce the cost of handling  physical\r\n\r\ncash,  improve  the efficiency of business transactions,  and\r\n\r\nfurther   enhance  the  cashless  business  environment   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However,  widespread infrastructure  to  support\r\n\r\nsuch an environment will be necessary, and the public must be\r\n\r\nadequately  prepared for the transition.   BCCS  is  actively\r\n\r\nstudying this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Under the current regulatory framework, only\r\n\r\nlicensed  banks, with the approval of MAS, can  issue  multi-purpose  stored value cards (MPSVCs).  It is also  common  in\r\n\r\nmajor  jurisdictions for the issuance of multi-purpose stored\r\n\r\nvalue  cards  to be restricted to deposit-taking institutions\r\n\r\nlike  banks.  Issuing multi-purpose stored value cards  is  a\r\n\r\nform  of deposit taking, so MAS wants to be certain that card\r\n\r\nholders  have  some  protection should the  issuer  run  into\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   Banks  are subject to MAS  supervision  and  to\r\n\r\nreserve  and liquidity requirements on the proceeds collected\r\n\r\nfrom  multi-purpose stored value cards, but other  commercial\r\n\r\ncompanies have no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar  requirements.  We  will  continue  to  review  this,\r\n\r\nweighing the balance between innovation and proper protection\r\n\r\nof proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The operation of clearing and settlement systems is\r\n\r\nnot restricted to the local banks.  For example, Citibank  is\r\n\r\nthe  settlement bank for the US dollar cheque clearing system\r\n\r\nwhile Banking Computer Services Pte Ltd (BCS) is the operator\r\n\r\nof  the  Automated  Clearing House,  which  clears  Singapore\r\n\r\ncheques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Ministry of Communications and Information\r\n\r\nTechnology  is  spearheading an inter-agency  task  force  to\r\n\r\nstudy   general   privacy   issues,   taking   into   account\r\n\r\ninternational  developments.  The study  will  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  e-commerce and Internet on  data  protection  and\r\n\r\nprivacy   and  will  cover,  among  other  things,  financial\r\n\r\ninformation collected from e-commerce websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to follow\r\n\r\nup  by asking the Deputy Prime Minister, particularly on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of other financial institutions issuing stored value\r\n\r\npayment  cards, whether the Deputy Prime Minister or the  MAS\r\n\r\nwould   consider   allowing   institutions   like   insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies, which are also regulated and very liquid, to issue\r\n\r\nsuch  services and, secondly, to consider whether  some  very\r\n\r\nmajor  and very liquid capital-heavy companies could also  do\r\n\r\nthese services, provided they are willing to be regulated  by\r\n\r\nthe MAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said in\r\n\r\nmy  main reply, our present policy is to confine it to banks,\r\n\r\nbut  it is an issue which we will keep alive and look at from\r\n\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a basic difference between banks and other\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   Banks take deposits.  Finance  companies  are\r\n\r\nthe  only  ones which are close to that.  Insurance companies\r\n\r\ndo  not take deposits.  Other companies, whether or not  they\r\n\r\nare  well  capitalised, do not take deposits.   Deposits  are\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  any  other form of  credit.   If  a  company\r\n\r\nborrows money from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbank,  the bank makes a judgement whether it is safe to  lend\r\n\r\nthis  money to the company and, if the company turns  turtle,\r\n\r\nthe  bank has a bad loan.  But the bank is supposed  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  good  for  it and looks after  its  own  interests.\r\n\r\nTaking  deposits  from  the general  public  is  a  different\r\n\r\nproposition,  because people assume that the banks  are  safe\r\n\r\nand,  particularly for the small amounts of money which  many\r\n\r\npeople  deposit,  as will be in the case of  a  stored  value\r\n\r\ncard,  they assume that the money will be safe.  They put  it\r\n\r\nin  and  they expect it to be protected.  And it is protected\r\n\r\nbecause   the  banks  are  regulated.   There  is  a  capital\r\n\r\nrequirement  so that the banks have a buffer, in  case  their\r\n\r\nbusiness goes bad.  There are liquidity requirements so that,\r\n\r\nin  case many people turn up at the bank at the same time  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw their money, the bank is liquid and can pay out  the\r\n\r\nmoney  and  will not find itself out of cash.  And  there  is\r\n\r\nsupervision  by MAS on top of this, to make sure  that  banks\r\n\r\nstick to these requirements and are properly operated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me whether somebody else who is well\r\n\r\ncapitalised  would  like  to  volunteer  to  come  under  MAS\r\n\r\nsupervision  and therefore issue multi-purpose  stored  value\r\n\r\ncards,  in  a small way, you are asking me whether  we  would\r\n\r\nissue  them a banking licence, to which the answer  would  be\r\n\r\n\"No\".  But it is a gray area because, if we are talking about\r\n\r\n$5  or  $10  in a phone card or some other stored value  card\r\n\r\nwith  restricted  purposes which you can use  in  the  store,\r\n\r\nwell,  that is between you and the shop, you have  given  the\r\n\r\ncompany  some  credit, he has given you some  discount.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is a multi-purpose card and you can use it in  many\r\n\r\noutlets, then, in fact, it is akin to deposit-taking,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink we should regulate it as such.  There are many banks in\r\n\r\nSingapore, so there is no lack of competition for issuers  of\r\n\r\nmulti-purpose stored value cards.  I know there are a lot  of\r\n\r\npeople whose eyes popped-out when they saw the opportunity of\r\n\r\nissuing such a card, because they thought that, if they issue\r\n\r\na card, they will get a float; if they have a float, they can\r\n\r\ninvest it; and if they invest it, they can get rich, and this\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextremely  favourable.

Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he would  not\r\n\r\nconsider  that the issue of stored value cards is really  one\r\n\r\nway of promoting Singapore as an e-commerce hub because there\r\n\r\nis  this perception that the banks are moving very slowly and\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  liberalisation of this area,  just  for  stored\r\n\r\nvalue  cards and not for the banking licence, would  be  good\r\n\r\nfor Singapore as a whole?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of\r\n\r\nstored  value  cards  is not a question of  the  banks  being\r\n\r\nreluctant  but  of consumers being reluctant.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nreluctance for people to hold credit cards.  There  are  lots\r\n\r\nand  lots of them and lots of people want more credit  cards.\r\n\r\nBut the use of a stored value card, where they have to top up\r\n\r\nmoney, put the money in, pay first, then spend it, it may run\r\n\r\nout, they will have to top up further, is not something which\r\n\r\nhas caught on in many jurisdictions.  It is quite popular  in\r\n\r\nJapan,  it  is  not  popular in Europe or in  America.   Many\r\n\r\nissuers  have  tried.   We  thought  that  we  had  a  killer\r\n\r\napplication  when we had the ERP system and every  car  owner\r\n\r\nhad  to  have  a card in his IVU.  But although  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of transactions take place on the ERP  every  day,\r\n\r\nonly  a  few  hundred transactions take place  off  the  ERP,\r\n\r\nbecause  nobody  goes to the provision  shop  and  to  buy  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  or groceries using a stored value card.   They  do\r\n\r\nnot  mind NETS because that is convenient.  But to bring  the\r\n\r\nmoney  into  the  card and then carry around  a  few  hundred\r\n\r\ndollars and spend it bit by bit and keep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrack, is not something which consumers have found convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have another opportunity because we are going to\r\n\r\nhave a contactless stored value card for mass transit, bus as\r\n\r\nwell  as  train, and we are hoping to use that to  make  that\r\n\r\nmore popular and use it for small purchases, like the Octopus\r\n\r\nCard  in  Hong Kong which can be used for small purchases  in\r\n\r\nshops in the MTR stations.  But we will have to watch and see\r\n\r\nhow consumer demand develops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEVALUATION OF SINGAPORE'S CURRENCY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government will devalue Singapore's currency  to\r\n\r\nmake its products more competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's\r\n\r\nexports  have performed strongly over the past year.  Non-oil\r\n\r\ndomestic  exports (NODX) increased by 11.8% in  2000.   Since\r\n\r\nNovember  2000, the growth of NODX has moderated, as external\r\n\r\ndemand  weakened with the slowdown in the global  electronics\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devaluation does not necessarily boost our exports,\r\n\r\nexcept  in the short run.  The import content of our domestic\r\n\r\nexports  is very high at 60%.  So a weak exchange rate  would\r\n\r\nlead  mainly to higher CPI inflation and higher import  costs\r\n\r\nfor  manufacturers.  In addition, with the economy  operating\r\n\r\nat  full capacity, a weaker Singapore dollar would cause  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market  to  tighten, nominal  wages  to  go  up,  and\r\n\r\ninflation  to  rise. This would negate the  initial  positive\r\n\r\nimpact of a weak exchange rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the inflation caused by a devaluation would\r\n\r\nerode the purchasing power of the substantial CPF savings  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, which are denominated in Singapore dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the MAS manages the S$ exchange rate with a\r\n\r\nview to maintaining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlow inflation and a stable Singapore dollar, as a sound basis\r\n\r\nfor  sustained economic growth.  It has deliberately not used\r\n\r\nthe  exchange  rate  as an instrument to  manage  our  export\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   Instead  the  Government  has  focused  on\r\n\r\ndirect   ways  to  reduce  business  costs,  improve   labour\r\n\r\nproductivity and enhance capabilities, such as the CPF cut in\r\n\r\n1998, which has now mostly been restored.  The fact that with\r\n\r\nthis approach the economy recovered quickly and strongly from\r\n\r\nthe  Asian crisis and grew by 9.9% last year, shows that  our\r\n\r\npolicy is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REVERSE MORTGAGES FOR HDB FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  whether the Housing and Development  Board  will\r\n\r\nallow  its  lessees  especially senior citizens  to  take  up\r\n\r\nreverse mortgages for their flats so that they can have  more\r\n\r\ndisposable income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of National Development and the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board have explored reverse mortgage\r\n\r\nas  a  possible  way to provide elderly HDB lessees  with  an\r\n\r\nadditional source of income for their retirement needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current reverse mortgage proposals allow a property\r\n\r\nowner  to receive monthly payments over a fixed term of about\r\n\r\n10  years.

But  we  do\r\n\r\nrecognise that the 20% down payment, for some young couples,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially in cases where the flat is completed early or they\r\n\r\nare  shortlisted for application sooner than  they  expected,\r\n\r\nthere  may be some difficulty in accumulating that  20%,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  reason  why  we came  up  with  the  Staggered\r\n\r\nDownpayment Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Staggered Downpayment Scheme has got certain\r\n\r\nrestrictions.   The  flat type must be a  smaller  flat  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  there must be a certain age restriction  as  well.\r\n\r\nBut  the  general principle does apply that you need to  have\r\n\r\nsomething upfront before you can actually apply for  a  flat.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why the scheme is not applicable to the 5-room  flats  because obviously the question of  affordability\r\n\r\nmay not be so relevant there.  But the Member did ask whether\r\n\r\nthis  scheme would be applicable to resale flats,  especially\r\n\r\nwhere  young  couples  want to move into  certain  areas  for\r\n\r\ncertain reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For resale flats, if you are a first-timer and if you\r\n\r\nare a young couple, you can avail yourself of the CPF Housing\r\n\r\nGrant  Scheme.

Utilities had to buy all their\r\n\r\npower requirements through the state power exchange and could\r\n\r\nnot  buy power in forward markets or hedge prices in any way.\r\n\r\nPrices  were  also frozen at the 1996 levels  until  2002  to\r\n\r\nallow the utility companies to recover the stranded costs  of\r\n\r\nold  investments.  The Independent System Operator (ISO)  was\r\n\r\ntasked  to  operate the network but was not  responsible  for\r\n\r\nplanning and building additional transmission capacity.   The\r\n\r\nbidding procedures in the power exchange were also vulnerable\r\n\r\nto gaming by the generation companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-deregulation, several developments led to the\r\n\r\ncrisis  in January this year.  Fuel prices rose dramatically.\r\n\r\nLed  by  the  economic boom, electricity demand in California\r\n\r\ngrew   strongly,  but  this  was  not  dampened   by   higher\r\n\r\nelectricity prices because those were capped and  supply  was\r\n\r\nnot  met by the planting of new generation capacity.  And due\r\n\r\nto  its  strict  environmental regulations  and  wide  public\r\n\r\nresistance of having a power plant in their backyard, no  new\r\n\r\ngeneration  plants were built in the state for more  than  10\r\n\r\nyears.   In fact, some commentators described California as a\r\n\r\n\"banana\"  state,  because  they had  this  policy  of  \"build\r\n\r\nabsolutely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnothing  anywhere near anybody.\"  As a result, the generation\r\n\r\nreserve  capacity in California dropped drastically from  30%\r\n\r\nto  below 7%.  A confluence of various factors, including bad\r\n\r\nweather,  resulted in a severe mismatch of supply and  demand\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  turn,  led to soaring prices on  the  electricity\r\n\r\nwholesale   market.   A  series  of  planned  blackouts   was\r\n\r\ntherefore   implemented  in  January  this  year  to   ration\r\n\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California had expected the market prices of electricity\r\n\r\nto  remain  low  after deregulation and thus imposed  a  rate\r\n\r\nfreeze.   However, as prices on the spot market soared,  this\r\n\r\nrate  soon  became  lower than the cost of  generation.   The\r\n\r\nutilities  companies  incurred  a  10-cent  loss  for   every\r\n\r\nkilowatt-hour  (kwh) of electricity sold and were  driven  to\r\n\r\nthe  brink of bankruptcy with a total debt of US$12  billion.\r\n\r\nThe  State  has now stepped in to prevent the situation  from\r\n\r\ngetting worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key lessons for us from California are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The market structure and regulatory framework must be\r\n\r\nsound and robust;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The market must be allowed to work. Price adjustments\r\n\r\nare  needed  to enable consumers to adjust their  consumption\r\n\r\nand to motivate new investments in generation capacity;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Entry to and exit from the industry should be\r\n\r\nfacilitated.   In  California, it was very difficult  to  get\r\n\r\napproval for new power stations which meant that supply could\r\n\r\nnot keep up with demand.  The strict environmental rules have\r\n\r\ndiscouraged investors from building new power plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we must make sure that good economics\r\n\r\ndrive   the   liberalisation  of  our  energy   market.    In\r\n\r\nCalifornia, the problem was not economics but politics.  Work\r\n\r\non  our liberalisation is progressing well and the new market\r\n\r\nwill  start  functioning in the second  half  of  this  year.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  deregulation of our electricity industry  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  problem-free as it is a complex exercise.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will liberalise in stages.

But  we operate a market system  and,  to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  extent  possible,  we should  allow  the  market  to\r\n\r\noperate.    Where  there  are  monopoly  powers,   then   the\r\n\r\nregulators involved must make sure that either the monopolies\r\n\r\nare regulated or broken up or the sector made contestable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has performed a very useful role being a consumer\r\n\r\nwatchdog.  I do not think it is toothless at all.  And it has\r\n\r\nbeen  lobbying  MTI  very hard for us  to  establish  a  Fair\r\n\r\nTrading  Act.  We are now working with CASE to  look  at  how\r\n\r\nsuch  an Act can be legislated.  It should be done in  a  way\r\n\r\nwhich  does  not make the market operate less efficiently  or\r\n\r\nless  flexibly.   Many MPs in this House, including Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee Tong on many occasions, have raised the need for such  an\r\n\r\nAct.  MTI has not been very enthusiastic about it because  it\r\n\r\ncreates  other problems.  But we are prepared to look  at  an\r\n\r\nAct  which is minimalist and which allows the small  consumer\r\n\r\nto seek redress at low cost, and we can make use of the Small\r\n\r\nClaims Tribunal for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very early in this\r\n\r\nParliament,  I  proposed the appointment of  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncommittee to check on price increases.

The cut in production is likely to lead\r\n\r\nonly  to a short-term increase in prices amid an increasingly\r\n\r\nsluggish global economy.  Producer competition is also likely\r\n\r\nto depress oil prices.  Oil price futures, which is a forward\r\n\r\nindicator of oil prices, suggests that oil prices would  ease\r\n\r\nin  the  months  ahead.  The 3-month and 12-month  oil  price\r\n\r\nfutures as at 14th February this year are US$27 and US$25 per\r\n\r\nbarrel   respectively.   The  OPEC  oil  production  cut   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  not expected to have a big impact on the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact on household electricity bills will depend on\r\n\r\nglobal fuel oil prices.

So, here is a place where people can  speak  any\r\n\r\ntime,  just  register  and speak on any topic,  except  those\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have mentioned, and people can gather,  and  indeed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  all  backgrounds have gathered,  some  more\r\n\r\ninterested  than others, but nevertheless many have  gathered\r\n\r\nand none has been prosecuted or investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like I have said, Sir, the use of the Park is\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  laws of the land, and Mr Jeyaretnam,  as  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  should  know  the provisions  of  the  Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nOffences  Act  and  the  rules, in particular  Rule  2  which\r\n\r\ndefines  what  is  an  illegal assembly,  when  people  plan,\r\n\r\norganise  together  to  publicise  a  specific  cause,   then\r\n\r\npossibly an offence has been committed.

That was the\r\n\r\nimport of Mr Jeyaretnam's original question which was rightly\r\n\r\nasked:  why  was the permit for the run refused?  The  permit\r\n\r\nfor  the  run  was  refused, like I have  said,  because  the\r\n\r\npublicity had said it was one event where you end up in  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  Park, where demonstrations would be held to abolish  the\r\n\r\nISA  and activists would be invited to join in.

But now Mr Jeyaretnam is  asking\r\n\r\nspecific  questions on events that happened thereafter  which\r\n\r\nare  currently under Police investigations, which I think  we\r\n\r\nshould not discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask a final question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Provided it is related to your main\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.

In reality, Sir,  that  is  what\r\n\r\nPolice has to consider.  Let me assure Mr Jeyaretnam that the\r\n\r\nPolice   will   consider  all  these  points  professionally.\r\n\r\nUppermost in the minds of the Police will be the question  of\r\n\r\npotential law and order and breach of the peace problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the permit asked for\r\n\r\nspecifically says that there shall only be 20 to  30  persons\r\n\r\nrunning.   If  the number is more than 30, the  Police  could\r\n\r\ndeclare  and just ask everybody to disperse because they  are\r\n\r\nbreaking the conditions of the permit there.  So if there are\r\n\r\nonly  20  to  30  persons confined to that demonstration,  is\r\n\r\nthere a security, law and order problem for the Police?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, answer that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

A\r\n\r\ndemonstration can start with 20 or 30 people, but who  is  to\r\n\r\nsay that other supporters will not gather?  And who is to say\r\n\r\nthat  other people who are against the cause may not  gather?\r\n\r\nThen,  problems will ensue.  I think from Police's  point  of\r\n\r\nview, uppermost in their minds is the protection of citizens,\r\n\r\nlike you and me, the safety of ordinary citizens.  Hence,  if\r\n\r\nthere is a potential law and order problem, they will have to\r\n\r\nsay  no.  They cannot wait for things to happen and hope that\r\n\r\nthe  31st  runner  would not join in, or  hope  that  at  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner there will be no 31st listener.  They cannot\r\n\r\ndo that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You do that just because you are\r\n\r\nspeculative of what will happen.

As long as\r\n\r\nthat  number is limited there, I do not think there  will  be\r\n\r\nany problems with the permit.  But as soon as it exceeds that\r\n\r\nnumber,  the  Police can immediately disperse the  crowd  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Look  here.   That is the end of  your  demonstration.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  end  of your event.\", because  you  break  the\r\n\r\nconditions of the permit.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in November last year, the Government announced\r\n\r\nplans   to  convert  the  Intellectual  Property  Office   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a statutory board with effect from 1st  April\r\n\r\nthis year.  This Bill provides the legislative framework  for\r\n\r\nthe formation of this new statutory board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government department, currently known as the\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Office of Singapore (or IPOS for short)\r\n\r\nhad  its  origins  in  1937.  In those  days,  its  role  was\r\n\r\nconfined   to   the  processing  of  applications   for   the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  trade marks, renewals  and  restoration  of\r\n\r\ntrade  mark  registrations, adjudication  of  opposition  and\r\n\r\nrectification  proceedings  for such  registration,  and  re-registration of United Kingdom patents.  Over the  years,  as\r\n\r\nthe realm of intellectual property rights increasingly became\r\n\r\nmore  important, the Registry expanded its activities  beyond\r\n\r\nits   traditional  regulatory  functions  to  include  policy\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  law  reform  and promotional  and  facilitation\r\n\r\nactivities.  These initiatives include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) creating indigenous regimes for the protection of\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  -  such  as  the  formation   of   an\r\n\r\nindigenous patent registration system in 1995 and the setting\r\n\r\nup of a new Designs Registry last year;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) introducing new regimes of Intellectual Property\r\n\r\nprotection,  for  example, protection for  layout-designs  of\r\n\r\nintegrated circuits, and geographical indications;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) advising on policy and legal issues relating to\r\n\r\ncopyright  protection,  including amendments  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nlegislation to comply with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related\r\n\r\nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights (or TRIPS), replacing\r\n\r\nthe  1939 Trade Marks Act with a new Trade Marks Act in  1998\r\n\r\nand  the  1999 amendments to the Copyright Act to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  recent  developments in e-commerce  and  information\r\n\r\ntechnology;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) driving and coordinating public Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty education and awareness programmes; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) collaborating with other agencies to develop\r\n\r\nsoftware packages to improve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccess  by  businesses  and  users of  Intellectual  Property\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these new roles and responsibilities, the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Trademarks and Patents was restructured  as  the\r\n\r\nIntellectual  Property Office of Singapore in September  1999\r\n\r\nand  given  oversight  of the entire  range  of  Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty  laws.  Now, one and a half years on, the conversion\r\n\r\nof IPOS into a statutory board is a logical step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, undoubtedly, Intellectual Property is a key\r\n\r\nresource in today's economy.  It is also a critical factor in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  Singapore's competitiveness  now  and  into  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future.  A poignant illustration of this point is\r\n\r\nthe  steadily  increasing number of patents being  filed  and\r\n\r\ngranted in Singapore.  In 1995, when the new Patents Act came\r\n\r\ninto  force, 2,410 patent applications were filed  under  the\r\n\r\nnew  Act  and  1,750 patents were granted.  Last year,  7,713\r\n\r\npatent  applications  were  filed  and  5,086  patents   were\r\n\r\ngranted.   In all, more than 20,000 patents were  granted  in\r\n\r\nSingapore between 1995 and the year 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the increasing significance of intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty   rights,  we  must  ensure  that  our  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty laws, policies and supporting framework continue  to\r\n\r\nfoster   an  environment  which  encourages  innovation   and\r\n\r\ncreativity and effectively protects investments in innovation\r\n\r\nand  intellectual  labour.  The conversion  of  IPOS  into  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board will ensure that it is given the autonomy and\r\n\r\nresources  to  perform this task effectively,  to  match  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  other key intellectual property offices  of  the\r\n\r\nworld, and the flexibility and nimbleness to ensure that  our\r\n\r\nintellectual  property infrastructure  keeps  pace  with  the\r\n\r\nrapidly  changing  conditions and with  the  speed  at  which\r\n\r\ninnovation and creativity is moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, IPOS will advise the Government on all areas of\r\n\r\nintellectual   property   policies,   including    copyright,\r\n\r\nintegrated circuits and geographical indications,  and  carry\r\n\r\nout  regulatory functions over intellectual property  agents.\r\n\r\nApart  from carrying out its core functions, IPOS  will  also\r\n\r\nengage in promoting intellectual property and will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nembark  on  other  support activities to support  innovation,\r\n\r\ncreativity and use of intellectual property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from educating and informing the public on\r\n\r\nintellectual  property, IPOS, with its greater autonomy,  can\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time embark on the provision of other  value-added   services  and  products  that  may  be  required   by\r\n\r\nintellectual property users.  Such services and products can,\r\n\r\nfor   example,  focus  on  the  dissemination  of   technical\r\n\r\ninformation   to   facilitate   research   and   development,\r\n\r\nemphasizing   the  importance  of  innovative  products   and\r\n\r\nservices,  and use of intellectual property as strategic  and\r\n\r\nmarketing tools to secure competitive advantage when entering\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a highly regarded intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty regime which is one of the best in Asia.  IPOS  will\r\n\r\nestablish and maintain an effective international network  to\r\n\r\nensure  that Singapore continues to stay at the forefront  of\r\n\r\nintellectual property developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now take the House through the main\r\n\r\nprovisions   of   the  Bill.   Part  II  provides   for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment, incorporation and constitution of  IPOS  as  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board.  The new statutory board will consist  of  a\r\n\r\nChairman, a Deputy Chairman and 8 to 20 other board  members.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the  selection of board members, we  will  draw  on\r\n\r\nexpertise from both the public and private sectors, and  from\r\n\r\nthe   tertiary  and  scientific  institutions  as   well   as\r\n\r\nintellectual property practitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III spells out the functions and powers of the new\r\n\r\nstatutory board.  The main functions are :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to administer our intellectual property laws and\r\n\r\nthe systems for the protection of intellectual property;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to promote public awareness and effective use of\r\n\r\nintellectual property rights;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to advise and make recommendations to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on matters related to intellectual property   and\r\n\r\nto   represent  the  Government  internationally  on  matters\r\n\r\nrelating to intellectual property; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to promote the development of the profession of\r\n\r\nintellectual   property  agents  and  intellectual   property\r\n\r\nadvisers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill relates to financial matters. IPOS\r\n\r\nwill be a self-funding statutory board and will fund its  own\r\n\r\nservices  and activities.  This would allow revenues obtained\r\n\r\nfrom intellectual property services and products carried  out\r\n\r\nby  IPOS to be channelled back to the benefit of the users of\r\n\r\nthe  system,  with optimal use of resources  that  meets  the\r\n\r\nusers' needs and expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill relates to transitional matters,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the transfer of employees to the new statutory board\r\n\r\non  terms  no  less favourable than those the  employees  had\r\n\r\nenjoyed immediately prior to their transfer, and the transfer\r\n\r\nof assets and liabilities to the new statutory board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII of the Bill contains various miscellaneous\r\n\r\nprovisions.   IPOS  officers will be vested with  enforcement\r\n\r\npowers  in  order to allow them to enforce some  departmental\r\n\r\noffences  for  the  Acts  under  their  administration.   The\r\n\r\noffences are those under the Bill and the offences set out in\r\n\r\nthe  Third  Schedule to the Bill, which are mainly regulatory\r\n\r\noffences  under  the  Patents  Act,  Trade  Marks   Act   and\r\n\r\nRegistered Designs Act.  IPOS officers will also be empowered\r\n\r\nto  carry out prosecutions and the legal officers may  appear\r\n\r\nin  court  for  civil proceedings on behalf of  IPOS  or  the\r\n\r\nRegistrars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of IPOS as a new statutory board is\r\n\r\nanother  important  step in establishing  the  infrastructure\r\n\r\nneeded  to  ensure  that  Singapore is  able  to  effectively\r\n\r\ndevelop intellectual property as a strategic resource to meet\r\n\r\nthe challenges of the new economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

It has a\r\n\r\nregulatory  function to administer the intellectual  property\r\n\r\nregime   in  Singapore  and  register  intellectual  property\r\n\r\nadvisers and patent agents.  It has an educative function, to\r\n\r\npromote  public awareness of IPRs, and provide  training  and\r\n\r\nscholarships  for  patent agents and other IP  professionals.\r\n\r\nAnd   it   has  an  international  function  -  to  represent\r\n\r\nGovernment internationally on matters relating to IPRs and to\r\n\r\nprovide advice and assistance to other countries as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these tasks are difficult ones and my first\r\n\r\ncomment  is:  is too much being expected from IPOS?   Can  it\r\n\r\nmanage its many roles efficiently and fairly?  It is a unique\r\n\r\ninstitution.   I  do not think that other countries  have  an\r\n\r\ninstitution    taking    on   such    wide    and    enormous\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, at least not all under one roof.  Would  it\r\n\r\nbe  able  to deliver on all its responsibilities?   Not  only\r\n\r\nthat.   It  is neither a typical statutory body or a  private\r\n\r\ncompany,  but a public corporation able to invest its  monies\r\n\r\nin  such  manner  as  it  thinks fit,  subject  only  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister's approval.  It has no duties, such as those imposed\r\n\r\non  private corporations registered under the Companies  Act;\r\n\r\nit  is not encumbered by the limitations of investments  that\r\n\r\nare  put  on  typical statutory bodies through  the  Trustees\r\n\r\nInvestments  Act;  all in all, a very powerful  animal,  made\r\n\r\nmore so perhaps by having protection from liability that goes\r\n\r\nbeyond  those provided for private companies.   Is  this  new\r\n\r\ntype of public corporation, armed with powers beyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  investment  powers of statutory bodies and  having  less\r\n\r\nrigorous    reporting    responsibilities    than     private\r\n\r\ncorporations,  the sign of things to come?  Who  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the office would be acting prudently and wisely?  I have\r\n\r\nreferred to the powers of IPOS, which are as extensive as its\r\n\r\nduties are onerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn to one that can be particularly troublesome\r\n\r\nin  its conception, in its scope and in its operation.   This\r\n\r\nis  the  power contained in clause 7(1)(c), \"to  accredit  or\r\n\r\ncertify  and regulate any person as an intellectual  property\r\n\r\nagent or intellectual property adviser\".  Taken together with\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"intellectual property adviser\",  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  the power given to IPOS may be extremely wide and could\r\n\r\nvery   well   be  unnecessary,  and  may  even  inhibit   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  IT industry.  An intellectual  property\r\n\r\nadviser is defined as \"Any person who, in the course  of  his\r\n\r\nprofession  or  business,  provides  legal  or  other  advice\r\n\r\nrelating  to any intellectual property\".  And the advice  can\r\n\r\nextend to IPRs outside of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, this definition is far too wide. It is\r\n\r\nlikely to be impossible for proper regulation or enforcement.\r\n\r\nIt  is also difficult to see what mischief this provision  is\r\n\r\naimed at.  It is not difficult to see that the definition  is\r\n\r\nreally  very wide.  Many professionals in the IT  field,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  would be caught by it, not just lawyers  practising\r\n\r\nIP law but, indeed, even a lawyer, who casually deals with  a\r\n\r\nsmall  IP  issue  as part of a bigger transaction,  would  be\r\n\r\ncaught.   A lawyer, who inserts an IP clause into a  contract\r\n\r\nof  employment,  may similarly be caught.  An  employer,  who\r\n\r\ntells  his  would-be  employee that all IP  rights  would  be\r\n\r\nassigned  to him so long as the employee works for him,  will\r\n\r\nbe  caught.  A software engineer, who informs his  team  that\r\n\r\nany  software  developed by them would  be  the  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty of the firm, will be caught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that there is a myriad of situations\r\n\r\nwhere  a  person  can  be  labelled an intellectual  property\r\n\r\nadviser  and who would therefore fall foul of the law  if  he\r\n\r\nwere  to  provide  any information or advice on  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty and he is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperly  registered.   Indeed, the information  officers  in\r\n\r\nIPOS themselves would be subject to the same regulations.  Is\r\n\r\nthis really the intention of the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention two especially problematic issues. First,\r\n\r\nsuch  a  wide provision means that all lawyers, who  are  all\r\n\r\npotentially  IP  advisers, would have to register  again,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to being subject to regulation by the Law  Society.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Is  there  some  special  concern,  some  interest  to\r\n\r\nprotect, that the Law Society, with its disciplinary  powers,\r\n\r\ncannot  take  care  of?   Why require lawyers  or,  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  engineers,  accountants  or  doctors,  who  are  all\r\n\r\nsubject to their respective professional bodies, to a further\r\n\r\nregistration  process under IPOS?  In fact, the intention  to\r\n\r\nregister  such advisers may be detrimental to the IT business\r\n\r\ngenerally.  It may also adversely affect foreign companies in\r\n\r\nthe  IT trade coming in, as their in-house advisers, be  they\r\n\r\nlegal   advisers  or  engineers,  would  also  have   to   be\r\n\r\nregistered.  And this may mean additional costs in setting up\r\n\r\nbusiness and, more importantly, perhaps perpetuate an unhappy\r\n\r\nimpression that Singapore is over-regulated.  I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  this is a step in the right direction, especially  when\r\n\r\nwe  are talking about creating a liberal creative environment\r\n\r\nfor  the  IT industry to prosper.  I accept that there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed to register intellectual property agents who are defined\r\n\r\ndifferently  in the Act.  These are the agents  who  have  to\r\n\r\ndraft    patent   applications,   trade   marks   or   design\r\n\r\napplications,  and for whom the responsibility  of  doing  an\r\n\r\naccurate application is particularly important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I generally support the rest of the Bill, I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  only  that  the part on regulating  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty advisers be removed.  If this cannot be done at this\r\n\r\nstage,  then  I would urge the Minister to assure  the  House\r\n\r\nthat  the  provision  would not  be  put  in  force  for  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future, at least until it is clearer why there is\r\n\r\na  need  to register intellectual property advisers  who  are\r\n\r\nalready regulated in their respective professions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8 of the Bill, the Minister can direct the\r\n\r\nOffice as to the performance of its functions and powers.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know whether the Minister  would,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ndirect  IPOS that no such register for IP advisers be set  up\r\n\r\nfor the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remain fully supportive of the need\r\n\r\nto have IPOS as an integral part of the proper development of\r\n\r\nthe  economy in Singapore.  IPOS will provide quality control\r\n\r\nin  terms of the personnel involved in the IT industry, guide\r\n\r\npolicy on the development of intellectual property rights  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and beyond, and promote the image of Singapore as a\r\n\r\nplace  where  intellectual property rights are protected  and\r\n\r\nwhere  creative people can prosper and reap the  benefits  of\r\n\r\ntheir creativity and hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, let me thank GPC\r\n\r\nChairman,  Prof.  Chin,  for supporting  the  Bill.   He  has\r\n\r\nexpressed some concerns which I will address one at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me clarify that IPOS is not in a unique\r\n\r\nsituation.   It is not a unique institution, because  it  has\r\n\r\nalso similar counterparts elsewhere in other countries.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  UK  Patents  Office  is  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nregistration of patents, designs and trade marks, as well  as\r\n\r\nfor the development of IPR policy generally.  Another example\r\n\r\nis  Hong  Kong.   Hong Kong also has an IP office  which  has\r\n\r\ntaken  on  the  administration of the whole  spectrum  of  IP\r\n\r\nrights  and  has also undertaken public awareness programmes.\r\n\r\nSo  we must also move as, in a sense, these are other centres\r\n\r\nwhich also want to create and develop a culture of IP.  It is\r\n\r\na competitive environment and Singapore must keep in step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next point is whether IPOS can handle the task.\r\n\r\nSir,  let  me assure the GPC Chairman that IPOS is poised  to\r\n\r\ntake on its enhanced role.  As I have mentioned in my speech,\r\n\r\nIPOS,  over  the  last  five years or  so,  has  indeed  been\r\n\r\nassuming more and more responsibilities.  In a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsense,  it  has been preparing itself for this new challenge.\r\n\r\nAs  I have said in my speech, for example, IPOS has taken  on\r\n\r\nan  active  role in the development of new IPR  policies  and\r\n\r\nlegislation.  The new Trade Marks Act, an entirely  new  Act,\r\n\r\nis  an  example.  The Copyright (Amendment) Act to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe   advent   of   electronic  commerce,  the   Geographical\r\n\r\nIndications  Act,  the Layout-Designs of Integrated  Circuits\r\n\r\nAct, and the Registered Designs Act, all these are very clear\r\n\r\nexamples.   So it has been actively involved in  helping  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law to formulate policies and draft  these  new\r\n\r\nActs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPOS has not just stayed within our shores, but it has\r\n\r\nalso  gone  into  joint  ventures  with  other  agencies   at\r\n\r\ninternational, regional and national levels, to increase  IPR\r\n\r\nawareness by organising workshops, seminars, exhibitions  and\r\n\r\ntraining  courses.  Some of these agencies include WIPO,  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Intellectual Property Organisation, the Japan  Patents\r\n\r\nOffice,  the European Patents Office, universities,  National\r\n\r\nScience  and  Technology Board, Trade Development  Board  and\r\n\r\nPSB.   IPOS,  in  addition, is one of the first  few  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  to have joined the Madrid Protocol, which allows  for\r\n\r\nthe international registration of trade marks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also mentioned some products and packages which\r\n\r\nIPOS  has  worked  with  industry to put  together  including\r\n\r\ncomputer  searches and, indeed, even a new portal called  the\r\n\r\nSurf   IP,   which  offers  a  holistic,  comprehensive   and\r\n\r\nintegrated  search for information on IP.  And  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat this is the first portal of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank Prof. Chin for pointing out that IPOS\r\n\r\nindeed  has  an enormous and difficult task ahead.   This  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  why IPOS needs to be given adequate resources  and\r\n\r\nthe flexibility to fulfil its new responsibilities.  And this\r\n\r\nis  precisely  why  we are converting IPOS into  a  statutory\r\n\r\nboard to give it the flexibility to develop its resources and\r\n\r\ncapabilities to meet these new challenges.  So, indeed,  IPOS\r\n\r\nwould have to do more.  I have outlined what it has done, and\r\n\r\nit has reached a certain stage.  But Prof. Chin is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabsolutely  right.  In order for it to be able to  carry  out\r\n\r\nits  functions effectively, it will do more.  It will do more\r\n\r\nin  terms of training its manpower, and gearing up its  staff\r\n\r\nto meet new challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just make one clarification. Prof. Chin says\r\n\r\nthat IPOS is not a statutory board.  It is a statutory board.\r\n\r\nIf he were to look at previous Bills on statutory boards, the\r\n\r\nphrase \"public corporation\" found in the explanatory note  is\r\n\r\na  standard  phrase  found in all such Bills.   So  it  is  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board in the usual sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the investment powers. The\r\n\r\nclause that Prof. Chin has mentioned on investment powers  in\r\n\r\nfact  reflects  the  result of a recent review  of  statutory\r\n\r\nboards'  investment powers.  They should be given the freedom\r\n\r\nto  maximise the investments of their own funds in  order  to\r\n\r\nrespond  effectively to changing investment  markets  and  to\r\n\r\nallow  them  to invest in new forms of investment  which  are\r\n\r\nappropriate for its purpose.  This clause is, in fact, a  new\r\n\r\nstandard clause adopted as a result of the review, and is not\r\n\r\nunique  to IPOS.  The same clause is found, in fact,  in  the\r\n\r\nother  two  statutory board Bills going  for  Second  Reading\r\n\r\ntoday,  ie, the Health Sciences Authority Bill and the Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board Bill.  But the point really is  that  having\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility of powers does not mean that it has full say\r\n\r\nwithout  any safeguards.  Safeguards are also important  and,\r\n\r\nindeed,  there are safeguards.  For example, their investment\r\n\r\npower will be subject to control by the board members of  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  who come from a wide range of  backgrounds.\r\n\r\nSo  these  people  would be culled from the  private  sector,\r\n\r\npublic   sector  and  academia  who  will  decide   on   what\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  make.  A further check would  be  that  this\r\n\r\ninvestment  power  would be subject to the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.   So, that is a key safeguard.  Furthermore,  there\r\n\r\nare  the  usual audit provisions, and IPOS has to  submit  an\r\n\r\nannual report to Parliament every year.  As Members know,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and if Members so desire, further  questions  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  asked  in  this  House about  IPOS,  including  its\r\n\r\naccounts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  investments.  This is something which private  companies\r\n\r\nwould not be subject to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with Prof. Chin's main point. Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  has expressed concern about the wide powers of IPOS  to\r\n\r\nregulate intellectual property advisers.  Let me address  his\r\n\r\nconcern  and  put  it  in context.  First,  let  me  describe\r\n\r\nbriefly the work that is being done now on the creation of  a\r\n\r\nnew patent agent profession.  This will help put the issue in\r\n\r\ncontext.   This  move  is  needed to  ensure  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ndevelops  a  sufficiently strong patent agent  profession  to\r\n\r\nprovide  support  services to the industry  in  the  area  of\r\n\r\nintellectual  property.  This is in line with our  vision  of\r\n\r\nbecoming  a competitive and knowledge-based economy,  capable\r\n\r\nof  attracting  innovators  to  create,  and  innovators  and\r\n\r\ninvestors  to register and trade their products and  services\r\n\r\nwith   the   assurance  of  a  strong  intellectual  property\r\n\r\ninfrastructure here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the proposal will be announced soon. But\r\n\r\nI  can  inform the House that, so far, 40 persons or so  have\r\n\r\nalready  signed up for the NUS' IP Law Course.  So  it  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  keen  activity.  People want to come on-board  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   the  vast  majority  are  non-lawyers,  people   with\r\n\r\nscientific  background preparing themselves for qualification\r\n\r\nas  patent agents under the new proposal.  In formulating the\r\n\r\nproposals, IPOS consulted extensively with the Law Society of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the  Singapore  group  of  the   Asian   Patents\r\n\r\nAttorneys'  Association, and the International Federation  of\r\n\r\nIntellectual  Property Attorneys.  Apart from patent  agents,\r\n\r\nlet  me say that there are no plans for IPOS to regulate  any\r\n\r\nother  intellectual  property related  professionals  in  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like all Acts of Parliament, this piece of\r\n\r\nlegislation will be in our statute books for many years.   We\r\n\r\nshould therefore ensure that the Bill provides IPOS with  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  mandate to promote the development of  professions\r\n\r\nand to advise the Government on measures to be taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerning  these professions, not only to cater  to  present\r\n\r\nneeds, but also to deal with future needs that cannot now  be\r\n\r\nall foreseen.  Why do I say this?  I think this is especially\r\n\r\nimportant in an area as fast moving as intellectual property.\r\n\r\nThese  vast  developments are now bringing  us  into  largely\r\n\r\nuncharted  waters whose tributaries may lead us to  limitless\r\n\r\nand  exciting discoveries in diverse areas such as cyber law,\r\n\r\ninformation technology law, bio-sciences, bio-technology  and\r\n\r\nlife  sciences.   Therefore, in crafting this  law,  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken  a  forward-looking and long-term approach  to  provide\r\n\r\nIPOS with the necessary mandate to promote the development of\r\n\r\nIP-related   professions  and  to   advise   the   Government\r\n\r\naccordingly as the state of these professions can affect  the\r\n\r\nquality of our intellectual property infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin may be right that the term \"intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty adviser\" is very wide, and is a term that is used to\r\n\r\ndescribe the full range of IP-related professions.  The  idea\r\n\r\nis  to  give  IPOS the mandate to promote and  develop  these\r\n\r\nprofessions.   I  think  that is the point,  ie,  not  to  be\r\n\r\nrestrictive or to curtail, but to bring in the flexibility as\r\n\r\nand  when the need may arise.  We do not see that arising  in\r\n\r\nthe  foreseeable future, to have a profession that will  push\r\n\r\nthe  industry  forward, like what we  are  doing  for  patent\r\n\r\nagents.   There  is certainly no intention in  the  immediate\r\n\r\nfuture   to   put   in   place   a   regulatory   regime   to\r\n\r\nindiscriminately  cover  all IP-related  professions  by  one\r\n\r\nstroke of the pen.  Any proposal to regulate any type of  IP-related  professionals will be tightly focused and  carefully\r\n\r\ntargeted at the relevant segment and would only be introduced\r\n\r\nfor  the  good  of the industry, not to its detriment.   Like\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  described, the whole manner in which  we  have\r\n\r\napproached  the  formation of patent agents as  a  profession\r\n\r\nwhich  involves not only lawyers - I think Prof. Chin's focus\r\n\r\nwas on lawyers - but indeed when a new profession is created,\r\n\r\nother people would also benefit because they would have  more\r\n\r\nwork  to  do,  they  would be able to be involved  in  a  new\r\n\r\ncapacity in the development of IP in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members of this House and the legal\r\n\r\nprofession  that  should  the need  ever  arise  to  consider\r\n\r\nregulating    other    types   of    intellectual    property\r\n\r\nprofessionals, the Law Society and all other relevant parties\r\n\r\nwould  be  consulted in the formation of any  new  regulatory\r\n\r\nmechanism,  just  as  what we have done  in  formulating  our\r\n\r\nproposals in the patent agent profession.  I am sure that  at\r\n\r\nthat  time, the concerns that have been raised by Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nin this House would be addressed. Sir,  my  officials  have,  in  fact,  also  met  with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Law Society to explain  the  rationale\r\n\r\nfor these provisions and to assuage their concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I am heartened that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State  has given  the  answers  about  not\r\n\r\nregistering intellectual property advisers straightaway.  But\r\n\r\nI  would  just  like to ask for a clarification.   Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State not confirm that neither  the  UK  Patent\r\n\r\nOffice nor the Hong Kong equivalent actually has the width of\r\n\r\npowers  that  are now being conferred on IPOS?  For  example,\r\n\r\nthere  has never been any suggestion in either Hong  Kong  or\r\n\r\nthe   UK   that  there  should  be  any  attempt  to  control\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  advisers  as  distinct  from   patent\r\n\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, that could very well be\r\n\r\nso.  But I think in the Singapore context, because we want to\r\n\r\nmove  ahead, we are in this hub, we are in this region  where\r\n\r\nwe   have   recognised  IP  as  an  important  industry   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment, we want to create an IPOS which should be  given\r\n\r\nthe  powers,  to push the frontiers.  But, as I have  assured\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House and the GPC Chairman, groundwork  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done and indeed I am sure the Ministry of Law  and  the\r\n\r\nnew   Director  would  ensure  that  the  powers   would   be\r\n\r\neffectively carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc.

The objective of the Bill  is  to  provide\r\n\r\nthe  legislative  framework for  the  formation  of  the  new\r\n\r\nstatutory board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain the rationale for the formation of\r\n\r\nthe statutory board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health of Singaporeans today is good. We have done\r\n\r\nquite  well by any parameter.  Our infant mortality  rate  of\r\n\r\nfour deaths per thousand live births, maternal mortality rate\r\n\r\nof  0.1  per thousand live births and still births  and  life\r\n\r\nexpectancy  at birth of 78 years are comparable to  those  in\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.  We have made significant  progress  in\r\n\r\nimproving  the  health of Singaporeans in many areas  through\r\n\r\nour health promotion and disease prevention programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with the children. Our children represent\r\n\r\nthe  future  of Singapore.  We need to ensure the health  and\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  our young.  We have done well in  this  area.\r\n\r\nThe National Childhood Immunisation Programme has resulted in\r\n\r\nthe  elimination  of  severe  infectious  diseases,  such  as\r\n\r\ndiphtheria and poliomyelitis. We have also reduced  childhood\r\n\r\ntuberculosis, whooping cough, measles, mumps,  rubella  to  a\r\n\r\nvery low level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our comprehensive School Health Programme of health\r\n\r\nscreening, immunisation, dental care and health education has\r\n\r\ncontributed to the good health of our young.  However,  there\r\n\r\nare one or two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngaps  that  we  need  to  plug.  For  example,  many  of  our\r\n\r\nsecondary  school students who were born before we introduced\r\n\r\nHepatitis  B immunisation for babies, have not been immunised\r\n\r\nagainst  Hepatitis B and are at risk of Hepatitis B infection\r\n\r\nand  liver cancer. We have therefore taken action to  address\r\n\r\nthis.   Earlier  this month, we implemented the  Hepatitis  B\r\n\r\nimmunisation   programme   for  students.    This   four-year\r\n\r\nprogramme  will  cover  over 300,000  students  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  junior  colleges,  centralised  institutes,   ITEs,\r\n\r\npolytechnics,   universities  and  our   full-time   national\r\n\r\nservicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have a comprehensive dental health\r\n\r\nprogramme  for primary schools.  Every primary school  has  a\r\n\r\ndental  clinic where dental health screening and basic dental\r\n\r\ntreatment  is  done.  However, the  programme  for  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  is less comprehensive. As a result, the dental health\r\n\r\nstatus  of  our secondary school students is not as  good  as\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  primary  school students.   We  are  therefore\r\n\r\nworking  with  the  Ministry  of Education  to  build  dental\r\n\r\nclinics in secondary schools so that our students can benefit\r\n\r\nfrom having dental care on site in their schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defective vision or myopia among school children has\r\n\r\ncontinued to increase from an overall rate of 43% in 1990  to\r\n\r\n51% in 1999.  The rate among Primary 1 children has increased\r\n\r\nfrom  19% to 30% over the same period.  We therefore need  to\r\n\r\nimplement measures to arrest and reverse this trend  as  high\r\n\r\nmyopia is associated with potentially blinding conditions  in\r\n\r\nlater  life.  Sir, although we have done well in  our  school\r\n\r\nprogrammes, much still needs to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the adults and the elderly, however, there are\r\n\r\nsome  areas  where we are not doing so well,  such  as  heart\r\n\r\ndisease, stroke and cancer.  Although the incidence of  heart\r\n\r\nattacks  has decreased from 94 per 100,000 in 1990 to  88  in\r\n\r\n1998,  our  death  rate  of  76 per 100,000  population  from\r\n\r\ncoronary heart disease is higher than the rates of 58 and  60\r\n\r\nper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100,000 in Canada and Australia respectively.  Similarly, our\r\n\r\ndeath  rate of 29 per 100,000 from stroke is higher than  the\r\n\r\nrate of 14 per 100,000 in both Canada and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These diseases often strike people in the prime of their\r\n\r\nlife,  resulting in premature mortality or severe disability.\r\n\r\nThis  results  in both economic and social burden  for  their\r\n\r\nfamily and the nation.  Fortunately, studies have shown  that\r\n\r\nthese conditions are preventable.  The lifestyle related risk\r\n\r\nfactors  of  these  diseases, such  as  physical  inactivity,\r\n\r\nunhealthy  diet,  smoking, obesity, high blood  pressure  and\r\n\r\nhigh blood cholesterol can be controlled.  Reduction of these\r\n\r\nrisk factors can improve the health of the individual and  of\r\n\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must improve the health of our adult population by\r\n\r\nfocusing  our efforts on the areas that we are not  doing  so\r\n\r\nwell,  otherwise,  although Singaporeans are  living  longer,\r\n\r\ntheir  quality of life in their autumn years may actually  be\r\n\r\nquite  poor  due  to  ill  health.   Singaporeans  must  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their own health. They must adopt  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyles,  go  for  health  screening  to  detect   chronic\r\n\r\ndiseases early and if they have chronic diseases, they should\r\n\r\ngo  for treatment and regular follow-up.  Unless Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntake   health  education,  health  promotion  and  prevention\r\n\r\nseriously,  many  Singaporeans will live the  last  years  of\r\n\r\ntheir life burdened with ill health and disability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other areas of concerns, such as breast cancer\r\n\r\nand  osteoporosis.  Breast cancer is the leading cancer among\r\n\r\nwomen in Singapore today.  The incidence of breast cancer has\r\n\r\nmore  than  doubled over the last 30 years.   A  study  among\r\n\r\nwomen  showed  that they are not well informed  about  breast\r\n\r\ncancer  and  its  risks.   They  are  also  not  aware   that\r\n\r\nmammography  is effective for the early detection  of  breast\r\n\r\ncancer and for improving the survival rate. Again, much  more\r\n\r\nneeds to be done in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osteoporosis or brittle bones is a disease of old age.\r\n\r\nIt  is  associated  with higher risk  of  hip  fractures  and\r\n\r\nresults in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsignificant  morbidity  and  mortality.   The  rate  of   hip\r\n\r\nfractures has risen by 38% from 42 cases per 100,000 in  1990\r\n\r\nto  58  cases per 100,000 in 1999.  With an aging population,\r\n\r\nthe  number of hip fractures is expected to increase,  giving\r\n\r\nrise  to much ill health, disability and suffering.   As  the\r\n\r\nbuild-up  of bone mass reaches its peak by about 30 years  of\r\n\r\nage,  we need to ensure that measures to prevent osteoporosis\r\n\r\nstart from the young and continue throughout life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to embark on a more focused integrated and\r\n\r\nconcentrated approach to get the health outcomes we want. The\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of the Health Promotion Board will  provide  the\r\n\r\nframework for a greater focus on these major health  problems\r\n\r\nand  spearhead  health  education, promotion  and  prevention\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  create  a supportive environment  to  tackle\r\n\r\nthese  and other health problems in children, adults and  the\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Promotion Board will work in collaboration\r\n\r\nwith  public, private and community organisations to  develop\r\n\r\nand  sustain national efforts to manage these problems.  This\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  close  partnerships  with  other  agencies  and\r\n\r\norganisations will enable the Health Promotion Board to reach\r\n\r\nout  to all Singaporeans in various settings and to reinforce\r\n\r\nthe messages in many different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the Health Promotion Board will also\r\n\r\nensure   more   efficient  use  of  financial  and   manpower\r\n\r\nresources,  and  strengthen the capacity  and  capability  to\r\n\r\ndevelop,  implement, monitor and evaluate  these  programmes.\r\n\r\nThe  Board  will  focus on outcomes and  standards  and  will\r\n\r\nprovide the impetus to ensure that results, especially in the\r\n\r\nproblem areas, are achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not touch on the main features\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III, clause 11, sets out the functions, objects and\r\n\r\nduties of the Board which are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to advise the Government on all matters connected\r\n\r\nwith the promotion of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  health  and  health lifestyles amongst  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to organise and implement effective health\r\n\r\neducation  programmes and other activities  to  promote  good\r\n\r\nhealth  and  healthy  lifestyles and to  prevent  and  detect\r\n\r\ndiseases;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to determine, establish and recommend standards and\r\n\r\nguidelines on diet and nutrition to encourage healthy  eating\r\n\r\nhabits; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to provide medical, dental, health screening and\r\n\r\nimmunisation services to school children and other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII, clause 42 of the Bill covers the consequential\r\n\r\namendments made to the Infectious Diseases and Dentists Acts,\r\n\r\nportions  of which will now be administered by the  Board  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the provisions in the Bill are the standard\r\n\r\nprovisions found in all statutory board Bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing new challenges in the pattern of\r\n\r\ndiseases in Singapore.  The formation of the Health Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  will  enable  us  to  focus on  and  spearhead  health\r\n\r\neducation, health promotion and disease prevention programmes\r\n\r\nto meet these challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nstand  to  support the Health Promotion Board  Bill.   It  is\r\n\r\ntimely  and significant indeed, if by setting up this  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board,  there can be more emphasis  put  into  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of good health and healthy lifestyles amongst  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, as stated in clause  11  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nregarding functions, objects and duties of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national healthcare expenditure, which formed about\r\n\r\n2.7% of Singapore's GDP in 1996, had increased to 3.1% of GDP\r\n\r\nin 1999.  This amounted to $4.4 billion or $1,370 per capita.\r\n\r\nThis amount is projected to increase to 7% of GDP in 2030\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor about $10 billion.  Sir, the best remedy to reduce medical\r\n\r\nhealthcare  demands is to ensure that people  live  healthily\r\n\r\nfor  as  long as possible, through preventive means and  thus\r\n\r\nrequiring  less medical care.  It is thus vital to have  good\r\n\r\nand   successful  promotion  of  good  health   and   healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 11(1)(d), there is mention to monitor and\r\n\r\nconduct investigations and research. I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nMinister  to ensure that the Health Promotion Board  urgently\r\n\r\nconcentrates on epidemiological studies of diseases that  are\r\n\r\nmost  pressing  and prevalent in our population  at  present.\r\n\r\nFor  example, apart from the commonest diseases, we also need\r\n\r\nto  evaluate  and  recommend preventive measures  to  address\r\n\r\npneumonia,  which  is  the fourth major  cause  of  death  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another example is the incidence of falls amongst\r\n\r\nour  elderly.  Falls amongst them not only can  be  fatal  at\r\n\r\ntimes  but  they can invariably cause the elderly to  end  up\r\n\r\nrequiring  extensive  medical care.  Efforts  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nincidence  of  falls through having better campaigns,  better\r\n\r\ninformation  on  how  to prevent falls  and  better  elderly-friendly environment are essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether there is a need to\r\n\r\nmention  pro-active actions towards preventive care  in  this\r\n\r\nBill?   For example, now that the prevalence of breast cancer\r\n\r\nis highest for cancers in women, as mentioned by the Minister\r\n\r\nearlier,  it is essential to increase the screening of  women\r\n\r\nto  prevent many of them from end-stage cancers.   Also,  the\r\n\r\nproblem of getting at those chronic-disease sufferers that do\r\n\r\nnot  go for long-term preventive medications that can prevent\r\n\r\ndisasters  like strokes, cardiovascular diseases  and  kidney\r\n\r\nfailures, must be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the constitution of the Board in clause 5, may I\r\n\r\nask  if  there is a need to specify the qualification of  the\r\n\r\nmembers, and especially of the Chairman, as only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersons  with  a  medical  or other  professional  degree  is\r\n\r\neligible to be so appointed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4(1) provides that the common seal may be broken,\r\n\r\nchanged, altered or made anew as the Board thinks fit.   Sir,\r\n\r\nif there are such possibilities, then one may have to include\r\n\r\na  subsection to the effect that all instruments affixed with\r\n\r\na broken, changed or altered common seal will nevertheless be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  have  been validly executed  and  sealed  if  the\r\n\r\nexecution and seal are carried out and affixed in the  proper\r\n\r\nmanner as prescribed in this section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 9(4), does \"majority of votes\" mean 51% by\r\n\r\nshow  of  hands  of  members present?  What  happens  if  the\r\n\r\nquestions   to   be   decided  by   votes   involve   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration such as disposal of the Board's property or any\r\n\r\ndealings  between members and the Board involving substantial\r\n\r\namounts  of money, etc?  Is there a need to provide  that  at\r\n\r\nleast  75% majority votes are required when a decision is  to\r\n\r\nbe made for such important or serious issues?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 covers the disclosure of interest of members.\r\n\r\nIn  clause 10(1), it appears that disclosure can only be made\r\n\r\n\"at  a  meeting of the Board\".  What if there is  no  meeting\r\n\r\nheld  and  a  disclosure is needed to be made urgently?   Can\r\n\r\ndisclosure be made to the Board in writing when there  is  no\r\n\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 15(3), what if the Chief Executive is\r\n\r\nincompetent or commits an offence that makes him/her unfit to\r\n\r\nbe  Chief  Executive?  This clause does not seem  to  include\r\n\r\nthese possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 28, dealing with the powers of\r\n\r\nthe  auditors, gives the impression that the Ministry is very\r\n\r\nconcerned about financial matters and hence has given a  very\r\n\r\nwide  power (with no limitation or restriction) to  auditors.\r\n\r\nIt  appears  that any such person may be required to  furnish\r\n\r\ninformation, including confidential information, as  long  as\r\n\r\nthey  relate  to accounts or finances.  Sir, it is  submitted\r\n\r\nthat  some form of control or limitation must be included  to\r\n\r\nprevent any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabuse  of  power by auditors and some limits must be  set  on\r\n\r\ndocuments  that may be accessed or copied by auditors  or  at\r\n\r\nleast the auditors may be required to exercise reasonableness\r\n\r\nor   have  a  duty  to  keep  all  documents  or  information\r\n\r\nconfidential.  Although clause 39 deals with preservation  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy, it appears that clause 39 imposes duty only  on  the\r\n\r\nmember,  officer,  employee or an agent  of  the  Board,  and\r\n\r\nauditors are intentionally excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40 deals with the composition of offences. May I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister why the Chief Executive may  compound  any\r\n\r\noffence by collecting from a person \"reasonably suspected of\"\r\n\r\nhaving  committed  the offence a sum of money  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$1,000?  Sir, why should a person who is merely a suspect  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  pay a composition fine?  It is hence  suggested\r\n\r\nthat these words \"reasonably suspected of\" be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Health will take into\r\n\r\nconsideration  my  aforesaid comments.  Sir,  I  support  the\r\n\r\nHealth Promotion Board Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I hope that this new Board can do a  better  job\r\n\r\nthan its five other predecessors, namely, the National Health\r\n\r\nEducation Department, Department of Nutrition, School  Health\r\n\r\nService,  School Dental Service and Health Promotion Division\r\n\r\n(Administration).   The  functions  of  the  five   mentioned\r\n\r\ndepartments,  I suppose, are basically also to  promote  good\r\n\r\nhealth and healthy lifestyles among\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.  But they do not appear to have done\r\n\r\na  particularly  good job.  Take, for example,  the  campaign\r\n\r\nagainst  smoking.  Smoking is something bad.  It causes  lung\r\n\r\ncancer  and  increases  the chances of smokers  having  heart\r\n\r\nproblems.   Many  public policies have  been  implemented  to\r\n\r\nreduce or eliminate smoking among Singaporeans.  Yet, we read\r\n\r\nin  the  press  that smoking is on the rise among  our  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially young female Singaporeans.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat this newly-formed Health Promotion Board can do a better\r\n\r\njob than its predecessors and reduce the number of smokers in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been promoting good health and\r\n\r\nhealthy  lifestyles  among Singaporeans for  many  years  but\r\n\r\nsomehow  major diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases,\r\n\r\ndiabetes  mellitus, have been on the rise.   Cancer  has  now\r\n\r\nbecome the number one killer in Singapore.  It has edged  out\r\n\r\ncoronary heart disease to take the number one spot among  the\r\n\r\nmajor  killer diseases.  Diabetes, although it is  the  sixth\r\n\r\nleading  cause  of death in Singapore in 1999,  can  be  very\r\n\r\ndebilitating for those who suffer from it.  I hope the Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  can  promote better healthy  lifestyles  to\r\n\r\nreduce   the   incidence  of  this  dreadful  disease   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, one of the main killers is coronary disease.\r\n\r\nThe  people there realise the seriousness of this problem and\r\n\r\nhave  taken steps to stop smoking and cut down on their  meat\r\n\r\ndiet  and  replace it with more vegetables.  Many  have  even\r\n\r\ngone on to be vegetarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the main killer is cancer. Cancer is a\r\n\r\ndiet-related  disease.  I should like to see  the  Government\r\n\r\nallocate  more  funds  to  the  Health  Promotion  Board   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate and do research on our local food to see if there\r\n\r\nis  something in our food we eat which causes cancer  in  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  for  example,  like monosodium  glutamate  (MSG)\r\n\r\nwhich  is widely used as a cheap addictive by our restaurants\r\n\r\nand hawkers to enhance the taste of their food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I would like to see the Board do is to\r\n\r\ngive more dental aid not only to school children but also  to\r\n\r\nadult  Singaporeans.  I see that there are  many  polyclinics\r\n\r\nwhere  adult  Singaporeans can see a doctor at  a  subsidised\r\n\r\nrate.    The  Government  should  do  the  same  for   dental\r\n\r\ntreatment.   At  the moment, there appears to be  not  enough\r\n\r\nGovernment  dental clinics.  The waiting time  for  a  dental\r\n\r\nappointment  at  a Government dental clinic  is  about  three\r\n\r\nmonths.   I  think  this is too long.   A  worker  cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to visit a private dentist because the charges  are\r\n\r\nbeyond  him.   As a result, I see too many Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\nbad  teeth.   Without a reasonable availability of subsidised\r\n\r\ndental  treatments,  we  shall  see  more  and  more  of  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with bad teeth.  I hope that the Government  can\r\n\r\nprovide affordable dental treatments widely to our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Bill.  Before that, I would like to  advise  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  to inform the particular workers to go to NTUC  Dental\r\n\r\nCare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1998, the National Trades Union Congress has taken\r\n\r\nthe  initiative  to work with companies to set  up  workplace\r\n\r\nhealth programmes.  These programmes have two key objectives.\r\n\r\nOne is to help prevent workers from running into hardship  as\r\n\r\nillnesses  can cost job losses and increase health  expenses.\r\n\r\nTwo,  it  helps companies save medical cost by keeping  their\r\n\r\nworkforce  healthy.  The companies' bottomline  will  improve\r\n\r\nand  the workers get better wages.  The ultimate goal  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that our workers enjoy a better life with healthy body\r\n\r\nand healthy mind.  We understand that health affects our work\r\n\r\nperformance,  earning  capacity and our  employability.   Job\r\n\r\ncreation, job security and good wages will be meaningless  if\r\n\r\nthe  workers  are unable to enjoy the benefits  due  to  poor\r\n\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, as mentioned by the Minister, most deaths\r\n\r\nin  Singapore were caused by infectious diseases.  Today,  it\r\n\r\nis the lifestyle diseases that take the greatest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoll  -  heart illnesses, cancer and stroke.  It is pertinent\r\n\r\nthat now all the tripartite social partners work more closely\r\n\r\nto  help  our employees reduce the risk factors in developing\r\n\r\nall these diseases and illnesses.  The National Health Survey\r\n\r\ndone  by the Ministry of Health in 1998 found that the  level\r\n\r\nof  high  blood  cholesterol and high  blood  pressure  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   has   increased.   The  survey   showed   that\r\n\r\nhypertension  was  more common among the  elderly  workers  - 49.5%  of those aged between 50 and 59, that is half of  this\r\n\r\nage group, and 64.3% for those aged 60 to 69.  It is alarming\r\n\r\nbecause  hypertension increases kidney disease risk  and,  on\r\n\r\naverage,  a  person with high blood pressure is  seven  times\r\n\r\nmore  likely to suffer a stroke.  This means that  there  are\r\n\r\nmore than 655,000 stroke candidates here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is said that a good worker works\r\n\r\nhard.  In today's workplace, our workers are working so  hard\r\n\r\nthat they have been taking their health for granted.  Company\r\n\r\npolicies  and  programmes at work to  improve  the  physical,\r\n\r\nsocial  and  emotional well-being of employees  now  play  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly important role.  If health care costs go up, the\r\n\r\ncompany's competitiveness will be adversely affected.   As  a\r\n\r\nfirm  believer of prevention is better than cure,  I  welcome\r\n\r\nthe  move by the Government to establish the Health Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  (HPB)  as a statutory board to better promote  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyle  and  good health for all.  It is appropriate  that\r\n\r\nthe Government now intensifies its effort in health promotion\r\n\r\nand   preventive  health  care.   Like  the   PSB   for   the\r\n\r\nproductivity movement, I hope the HPB will be a champion  for\r\n\r\ngood  health  for all and to provide more resources  to  help\r\n\r\nimprove  the  health  of  our workers  and  spare  them  from\r\n\r\nunnecessary medical expenses.  Today, unlike the  babies  and\r\n\r\nthe   young   Singaporeans  who  are  students  or   national\r\n\r\nservicemen,  our  working adults are  not  provided  with  or\r\n\r\nsubjected to any structured health programmes.  Our employers\r\n\r\nat  the  same time also tend to be more concerned  about  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  medical  treatments  only,  rather  than  proactive\r\n\r\nprogrammes to improve their workers' health.  The idea  of  a\r\n\r\nworkplace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhealth promotion is still relatively new in Singapore and  it\r\n\r\nhas not yet taken root in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to do more in this area to make\r\n\r\nour   workers  healthier  and  happier.   We  have  no  other\r\n\r\nalternative.  Our workforce, which is the world's number one,\r\n\r\nis the nation's best asset we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  the  three Members for their support of the  Bill.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  are  all agreed that the intention of  the  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion Board Bill is to provide the framework to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to take better care of their health and this  is\r\n\r\nthe  approach  that  the  Board  will  undertake.   They  are\r\n\r\nsystematically looking at the 10 most common causes of  death\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  analyse each disease, try to understand  what\r\n\r\ncauses  the incidence of disease and then work out a strategy\r\n\r\nto  try  and  bring down the incidence.  Take,  for  example,\r\n\r\ncancer.   The incidence of cancer is indeed rising, primarily\r\n\r\ndue  to  two main reasons.  First, because our population  is\r\n\r\ngetting older and therefore many cancers related to an ageing\r\n\r\npopulation are now on the rise.  Second, there are also  many\r\n\r\ntypes  of cancer related to lifestyle that are more prevalent\r\n\r\nnow than 10 or 20 years ago.  So we are seeing a shift in the\r\n\r\npattern of diseases.  In particular, breast cancer is on  the\r\n\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each of the cancer types, the Board would\r\n\r\ndevise  strategies to deal with them.  For breast cancer,  we\r\n\r\nare going to set up mammography facility in every polyclinic.\r\n\r\nBut  the  key  is to get Singaporean women to go  for  breast\r\n\r\nscreening.   This requires both education, promotion  and  to\r\n\r\nget  the women to act upon awareness, and not just know  that\r\n\r\nbreast  cancer  is  a  rising  disease  and  mammography   is\r\n\r\nimportant, but, more importantly, to get them to act  and  go\r\n\r\nfor  the  screening.  Second, coronary diseases and diabetes.\r\n\r\nThese are related to lifestyle and therefore the messages  we\r\n\r\nput  out to the children, the adults and the elderly are very\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes is a condition that can be managed. What we\r\n\r\nneed is to screen the people, particularly, the elderly.   If\r\n\r\nthey know that they have a diabetic condition, they will take\r\n\r\nactive  steps  to manage this and mitigate the  complications\r\n\r\nthat may arise due to diabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also mentioned pneumonia. We are studying\r\n\r\nthis.  Also, the problem of elderly falling.  This is related\r\n\r\nto  what I mentioned earlier about osteoporosis.  It  is  not\r\n\r\njust  building up the bone mass when we are young,  but  also\r\n\r\ntaking part in exercises so that the bone structure continues\r\n\r\nto be strengthened.  But, as Dr Lily Neo stressed, we need  a\r\n\r\nmore  holistic  approach to also make sure we  have  non-skid\r\n\r\nfloors  and less barriers in the design of our walkways.   So\r\n\r\nHDB  will  undertake  all  these in  conjunction  with  other\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong made the comment that he hopes that\r\n\r\nthe  Board  would do a better job, implying that the  current\r\n\r\ndepartments are not doing a sufficiently good job.  The  idea\r\n\r\nof  creating the Board is of course to do a better  job,  but\r\n\r\nnot  to  cast  a  judgement on the present departments.   The\r\n\r\npresent  departments are doing a commendable  job.   What  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  do with the Health Promotion Board is to make  sure\r\n\r\nthese  efforts  are  integrated  and  more  focused  on   the\r\n\r\nchildren,  adults  and  elderly  in  different  settings,  in\r\n\r\nschools, institutions, at the workplace and in the community.\r\n\r\nBy  putting  the five departments together and by integrating\r\n\r\nthe  efforts and by focusing on each disease, we hope  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to achieve better outcomes based on the strategies  for\r\n\r\neach disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dental health, I hope when Mr Chiam said that he saw\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans with bad teeth, he is not doing  so  in  a\r\n\r\nprofessional   capacity.   Indeed,  the  dental   health   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is improving.  We have statistics on  children's\r\n\r\ndental  health status when they are seven, 13  and  19  years\r\n\r\nold.  The number of cavities has reduced.   Therefore, we are\r\n\r\nmonitoring  very closely the dental health of our population.\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, many dentists would tell you that  in  fact  the\r\n\r\nvolume of business has gone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  because  they  are seeing fewer and fewer  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith bad teeth.  The dental health of our population, by  and\r\n\r\nlarge, is definitely improving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that we should do more in the campaign against\r\n\r\nsmoking.  But I must emphasise that smoking is addictive  and\r\n\r\nthe trick is to prevent the teenagers from taking up smoking.\r\n\r\nOnce  they  smoke and if they do so regularly in their  early\r\n\r\nyears,  then they will be addicted and they will  be  hooked.\r\n\r\nWe  are tracking the incidence of smoking.  By and large, the\r\n\r\nincidence  of smoking in Singapore, as a whole, is  dropping.\r\n\r\nBut I do agree that the incidence for young females is rising\r\n\r\nwhich is a cause for concern.  Therefore, one of the tasks of\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Promotion  Board is to target  the  anti-smoking\r\n\r\ncampaign  at  these vulnerable groups - the  younger  people,\r\n\r\nincluding the younger females.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang emphasised about the importance of\r\n\r\nhealth promotion among the workforce.  This is one of the new\r\n\r\nstrategies that we are embarking to promote workplace  health\r\n\r\npromotion programme.  We recognise that the younger people in\r\n\r\nschools  and institutions of higher learning provide us  with\r\n\r\nan  institutional  setting for which we  can  conduct  health\r\n\r\npromotion,  health education and prevention programmes.   But\r\n\r\nonce  they  go  into the workforce, there  is  less  of  this\r\n\r\ndirected  effort  at  the  workforce.   Therefore,  we   have\r\n\r\nembarked  on  this  workplace health promotion  programme  to\r\n\r\nbring  what  we  are  doing  in the  schools  also  to  every\r\n\r\nworkplace.  We are more successful in the community  than  in\r\n\r\nthe  workplace.   So  one  of the priorities  of  the  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion Board is to direct their efforts at the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the key issues that the Health Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard, when set up, will deal with.  Let me next turn to some\r\n\r\nof  the  administrative provisions in the Bill which Dr  Lily\r\n\r\nNeo  pointed  out.   These  are  standard  provisions.   But,\r\n\r\nnonetheless, since she raised them, it is worth my  while  to\r\n\r\nclarify  them.  First, on the qualification of the  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors.  We do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  we should restrict the board of  directors  to\r\n\r\njust  medical  or  professional  people.   The  Board  should\r\n\r\nencompass  a wide range of Singaporeans - those who  can  add\r\n\r\nvalue  to the Board, whether they are educationists,  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are people from the media that can help us promote  and\r\n\r\ndeliver  the  messages - who can in fact  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the conduct of the Board, like most statutory\r\n\r\nboards, the conduct would be based on the majority vote,  and\r\n\r\nnot  requiring 75% vote for serious issues.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  Member that for serious issues involving  larger\r\n\r\nsums  of  money, the Board would comply with proper financial\r\n\r\nprocedures  which  would  require  approval  by   a   certain\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  the  Board  as well as  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On disclosure of interests of members, this is a\r\n\r\nstandard  provision.   Most board members  meet  together  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  projects and papers, and that is a  convenient  time\r\n\r\nfor them to indicate their disclosure.  However, if there  is\r\n\r\na project or decision paper that is done through circulation,\r\n\r\nthen  the board members can indicate the disclosure of  their\r\n\r\ninterest through writing and circulation as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the powers of the auditor, again, this is a standard\r\n\r\nprovision.   The powers given to the auditor is necessary  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that they conduct effective audit of  the  Board.\r\n\r\nThe   auditor   would  be  appointed  by  the  Ministry,   in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the Auditor-General.  On appointment,  the\r\n\r\nauditor  or his representative would be required to  sign  an\r\n\r\nundertaking   to   safeguard   official   information.     So\r\n\r\nconfidentiality will be safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on the use of the Board's seal. This\r\n\r\nis  a standard provision.  The provision allows the Board  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  seal to affix on to important documents and, if  the\r\n\r\nBoard wishes, it could break the seal, amend and create a new\r\n\r\nseal.  I would like to assure Dr Lily Neo that even though  a\r\n\r\nnew seal may be created, any document that is sealed with the\r\n\r\nold  seal  will continue to be valid as long as the  seal  is\r\n\r\napplied in the correct manner by the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also made the point about composition of\r\n\r\noffences.    The  provision  to  compound  offences   is   an\r\n\r\nadministrative way in which we give the offender  the  option\r\n\r\nto compound it by paying a composition fine.  If the offender\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want  to  accept the composition,  then  the  full\r\n\r\nprocess of the law would take its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Dr Lily Neo that these are all the\r\n\r\nstandard  provisions  in setting up  a  statutory  board.   I\r\n\r\nrecognise  her concerns and these concerns are  duly  catered\r\n\r\nfor in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek clarification, Sir? I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  clarify  that I did not ask for specific  types  of\r\n\r\nqualified  people  in the medical board.  I  only  asked  for\r\n\r\ntheir  qualifications,  be  it  medical  or  others,  to   be\r\n\r\nspecified  in  the  Bill.   The Minister  earlier  said  that\r\n\r\nmammography  will  be made available to all  polyclinics.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask him whether this facility is  operational\r\n\r\nnow.   Could  I also ask the Minister whether representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  the  other Ministries can be made available  with  this\r\n\r\nHealth  Promotion  Board  so  that  the  implementation   and\r\n\r\ncooperation  can be got from other Ministries as  well?   And\r\n\r\nearlier  in  my  speech, I also asked  for  proactive  action\r\n\r\nregarding chronic cases.  Could he say something about  that,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not think it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for  us  to  set out  in  specific  terms  the\r\n\r\nqualifications of the board members.  It is suffice  to  know\r\n\r\nthat we will select a Board with different members to look at\r\n\r\ndifferent  aspects and who will add value to the  Board.   We\r\n\r\nwill  include of course medical professionals, with  interest\r\n\r\nin   the   things  that  we  are  doing.   We  will   include\r\n\r\neducationists,  as  I said earlier, maybe media  people,  who\r\n\r\nwill  help us devise the promotion strategy.  We may  include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the various Ministries,  for  example,\r\n\r\nsomeone from the Ministry of Education or maybe someone  from\r\n\r\nthe Sports Council would be also useful.  So we will look  at\r\n\r\nall  the various possibilities and put together a Board  that\r\n\r\ncan lead the management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mammography facilities, we have started with two\r\n\r\npolyclinics  and  our  intention is to  extend  this  to  all\r\n\r\npolyclinics in due course.  This will happen by the middle or\r\n\r\nthird quarter of this year.  The polyclinics are now actively\r\n\r\nundergoing  renovations  to be able  to  take  on  these  new\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On chronic cases, we have started the chronic care\r\n\r\nmanagement  programme some time last year so that people  who\r\n\r\nsuffer   from  chronic  diseases,  such  as  diabetes,   high\r\n\r\ncholesterol,  or high blood pressure, can be managed  at  the\r\n\r\npolyclinic level.  They will be given a package to help  them\r\n\r\nmonitor  as  well  as to go for regular consultations.   This\r\n\r\nrequires the people suffering from such chronic conditions to\r\n\r\ntake  an  active  interest  and to  manage  their  conditions\r\n\r\nactively.  We are still in the early stages of the programme.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  as  successful  as  we  like  it  to  be.   Some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  still take a fairly laid back attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthis,  for  example, towards diabetes.  They do  not  realise\r\n\r\nthat  diabetes  is a silent killer, even though  it  may  not\r\n\r\nmanifest  itself in very obvious symptoms.

In\r\n\r\nan  era  of  rapid change in medical practice and  increasing\r\n\r\ncomplexity of regulatory issues, the formation of  HSA  as  a\r\n\r\nnew  statutory  board  will allow more timely  and  effective\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   harnessing  and  integration  of  professional\r\n\r\ncapabilities necessary to meet the challenges of the  future.\r\n\r\nThis  will  allow  Singapore  to  keep  pace  with  the  best\r\n\r\ninternational  practices  and  to  be  world  class  in   our\r\n\r\nregulatory and professional expertise in the Health Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of HSA will result in a larger and\r\n\r\nstronger   critical  core  of  medical,  pharmaceutical   and\r\n\r\nscientific  expertise to provide the synergy for professional\r\n\r\nand  regulatory  excellence.  Developments in the  biomedical\r\n\r\nsciences, both internationally and locally, will lead to  the\r\n\r\ndiscovery of novel health-care products that will require new\r\n\r\nexpertise  and systems to make good evaluations  before  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  used by patients.  The evaluation of a biotechnology\r\n\r\nproduct  derived  from  genetically-engineered  human  blood,\r\n\r\ntissue  or  cells,  and  delivered  by  special  miniaturised\r\n\r\ndevices will require close scientific interaction of a  range\r\n\r\nof  professionals skilled in the evaluation  and  testing  of\r\n\r\ndrugs,  devices  and  blood products.   New  capabilities  in\r\n\r\nmolecular  biology,  genetics,  toxicology  and  pre-clinical\r\n\r\nevaluation   will  have  to  be  developed.   Combining   the\r\n\r\nprofessional  strengths  in HSA will  ensure  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  have a capable and credible regulatory  agency\r\n\r\nthat is able to rigorously evaluate and approve these new and\r\n\r\ninnovative products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of HSA will also result in a one-stop\r\n\r\nregulatory  agency that will administer a seamless regulatory\r\n\r\nprocess  for  all therapeutic products.  Convergence  in  the\r\n\r\napplication  of  medical technology has increasingly  blurred\r\n\r\nthe  boundaries  between  health-care  products.   There   is\r\n\r\nalready  a  trend  towards  products  that  combine  multiple\r\n\r\ntechnologies, eg,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedical  devices  that  also  release  drugs.   As  a  multi-disciplinary  agency, HSA will be able  to  deliver  a  well-coordinated  regulatory process efficiently and  effectively.\r\n\r\nThe medical and pharmaceutical industry will now only need to\r\n\r\ninteract with a single agency which will have the full  range\r\n\r\nof  professional expertise necessary to evaluate and  approve\r\n\r\ntheir therapeutic products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the key to HSA's success is\r\n\r\nknowledgeable and well-trained professionals who are able  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  their  regulatory  and statutory  responsibilities\r\n\r\nwith  competence, integrity and commitment.  With the  growth\r\n\r\nof the health-care and biomedical sectors in Singapore, there\r\n\r\nwill  be increasing competition for good doctors, pharmacists\r\n\r\nand   scientists.   MOH  has  already  faced  difficulty   in\r\n\r\nattracting  these  professionals into the highly  specialised\r\n\r\nfields  of expertise in the five departments.  As a statutory\r\n\r\nboard,   HSA  will  now  have  greater  flexibility   to   be\r\n\r\ncompetitive  so as to recruit and retain its  fair  share  of\r\n\r\nprofessional  talent.   With  more  competitive   recruitment\r\n\r\npolicies, HSA will also be able to attract foreign talent  to\r\n\r\naugment and enrich the local talent pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now highlight the main features\r\n\r\nof the Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Authority shall consist of a\r\n\r\nChairman  and six to ten other members as provided in  clause\r\n\r\n5(1).

HSA will build a strong and\r\n\r\ncredible world-class professional capability to regulate  all\r\n\r\nhealth-care  products  and to provide specialised  scientific\r\n\r\nexpertise to support essential statutory functions.   As  the\r\n\r\nnational regulatory agency, HSA will provide seamless service\r\n\r\nto the health-care industry, and effectively safeguard public\r\n\r\nconfidence in the quality, safety and efficacy of all health-care  and  blood  products  in  Singapore.   HSA  will  forge\r\n\r\nstrategic  alliances and partnerships with other  world-class\r\n\r\nregulatory and scientific agencies, such as those in the  US,\r\n\r\nEurope  and Australia, to achieve global recognition  of  its\r\n\r\ncapability and expertise for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO THE NEXT DAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That at its rising today, Parliament will stand\r\n\r\nadjourned to tomorrow, 23rd February 2001, at 2.15 pm.\" - [Mr\r\n\r\nWong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB SHOP RETAILERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare\r\n\r\nthat I am running a clinic from an HDB tenanted shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retail sector in Singapore, like many other\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs), is undergoing a dramatic\r\n\r\nchange.    High  operating  costs,  fierce  competition   and\r\n\r\ndwindling  business  in  the  industry  are  threatening  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  some 12,000 HDB shop retailers.  Their  growing\r\n\r\nwoes  and  difficulties  must be  heard  and  heeded  by  our\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I wish to voice their call for help and  beseech\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  extend a sympathetic  hand  with  rescue\r\n\r\nmeasures for their survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rapid economic growth, more working women and\r\n\r\nhigher  education  levels  have  changed  the  lifestyle   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  brought  about  big  changes  in  consumer\r\n\r\nattitude and shopping preferences.  Many also prefer to cross\r\n\r\nover and shop in Malaysia where goods are often cheaper. Such\r\n\r\nnew trends put a toll on the local retail trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our shoppers are more sophisticated and\r\n\r\ndiscerning; placing more emphasis on better quality of goods,\r\n\r\nwider   choice   of   goods  and  prices,   more   attractive\r\n\r\npresentation and more pleasant shopping ambience.  There is a\r\n\r\nmarked  preference  for mega shopping centres  with  exciting\r\n\r\natmosphere and ambience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany  HDB shop retailers face stiff competition from the  big\r\n\r\nchain  retailers  that can sell goods at  much  lower  prices\r\n\r\noperating through economies of scale.  As in the case of many\r\n\r\nSMEs,   challenges  faced  by  the  retailers  include   weak\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial     culture,     insufficient      management\r\n\r\nprofessionalism   and  know-how,  shortage  of   professional\r\n\r\ntechnical manpower, insufficient use of technology, outmoded,\r\n\r\nunproductive  methods of operation, limited  ability  to  tap\r\n\r\neconomies  of scale and small domestic market.   Thus,  these\r\n\r\nSMEs  are  losing out to supermarket chains and big  shopping\r\n\r\nmalls  which offer one-stop shopping and appeal to the  young\r\n\r\nwith  their  up-market image.  Sir, as this trend  continues,\r\n\r\nthese  retailers  will find their clientele  shrink  year  by\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local SMEs employ 51% of our workforce. They make up\r\n\r\nabout  92%  of all business establishments here and  form  an\r\n\r\nimportant  part of the Singapore economy.  At least,  90%  of\r\n\r\nretail businesses in Singapore are SMEs and many of them  are\r\n\r\nin  the HDB estates.  Sir, many SMEs have not recovered  from\r\n\r\nthe last economic crisis and most of them are not feeling the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  the  high  economic  growth  reported  by   our\r\n\r\nGovernment.   In  fact, they are facing more difficulties  as\r\n\r\nthey  have to pay increasing charges such as rental, property\r\n\r\ntax,  service  and conservancy charges, utilities  bills  and\r\n\r\ntransport   costs.   Wages  for  workers   have   also   been\r\n\r\nincreasing.   SMEs with shallower pockets and thinner  profit\r\n\r\nmargins  find  it  hard  to  cope  with  the  restoration  of\r\n\r\nemployers' Central Provident Fund contributions.  In general,\r\n\r\nSMEs  have cited the high costs of doing business here  as  a\r\n\r\nserious problem and are extremely concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many retailers, especially those who have obtained their\r\n\r\nshops  by  tender, lament the high rental and high prices  of\r\n\r\nHDB  shops.   In the older estates, retailers are faced  with\r\n\r\nthe  declining  population with lower  disposable  income  as\r\n\r\nyounger  people  move  out, leaving the older  folks  behind.\r\n\r\nBusiness had been deteriorating for many and the retailers do\r\n\r\nnot  have  enough business to make ends meet.  Shop retailers\r\n\r\nhave  to  operate long hours, often late into  the  night  to\r\n\r\nattract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Sir, many retailers fear that this situation will\r\n\r\nworsen with a lower projected GDP growth for this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All told, these retailers declare that times are bad and\r\n\r\nthey  need help.  No doubt, they have to bite the bullet just\r\n\r\nlike everyone else in a free market enterprise.  But they  do\r\n\r\nhave  to  abide  by the HDB rules and regulations  and  these\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations  may be too restrictive  and  perhaps\r\n\r\ninappropriate for these times.  I would like to suggest  that\r\n\r\nour  Government, together will all relevant authorities, make\r\n\r\na  concerted  effort to help them.  Perhaps, we  should  look\r\n\r\ninto the following areas for a start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much can be done to help the small retailers become more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and  more  in sync with consumer  attitudes  and\r\n\r\nshopping  preferences  of shoppers  today.   New  skills  and\r\n\r\nmanagement ideas can be taught and the Government can  be  of\r\n\r\nassistance in this respect by providing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training on aesthetics and presentation and on marketing\r\n\r\nand   personalisation  of  services.   Instead  of   allowing\r\n\r\nproducts  to be haphazardly laid out, retailers can be  shown\r\n\r\nhow  to  improve  layout and appearance  of  their  shops  to\r\n\r\nattract   customers.    Instead  of  traditional   practices,\r\n\r\nretailers  can be taught how to provide personalised  service\r\n\r\nas  a  niche area by offering a familiar, friendly experience\r\n\r\nto  the  neighbourhood  customers.   Their  training  courses\r\n\r\nshould  be tailored to suit them.  For instance, more courses\r\n\r\nshould  be  conducted  in Chinese to cater  to  the  Chinese-educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conduit for bulk purchasing so that the retailers may\r\n\r\nsave  on costs.  The small retail shops may be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nband  together  so  that they may improve  their  stores  and\r\n\r\nenhance  shopping  experience.  A good example  of  how  this\r\n\r\nbanding  together can work can be seen at Chong Pang City  in\r\n\r\nYishun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer training to introduce these retailers to the\r\n\r\nconcept of e-commerce and trading through e-commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be useful if we can allow more flexibility of\r\n\r\nthe SME Financial Scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  allow  shopkeepers  to  have  repayment  of  loans  with\r\n\r\ninstalments  over  a longer period when times  are  bad.

They\r\n\r\npropose  that the authorities collate and release  statistics\r\n\r\non a regular basis, in order to set them apart from the large\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SME 21 is a 10-year strategic plan launched last year to\r\n\r\ncreate  vibrant and resilient SMEs in the new economy.   Sir,\r\n\r\nas  many  of  our  SMEs are not doing well,  I  do  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to speed up implementation of SME  21  with  more\r\n\r\nresources and with a sense of urgency to assist the SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High property cost and rental have been cited as a major\r\n\r\nfactor for the many problems SMEs face.  Many say that rental\r\n\r\ncost has become a tremendous burden to them due to their poor\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Retailers who rent HDB shops  have  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  rental  and  some  have  suggested  a  minimum\r\n\r\nreduction of 20%. Those who paid property tax have also asked\r\n\r\nfor  a further extension of the 25% property tax rebate.   It\r\n\r\nhas  been suggested that, just as hawkers are compensated for\r\n\r\ngiving  up  their  stalls, those who wish to  retire  or  are\r\n\r\naffected  by  redevelopment should also  be  compensated  for\r\n\r\ngiving up their leases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sale of Tenanted Shops (SOTS) Scheme, launched in\r\n\r\n1992  and  discontinued in 1998, some  8,000  of  the  10,000\r\n\r\neligible  shops were offered for sale to the sitting tenants.\r\n\r\nMany  shopowners were encouraged to buy their units from  HDB\r\n\r\nand  they now face large amounts in monthly repayments.  This\r\n\r\nis  especially  so for the shopowners who have  bought  their\r\n\r\nshops  in 1995 and 1996; some of them have as much as  $8,000\r\n\r\nper  month in repayment of their loans.  The businessmen  who\r\n\r\nbought  the  99-year  leasehold properties  have  very  heavy\r\n\r\nburdens  in lieu of high monthly repayments.  They are  in  a\r\n\r\ndilemma because the market is extremely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweak  and  they  cannot afford to sell their properties  when\r\n\r\nmarket prices are so low.  It is very sad indeed to hear that\r\n\r\nsome  of  them  are barely able to cling on  to  such  a  bad\r\n\r\npredicament and can see no foreseeable respite.  Sir, some of\r\n\r\nthem mortgage their own homes to stay afloat and it is only a\r\n\r\nmatter  of time before they lose their homes as well.   These\r\n\r\npeople are hoping that their businesses will improve.   Alas,\r\n\r\nI  fear  that  they  are hoping against  hope  under  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   In  the past, when the property  market  was\r\n\r\nbuoyant,  they could take solace and comfort on the assurance\r\n\r\nof  having  valuable assets in their properties.   Those  who\r\n\r\nhave  purchased their shops from HDB now face a double whammy\r\n\r\nof poor business and poor property prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be done here? I would like to echo their\r\n\r\nrequests.  Most people agree that HDB must have some sort  of\r\n\r\nplanning   and   control  to  ensure  that  no   overwhelming\r\n\r\nduplication  of  similar  businesses  occurs  in  one   area.\r\n\r\nGranted  that such an occurrence is detrimental for  one  and\r\n\r\nall,  they  would like HDB to allow more flexibility  in  the\r\n\r\nconduct of their businesses as in:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing splitting of the shops into smaller shops to co-exist with other types of businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting \"change of use\" of their shops and allowing\r\n\r\nthem  to be converted into offices or wholesale shops  either\r\n\r\ntemporarily or permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resettling some retailers to other places that have\r\n\r\nbetter need of their kind of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relocating shops in poor locations and poor market\r\n\r\nconditions to better business areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the option of selling their shops back to HDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I urge HDB to review the planning of HDB shops\r\n\r\nspaces.   In view of the present trend towards mega  shopping\r\n\r\nmalls  and  supermarkets,  there is  a  need  to  reduce  and\r\n\r\nrestructure  the HDB shops, not only in terms of  new  supply\r\n\r\nbut also in consideration of existing ones.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHDB  can improve on the defining terms concerning the variety\r\n\r\nof  trade  mix.    Poor distribution of trades  and  services\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  a  common  problem in  the  town  centres  and\r\n\r\nneighbourhood centres.  A survey of the retail outlets in the\r\n\r\ntown centres of Bedok, Clementi and Toa Payoh showed that the\r\n\r\npredominant   trades   are  personal  items   (shoes,   bags,\r\n\r\naccessories), clothing and miscellaneous retailing.  For  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  centres,  the survey conducted  in  the  Bedok\r\n\r\nneighbourhood   showed  that  the  predominant   trades   are\r\n\r\nprovision  shops and personal services such as  barber  shops\r\n\r\nand  hairdressing salons.  There is insufficient  variety  of\r\n\r\ntrades  and  the choice of goods and services is  limited  in\r\n\r\nmost HDB town centres and neighbourhood centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB shops can be regrouped to form \"commercial streets\"\r\n\r\nof distinctive features to be in a better position to compete\r\n\r\nwith  giant  shops.  Representatives for retailers  like  the\r\n\r\nMerchants'   Association   and   the   Singapore   Retailers'\r\n\r\nAssociation can work with the Government to bring this about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town councils can help by improving the physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in the business neighbourhood.  Town  councils\r\n\r\nmust  help  by injecting life into the business neighbourhood\r\n\r\nto   attract  the  shopping  crowd.   There  should  be  more\r\n\r\neffective  use  of  festivals,  eg,  Mid-Autumn  Festival  to\r\n\r\nattract  residents  into  the  shopping  areas.   Shopkeepers\r\n\r\nshould  be  encouraged to join the Business Liaison Committee\r\n\r\nof  the  Town  Councils to address their  concerns.   Liberal\r\n\r\napproval  for pasar malams at HDB estates should  be  weighed\r\n\r\nagainst the impact on the neighbourhood retail businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry announced the Retail\r\n\r\nSector  Development Plan (RSDP) in March  1992.   This  is  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan to give the small retailers  a  chance  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  in  this competitive environment.  This  plan,  Sir,\r\n\r\nshould  be  extended  and carried on in  a  faster  and  more\r\n\r\norganised  fashion.  It should be undertaken  in  partnership\r\n\r\nwith  all  concerned.  The sheer size of the sector  and  the\r\n\r\ncomplexity of the task require\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclose and ongoing consultation and collaboration between  the\r\n\r\npublic and private sectors, and between the planners and  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the solution to the problems of the SMEs,\r\n\r\nespecially the HDB retailers, is in restructuring  that  will\r\n\r\ncollectively  improve  them and keep  them  relevant  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  trends and lifestyles of consumers.  This needs  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  SMEs, private associations or organisations  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  to work hand in hand.  The majority of  our  SMEs\r\n\r\nare  not  doing well in spite of a double digit  growth  last\r\n\r\nyear.   Their  prospects are not rosy and  they  require  the\r\n\r\nconcerted  efforts of all concerned to help  them  keep  pace\r\n\r\nwith  the  rest of the economy.   Their transformation  needs\r\n\r\ntime and a lot of effort for fruition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beseech our Government to prioritise this matter\r\n\r\nand,  in the interim, lessen their pain with immediate rescue\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Lily Neo has\r\n\r\narticulated   very  clearly  and  very  comprehensively   the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of HDB shopkeepers.  She has analysed the  problems\r\n\r\nthey  face  and  offered  several suggestions  to  help  them\r\n\r\novercome these problems.  Over the last few months,  we  have\r\n\r\nalso  heard similar feedback from many Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nfrom  grassroots  leaders  as well as  from  participants  of\r\n\r\nfeedback sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the  Government  recognises  the  role  and  the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of our HDB shopkeepers.  We share  the  concern\r\n\r\nthat  they  are not doing well and we will look into  various\r\n\r\nmeasures to help them.  We will have to be guided by  certain\r\n\r\nprinciples,  and one of the principles must be that  we  must\r\n\r\nenhance the viability of the HDB retail sector on a long-term\r\n\r\nsustainable  basis,  and  not just go  for  short-term  quick\r\n\r\nfixes.   We  will also be mindful that HDB shopkeepers,  like\r\n\r\nother  businesses,  must  be  encouraged  to  adhere  to  the\r\n\r\nfundamentals of business; in other words, serving  the  needs\r\n\r\nof   their  customers,  offering  value-for-money  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices, taking risks and being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrewarded based on the decisions they make and the risks  that\r\n\r\nthey  take.  In the final analysis, while Government can help\r\n\r\nto  improve their operating environment, it cannot  guarantee\r\n\r\ntheir viability, survival or profitability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I comment on the various suggestions made by Dr\r\n\r\nLily  Neo,  allow  me to recollect the role  played  by  many\r\n\r\nshopkeepers in our nation building.  Members will recall that\r\n\r\nin  our early years of independence, many old shophouses were\r\n\r\nresettled  in  HDB  estates to make  way  for  roads,  flats,\r\n\r\nfactories,   schools  and  so  on.   Government   helped   by\r\n\r\nsubsidising their rentals and the shopkeepers in turn  helped\r\n\r\nto  keep  the cost of living affordable for HDB residents  by\r\n\r\npassing on the benefits of these subsidised rentals to  their\r\n\r\ncustomers.   In  this  process,  they  helped  to  hold  down\r\n\r\ninflation  at a time when many Singaporeans were trying  very\r\n\r\nhard to make ends meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are still about 2,000 first-generation\r\n\r\nshopkeepers; in other words, those who were relocated in  the\r\n\r\nearly  years,  but  still  plying their  trades  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   Many  of them are now elderly and  we  should  not\r\n\r\nforget  the  contributions they have made and overlook  them,\r\n\r\neven as the rest of the country enjoys the fruits of economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, in her diagnosis of the ills facing the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,  pointed  out that changing  lifestyles   -   in\r\n\r\nother   words,   more   working  women,  more   sophisticated\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,  more  competition, easy travel,  globalisation,\r\n\r\netc   -  all  these have affected the traditional  retailers.\r\n\r\nThis  is  true.   But I believe that HDB neighbourhood  shops\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  play an important role in  servicing  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  HDB heartlanders.  There will always be  residents\r\n\r\nwho,  for  one  reason or another, whether it is convenience,\r\n\r\nfamiliarity or simply good value for money, still  prefer  to\r\n\r\npatronise these shops, rather than big shopping malls or mega\r\n\r\nmarts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still recall the friendly neighbourhood shopkeeper\r\n\r\nthat  I used to go to as a child in Kim Keat Avenue.   I  can\r\n\r\nstill  remember the name and the owner of that shop.  It  was\r\n\r\ncalled  Ban  Heng.  It is no longer there.   But  many  years\r\n\r\nlater,  when  I  went  back  to the  shop  after  my  studies\r\n\r\noverseas,  the shopkeeper still remembered me and  remembered\r\n\r\nthe  things that I used to buy from her shop.  And I was very\r\n\r\nimpressed  and  very touched.  I think that is  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nfriendly,  familiar, personalised service that  Dr  Lily  Neo\r\n\r\ntalked  about,  that is still able to retain the  loyalty  of\r\n\r\ncustomers,  even in today's world of mega marts and  shopping\r\n\r\nmalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think many of us in our visits to hawker\r\n\r\ncentres,  neigbourhood shopping centres and so on  will  have\r\n\r\ncome across many residents or ex-residents who have moved out\r\n\r\nof  the  estate  but who still come back to the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nshopping  centre,  or to the neighbourhood  eating  shops  or\r\n\r\ncoffee  houses, just to come back and eat at their  favourite\r\n\r\nstall.   So these shops and eating houses are part and parcel\r\n\r\nof  our social landscape.  They contribute in some small  but\r\n\r\nsignificant way and manner towards our collective  memory  of\r\n\r\nwhat it means to be Singaporeans.  And I believe we should do\r\n\r\nwhat we can to retain them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on some of the Member's suggestions.\r\n\r\nAn   underlying  principle  of  the  Government's  assistance\r\n\r\nprogramme for HDB retailers is to encourage them to  upgrade,\r\n\r\nso   that   they   can  keep  pace  with  the   fast-changing\r\n\r\nenvironment.   In other words, we will help  those  who  help\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has made several good suggestions in the\r\n\r\nsame  vein.  For example, provide training to enable HDB shop\r\n\r\nretailers  to  improve  their  marketing,  presentation   and\r\n\r\nmerchandising  skills.  That is a very  good  idea.   And  we\r\n\r\nshould  work  towards encouraging more of these  shopkeepers,\r\n\r\nnot  to assume that they know what is happening already,  but\r\n\r\nto  try and keep up to date with the various trends and  with\r\n\r\nthe changing lifestyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also suggested that we should provide a means for\r\n\r\nthem  to avail themselves of things like bulk purchasing;  in\r\n\r\nother words, to enjoy economies of scale.  Again, this  is  a\r\n\r\ngood   suggestion  and  we  will  certainly   consider   this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested that HDB shops band together\r\n\r\nto form what are called \"commercial streets\" with distinctive\r\n\r\nfeatures.  I understand that there are certain areas  in  the\r\n\r\nHDB estates which have already undergone this transformation,\r\n\r\nplaces  like  Marine  Parade Town Centre,  Chong  Pang  City,\r\n\r\nTampines   N2   Shopping  Street,  Toa  Payoh  Town   Centre.\r\n\r\nShopkeepers  in these areas have got together with  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  and  they have made improvements to the  pedestrian\r\n\r\nmalls,  shopping areas and, as a result, their  business  has\r\n\r\nimproved and their customers have not only been retained  but\r\n\r\nthey  have  been able to attract new customers.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nidea that I would also endorse and we should find some way to\r\n\r\nencourage more of these developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member's concern on rental cost and\r\n\r\nprices  of  HDB  shops, I would like to point  out  that  the\r\n\r\n16,000  HDB shop lessees and tenants today are still enjoying\r\n\r\nrental and property tax rebates which we introduced in  1998.\r\n\r\nThe  property tax rebates have been extended to June of  this\r\n\r\nyear  at  a reduced rate of 25%.  Likewise, the HDB has  kept\r\n\r\nits  rental  rebates till the end of this year  at  half  the\r\n\r\noriginal  quantum.  The Government will review these  rebates\r\n\r\nbefore their expiry, whether it is in June or December.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's request to give HDB shop retailers more\r\n\r\nflexibility  in the conduct of their business, HDB  tells  me\r\n\r\nthat it currently grants approval on a case-by-case basis.  I\r\n\r\nwill  ask the HDB to consider being more flexible in granting\r\n\r\napproval for change of trade, except in cases that can  cause\r\n\r\ndisturbance to residents.  One example would be conversion to\r\n\r\nan   eating  shop.   HDB  will  also  consider  the  Member's\r\n\r\nsuggestion to facilitate exit of rental tenants who  wish  to\r\n\r\nretire or who are affected by redevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to add that the\r\n\r\nRetail  21  Committee,  which is  chaired  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board, and which comprises members\r\n\r\nfrom  the HDB and other public and private agencies, will  be\r\n\r\nreleasing  its 10-year strategic plan for the overall  retail\r\n\r\nsector very soon.  HDB is also looking into specific ways  to\r\n\r\nhelp HDB shopkeepers enhance their competitiveness.  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  in  our collective interest to ensure that the HDB retail\r\n\r\nsector  remains  viable  and  sustainable,  so  that  it  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to provide good service to HDB residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-Nine</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes past Four o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to 23rd February, 2001.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) how is\r\n\r\nthe  search  for members of statutory boards  and  boards  of\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked Companies (GLCs) conducted;  (b)  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  criteria and guidelines for the selection of these board\r\n\r\nmembers; and (c) what are the numbers of men and of women  on\r\n\r\nthese boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statutory board or GLC, in consultation with their\r\n\r\nrespective   parent  Ministry  or  holding   company,   first\r\n\r\nidentifies   their  requirements  and  the  broad   selection\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  Board  members.
