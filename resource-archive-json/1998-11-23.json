HDB prices new flats such  that\r\n\r\n90% of Singaporean households can afford at least a 3-room flat,\r\n\r\nand 70% at least a 4-room flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also takes into account individual attributes of the flats\r\n\r\nsuch  as location, proximity to MRT/LRT stations, the view  from\r\n\r\nthe  flats, and special design features and finishes. New  flats\r\n\r\ntend  to  have better designs and finishes, and are  located  in\r\n\r\ntowns with better facilities and infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB does not consider the prices of private residential\r\n\r\nproperties when it sets\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprices of new HDB flats. However, it does factor in current  HDB\r\n\r\nresale market prices, because resale prices are an indication of\r\n\r\nhow  willing  and able Singaporeans are to pay  for  HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nPrices  of  new  HDB  flats  are  below  the  market  values  of\r\n\r\nequivalent flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present prices, new HDB flats continue to be heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidized. The overall sales proceeds do not cover their  total\r\n\r\ndevelopment costs. The loss incurred by HDB has to be funded  by\r\n\r\na Government grant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in view of the drop in\r\n\r\nprices of resale flats, does the HDB take into consideration the\r\n\r\nso-called market subsidy in setting its price?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, we have debated this before in the\r\n\r\nHouse.

Does  the  HDB  publish,\r\n\r\nevery time they embark upon a construction, the cost to the  HDB\r\n\r\nof the construction of that particular estate or block?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, HDB has just released their Annual\r\n\r\nReport  and  the  CEO of HDB conducted a press  conference  last\r\n\r\nweekend.  May I refer Members to the financial review pages  and\r\n\r\nthey will get all the relevant statistics.  In particular, may I\r\n\r\nrefer  the Member to the balance sheet and the income statement.\r\n\r\nThe income statement  shows quite clearly the losses incurred by\r\n\r\nthe Government in the sale of new flats and this figure was also\r\n\r\nhighlighted by the CEO of HDB.  For the year 1997/98 it amounted\r\n\r\nto  $591  million.   This is something like  60%  of  the  total\r\n\r\ndeficit incurred by HDB, which was about $1 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not asking for\r\n\r\nfigures in the annual statement of the HDB.

The reason why we\r\n\r\ndo  not  publish  these  figures  is  that  every  precinct  has\r\n\r\ndifferent  characteristics.  New precincts have got markets  and\r\n\r\nroads  at  different stages of construction.   But  the  selling\r\n\r\nprices  of new flats are published and made known to the  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  asked to select the flats.  But these figures are  not\r\n\r\nstate secrets.  If he wants to know the development cost we will\r\n\r\nlet him know.  But we incurred a great loss because of the total\r\n\r\ndevelopment cost.  I think Members confuse development cost with\r\n\r\nconstruction  cost.  Over the last one year,  construction  cost\r\n\r\nhas  indeed gone down, but the land cost has not gone down  that\r\n\r\nmuch.   If  you  talk  about flats built today,  ie,  ready  for\r\n\r\nselection and to go in for occupation , they were bought by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment several years back.  At that time, the land cost  was\r\n\r\nvery expensive and the construction cost was equally high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RESALE FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Review of levy)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development if\r\n\r\nhe  will review the levy imposed on various types of Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board resale flats in view of the current  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify that the\r\n\r\nresale  levy  is not imposed on HDB resale flats.  If  a  person\r\n\r\nsells his first direct purchase HDB flat and buys a resale  flat\r\n\r\nin  the open market, he does not pay the resale levy. This is an\r\n\r\nimportant point.  The resale levy is applicable only for lessees\r\n\r\nwho  have  already enjoyed the first Government subsidy  (either\r\n\r\nthrough the purchase of new HDB flats or the purchase of  resale\r\n\r\nflats  using  the  CPF  housing grant) and  intend  to  purchase\r\n\r\nanother  flat directly from HDB.  In other words, he intends  to\r\n\r\ntake a second bite of the subsidy cherry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the resale levy is to ensure that the\r\n\r\nsecond housing subsidy is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmaller than the first housing subsidy, which is something I  am\r\n\r\nsure  all  Members  will agree. The Government  understands  the\r\n\r\nneeds of 3-room flat dwellers to upgrade to a bigger flat. Thus,\r\n\r\nit has structured the resale levy such that a lessee who sells a\r\n\r\nsmaller  flat, such as a 2-room or 3-room flat,   pays  a  lower\r\n\r\nlevy. Conversely, the levy imposed on the sale of a larger flat,\r\n\r\nlike a 5-room or Executive flat, is higher than the 3-room or 4-room flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resale levy has effectively helped HDB to manage the\r\n\r\ndemand  for new flats from upgraders. As the objective to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  amount of subsidy for purchase of second flat from  HDB  is\r\n\r\nstill  valid,  my  Ministry does not see a need  to  review  the\r\n\r\nresale levy now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary not\r\n\r\naware  that all Government departments are reducing their  fees?\r\n\r\nCan the same principle not be applied to the resale levy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I think the Member did not hear me\r\n\r\ncorrectly.   If   you sell your first flat which  you  purchased\r\n\r\nfrom  the HDB some years ago, at least five years ago,  and  now\r\n\r\nyou  want to buy a resale flat, you do not pay the resale  levy.\r\n\r\nYou  only pay the resale levy when you queue up and buy the next\r\n\r\nflat  direct  from  HDB.   Resale flats have  indeed  fallen  in\r\n\r\nprices.   So  as a percentage of the smaller selling price,  the\r\n\r\nabsolute  amount of the resale levy is already  smaller.   Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  that,  people who are eligible to sell today have  already\r\n\r\noccupied their flats for at least five years.  For those who are\r\n\r\neligible  to apply for a second flat, they would have stayed  in\r\n\r\nthe  flat for 10 years.  In other words, they would have  bought\r\n\r\ntheir flats either in 1988 or 1993.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the price of a 3-room flat from HDB was only $44,000.\r\n\r\nIn  1988,  the price of a 3-room flat from HDB was only $41,000.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  resale  price  of a 3-room  flat  is  approximately\r\n\r\nbetween $150,000 and $180,000. If you do a simple sum, there  is\r\n\r\na sizable capital gain, ie, $150,000-$180,000 minus the $40,000-odd  and multiply that by 20% resale levy, which he need not pay\r\n\r\nuntil he gets the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew flat.  Of course, if he chooses this option he has to pay  a\r\n\r\n5%  interest annually.

Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that HDB  has\r\n\r\nalso  moved  towards market pricing?

Yes,  resale prices have fallen by about 25%  from  the\r\n\r\npeak  in  1996  and  we have consequently adjusted  the  selling\r\n\r\nprices  of new flats.  But there is still a big gap between  the\r\n\r\nprice  of a new flat and the price of an old flat.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe substantial market subsidy, the resale levy should stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, in view of the relatively lower resale\r\n\r\nprices  of 3-room flats and the relatively higher prices  of  4-room  flats,  in comparison to the market price now,  would  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary consider waiving the resale levy for  3-room  flats and help those who apply directly to HDB to  upgrade\r\n\r\nto 4-room HDB flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the resale levy for a 3-room flat is\r\n\r\nonly 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It is money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Yes, correct, it is money and money is\r\n\r\nhard-earned.

The original selling price of a 3-room flat for those\r\n\r\nwho  are  eligible  to  sell their flats today  was  only  about\r\n\r\n$44,000.   If you do a simple calculation, the capital  gain  is\r\n\r\nhuge  with  over  $100,000.  Out of the $100,000  capital  gain,\r\n\r\nwhich is tax free, you just pay 20% to the Government.

These are taxpayers' monies.  So we  must\r\n\r\nbuy  a  flat  which is reasonably in demand.  But  we  give  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the doubt to the future buyers.

The essence of what Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Mahathir and I discussed has already been reported  in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir sought Singapore's co-operation to\r\n\r\nraise funds to help Malaysia meet its financial needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir also reaffirmed Malaysia's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to provide water to Singapore beyond 2061  when  the\r\n\r\n<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Agreement expires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Malaysia's request, Singapore submitted its draft\r\n\r\nAgreement  on  Water  to the Malaysians on 14th  November  1998.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in turn sent its draft loan agreement to Singapore  on\r\n\r\n20th November 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials from both countries are now negotiating the two\r\n\r\nagreements.  It is, therefore, premature to go into the  details\r\n\r\ntoday.   But  as they are major agreements between  two  states,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  tabled  before  our respective  Parliaments  for\r\n\r\napproval  after Dr Mahathir and I have signed them.  However,  I\r\n\r\nmust caution that negotiation is still in progress and we cannot\r\n\r\nassume yet that we will reach agreement on the details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two proposals are win-win because Singapore will\r\n\r\nprovide  or  raise funds for Malaysia on very favourable  terms.\r\n\r\nThese  funds  will help Malaysia meet its financial requirements\r\n\r\nand  overcome  its economic challenge.  In turn,  with  the  new\r\n\r\nwater  agreement, Singapore's long term supply of water will  be\r\n\r\nsecured.  Water from Malaysia is also a cheaper alternative than\r\n\r\ndesalination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting between Dr Mahathir and I to discuss bilateral\r\n\r\nco-operation does represent a change in attitude on  both  sides\r\n\r\ntowards  restoring and improving bilateral  ties.   There  is  a\r\n\r\ngreater  chance  now  that  such improvement  in  ties  will  be\r\n\r\nsustained,  especially  if  we  conclude  the  loan  and   water\r\n\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister whether it is possible for him to disclose  some\r\n\r\nbroad outline of the nature of the two agreements that are being\r\n\r\ndiscussed,  for example, the amount of loan that  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nhave   now  stated in their agreement and is there any  proposed\r\n\r\nperiod in the water agreement  that we would like to ask for?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained just\r\n\r\nnow, negotiation is in progress.

Member is referring to a number\r\n\r\nof  statements over the past month made by the Malaysian Defence\r\n\r\nMinister, Datuk Syed Hamid Albar. On 26th October and  again  on\r\n\r\n10th  November  this year, Datuk Syed Hamid told  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nParliament  that the RMAF would mobilise its fighters  \"to  take\r\n\r\nappropriate  action\" if there was any intrusion into  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nairspace by the RSAF.  Datuk Syed Hamid was also quoted  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  press as having said, on 2nd November, that  although\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had  the  right  to fire missiles  at  aircraft  which\r\n\r\nintruded  into  its  airspace, it preferred  to  apply  pressure\r\n\r\nthrough  public  opinion.  He cited the case of a  South  Korean\r\n\r\nairliner  that was shot down by a Soviet Union military aircraft\r\n\r\nafter  it  strayed  into Soviet airspace  -  an  incident  which\r\n\r\nresulted in a huge loss of innocent lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia had, in official protests, alleged that there\r\n\r\nwere  seven  intrusions by the RSAF since  18th  September  this\r\n\r\nyear,  when  Malaysia  revoked the arrangements  and  agreements\r\n\r\nwhich  allowed  the  RSAF  access  to  Malaysian  airspace.   No\r\n\r\nsupporting information was provided to substantiate any  of  the\r\n\r\nallegations.   Singapore   categorically   rejects   all   these\r\n\r\nallegations   as   being   completely   without    basis.    Our\r\n\r\ninvestigations showed that three of the cases involved  aircraft\r\n\r\nof   other  countries.  Two  of  them  were  transiting  through\r\n\r\nMalaysian airspace with proper diplomatic clearance given by the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  authorities while the third was a civil aircraft.  In\r\n\r\nanother three cases,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  were  no  RSAF aircraft flying at the  times  and  places\r\n\r\nstated  in  the  Malaysian  Third Person  Note.  The  last  case\r\n\r\ninvolved an RSAF Fokker 50 maritime patrol aircraft coming  into\r\n\r\nChangi Air Base, but the aircraft did not overfly or circle over\r\n\r\nthe  Navy  Recruit  Training  Base as  alleged.   Singapore  has\r\n\r\nalready  responded officially to Malaysia to conclusively  rebut\r\n\r\nthe allegations.  We have also asked for substantiating evidence\r\n\r\nif  Malaysia insists that the intrusions did occur.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nreasonable   to  keep  on  repeating  the  allegations   without\r\n\r\nproviding any details to substantiate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore recognises that Malaysia, like any other country,\r\n\r\nhas  the  right to take actions to defend itself against hostile\r\n\r\naction  and  to  protect its sovereignty.  As I have  explained,\r\n\r\nthere  were  no  intrusions by RSAF aircraft  in  the  instances\r\n\r\nalleged  by Malaysia.  The RSAF is extremely careful  about  not\r\n\r\nintruding into the airspace of other countries.  But it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible   to  guarantee  that  there  will  not  be  accidental\r\n\r\ninfringements, especially when Singapore's airspace is so  tight\r\n\r\nand  we  share  a  common  border.   Sometimes  adverse  weather\r\n\r\nconditions cause aircraft to stray off-course. And no air  force\r\n\r\nin  the  world  can guarantee that its pilots  will  never  make\r\n\r\nnavigational errors.  Earlier this year, there was one  instance\r\n\r\nwhen  RSAF aircraft accidentally strayed into Malaysian airspace\r\n\r\n- and we apologised to Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, threats to scramble RMAF aircraft to deal\r\n\r\nwith  RSAF  intrusions  and assertions of  the  right  to  shoot\r\n\r\nmissiles to bring down intruding aircraft are, to say the least,\r\n\r\nmost  unfortunate - particularly when reference  is  made  to  a\r\n\r\nfighter  of the former Soviet air force shooting down a civilian\r\n\r\naircraft  that  had  been misidentified.   Such  statements  are\r\n\r\nespecially  unfortunate considering that Singapore and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nare  friendly  neighbours interested in cooperation  for  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit  as  the two Prime Ministers have recently  underscored.\r\n\r\nWe should be trying to clear up any misunderstandings instead of\r\n\r\nmaking   statements  which  raise  tensions  and  increase   the\r\n\r\nlikelihood that a dangerous situation might arise.  As  Minister\r\n\r\nSyed Hamid himself has stated, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  dangerous  to \"play games\" in defence matters  as  doing  so\r\n\r\ncould lead to a very dangerous consequence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that we would like to\r\n\r\nhave  good  defence relations with Malaysia.

The Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) is one of  the\r\n\r\nkey programmes to provide unskilled and low skilled workers with\r\n\r\ntraining leading to national skill certification.  The focus  of\r\n\r\nthe  SRP is on skill upgrading to enhance employability  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   SRP support is extended to companies that send  their\r\n\r\nworkers  for  the modular skill training programme by  the  ITE,\r\n\r\nwhich  leads  to  the Certificate of Competency,  NTC3  or  NTC2\r\n\r\ncertification  or  for certificate programmes conducted  by  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as at end October, the total number of workers\r\n\r\ncommitted for training under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  SRP stood at 10,500.  This is more than half of the  target\r\n\r\nof  20,000  workers that the NTUC aims to achieve  by  the  next\r\n\r\nLabour  Day.  Of this number, over 2,800 workers have  completed\r\n\r\ntheir   training  and  another  3,300  workers   are   currently\r\n\r\nundergoing training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation of workers in the SRP has been boosted as a result\r\n\r\nof  the sector-driven approach that has been recently adopted by\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC.  In the hospitality sector, 59 hotels have signed  up\r\n\r\nto  retrain a total of 2,000 workers.  These workers would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  vulnerable  to  retrenchment,  but  the  SRP  provided  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  hotels to upgrade their skills  at  affordable\r\n\r\ncost during this lull period.  The SRP for the marine sector was\r\n\r\nlaunched  just  this  month, with 13  companies  committing  500\r\n\r\nworkers   to   be   trained.   The  SRP  for  a  third   sector,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  sector, will be  launched  next  month,  and\r\n\r\nanother  500  workers  are expected to be retrained.   The  NTUC\r\n\r\nplans to launch the SRP in at least another 12 more sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the economic downturn, many companies have cut\r\n\r\nback  on  their training budgets.  Despite this, the  number  of\r\n\r\nworkers  being  scheduled for training under the  SRP  has  been\r\n\r\ngrowing at an encouraging pace.  This is an indication that  the\r\n\r\nSRP  is  making good progress, and has contributed to preserving\r\n\r\njobs  and  making workers more employable during these difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the SRP is that whenever possible,\r\n\r\ntraining  plans are worked out with the participating  companies\r\n\r\nfor  their workers.  This is critical to the success of the  SRP\r\n\r\nas  many  workers  lack the basic secondary education,  or  even\r\n\r\nbasic  literacy  and  numeracy skills, to qualify  for  training\r\n\r\nleading to skills certification.  For this group of workers, SRP\r\n\r\nsupport is extended for retraining programmes such as the  Basic\r\n\r\nEducation  for  Skills  Training (BEST) and  Worker  Improvement\r\n\r\nthrough  Secondary  Education  (WISE).   Training  under   these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  will  continue to help workers to  gain  certifiable\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BEST and WISE programmes are important segments of our\r\n\r\nretraining\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neffort.   BEST  was introduced in 1983 to equip workers  without\r\n\r\nany   formal  qualifications  to  PSLE  level  in  English   and\r\n\r\nMathematics.  To-date, the programme has reached out to  216,000\r\n\r\nworkers.  The 1998 enrolment figure is 22,000 which is about the\r\n\r\nsame  as  the  1997 enrolment.  WISE was launched  in  1987  for\r\n\r\nworkers  to  upgrade English and Mathematics to GCE  `N'  level.\r\n\r\nSince  its  launch,  the programme has reached  out  to  130,000\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  1998 enrolment figure is 16,000  which  is  over\r\n\r\n1,000 more than in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight the progress of worker training\r\n\r\nsupported by the NTUC Education and Training Fund (N-ETF), which\r\n\r\nwas  launched  on  1st  October this year.   The  Government  is\r\n\r\nproviding a grant of $9 million to the NTUC to match funds of $3\r\n\r\nmillion being raised by the labour movement.  The NTUC Education\r\n\r\nand Training Fund supports the training of union members who may\r\n\r\nnot  be able to benefit from training support by their employers\r\n\r\nbut  are prepared to invest in their own skills upgrading.   The\r\n\r\ntarget set by the NTUC was to train 10,000 workers in the  first\r\n\r\nyear.   As at end-October 1998, NTUC has already received  2,600\r\n\r\napplications.   This  is  an indication  that  there  is  strong\r\n\r\ninterest in retraining among the union members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, there is a range of retraining programmes in\r\n\r\nplace  aimed  at  various segments of the  workforce,  including\r\n\r\nthose  who  do not have any formal qualifications.  Despite  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn and reduction in companies' training budgets,\r\n\r\nthe  enrolment  figures  indicate  that  these  programmes  have\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  maintain a healthy level  of  participation.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry will continue to encourage and support participation in\r\n\r\nthese  programmes  as  part of the initiatives  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nemployability of our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DATABASE OF PART-TIME AND HOME-BASED JOBS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  (a) if a database of part-time jobs as well  as  home-based jobs is available for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefit  of those workers not seeking full-time jobs because  of\r\n\r\nfamily  commitments;  (b) how part-time  job  seekers  can  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  this  information; and (c)  how  many  persons  have\r\n\r\nactually used the service and been successfully matched with the\r\n\r\njobs that suit their circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the June 1998 Labour\r\n\r\nForce  Survey,  49,000 economically inactive  persons  indicated\r\n\r\nthat they intended to seek work within the next two years. About\r\n\r\none  in  two persons in this group indicated that they preferred\r\n\r\npart-time work for one reason or another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry's Employment Service Department (ESD)\r\n\r\nprovides  employment  assistance to Singaporeans  and  Permanent\r\n\r\nResidents looking for jobs, whether it is for full-time jobs  or\r\n\r\npart-time jobs. As at 31st October 1998, there were some 900 job\r\n\r\nseekers  registered with the ESD, who were looking for part-time\r\n\r\nor   flexible  work.  However,  there  were  only  64  part-time\r\n\r\npositions posted with the Department as at that date.  About  40\r\n\r\nof these vacancies have since been taken up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employment is not prevalent in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nJune 1998 Labour Force Survey reveals that only 3.1% of employed\r\n\r\npersons are working part-time.  While many economically inactive\r\n\r\npersons such as housewives favour part-time work, employers  are\r\n\r\nstill  not  keen  to recruit part-timers.  The current  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn has resulted in loosening the labour market.  This  has\r\n\r\nmade  it  more difficult to promote part-time and flexible  work\r\n\r\narrangements.  Once the economy recovers and demand  for  labour\r\n\r\npicks  up,  employers  will have to review  their  position  and\r\n\r\nconsider part-time workers as a valuable supplementary workforce\r\n\r\nto meet growing demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, could\r\n\r\nI  ask  the Minister for the 900 job seekers, what kind of  jobs\r\n\r\nwere they looking for, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the\r\n\r\nspecific  details for all the 900 job seekers.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  have  a wide choice of full-time job  seekers.

Normally they would lose their eligibility  for\r\n\r\nthese  subsidies when they are no more working.  But the  Member\r\n\r\nmay  be  pleased  to know that our current practice  now  is  to\r\n\r\nextend the child-care subsidy for a three-month grace period  if\r\n\r\nthe mother is looking for a job.  In view of the difficulties in\r\n\r\nthe  job  market  now,  my  Ministry  will  review  the  3-month\r\n\r\nextension period with a view to lengthening it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other schemes to help families with young\r\n\r\nchildren needing child-care.  For example, there is the  Centre-based Financial Assistance for Child Care (CFAC) Scheme for low-income  families administered by the National Council of  Social\r\n\r\nService.   This scheme provides financial assistance  of  up  to\r\n\r\n$200  per month depending on family income.  This is in addition\r\n\r\nto  the child-care subsidy provided by Government.  Even if  the\r\n\r\nmother is currently not employed, she is still eligible for  the\r\n\r\nCFAC assistance as long as she is seeking employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Before-and-after-school care centres, or BASCs, they\r\n\r\nare  operated  by voluntary welfare organisations  (VWOs)  which\r\n\r\ngenerally keep their fees at an affordable rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-income families, ie, those with gross monthly household\r\n\r\nincome of less than $2,500, are eligible for the Ministry's BASC\r\n\r\nfee subsidy of up to $150 a month on a sliding scale.

The Committee has  completed\r\n\r\nits  work and released its Report on 11th November 1998.  Copies\r\n\r\nof the Report have been circulated to hon. Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the CSC first began its work, the focus was on the\r\n\r\nnext  ten  years.  The onset of the regional economic crisis  in\r\n\r\nJuly   1997   has,  however,  altered  the  economic   landscape\r\n\r\nsignificantly.  Given our open economy and significant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlinkages with the region, Singapore too has not been spared from\r\n\r\nthe  contagion  despite  our sound economic  fundamentals.   The\r\n\r\nsharp    currency   realignments   have   also   weakened    our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   The  scope of the CSC  Report  was  therefore\r\n\r\nexpanded  to propose measures to help the economy cope with  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.   The  Report hence includes both short-  and  long-term\r\n\r\nrecommendations to improve our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Short-term Measures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the regional crisis has significantly\r\n\r\nimpacted  our economic performance.  Between 1st July  1997  and\r\n\r\n21st  November  1998,  the  S$ to  US$  exchange  rate  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  stock market have fallen by 12% and 30% respectively.\r\n\r\nThe GDP growth rate year-on-year has slowed from 7.8% in 1997 to\r\n\r\n6.2%  and  1.8% respectively in the first and second quarter  of\r\n\r\n1998.   Third quarter growth was -0.7%, the first decline  since\r\n\r\n1985.   On  a  quarter-on-quarter basis, the  economy  has  been\r\n\r\nshrinking for two successive quarters.  For the whole  of  1998,\r\n\r\nSingapore's GDP growth is expected to be around 1/2-1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses have been hit, some sectors more than others,\r\n\r\nand  more than 20,000 workers have been retrenched in the  first\r\n\r\nthree   quarters   as   a   result.    The   seasonally-adjusted\r\n\r\nunemployment rate has risen sharply from 2.3% in June to 4.5% in\r\n\r\nSeptember this year.  The coming quarters will be difficult  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We will continue to face weaker demand for our goods\r\n\r\nand services from the region which is struggling to recover from\r\n\r\nthe  severe economic crisis.  The slowing momentum in the US and\r\n\r\nthe  EU will dampen demand further.  As external demand accounts\r\n\r\nfor  more  than  two-thirds of our total demand,  1999  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  is  expected  to remain weak.  MTI's preliminary  growth\r\n\r\nforecast for 1999 is between -1% and 1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key concern is that the sharp currency realignments have\r\n\r\neroded our cost-competitiveness.  Our relative unit labour  cost\r\n\r\n(RULC)  has  been rising gradually but steadily over the  years.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  region was prospering, our rising RULC was a  concern\r\n\r\nbut not a critical problem.  Now\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions have changed drastically in the region  and\r\n\r\nwe  are competing for a global economic pie that is growing more\r\n\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from EDB indicated that some companies were facing\r\n\r\npressures  to  pare  prices  or  relocate  production  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries  because  of the cost differentials between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  regional countries.  Our total exports to the US  have\r\n\r\nfallen by 8.2% in the first 9 months of this year while all  the\r\n\r\nother  regional  countries still managed  to  register  positive\r\n\r\nexport  growth  to  the US.  This is due  largely  to  the  weak\r\n\r\nperformance  of our electronics industry.  Our market  share  of\r\n\r\nelectronics  exports  to the US has dropped  from  9.3%  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond quarter of 1997 to 7.3% in September 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, the key concern for Singapore is how to\r\n\r\nrestore our competitiveness, help our companies to tide over the\r\n\r\ncrisis  and  minimise  further job  losses.   We  also  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   attracting  investments  to  create  new   jobs   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides raising productivity which takes time, there are\r\n\r\ntwo main approaches to restore cost competitiveness in the short\r\n\r\nterm.  One approach is through currency depreciation.  While MAS\r\n\r\nhas  been  managing the S$ more flexibly in view of the regional\r\n\r\ncrisis, competitive devaluation is not recommended.  A weak  S$,\r\n\r\nin  the context of an open economy heavily dependent on imports,\r\n\r\nwill  translate into larger imported inflation.  This  would  in\r\n\r\nturn erode any competitive gains from a currency devaluation.  A\r\n\r\ndepreciating currency would also erode confidence in the S$ as a\r\n\r\nstore  of  value, impact our position as a financial centre  and\r\n\r\ndiminish   the   value   of  S$-denominated   assets   held   by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other approach which the CSC has recommended is to\r\n\r\nreduce  business  costs  directly.   This  addresses  the   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness head-on, without the disadvantages brought about\r\n\r\nby  competitive  devaluation.   The  Government  took  the  same\r\n\r\napproach to tackle the 1985 recession, with great effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June the Government accepted the CSC's recommendation of\r\n\r\na  $2  billion  package of off-budget measures which  have  been\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Since then the economic situation has deteriorated\r\n\r\nfurther and the contagion has spread to Russia and Brazil.   The\r\n\r\nCSC  has recommended that the Government should now implement  a\r\n\r\nmuch  larger  cost  and  tax cutting  package  worth  about  $10\r\n\r\nbillion,  equivalent  to  about 7%  of  our  GDP,  to  help  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  compete during this difficult period.   All  the  key\r\n\r\ncomponents  of  business  costs should be  addressed,  including\r\n\r\nwages,  foreign worker levy, rentals, charges for services  like\r\n\r\nelectricity,  telecommunications  and  port  services,  vehicle-related  overhead costs, as well as Government  taxes.   Here  I\r\n\r\nrefer  Members to pages 3 and 4 of the CSC Report which set  out\r\n\r\nthe details of these recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures should be implemented expeditiously to\r\n\r\nregain  our  competitiveness, minimise further  job  losses  and\r\n\r\nposition  our  economy to face intense competition  as  regional\r\n\r\ncompetitors  struggle to export their way out of their  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   Besides the cost-cutting package,  the  CSC  has\r\n\r\nalso  recommended measures to improve credit availability,  seek\r\n\r\nout  markets  beyond  the  region, attract  more  businesses  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and build up our capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Long-term Capability Building Measures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must not lose sight of the need to\r\n\r\naddress  longer-term challenges and take steps now to strengthen\r\n\r\nour competitiveness beyond the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take into account the long-term global trends\r\n\r\nwhich  will  have  an  impact on Singapore.  Continued  economic\r\n\r\nliberalisation,  globalisation and  rapid  technological  change\r\n\r\nwill  shape the competitive economic environment of the  future.\r\n\r\nThese  global  forces will not wait for the economic  crisis  to\r\n\r\nblow  over.   We  need to take cognisance of these  changes  and\r\n\r\nadjust  our  strategies  and  policies  now  to  build  up   the\r\n\r\ncapabilities to enable us to thrive in this future world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sound economic fundamentals, stability and cohesiveness\r\n\r\nwill  enable  us to do so.  We do not face the serious  domestic\r\n\r\nstructural  problems that some other countries  are  preoccupied\r\n\r\nwith.   We  have ample resources and our people are skilled  and\r\n\r\nwell-trained.  We must therefore use this window of  opportunity\r\n\r\nnow  to  enhance  our capabilities to widen  the  gap  with  our\r\n\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC's vision is for Singapore to develop in the next\r\n\r\nten  years  into an advanced and globally competitive  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy, with manufacturing and services as the twin engines  of\r\n\r\ngrowth.   In  a knowledge economy, the basis for competitiveness\r\n\r\nwill  be  the capabilities and intellectual capital  to  absorb,\r\n\r\nprocess and apply knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To realise this vision, we require to strengthen our\r\n\r\ncapabilities while managing cost competitiveness.  The  CSC  has\r\n\r\nidentified  eight strategic thrusts.  These are  promoting  high\r\n\r\nvalue-added  manufacturing and services as the twin  engines  of\r\n\r\ngrowth  to  serve global needs;  strengthening and  diversifying\r\n\r\nour   external  wing  and  incorporating  a  global   dimension;\r\n\r\nbuilding  world-class companies;  strengthening  our  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized    local   enterprises;    developing   human   and\r\n\r\nintellectual  capital as a key competitive edge;  leveraging  on\r\n\r\nscience,   technology   and  innovation;   optimising   resource\r\n\r\nmanagement;  and facilitating by the Government to  enhance  our\r\n\r\nbusiness environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has managed to weather the crisis\r\n\r\nrelatively  well so far.  This is the result of  our  consistent\r\n\r\nfocus  on  getting  our fundamentals right - a stable  political\r\n\r\nenvironment,  strong tripartite co-operation,  fiscal  prudence,\r\n\r\ncareful    financial   supervision,   investment   in   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, and a good education system.  These are national\r\n\r\nassets  which  we must jealously guard and continually  nurture.\r\n\r\nWith  our strong fundamentals and our steadfast adherence to  an\r\n\r\nopen-market  philosophy, this crisis has in  fact  enhanced  our\r\n\r\ninternational standing in contrast with the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the regional economic crisis has created serious\r\n\r\nimmediate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchallenges, as well as added an urgent dimension to our  efforts\r\n\r\nto  transit  to  a knowledge economy.  Regional  economies  will\r\n\r\nemerge leaner, fitter and more cost-competitive after they  have\r\n\r\nrestructured their economies.  This means we have to  accelerate\r\n\r\nthe upgrading of our economy so that we are even more productive\r\n\r\nand ready to soar when the region recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC had an extensive discussion of this problem over a year,\r\n\r\nwith valuable inputs from hundreds of people, both in the public\r\n\r\nand  the  private  sectors,  both locals  and  foreigners,  both\r\n\r\npractitioners and academics.  I wish to thank all  of  them  for\r\n\r\ntheir  contributions.  The proposed strategy  and  the  specific\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  CSC  are  comprehensive  and  mutually\r\n\r\nreinforcing, covering both the short term and the long  term.  I\r\n\r\nrecommend  them  to  the  Government  for  adoption  and  prompt\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the acceptance of the CSC recommendations\r\n\r\nwill  require a united response from all Singaporeans to  accept\r\n\r\npainful  cuts  in  CPF  and wages.  The world  is  watching  how\r\n\r\nSingapore is responding to the crisis.  Let us give a clear  and\r\n\r\nresounding  signal  that  as a people we  will  do  whatever  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to compete,  thrive and emerge stronger than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of\r\n\r\nthis  motion  tabled in the name of the Minister for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry, Mr Lee Yock Suan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that this House will strongly endorse the\r\n\r\nstrategies  and policies set out in the Report of the  Committee\r\n\r\non  Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  I note with satisfaction\r\n\r\nthat  the CSC, except for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman  (who\r\n\r\nare  both  Ministers for Trade and Industry),  comprises  mainly\r\n\r\nmembers  who are from the private sector.  Views were diligently\r\n\r\ncollected from a wide segment of private sector members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend the two Ministers for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommittee Members for preparing a comprehensive report  that  is\r\n\r\nbrimming with new and creative ideas and suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn  order for our GPC for Finance, Trade and Industry to  gather\r\n\r\nfeedback  from  the  ground  and  industry  members,   we   held\r\n\r\ndiscussions with representatives of the Singapore International,\r\n\r\nChinese  and  Indian  Chambers of  Commerce  and  Industry,  and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the Singapore Confederation of  Industries,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Hoteliers Association and the Singapore Retailers\r\n\r\nAssociation. Our GPC members and I would like to thank them  for\r\n\r\ntheir  contributions.  We shall relay some  of  their  important\r\n\r\ncomments to this House during the course of this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore's economy is officially in recession as\r\n\r\nwe  have negative growth for the third quarter 1998, and perhaps\r\n\r\nquite  surely  for the fourth quarter 1998.  The CSC  Report  is\r\n\r\ntimely  as  it  sets  out  the  key strategies  for  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsurvival in the immediate and long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is: is this $10 billion rescue\r\n\r\npackage that the CSC has proposed sufficient to pull us  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  recession?   The Government has previously announced  a  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  off-budget measures in June 1998.  We know now that  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  is  not  enough.  The new package is now  $10  billion.\r\n\r\nThis  amount would be more effective than the earlier $2 billion\r\n\r\nbut the question still remains:  is it enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key issue which I would like to pose is whether\r\n\r\nthis  package is in fact expansionary or deflationary.   Central\r\n\r\nto  the  package are the wage and CPF cuts totalling $7 billion.\r\n\r\nThis is the people's money that they are asked to contribute  by\r\n\r\ntightening their belts and bear with CPF and wage cuts.   Hence,\r\n\r\nwhile there is a $7 billion saving for the private sector,  this\r\n\r\nis  dampened by a similar $7 billion drop in consumer  spending.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the  impression is that Government's contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  $10 billion package is only the remaining $3 billion, which\r\n\r\nis 30%.  The equation looks rather unbalanced as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   people  are  bearing  the  main  burden  of  70%  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  share appears to be 30%.  We feel that  Government\r\n\r\ncan do more, and use more of the reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has total reserves amounting to about $120\r\n\r\nbillion.   Since  the start of the recession,  many  individuals\r\n\r\nhave  dipped  into  their own reserves to  weather  this  \"rainy\r\n\r\nperiod\".   Hence, we must accept that the Singapore  economy  is\r\n\r\nnot  only  in  the rainy period but perhaps in  a  storm.   Many\r\n\r\nMinisters  and Government leaders have said this  is  the  worst\r\n\r\neconomic crisis that they have ever seen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is time to draw upon our national reserves. We have\r\n\r\nalready  decided  that Singapore can spend $5  billion  to  help\r\n\r\nIndonesia and I do not know how much we would draw upon to  help\r\n\r\nour neighbours like Malaysia.  But what about helping ourselves?\r\n\r\nIf the Government were to spend just 5% of the total reserves to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singaporeans, the amount to be used would be at  least  $6\r\n\r\nbillion.   If you want to be more generous and use  10%  of  the\r\n\r\nreserves, this would be a very large $12 billion.  I feel it  is\r\n\r\ntime  for Government to be bold and decisive. Having the correct\r\n\r\nmeasures and strategies, and using our reserves wisely, will  be\r\n\r\nconsistent with the effective, efficient and level-headed  image\r\n\r\nof  the  PAP  Government.   Hence, I  would  like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be bold to draw more from our reserves  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed CPF and wage cuts would take up about $7\r\n\r\nbillion  from the local economy in the form of lower  disposable\r\n\r\nincome  of the people.  The $7 billion is about 5% of our annual\r\n\r\nGDP.   Based  on a simple arithmetical computation,  that  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  GDP could well contract by 5%.  If we add the  ripple\r\n\r\neffects  of  the  loss of $7 billion in consumer  spending,  the\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the  economy will have a higher  multiplier  effect.\r\n\r\nAssuming  that  the multiplier effect is double,  then  the  GDP\r\n\r\ncould  even  shrink  by  a total of 10%.  If  this  deflationary\r\n\r\neffect  is  to  take  its  full  course,  this  could  be  quite\r\n\r\nworrisome.  Hence, counter-stimulating measures must be taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a recession, the contractionary effect of the CPF\r\n\r\nand wage cuts is very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nundesirable.   People will stop spending and  the  economy  will\r\n\r\ncontract.   The  local retail and commerce sectors  are  already\r\n\r\nfacing  bad  business.  The mood will be further depressed.   It\r\n\r\nwill cause the economy to spiral downwards much faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is imperative that the Government should introduce\r\n\r\nconcurrently  economic  boosting  measures.  One  area   is   by\r\n\r\nintroducing  cuts in Government tax, rates and fees.  The  first\r\n\r\nobjective is to substantially reduce business costs.  The second\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to  put back money into the people's  pockets  to\r\n\r\nmitigate  the drop in their disposable income due to their  loss\r\n\r\nin wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in theory, although $7 billion is taken out of\r\n\r\ncirculation  from the people's spending, it is  hoped  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  put  back  $7  billion,  if  not   more   into\r\n\r\nstimulating the economy.  This sum of course could in fact  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the savings of the employers in their business costs.   It\r\n\r\ncan also be a combination of other measures like government cuts\r\n\r\nin industrial rentals, port charges, utilities, taxes and levies\r\n\r\nas well as in the form of pump priming by the Government through\r\n\r\nprojects such as infrastructure development, roads, schools,  IT\r\n\r\nprogrammes and R&D spending.  The public's expectation  is  that\r\n\r\nthe Government should contribute an equivalent, if not more,  or\r\n\r\nat  least equal to the CPF and wage cuts, which is $7 billion of\r\n\r\nthis total package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in difficult times. It is crucial that the Government,\r\n\r\nemployers and employees work closely together, hand in  hand  to\r\n\r\novercome this formidable economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am generally in support of the proposed level of CPF cut\r\n\r\nof  10%  and the 5-8% of wage cut.  I feel any deeper  level  of\r\n\r\ncuts  would  have  too  severe  a contradictory  effect  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a word of caution, I would like to urge that employers in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  do  their  part  in  preserving  jobs  and  not\r\n\r\noverdoing the pay cuts of their employees.  Companies  that  are\r\n\r\ndoing well and maintaining profitability should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\navoid that basic wage cuts or year-end bonus cuts.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  employers  should also avoid using this  occasion  to  be\r\n\r\nopportunistic and thereby deliberately reducing too  excessively\r\n\r\ntheir workers' annual pay package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate the effect of the proposed 10% CPF cut, I would like\r\n\r\nto  suggest that a 5% cut can be applied to the Ordinary Account\r\n\r\nand the balance 5% be applied to the Special Account. This would\r\n\r\nalleviate by half the impact of the drop in available funds  for\r\n\r\nhomeowners  with outstanding mortgages.  A 5% cut in  their  CPF\r\n\r\nOrdinary Account will be more manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the Government should nevertheless introduce some\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help those who are badly affected  and  unable  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   servicing  their  existing  housing  loan  repayments\r\n\r\narising  from  the drop in the CPF contributions.   The  schemes\r\n\r\nproposed  should  be able to help not only  those  who  are  HDB\r\n\r\nhomeowners, but also those who are private residential owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One scheme I would like to suggest is to allow taxpayers to\r\n\r\nclaim  for up to a certain amount, say, $10,000-$50,000  yearly,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  how  generous is the Government,  as  tax  relief\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the  interest payable  due  to  the  outstanding\r\n\r\nhousing  mortgages. This tax relief has been introduced in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.   I  suggest that, to be equitable, both HDB  and  private\r\n\r\nhomeowners  be  allowed to enjoy this relief but only  for  loan\r\n\r\nmortgages taken for owner-occupied homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it is taboo or sacred cow to suggest that Government\r\n\r\nallow   Singaporeans  to  draw  on  their  CPF  savings   before\r\n\r\nretirement.    Many   people  are  now   in   severe   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Their CPF savings of course are meant to be  used\r\n\r\nfor  old  age  or retirement.  However, I feel that for  special\r\n\r\ncases,  only on a case-by-case basis, the Government  can  allow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  out  of job because  of  severe  medical\r\n\r\nproblems  and  very desperate of funds with no savings  left  to\r\n\r\ndraw from their CPF savings now.  If need be, even to allow them\r\n\r\nto withdraw from the CPF savings of their immediate relatives if\r\n\r\nthey are in such desperate straits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the proposed wage cut, I feel that the lower level\r\n\r\nworkers should not be made to suffer any basic wage cuts.  There\r\n\r\nmay  be  some  cuts  in their annual bonuses, depending  on  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the respective companies.   But  for  low  wage\r\n\r\nearners,  a cut of even $10 maybe very painful and difficult  to\r\n\r\nmanage as they are already living from hand to mouth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I support a graduated scale of 5% cut for the mid-level\r\n\r\nemployees and a 7.5% cut for the senior and top executives.  For\r\n\r\nthe Ministers, as they have to lead by example, I consider a 10%\r\n\r\ncut,  at  least  a 2.5% larger cut than the top civil  servants,\r\n\r\nwould be quite adequate.  It may be hard on the Ministers but as\r\n\r\nnational leaders, they have to lead by example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> MPs as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes, MPs as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amounts and rates of reduction in Government-related fees\r\n\r\nand  charges have not been specified in the CSC Report.   To  be\r\n\r\ncomplete, it is necessary for the Government to also specify the\r\n\r\ntargeted reduction in various rates and fees.  In fact, so as to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  overall  savings in business  costs  by  15%,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should set definite rates of cuts to be made  by  all\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  and departments, such  as  in  port  charges,\r\n\r\nindustrial  rentals, utilities and telecommunications.   Without\r\n\r\nsetting  the  desired quantum for each fee item, I feel  we  may\r\n\r\nfind  that  the  desired target of 15% cut in  overall  business\r\n\r\ncosts may not be achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has also suggested that the foreign worker levies be\r\n\r\nreduced.   It  has proposed that the reduction be  from  $50  to\r\n\r\n$100.   This  amount, I feel, is too low.  To be bold,  I  think\r\n\r\nthat the Government should consider a 50% cut in the interim  2-year period for such foreign worker levies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I also feel that the Government should allow a 50%\r\n\r\ncut in maid's levy for an interim 2-year period.  This reduction\r\n\r\nwill help many Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  companies, particularly the middle-income families who have\r\n\r\nmaids,  to have more disposable income, which will help them  to\r\n\r\noffset their loss in CPF and wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to pick on an important issue\r\n\r\nraised at page 130 of the CSC Report.  The CSC has proposed that\r\n\r\ngroup  tax  consolidation  be  allowed.    This  will  encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  grow  through new ventures  and  ease  cash  flow\r\n\r\nconstraints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this economic downturn, many companies will encounter\r\n\r\nlosses, including those incurred by their subsidiaries.  This is\r\n\r\nparticularly  so for property developers but applicable  to  all\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Under  present income tax rules, holding  companies\r\n\r\nare  not  allowed  to  offset the  losses of their  subsidiaries\r\n\r\nagainst their profitable ones, even though they are owned by the\r\n\r\nsame  group.   This  rule is particularly  unfair  for  property\r\n\r\ndevelopers  as  it  is  a Government requirement  to  impose  on\r\n\r\nsuccessful  tenderers of Government land sales to form  separate\r\n\r\ncompanies to own land sites purchased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I wish to declare my interest as a director of a property\r\n\r\ndevelopment company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of losses incurred during this recession, companies are\r\n\r\nfacing  huge  write-offs and provisions for losses.   Yet,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  enjoy  any  tax offset against the profitable  projects.\r\n\r\nNormally,  if  all the investments or projects  (that  is,  both\r\n\r\nprofitable and loss-making ones) are put into one company,  they\r\n\r\nwill enjoy the tax offsetting.  The Government does not want  to\r\n\r\nallow tax leakages by allowing group offsetting, especially  for\r\n\r\noverseas projects.  But I feel that for cases of definable local\r\n\r\nprojects   and  investments,  and  also  for  new  ventures   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  R&D  projects  and other new  investments  that  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to incur losses, the Government should consider allowing\r\n\r\nfor group tax offsetting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxpayers are given a 5% tax rebate during this year's Budget\r\n\r\nannouncement.   This  rebate  we  now  see  is  too  low.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can consider introducing reductions in corporate  or\r\n\r\npersonal income tax cuts.  Otherwise, I would like to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Government consider allowing the  tax  rebates\r\n\r\nfor  Year of Assessment 1998 and 1999 to be higher, say,  15-20%\r\n\r\nfor  tax  rebate.  If we recall, Dr Mahathir,  who  is  now  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister of Malaysia, has allowed a total tax relief for\r\n\r\ntaxpayers in Malaysia in 1998.  The idea of a larger tax  rebate\r\n\r\nis  to  encourage  our   taxpayers and companies  to  have  more\r\n\r\ndisposable income.  Hopefully, some of this money will flow back\r\n\r\ninto the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CSC Report has focused on the business sector. Rightly\r\n\r\nso,  as  we need to formulate plans for the immediate  and  long\r\n\r\nterm,  concepts  and strategies for Singapore  to  survive  this\r\n\r\ncurrent recession and remain competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report contains 168 pages. It is a very thorough and\r\n\r\nwell-researched report.  Many sections are devoted to  long-term\r\n\r\nstrategies, some of which my other GPC Members will comment on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel strongly that a total review should be done to help\r\n\r\neveryone in Singapore.  There should be constant monitoring  and\r\n\r\nfeedback.  Besides the business sector, we should not forget the\r\n\r\nindividuals.   The  total economic rescue  package  should  also\r\n\r\ninclude  help  for the individuals, especially  for  the  poorer\r\n\r\nsegments  of  the people.  A comprehensive rescue  package  will\r\n\r\nhelp  garner  total  support from the entire  population.    The\r\n\r\nchances  of success will be enhanced.  Let us take heart.   With\r\n\r\neffective measures and determination in the implementation,  let\r\n\r\nus   work  closely  together  to  pull  ourselves  out  of  this\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me, first,\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  CSC for the comprehensive  way  in  which  it\r\n\r\nprepared  the  Report,  and also the rapid  way  in  which  they\r\n\r\nchanged  horses mid-stream to deal with the economic  crisis  at\r\n\r\nhand.   The short-term packages, personally, I have no  quarrel.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  CPF wage cut has all been announced  before  the\r\n\r\nReport was published.  But I only hope that the Government  will\r\n\r\nalso consider the assistance to be given to mortgage houseowners\r\n\r\nin  order to alleviate the problem when the CPF is cut.   And  I\r\n\r\nalso hope that Government Ministries and departments\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill respond equally fast to reduce charges in equal measure  to\r\n\r\nkeep tab with the wage reduction that the people will suffer  in\r\n\r\nreturn.  In fact, those of us in the private sector have already\r\n\r\ndone so.  Many of us have already cut the bonuses almost by 80%-90%, and some companies have already decreased wages by about 10-15%.   As regards availability of capital, I do not think it  is\r\n\r\nan issue.  I think our banks have very sound fundamentals and if\r\n\r\nthe projects are bankable, there will be no lack of finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to comment today, rather than on the short-term measures which I think other Members will have a field day,\r\n\r\nis  to  comment on the future competitiveness section which  the\r\n\r\nCSC  Report has delved on at length.  I think the three elements\r\n\r\nthat were mentioned in the Report are very important.  First  of\r\n\r\nall,  the  strengthening  of the external  wing  post-recession;\r\n\r\nsecond, the human and intellectual capital that we have  got  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up; and, third, the optimal resource management  that  we\r\n\r\nmust exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans must realise that there is a basic shift in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  climate  in Singapore, and  it  is  not  just  an\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis.  This economic crisis, in fact, is a  wake  up\r\n\r\ncall  for us.  Our competitiveness has been eroded since  before\r\n\r\nthe  recession.   It  has  progressively  gone  worse,  but  the\r\n\r\nregional crisis has brought it out into stark perspective, which\r\n\r\ntherefore  means that post-economic crisis the same issues  will\r\n\r\nremain  with us, that of competitiveness.  If we at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  economic crisis are still as uncompetitive as before, then\r\n\r\nI think we will be in dire straits.  Everyone of us  Government,\r\n\r\nindustries  and our people  must take this opportunity  to  make\r\n\r\nourselves trimmer and leaner to prepare for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Mexico last year and I found in Mexico most of the MNCs\r\n\r\nwere there.  They were there because Mexico was competitive  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  NAFTA  which  provides the  market.   So  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nindustries, especially electronic industries, some of  them  are\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore, have moved to Mexico.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just came back from Europe over the weekend. I visited\r\n\r\nGermany, France and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAustria.   Even in developed countries like Germany and  France,\r\n\r\nthey  are taking very drastic measures to revamp the industries,\r\n\r\nto cut costs and they retrenched workers by the thousands.  Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  they  are  facing  competition  from  countries  within\r\n\r\nEurope.   In  Austria, in fact, most of the big MNCs which  have\r\n\r\noperations in Europe also have their plants there.  Some of them\r\n\r\neven  put  their headquarters there.  The reason is because  the\r\n\r\nAustrians'  wage  levels are lower than  most  of  Europe.   The\r\n\r\nworkforce is also intelligent and educated.  This is not only to\r\n\r\nspeak  of  Europe itself but Northern Ireland, for example,  and\r\n\r\nScotland.   Scotland and Northern Ireland together  account  for\r\n\r\n45%  of  export of electronic equipment to EC.  So countries  in\r\n\r\nEurope  and the US have other alternatives, not in Asia, but  in\r\n\r\nEurope  and  in  their own continents.  If  we  are  to  attract\r\n\r\ninvestments from these countries, then we must ourselves be more\r\n\r\ncompetitive than countries in these continents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response is not just Government, because the Government does\r\n\r\nnot  make up the country.  The people make up the country.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can have all the policies but if the people  do  not\r\n\r\nrespond, there is nothing the Government can do.  My message  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is that we must adjust our abilities to meet  these\r\n\r\nchallenges.   We must acquire new knowledge and we must  respond\r\n\r\nto  the  Government's call for retraining  on  new  ways  to  do\r\n\r\nthings.  All the people in the rest of the world are doing this.\r\n\r\nIf we are not doing that, we are in deep trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must also adjust our own living standards. We have\r\n\r\nbeen  used  to years of high growth and high wage increases,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  so  that we do not know what bad times are.  I think  many\r\n\r\npeople would not want to say this, but I will say this.  I think\r\n\r\nwe  have got to have some pain.  I think without pain, there can\r\n\r\nbe  no  incentive  to  improve.  I think  we  will  be  deluding\r\n\r\nourselves if we think that this recession will pass and everyone\r\n\r\nof  us  will be better in the process.  We are not.   All of  us\r\n\r\nwill  suffer.   Some of us suffer less, some of us suffer  more.\r\n\r\nThe Government's duty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  to  help  those who cannot help themselves  and  make  their\r\n\r\nsuffering a bit more bearable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? It means that we probably have to eat into\r\n\r\nour  savings  that we accumulated over the good years.   As  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has said, instead of going  to  the  US  for  a\r\n\r\nholiday,  go  to Bintan.  It is one-fifth the cost.   You  still\r\n\r\nhave  a  good holiday.  You still got some money left  for  your\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very dismayed when I read in the New Paper two weeks ago\r\n\r\nthat some children were saying, \"I'm not going to take a cut  in\r\n\r\nallowance,  because there is no recession yet.\"   This  kind  of\r\n\r\nattitude, I think, has to change, because without the  pain,  we\r\n\r\nare not likely to be galvanised into action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is in our favour? I think we still have a hardworking\r\n\r\nworkforce.   There is no denial about it and that has  been  our\r\n\r\nselling  point all these years.  Our workforce has  been  ranked\r\n\r\nnumber   one   or  two  consistently.   We  have   a   fantastic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, equal to none.  Our educational institutions are\r\n\r\none   of   the  best,  if  not  the  best,  especially  in   the\r\n\r\ntechnological  field.   So we can do a lot  of  things  to  help\r\n\r\nourselves.   The  question is whether we are prepared  to  avail\r\n\r\nourselves of this.  If our people can respond to the retraining,\r\n\r\nto  the tightening of the belt and to live a frugal life instead\r\n\r\nof  spending money on wasteful things and if we complement  this\r\n\r\nwith  the good fundamentals that the Government has put  out,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  stand a very good chance in overcoming the recession.\r\n\r\nThat  is  not the problem.  The recession will be overcome  but,\r\n\r\nmore  important,  I think we should be able to face  the  future\r\n\r\nstronger because we are dealing with a very fundamental problem,\r\n\r\nthat of surviving in the long term, not the short term.  For the\r\n\r\nshort term, all of us can do it.  But in the long term, we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  be fit and able and the Government's duty is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat we can do that and I hope that the people of Singapore will\r\n\r\ncome  together with the Government, change their lifestyles  and\r\n\r\nwork  towards the common good of bringing ourselves out of  this\r\n\r\nrecession,  leaner,  trimmer,  hungrier  and,  of  course,  more\r\n\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nworkers  shall  bear  the  brunt of  the  cost-cutting  measures\r\n\r\nrecommended  by  the  Committee on Singapore's  Competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe  CSC has recommended a 15% wage cut from the 1997 level, 10%\r\n\r\nof  which shall be from the employer's component of the CPF  and\r\n\r\nthe balance from the flexi-wage scheme part of the wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th November this year, the National Wages Council\r\n\r\nrecommended  a  cut  of  5-8% of the  workers'  wages.   If  the\r\n\r\nemployers choose to cut workers' flexi-wage as high as 8%,  then\r\n\r\ntogether  with the 10% cut in the employer's component  of  CPF,\r\n\r\nthe  workers can lose up to 15% of wages a month.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to be slow in implementing these recommendations. The\r\n\r\nworkers already suffered once in 1985 when  Singapore went  into\r\n\r\na  recession.  At that time, the workers' wages suffered  a  15%\r\n\r\ndrop when 15% of the employers' CPF were cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the local press that for the first nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the year, 20,000 workers were retrenched.   But  how\r\n\r\nmany  of  these workers are foreign workers?  I understand  that\r\n\r\nMNCs  are  allowed  to hire as many as four foreign  workers  to\r\n\r\nevery  one  Singaporean  worker the  company  employs.   So  the\r\n\r\nMinister  should make sure that the number of Singapore  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  retrenched  is  significant  before  implementing  the\r\n\r\nrecommended wage cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my meet-the-people sessions in my constituency so far, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  have any resident coming to complain that he is out  of\r\n\r\njob.  Employers should not be encouraged to jump the gun and cut\r\n\r\nworkers'  wages  prematurely, since there is  so  much  talk  of\r\n\r\ncutting workers' wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is in support of the 10% employers' CPF cut.\r\n\r\nInstead of just recommending that 10% of the employers'  CPF  be\r\n\r\ncut,  the NTUC should also recommend that the employees' CPF  be\r\n\r\ncut  by an equivalent amount.  With the 10% employees' CPF  cut,\r\n\r\nthe  workers  can have more take-home pay.  This is particularly\r\n\r\nimportant to single breadwinners in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamily.  If there is only one spouse working in the family, that\r\n\r\nfamily  often finds that it cannot make ends meet.   The  single\r\n\r\nbread earner has to take on a part-time additional job which  he\r\n\r\nmay  not  be able to hold continuously.  The extra 10%  cash  in\r\n\r\nlieu of a CPF reduction shall come in very handy.  Some will say\r\n\r\nthat in such a case, that worker will not have enough CPF in the\r\n\r\naccount to pay for his CPF monthly loan instalments.  In such  a\r\n\r\ncase,  I would say that the HDB as well as the Government should\r\n\r\ngive a helping hand. The HDB could restructure the mortgage loan\r\n\r\nand  work out a longer repayment period.  If that does not  help\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  then the Government should step in  and  use  its\r\n\r\nsurpluses  collected  over the last 10  years  to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers' HDB monthly loan instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is reported to have accumulated $122 billion in\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  So setting aside $5 billion to help out our  workers\r\n\r\nin  time  of  need is not asking too much of the Government.   I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that  the  Government owes a duty  to  the  nation's\r\n\r\nworkers  to  tide them over the next one or two years  when  the\r\n\r\nrecession  takes its worst toll.  The Government  can  charge  a\r\n\r\nnominal  interest  rate of 2% and have the loans  secured  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond mortgage after the HDB.  I am certain a scheme like  that\r\n\r\ncan  be worked out to help the workers since $5 billion is  less\r\n\r\nthan  5%  of the amount of the Government's surpluses  collected\r\n\r\nover the years.  I wish the NTUC will support this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the CSC has only recommended a reduction of the\r\n\r\nlevy  for  both  skilled and unskilled foreign  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector, but not for domestic maids.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  reduce the levy  of  all  foreign  workers,\r\n\r\nincluding  domestic maids, by $100-$200 per month.  By  lowering\r\n\r\nthe  levy, employers shall pay less for foreign workers and this\r\n\r\nshould  be all right since foreign workers mostly work  in  jobs\r\n\r\nwhich  local  workers are not willing to do so, for example,  in\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry,  road works or  MRT  sites.   Local\r\n\r\nworkers shall thus not be deprived of their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the charges for electricity,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications and port services\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould be reduced.  I would further suggest that Singapore Power\r\n\r\nstop  collecting  water conservation charges  and  also  not  to\r\n\r\ncollect  interest  and  penalties for late  payments  until  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  is over.  The reason is that  electricity  and\r\n\r\nwater  consumers have placed sufficient deposits with  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower in their accounts.  No interest is paid by Singapore Power\r\n\r\nto  consumers  for  the use of their deposit  money.   Singapore\r\n\r\nPower  can  use  the  interest earned from the  vast  amount  of\r\n\r\ndeposits placed with them by account holders over the past years\r\n\r\nto offset the lost interest as a result of late payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the CSC that rentals for Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  and Housing and Development Board land and  factory\r\n\r\nrentals  should  be reduced.  I would further suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nsale price of new HDB flats should also be reduced, since prices\r\n\r\nof   building   materials  and  building  costs   have   dropped\r\n\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also agree with the CSC that motor vehicle customs\r\n\r\nduty and petrol diesel duty be reduced, and the 55% property tax\r\n\r\nrebate  be  extended.  I would also support  the  suspension  of\r\n\r\nstamp  duty  on  share transactions and to lower  corporate  and\r\n\r\npersonal income tax.  In these hard times, I would also call  on\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  and his Ministers to voluntarily  take  at\r\n\r\nleast  a  25% pay cut.  I understand that in the private sector,\r\n\r\nmany workers are suffering a freeze on their salaries and others\r\n\r\nare  taking a 20% cut on their pay.  It is reported that company\r\n\r\ndirectors  are  taking  a  50% cut  on  their  directors'  fees.\r\n\r\nSingapore  Ministers are reputed to be the highest paid  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  So a 25% cut on the Ministers' salary shall still  leave\r\n\r\nthem with a lot to live on comfortably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers are top leaders of the country and a significant\r\n\r\ngesture on their part in these difficult times shall be a  great\r\n\r\nboost  to the morale of the whole country.  The Ministers should\r\n\r\ntake  a  pay cut at this point of time.  An act like that  shall\r\n\r\njell  the  whole  nation, as they can  say  that  they  lead  by\r\n\r\nexample.   They  really show solidarity with the workers.   They\r\n\r\nhave a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngenuine feel for the people. The Ministers have gone down to the\r\n\r\nNTUC  and tell them, \"United we stand.\" Such a pronouncement  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of Ministers sounds hollow if they do not  share  the\r\n\r\nsufferings  of  the  workers who are  expected  to  take  a  15%\r\n\r\nreduction in their monthly wage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people also are complaining about the 3% GST imposed\r\n\r\non  all  goods and services. They want the Government to suspend\r\n\r\nGST  for  the time being until the financial crisis is over.   I\r\n\r\nhope the Government can give a positive response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to comment on the CSC's vision for\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the next decade.  It wants Singapore to become  an\r\n\r\nadvanced  globally competitive knowledge economy.  I  quote  the\r\n\r\nCSC's Report:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We should be a knowledge economy where the basis for\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  will  be  the  capabilities  and   intellectual\r\n\r\ncapital to absorb, process and apply knowledge.  We should  have\r\n\r\na  strong technological capability and a vibrant entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nculture that thrives on creativity, nimbleness and good business\r\n\r\nsense. To develop into a knowledge economy, Singapore should  be\r\n\r\nan  open  cosmopolitan society, attractive to global talent  and\r\n\r\nconnected with other global  knowledge nodes.  There should be a\r\n\r\ncritical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\ninnovators  and arbitrageurs.  Together with the global  talent,\r\n\r\nthey will move Singapore ahead in the Information Age.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely agree with this vision. In Japan they had this\r\n\r\nsimilar  vision,  ie, to develop a knowledge economy   in  1992.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  in  Japan which hindered the  attainment  of  this\r\n\r\nvision  was  their  culture  of  bureaucratic  leadership.   The\r\n\r\nbureaucratic civil servants run the country.  It is said that in\r\n\r\nJapan  the  measures adopted under bureaucratic leadership  were\r\n\r\naimed not at development for the future, but maintenance of  the\r\n\r\nstatus quo.  Can Singapore attain a knowledge economy within the\r\n\r\nnext  decade?   I  personally  think  that  we  cannot  do   so.\r\n\r\nSingapore is worse than Japan.  We do not only have a culture of\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  leadership but we have in place  a  dominant  one-party  rule  that  is  bent  in  perpetuating  its  rule.    The\r\n\r\norganisation  of  the  whole  of  Singapore  is  such  that  the\r\n\r\nleadership  must  come from the party or the top.   In  the  CSC\r\n\r\nReport, at page 118, it is mentioned:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The World Competitiveness Yearbook indicated that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  adopted a centralised, top-down  decision-making\r\n\r\napproach in government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that the PAP will change its style or form of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It  wants a firm control of the country.   On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, the CSC envisages that in a knowledge economy \"there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  critical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  innovators  and  arbitrageurs\".   In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  will the present PAP political system allow a  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   a  critical  mass  of  leaders  who   can   think\r\n\r\nindependently and develop independently?  I do not think so.   I\r\n\r\nmake  this assessment after having been in politics in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  22 years and an elected MP for 14 years.  Just look at  all\r\n\r\naspects  of  the Singapore society, whether it be  in  business,\r\n\r\nsports, culture or social activities, you see a PAP Minister,  a\r\n\r\nPAP  MP  or a PAP man in charge.  So nationally I cannot  see  a\r\n\r\ncritical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\ninnovators and arbitrageurs to emerge unless, of course, we have\r\n\r\na  reformation,  a  material change  in  the  political  system.\r\n\r\nInstead of a one-party rule, we have democratic pluralism, maybe\r\n\r\na  two-party system and the Government of the day behaves  in  a\r\n\r\nmore  traditional way, ie, to collect taxes,  maintain  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity,  external  defence, foreign  policies  and  leave  the\r\n\r\ncommerce and business to its private citizens.  It is only under\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system  where Singaporeans are given more  freedom  can\r\n\r\ntruly great, great business leaders emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the CSC Report has missed one important issue, and\r\n\r\nthat  is, our relationship with our closest neighbour, Malaysia.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  Singapore's most important trading  partner.   Our\r\n\r\nwater  supply  is also from Malaysia.  For the long  term  well-being  of  our economy, Singapore must enter into some  kind  of\r\n\r\neconomic  relationship with Malaysia which benefits both  sides.\r\n\r\nI  have  suggested in this House that Singapore seek an economic\r\n\r\nunion  with  Malaysia.  The CSC Report  has  mentioned  that  \"A\r\n\r\nlimited  domestic market poses a serious impediment to expansion\r\n\r\nand  constrains investment in equipment, technology  and  modern\r\n\r\nmanagement methods.\"  If\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  can bring about an economic union with Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  our small size or limited domestic  market  can  be\r\n\r\nsolved.   But  the ultimate aim of our economic union  must  not\r\n\r\nonly  be for the benefit of Singapore, it must be for the mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit  of both countries.  I call on the Government to  strive\r\n\r\nfor an economic union with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  recall  a  conversation I had 10 years  ago  with  the  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer of a very huge Japanese multi-national because\r\n\r\nI  wanted  to  understand the bottoms-up  philosophy  among  the\r\n\r\nJapanese workers.  And he told me, \"It is not as simple  as  you\r\n\r\nthink  because normally workers will be told what their  leaders\r\n\r\nwant and they will know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in these economic tough times, it is\r\n\r\nheartening to learn that Singaporeans understand and accept  the\r\n\r\nneed  for painful wage cuts.  Dr Yaacob Ibrahim summed up  these\r\n\r\nsentiments  very well in The New Paper of 18th  November  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  quote him here:  \"The general feeling  is  that\r\n\r\npeople understand and accept that there must be wage cuts.  They\r\n\r\nare  glad  to  have a job that pays less, than no job  at  all.\"\r\n\r\nYes,  isn't it better to have a job that pays less, than to have\r\n\r\nno  job  at all?  But I would also like to stress that  what  is\r\n\r\nvery  important is that most Singaporeans today still hold their\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for us, Mr Speaker, the prudent policies and\r\n\r\nfinancial  foresight of our Government have spared  us  from  an\r\n\r\neconomic  meltdown of Titanic proportions.  We  should  be  glad\r\n\r\nthat  our Government and people did not see our economy  as  the\r\n\r\nTitanic's captain, crew and passengers did their ship  in  1912.\r\n\r\nIt  has  happened, it will happen again if we are  not  careful.\r\n\r\nSo,  therefore, it is worthwhile to recall that voyage  made  by\r\n\r\nthe   Titanic  and  its  maiden  voyage  that  was  filled  with\r\n\r\nexhilaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits were high, the air was heavy with excitement and\r\n\r\njubilation.   The  crew  and  the  well-heeled  passengers  were\r\n\r\nfortified in their belief that they were on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe safest ship ever built in the world.  They all looked to the\r\n\r\nship  as unsinkable, just as many governments, corporations  and\r\n\r\npeople  in  this part of the world looked at their economies  as\r\n\r\nthough these economies were invulnerable.  The celebratory  mood\r\n\r\namong  the passengers continued into the voyage and as the  ship\r\n\r\nsailed  towards its destination, the passengers wined and dined.\r\n\r\nThey  indulged in pleasures without a care in the world  -  just\r\n\r\nlike  some governments, some corporations and people around  the\r\n\r\nworld, especially this region, preoccupying themselves with mega-borrowings and spendings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers on board the Titanic were enjoying themselves to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  that they were blinded to the fact  that  the  ship\r\n\r\ncould  be  in danger.  When warning signals became apparent  and\r\n\r\nthe  captain  was  told of them, he dismissed those  dangers  as\r\n\r\nnothing  more  than nuisances, as he did not  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nTitanic could be in trouble.  As the danger became more and more\r\n\r\napparent, the captain and the people on board still chose not to\r\n\r\nheed  it  but  carried  on with their preoccupations.   Finally,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their over-confidence and slowness  to  react,  the\r\n\r\nTitanic went smack into real danger - just like what happened to\r\n\r\nmany countries and many economies in this part of the world that\r\n\r\nwere caught unawares by the quick rises and falls of the markets\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the  way  money was transacted at  lightning  speeds\r\n\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, amidst this current regional economic crisis,\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy has also been affected.  While we  have  not\r\n\r\nemerged  unharmed, fortunately, we have not been seen  as  badly\r\n\r\nhit  as our neighbours.  Hopefully, with the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  CSC,  we will be able to avoid the worst and pick ourselves\r\n\r\nup again as quickly as possible, and be in the front of the race\r\n\r\nwhen others are still picking themselves up.  While figures show\r\n\r\nthat some 40,000 are expected to be retrenched by the end of the\r\n\r\nyear,  I think we are still relatively fortunate.  The estimates\r\n\r\nare not very much higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the CDCs (Community Development Councils) will do all\r\n\r\nthey  can to find as many jobs as possible, to ferret them  out,\r\n\r\nso that they will be able to find alternative jobs for those who\r\n\r\nlose  their jobs or are being retrenched.  For instance, in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Marine  Parade  district,  last  year,  we  helped  30\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to find jobs; this year, in 1998 up to  now,  about\r\n\r\n700 jobs.  So who says that there is no one Singaporean that has\r\n\r\nlost his job?  Thanks here to Ministry of Manpower, NTUC, ADECCO\r\n\r\n(ADECCO   is   a  private  international  employment  assistance\r\n\r\ncompany),   and  MDIS  (Management  Development   Institute   of\r\n\r\nSingapore).  In fact, these two private organisations have  done\r\n\r\nmore  than  their fair share.  What they have done  actually  is\r\n\r\nalso  to organise courses so that workers who choose not  to  go\r\n\r\nimmediately  into  another employment  can  also  choose  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained or retrained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I said at the outset that the most important\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  the majority of Singaporeans are  still  having\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.   And I think that this is a very important  point,\r\n\r\nand  I attribute this to the kiasu attitude of Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Contrary to common perception,  kiasuism  need\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily be bad.  Who says it is bad?  It  is  bad  only\r\n\r\nwhen  it  makes the Singaporeans ugly - when they become greedy,\r\n\r\nself-centred,  selfish, envious, discourteous  and  unkind.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  certainly do not want to be  like  what  the\r\n\r\neconomist,  Mr  E. F. Schumacher, said in his  book,  \"Small  is\r\n\r\nBeautiful\".  Allow me to quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If human vices such as greed and envy are systematically\r\n\r\ncultivated,  the  inevitable  result  is  nothing  less  than  a\r\n\r\ncollapse  of  intelligence.  A man driven by greed  or  by  envy\r\n\r\nloses  the power of seeing things as they really are, of  seeing\r\n\r\nthings  in  their roundness and their wholeness,  and  his  very\r\n\r\nsuccesses become failures.  If the whole society become infected\r\n\r\nby  these vices, they may indeed achieve astonishing things  but\r\n\r\nthey   become  increasingly  incapable  of  solving   the   most\r\n\r\nelementary problems of everyday existence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we must not allow selfishness, greed, anger to take\r\n\r\npriority   over   more  important  and  serious   issues.    The\r\n\r\nrecommendations put up by the CSC, taken in the  right  attitude\r\n\r\nand  casting self-interest aside, could, I believe, bring us out\r\n\r\nof troubled waters and help us weather whatever storms that come\r\n\r\nin future and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nride them out confidently.  Therefore, these recommendations can\r\n\r\nbe seen as worthy kiasu measures to ensure our self-preservation\r\n\r\nand  success.   We should see the recommendations  as  something\r\n\r\nthat  is good for all Singaporeans.  And so I would like to urge\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean  to  see  it  in  its  big  picture,  because\r\n\r\nsquabbling  and quarrelling must be avoided at  all  costs.   We\r\n\r\nshould  channel our energies into ensuring that we pull  through\r\n\r\nthese tough times and not wallow in them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far we are all right. If we had been\r\n\r\nmanaged by a different band of less than capable people, then  I\r\n\r\nthink we would find ourselves in an entirely different position.\r\n\r\nYes,  we are small, and small is indeed beautiful, but only when\r\n\r\nit  is  properly managed.  We have a combination of  both.   The\r\n\r\nbeauty  of being small in Singapore is that we can reach out  to\r\n\r\nevery  corner  of  Singapore and be kept up-to-  date  with  the\r\n\r\nlatest goings-on.  After all, we all do that, don't we?  We walk\r\n\r\nour little corner of the island on weekends, we go from home  to\r\n\r\nhome talking to our residents, learning from them, listening  to\r\n\r\nthem,  finding out what they want, what help they need  or  what\r\n\r\nhelp  they  don't need.  So, in a situation like  what  we  have\r\n\r\ntoday,  we are able to confidently assess and describe  how  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  doing  and have our fingers on  the  pulse  of  the\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, take Mountbatten, we were concerned with how our\r\n\r\npeople are faring in this economic crisis, because they all have\r\n\r\nbeen  moved from rental flats into 4- or 5-room flats, new ones,\r\n\r\nexpensive  ones too.  I guess we must have walked a few  hundred\r\n\r\nhomes  over  a couple of months and I am relieved to  know  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  them are still able to maintain their homes, they  are\r\n\r\nable  to pay their SC&C charges, their monthly instalments,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   But this brings out a very important point.   Most  of\r\n\r\nthese  people who have moved into new flats, they are living  in\r\n\r\nextended families.  You have your grandmother, your grandfather,\r\n\r\nyour father, your mother, your brothers, sisters, and so on, and\r\n\r\nwhen  one  person  gets retrenched, the  others  chip  in.   The\r\n\r\nstrength and virtue of the extended family\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  still  very  strong.  But there is a  present  tendency  for\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  break  out into nuclear families.   Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the challenge in the 21st century is to find  ways\r\n\r\nand  means  to  see how we can keep family support  healthy  and\r\n\r\nfirmly  in  place, so that people will remain safe not  only  in\r\n\r\ntimes of crisis but also in better times as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This should serve as a reminder to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat economic development and prosperity should not be taken for\r\n\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me speak generally on short-term measures and\r\n\r\nlong-term  strategies.  In  this region,  the  present  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  was  sparked  off by a financial turmoil.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\nnatural  that everyone is concerned with how to manage, regulate\r\n\r\nand supervise over the short term capital flows.   But in nature\r\n\r\nand  concept,  capital  flows  and trade  flows  are  different.\r\n\r\nMeasures  on capital flows, especially on speculative short-term\r\n\r\ncapital  flows, should not derail long-term objectives of  trade\r\n\r\nliberalisation.  The plan for a free\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrade area, whether it is in the Asia-Pacific or in ASEAN,  must\r\n\r\nbe persistently pushed forward  for implementation as planned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in Singapore, the Committee on Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  (CSC)  Report  also  covered  both   short-term\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  long-term  strategies.   But  the  two  types  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  should  not  be  confused and  mixed   together.   The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  editorial on 13th November mentioned  that   the\r\n\r\nlong-term  and  short-term recommendations  taken  together  may\r\n\r\nconfuse the public.  This is totally unnecessary.  The Committee\r\n\r\nwas  established  in  May 1997  to review  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness over the next 10 years.  But two  months  later,\r\n\r\nin  July  1997, the region was taken by surprise by a  financial\r\n\r\nturmoil  which  turned into an economic crisis.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nCSC had to recommend short-term measures to deal with the impact\r\n\r\nof  this crisis on Singapore's economy.  To put it simply,  even\r\n\r\nwithout  the  present regional economic crisis, we  should  also\r\n\r\nstudy and take stock of our economic achievements in the last 12\r\n\r\nyears,  and  understand our strengths and weaknesses  so  as  to\r\n\r\nformulate our economic development strategy for the future.   We\r\n\r\nshould understand and realise that even before this crisis,  the\r\n\r\nrelative  unit labour cost (RULC) has been rising,  and  we  are\r\n\r\ngradually losing our competitive edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the short-term measures, we must first reflect on the\r\n\r\nproblems, cope with the changes in order to tide over the crisis\r\n\r\n(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness is decided by a number of factors, including (1)\r\n\r\ncost;  (2)  productivity;  and (3)  the  exchange  rate  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar against other currencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me raise three issues: first, productivity and\r\n\r\nexchange  rate.  The Committee recommends cost-cutting and  also\r\n\r\nemphasises  on  the  need  to  develop  human  and  intellectual\r\n\r\ncapital,  and  leverage on science, technology  and  innovation.\r\n\r\nAll  these measures expand our capacity building and improve our\r\n\r\nproductivity so as to strengthen our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlong-term  competitiveness.   However,  the  Committee  has  not\r\n\r\nclearly analysed and explained why the S$ depreciation is not  a\r\n\r\nviable  option to deal with the current economic  crisis.   Some\r\n\r\nacademicians,  businessmen  and others  still  believe  that  S$\r\n\r\ndepreciation  is the easiest way out.  With depreciation  of  S$\r\n\r\ncurrency,  we  may be able to avoid wage cut and  other  painful\r\n\r\nmarket  adjustments.   But we must also  realise  and  face  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of S$ depreciation, for example, prices of imported\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services from equipment, spare parts  to  food  will\r\n\r\nincrease;  the value of our CPF savings and other assets  in  S$\r\n\r\nterms  will  decline, and our position as a financial  hub  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  adversely  impacted.  I am glad that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTrade  and Industry had just mentioned this point in his speech.\r\n\r\nBut  when we talk to the community leaders, trade unionists  and\r\n\r\nthe  people, we must reiterate the explanation of this issue  on\r\n\r\nS$ depreciation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is cost-cutting. In general, the unions\r\n\r\nhave  already  accepted the recommendations of the Committee  to\r\n\r\ncut  wage  cost.  We should all remember that this  is  not  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time that the CPF is cut; and this is also not the  first\r\n\r\ntime  that  the employees suffer a pay-cut.  The  CSC  has  also\r\n\r\nrecommended  that the Government should cut down non-wage  costs\r\n\r\nsuch   as   rentals,   service  charges   on   electricity   and\r\n\r\ncommunication, and port charges.  The private sector  must  take\r\n\r\nsimilar  measures to cut cost.  They should cut  their  rentals,\r\n\r\ninterests, transport charges and other non-wage costs.  In terms\r\n\r\nof  wage  cost,  for  companies which are not  doing  well,  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  should  make downward adjustment  of  the  directors\r\n\r\nfees,  and the pay and allowances of management staff.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  for  companies which are doing well,  they  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  give their employees what they deserve.   In  this\r\n\r\narea, we should consider two concrete measures: (1) when we  can\r\n\r\ncut  down  the  variable  component  of  wage  and  salary,  the\r\n\r\nmagnitude  of the cut for the lower-income employees  should  be\r\n\r\nless  than that of the managerial and executive staff;  and  (2)\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  consider  giving assistance package to the  lower-income\r\n\r\ngroup,  eg,  in  the  form  of rental,  S&C  charges,  utilities\r\n\r\nrebates, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unions, business community, Government and Parliament\r\n\r\nunanimously  accept these cost-cutting measures,  this  resolute\r\n\r\ndecision  will  send  a strong signal to the  market  and  boost\r\n\r\ninvestors'  confidence  on Singapore.  This  will  have  a  very\r\n\r\npositive and decisive effect on our economic recovery.   Looking\r\n\r\naround the world, very few  governments can propose reduction in\r\n\r\nwages  and  welfare benefits of the employees without causing  a\r\n\r\nboycott  and  protest from the trade unions, or even  causing  a\r\n\r\npolitical turmoil. Our people of Singapore, especially the union\r\n\r\nmembers,  understand  the  whole  macro-economic  situation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the long term implications of our  economy,  and\r\n\r\nthey have gallantly agreed to make the necessary adjustments and\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  The union members should be commended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic crisis has given rise to a sense of\r\n\r\nanxiety (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), a sense of crisis, and the\r\n\r\nexpectation  of good Government leadership.  If we can  overcome\r\n\r\nthe present difficulties within a short time, the cohesion among\r\n\r\nthe  people will be strengthened and the bond between the people\r\n\r\nand  the  Government will be further consolidated.  A few  years\r\n\r\nlater, when we look back at the current economic crisis, we will\r\n\r\nsay  that when it comes to the crunch, we the common people have\r\n\r\nmade  the necessary adjustments and painful sacrifices,  thereby\r\n\r\nenabling  our  economy to recover, and that our  Government  has\r\n\r\nonce again led us out of the valley of economic recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is tax cuts. The CSC has also recommended\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  reduce tax rates or give rebates  on  the\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax, company tax and foreign worker levy.   Tax\r\n\r\ncuts  take place after economic returns and are below the bottom\r\n\r\nline, while cost cuts take place before economic returns and are\r\n\r\nabove the bottom line. Tax cuts will help stimulate investments,\r\n\r\nencourage  hard  work  and strengthen the  propensity  to  save.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, tax cuts are not cost\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncutting measures.  In tax cuts, some people, including Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee   Tong,  seem  to  focus  their  attention  on  the  GST   (\r\n\r\n).   They  proposed that the Government should  abolish  GST  or\r\n\r\nreduce the GST rate.  In fact, GST is not part of business  cost\r\n\r\n(apart  from some administrative costs).  Businessmen  are  only\r\n\r\ntax  collection agents for the Government, and if  their  annual\r\n\r\nbusiness  turnover is less than $1 million, businesses need  not\r\n\r\ncollect GST, unless they volunteer to register as GST collection\r\n\r\nagents.  Those who think that GST will add to business costs are\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion on how GST would affect consumption expenditure\r\n\r\nis  more  relevant.  But here, we must pay attention  to  a  few\r\n\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the import linkages, that is to say, most of our\r\n\r\nconsumer  goods  from  food to electrical  home  appliances  are\r\n\r\nimported.  Secondly, our domestic market is very small.  Private\r\n\r\nconsumption  expenditure  accounted  for  only  40%   of   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure, whereas the Government consumption expenditure  was\r\n\r\nonly  9%.  Mr Leong Horn Kee said that the proposed CPF and wage\r\n\r\ncuts  of  $7  billion  would lead to a loss  of  $7  billion  in\r\n\r\nconsumption  expenditure is incorrect.  Further, the GST rate is\r\n\r\nonly  3%.  In Europe, the rate is between 13% and 25%.  In Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  like  Japan, Korea and Taiwan, their consumption  tax\r\n\r\nrates  are much higher than that of Singapore.  The other  point\r\n\r\nis  that  when  GST was first introduced in 1994, the Government\r\n\r\nhad  cut  income  tax  and property tax,  and  gave  rebates  on\r\n\r\nrentals,  S&C  charges   for  the  lower-income  families.   The\r\n\r\ndifference  between  GST  revenue  and  revenue  loss   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from the tax cuts and expenditure on the package  of\r\n\r\nrebates is pretty narrow. In other words, GST is revenue-neutral\r\n\r\nor  even  negative.  Based  on these reasons,  from  the  macro-economic perspective, the stimulative effect from a cut  in  GST\r\n\r\non our consumption expenditure cannot be substantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, more attention must be given to our long-term\r\n\r\neconomic strategies.  The strategies should be to develop\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour full potential so as to launch into the next phase (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). If we cannot maintain our competitiveness, and if we cannot\r\n\r\ncatch  up  and  deal with the market and technological  changes,\r\n\r\nthen  the world will forge ahead and leave us behind.   The  CSC\r\n\r\nhas  recommended  a  twin-engine  growth,  ie,  to  develop  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and service industries together at the same  time.\r\n\r\nIt is a good and sound strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must also develop our own MNCs. We\r\n\r\nmust   help our promising SMEs.  We must face one harsh  reality\r\n\r\nthat  our  economy is gradually transforming into  a  knowledge-based economy.  The labour intensive, low-value added industries\r\n\r\nand  activities will eventually be phased out.   Jobs  that  are\r\n\r\nrelated  to such industries and activities will also be lost  in\r\n\r\ndue  course.  Therefore, our employers, entrepreneurs, employees\r\n\r\nand   indeed  all  Singaporeans  must  prepare  to   face   this\r\n\r\nunavoidable economic restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of our economic structure, two-thirds of our demands are from external sector. The sharp fall\r\n\r\nin  external  demand is the main cause of our  current  economic\r\n\r\nrecession.   We  must develop overseas markets,  strengthen  our\r\n\r\nregionalisation, and look out for new markets and new commercial\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  stimulate demand and  diversify  the  demand.\r\n\r\nThese  measures  are  crucial and must be implemented.   On  the\r\n\r\nsupply  side,  education,  training, technology  and  innovation\r\n\r\nwould  expand  and  build  up  our  capacity  and  upgrade   our\r\n\r\ncapability.    I  agree  with  the CSC's  view  that  we  should\r\n\r\ntreasure our limited resources, especially land and talents, and\r\n\r\nensure that they are put to optimum use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Committee has also referred to the role of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  Government should  review  its  role  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction  domain,  whether the Government  should  only  be  a\r\n\r\nfacilitator or should participate directly in production through\r\n\r\nthe  Government-linked companies (GLCs). The crucial point  here\r\n\r\nis whether the GLCs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  private enterprises can all withstand the test of the market\r\n\r\nby making profits and getting the targetted returns.   As to who\r\n\r\nowns these companies, it is of secondary importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to side-track to comment on Mr Chiam See\r\n\r\nTong's  point made just now that the PAP has dominated virtually\r\n\r\nevery   field   in  Singapore  so  that  people   cannot   think\r\n\r\nindependently  and cannot develop themselves.   He  was  hinting\r\n\r\nthat this could be one reason why we are not able to develop our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  This reminds me of two points.  Firstly, let  me\r\n\r\npoint  out to him that the CSC members, apart from two Ministers\r\n\r\nand  one  Minister of State, the others are not  linked  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Secondly, in Hong Kong,  a  very  popular  tabloid\r\n\r\n\"Apple  Daily\"  carried a report with a  big  headline  on  13th\r\n\r\nNovember  1998: \"Singapore is unable to produce a Li Ka  Shing\".\r\n\r\nHowever,  the newspaper was at least fair in pointing  out  that\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  Hong  Kong  have  their  own   advantages   and\r\n\r\nweaknesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whatever strategy we may select to develop\r\n\r\nour  economy,  our  people, unions, business community  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should always stay together and move  ahead  in  one\r\n\r\nheart (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). As the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nonce  mentioned, our collective organisational  ability  is  our\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge.  In this increasingly competitive  world  that\r\n\r\nwe  are living in, if we can maintain this competitive edge  and\r\n\r\nkeep  one  step ahead of our competitors, then our economy  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to grow steadily, and our people will be able to  enjoy\r\n\r\na rising standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June this year, the Government introduced a $2 billion\r\n\r\noff-Budget package to stimulate Singapore's economy.   Now,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee   of  Singapore's  Competitiveness  (CSC)  has   again\r\n\r\nintroduced a cost-reduction package with the hope that  business\r\n\r\ncosts  in  Singapore can be reduced by S$10 billion in the  next\r\n\r\nyear.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother words, since June this year, the Government has introduced\r\n\r\naltogether packages worth S$12 billion to help the businesses to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  imminent predicament they are  facing,  and  to\r\n\r\nminimise  further job losses.  I personally feel  that  the  CSC\r\n\r\nshould  be  commended  for  being so  resolute  in  making  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation to reduce our business cost so that we could have\r\n\r\na proper direction for our economic development over the next 10\r\n\r\nyears and for giving us a series of strategies for our long-term\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   The Committee does not recommend  devaluation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore dollar to solve the problem.  This  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nvery wise decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I heard Mr Chiam See Tong saying\r\n\r\nthat   despite   the  economic  crisis,  no  resident   in   his\r\n\r\nconstituency came to his meet-the-people session for  assistance\r\n\r\nin  getting  a  job. I believe in the present  economic  crisis,\r\n\r\nthere is no lack of people who have lost their jobs, but they do\r\n\r\nnot go to Mr Chiam See Tong because they do not believe Mr Chiam\r\n\r\ncould   help them to secure jobs.  They would rather go straight\r\n\r\nto  the Ministry of Manpower for help.  This is a more practical\r\n\r\nthing for them to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now Mr Chiam See Tong mentioned that the Government should\r\n\r\nnot reduce the employer's CPF contribution.  I do not agree with\r\n\r\nhim.   In  his view, so long as we reduce Government taxes,  our\r\n\r\neconomic  problem  can be resolved.  The  problem  is  not  that\r\n\r\nsimple.   If  our  workers do not take a cut in  their  CPF  and\r\n\r\nwages, then it will give the foreigners the impression that  our\r\n\r\nworkers  do  not  support the Government's effort  to  help  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  and they will have no confidence in us.  They will not\r\n\r\ncome here to invest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and the people should be united in one heart\r\n\r\nduring  this economic crisis and to send the correct signal   to\r\n\r\nour foreign investors.  So I believe what Mr Chiam said just now\r\n\r\nis  not correct.  It may be just a political stunt to please his\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir voters.  Just now he said that there should  be  an\r\n\r\neconomic alliance between Singapore and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I do not think this is feasible because no matter how\r\n\r\nwe  unite  with  Malaysia, it would not be as effective  as  the\r\n\r\nlarger  regional forum such as APEC.  I support the  CSC  Report\r\n\r\nbut I have a few suggestions for  the Government to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we should try to reduce more non-wage costs.\r\n\r\nThe CSC has recommended reduction in some non-wage costs such as\r\n\r\nrentals, utilities, telephone bills and taxes, etc.  But I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government departments and the private sector  should\r\n\r\ntry  their  best to reduce more non-wage costs including   items\r\n\r\nwhich are not mentioned in the Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I received this Report from the CSC, the first thing I\r\n\r\nnoticed was that   the book was very beautifully printed and the\r\n\r\npaper quality is excellent.  On the one hand, the Government  is\r\n\r\nadvocating reduction in business costs.  On the other hand, they\r\n\r\nseem to have forgotten that they should also try to save cost in\r\n\r\nits operations.  You may notice that for this 186-page Report, a\r\n\r\nthick  paper  of not less than 120 gm was used, with  two-colour\r\n\r\nand four-colour printing and large font size, which are superior\r\n\r\nto the textbooks used by our secondary students.  In my opinion,\r\n\r\nthe  production cost of this book can be easily  reduced  by  at\r\n\r\nleast  50%.   Therefore, I feel that Government departments  and\r\n\r\nthe  private  enterprises should not  spend  so  much  money  in\r\n\r\nproducing fanciful  annual reports.  They should be made  simple\r\n\r\nand  extravagant high profile presentation should be avoided  as\r\n\r\nit will increase their business cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that when senior officers from the\r\n\r\npublic  and  private sectors go on official trips  abroad,  they\r\n\r\nshould  travel  by  economy  class instead  of  first  class  or\r\n\r\nbusiness class.   As for entertainment, I agree with Prof. Tommy\r\n\r\nKoh's  view  that  the number of courses in our Chinese  dinners\r\n\r\nshould  be  reduced from eight dishes to six dishes.  This  will\r\n\r\nsave cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole package introduced by the CSC has been weighted\r\n\r\ntowards  helping the manufacturing and the retailing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindustries  to reduce their business costs.  However,  there  is\r\n\r\none   thing  that  I  think  the  CSC  has  neglected,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nadvertising  cost.  Many manufacturers and retailers  have  been\r\n\r\nusing  the television or newspapers to advertise their  products\r\n\r\nand  services.   According to a survey conducted by the  Temasek\r\n\r\nPolytechnic recently, more than 32% of male Singaporeans  learnt\r\n\r\nof news about new products or services through advertisements in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers and about 26% of female Singaporeans learnt about\r\n\r\nsales and special offers through newspapers.  This clearly shows\r\n\r\nthat it is very important for the manufacturers and retailers to\r\n\r\nadvertise their products and services.  I suggest that  TCS  and\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers should also reduce their advertising fees during\r\n\r\nthese difficult times to help businesses cut their costs.   When\r\n\r\nthe  businessmen  calculate their costs, they naturally  include\r\n\r\nthe  advertising cost into their business costs,  and eventually\r\n\r\nit will be the consumers who are paying for it.   Therefore,   I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  for advertisements on sundry goods and  essential\r\n\r\ndaily  goods  by, say, NTUC FairPrice and other supermarkets,  a\r\n\r\ndiscount   shall  be  given   in  the  advertising  fees.    The\r\n\r\nadvertisers  can then pass on their savings from the advertising\r\n\r\ncost  to   the  consumers by offering these essential  goods  at\r\n\r\ncheaper  prices.   This  will help to bring  down  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should not cut the salaries or CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  of   the employees from the lower  income  group.\r\n\r\nThe  CSC  suggests that the total  wage cost be reduced by  15%,\r\n\r\nie,  10%  from employer's CPF contribution and 5-8% from  wages.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that for the low-income employees, the reduction should\r\n\r\nbe  less.   And  for  the executive and senior  officers,  their\r\n\r\nsalaries can  be reduced by a larger margin.  For those who  are\r\n\r\nliving  in  1-  and 2-room flats, their average combined  family\r\n\r\nincome  is  only about S$800 per month.  So if we are having  an\r\n\r\nacross-the-board  percentage deduction  in  salary,  these  low-income families will suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower income ordinary citizens may not be able to\r\n\r\nenjoy some of the rebates on  property tax, foreign worker levy,\r\n\r\nstamp  duty  for  share transfers and petrol tax,  etc,  because\r\n\r\nthese  items do not involve them in the first place.    Most  of\r\n\r\nthem  do  not  pay  any income tax anyway.  I  think  for  those\r\n\r\nfamilies whose combined income is less than S$800, we should not\r\n\r\nreduce their CPF contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I propose that retrenched workers from the lower\r\n\r\nincome families should be allowed to withdraw part of their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  to  tide  over the difficult times. I  think  maybe  we\r\n\r\nshould  consider allowing retrenched workers from families  with\r\n\r\ncombined  income of less than $800 per month to  withdraw,  say,\r\n\r\nS$150  per  month  from their CPF account for  a  period  of  12\r\n\r\nmonths.  In other words, the maximum they could withdraw is only\r\n\r\nS$1,800  but to them this may be the straw they can hold  on  to\r\n\r\ntide over the difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should reschedule the instalment payments of\r\n\r\nshopowners  and  hawker  stallholders.   Many  existing  tenants\r\n\r\nbought  over their shops or stalls under the \"Shop For Everyone\"\r\n\r\nScheme  introduced by HDB some years ago.  With business so  bad\r\n\r\nnow, they are having problems serving their loan instalments.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the HDB would reschedule the loan repayment or  maybe\r\n\r\nsuspend  their payment for one year so that they could  continue\r\n\r\nto pay after the crisis is over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hawkers are also having the same predicament. I think\r\n\r\nthe  Government should also help them.  I also suggest that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should consider reducing the rentals for  the  shops\r\n\r\nand hawker stalls in the HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should provide capital assistance to our\r\n\r\npromising  local  enterprises which have  the  potential  to  go\r\n\r\nregional.  The CSC has recommended eight major strategies.  I am\r\n\r\nin  particular agreement with three  of them, ie, to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  external wing, to build world-class local companies and  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  base  of  small and medium  local  enterprises.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  perspective of long-term development,  using  foreign\r\n\r\neconomies to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupplement  the  growth of the domestic economy is  a  practical\r\n\r\nstrategy.   At  the  same  time, while strengthening  the  local\r\n\r\nenterprises, it will also provide the Singapore economy  with  a\r\n\r\nnew impetus for growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government consider granting some loans or\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance  to  local  enterprises  which  have   the\r\n\r\npotential to go regional.  For example, we may allow them to use\r\n\r\ntheir   company's  shares  as  collateral  for  mortgage  loans.\r\n\r\nPromising   local  enterprises may  have  the  potential  to  go\r\n\r\nregional, but  they may not be able to secure bank loans  during\r\n\r\nthis  economic crisis.  Many banks which have previously granted\r\n\r\nloans  to  companies or enterprises to invest  in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  are  having  problems recovering  their  loans.  Once\r\n\r\nbitten twice shy. The banks are having this phobia whenever they\r\n\r\nhear that the companies are going regional.  Nowadays, when  you\r\n\r\ntalk  to  the banks about regionalisation, they are  simply  not\r\n\r\ninterested.   So if the Government could  give these companies a\r\n\r\nhelping  hand,  it  will help them to go  regional  earlier  and\r\n\r\nfaster,   and  will  go  a  long way  in  building  these  local\r\n\r\nenterprises into  world class companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, more business information should be provided to\r\n\r\nthe   businesses  in  Singapore  at  this  time   where   prompt\r\n\r\ninternational  business information is of utmost importance.   I\r\n\r\nthink  MTI  should be able to provide more ready information  to\r\n\r\nour businesses.  This is more effective than conducting overseas\r\n\r\ntours for our trade delegations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we should start to plan a second package to save\r\n\r\nour  economy  from  future  crisis.   Some  people  are  of  the\r\n\r\nimpression that the present package of $12 billion to  help  our\r\n\r\nlocal  enterprises  may  not  be enough  to  save  our  economy.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  the international economic situation  deteriorates\r\n\r\nrapidly, the future will be most unpredictable.  If we wait  for\r\n\r\nthe  worst  to happen before planning  for a second  package  to\r\n\r\nsave  our  economy,  it will be too late.   I  think  we  should\r\n\r\nprepare well in advance. I believe the CSC took more than a year\r\n\r\nto come out with this Report.  Therefore, we should start now to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplan  a  second package as a contingency plan against any future\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMITTEE ON SINGAPORE'S COMPETITIVENESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I wish to seek a clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jalan Besar.

Let me ask him very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nslowly.   Mr  Chiam  See Tong, did you say  that  no  retrenched\r\n\r\nworker  had  approached you at your meet-the-people session  for\r\n\r\nhelp to find another job?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course, I did. I made a plain\r\n\r\nstatement  like  that  just to illustrate that  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment  is not so serious in Potong Pasir.  There  are  no\r\n\r\npeople coming in a rush to ask for help to get jobs.  If they do\r\n\r\ncome,  and if there are complaints that I am unable to get  them\r\n\r\njobs,  then it is fair for Mr Peh to say, \"Look, they have  come\r\n\r\nto  look  for  jobs from you.

As MP for Jalan  Besar,  every\r\n\r\nweek  I meet my people, and there are many constituents who come\r\n\r\nto  me  for  help to look for a new job because of retrenchment.\r\n\r\nBut  the residents in Potong Pasir did not see him.  Maybe these\r\n\r\npeople went direct to the Ministry of Manpower to look for jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I am a first-time MP, but\r\n\r\nI  would  like to make a reference to what Mr Chiam said earlier\r\n\r\nabout  wage cuts.  He said that our workers would have to endure\r\n\r\nup to 18% cut in wages.  Let me just correct him because quite a\r\n\r\nlot  of information has been given out to our workers during the\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions and speeches.  I think Mr  Chiam  might  have\r\n\r\nconfused  between  a  10 percentage cut in  the  employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution and a 10% wage cut.  What we are going to have is a\r\n\r\n10  percentage  point  cut  in the CPF  contribution,  and  that\r\n\r\nconstitutes about 8.3% of wages.  With the proposal of  the  NWC\r\n\r\nfor  a 5-8% cut in other forms of wages, we could have up to 16%\r\n\r\ncut in wages, but do not forget, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave to subtract from that figure a wage increase of between  2%\r\n\r\nand  4% that we have enjoyed at the beginning of the year.  That\r\n\r\nis  just  to correct the wrong impression that might  have  been\r\n\r\ncreated  by what Mr Chiam said earlier.  So it is very important\r\n\r\nthat  we  get  our  facts right even if you have  all  the  good\r\n\r\nintentions so that we do not confuse the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the union leaders saw the trend of increasing\r\n\r\nretrenchments  over  the  past  one  year  or  so,  they   asked\r\n\r\nthemselves: Will it affect our members and, if so,  when?   What\r\n\r\nwill  be  the impact on their families? And what can be done  by\r\n\r\nthe three social tripartite partners to buck the trend?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that during the economic downturn our employers\r\n\r\nin   general  asked:  How  to  cut  costs  in  order  to  regain\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness?  When will we recover?  How can the workers and\r\n\r\nGovernment help to achieve it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government on its part wants to ensure that the economy\r\n\r\nremains  healthy, companies remain viable, unemployment is  kept\r\n\r\nsmall,  and  hardship due to the loss of jobs is controlled  and\r\n\r\novercome.   Two key points in the mind of the Government,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,   are  that  Singapore  remains  stable  politically   and\r\n\r\ninvestors' confidence towards Singapore is kept high and further\r\n\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the union leaders and workers, I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  our  workers  are  pragmatic  and  responsible  enough  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they have to make short term  sacrifices,  for\r\n\r\nlonger term gains.  They have accepted the need for wage cuts in\r\n\r\norder   to  save  their  jobs.   By  accepting  to  make   these\r\n\r\nsacrifices, our workers have shown that they are willing to play\r\n\r\ntheir  part to help ensure that their companies do not  need  to\r\n\r\nclose  down  and that Singapore remains an attractive investment\r\n\r\ndestination  in  order to create more jobs for  their  children.\r\n\r\nThis  is a case of our workers showing their willingness to take\r\n\r\na  smaller  share  of  the pie when the pie  itself  has  become\r\n\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let me, if I may, recall and emphasise the\r\n\r\npurpose of the cost-cutting exercise.  The objective is to help\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies  remain  viable  and  competitive  and  not  to   make\r\n\r\ncompanies to profit from wage cuts, including CPF cut, per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the economic crisis affects the bottom line of\r\n\r\nemployers, there will exist some companies which are not in  the\r\n\r\nred,  and  which are still able to stay afloat and make  profits\r\n\r\neven if there were no CPF cut.  I urge these companies to pass a\r\n\r\npart  of  the  savings from the CPF cut back to  their  workers.\r\n\r\nThis  can  be done in a variety of ways, for example, through  a\r\n\r\none-off  year-end bonus, or variable monthly payment, or  simply\r\n\r\nby  topping up their employees' CPF accounts.  This  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmuch  needed  boost  for those who rely  heavily  on  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings to pay for their housing.  Alternatively, employers  can\r\n\r\npay   a   performance-related  incentive  to  encourage  further\r\n\r\nimprovement in workers' productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to caution that we should not\r\n\r\nresort  to  returning the savings to meet short-term  objectives\r\n\r\nonly.  A larger part of the costs saved should be used to invest\r\n\r\nin  skills  training  and retraining of  their  workers  and  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  their  capabilities to meet future  competition  and\r\n\r\nexpansion.   Investment in human capital can only  rebound  with\r\n\r\npositive results for employers.  Over the medium to longer term,\r\n\r\nbetter  trained  workers  will  be  more  productive  and   more\r\n\r\nknowledgeable,  which will enable them to contribute  better  to\r\n\r\nthe  companies.  It is easy to take a short term view and  think\r\n\r\nonly  of  survival  in these difficult times.  However,  I  urge\r\n\r\nemployers  to  take  a  long term view and  help  their  workers\r\n\r\ntransit smoothly to the knowledge-based economy.  In fact,  over\r\n\r\nand  above  the savings from CPF cuts and other wage  cuts,  the\r\n\r\navenues  and  funds  for skills training and upgrading  are  all\r\n\r\nthere.   It is for employers to take advantage and to make  full\r\n\r\nuse  of  such  funds.  So both employers and employees  have  no\r\n\r\nexcuse not to take part in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, unfortunately, those companies which continue to\r\n\r\nface  financial difficulties despite wage and CPF cuts.  I  urge\r\n\r\nthese  employers to consider retrenching workers only as a  last\r\n\r\nresort.  Why not use other innovative ways to cut\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-wage costs?  For instance, employers can institute a shorter\r\n\r\nwork week, or mandate a compulsory clearing of annual leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of creative\r\n\r\nthinking.   Like  the  example of the Safe  Superstore  in  Sims\r\n\r\nDrive,  which  was  quoted in The New Paper  last  Friday,  20th\r\n\r\nNovember  1998,  by NTUC Secretary-General and Minister-without-Portfolio,  Mr Lim Boon Heng.  By doing some simple research  on\r\n\r\ncustomer traffic at certain hours, the store managed to cut down\r\n\r\nfrom  two  shifts to one.  This reduced manpower  and  utilities\r\n\r\ncosts.   There is an increasing number of companies in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  relooking  into the  operation  and  business\r\n\r\nprocesses.   There  have  been many examples  of  QCs  and  Work\r\n\r\nImprovement  Teams which have helped save their  companies  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  million dollars.  So it is good for companies  to  look\r\n\r\ninto these areas to cut costs without first resorting to further\r\n\r\nwage cut or retrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put it bluntly, by agreeing to the CPF and other\r\n\r\nwage  cuts,  our workers have actually agreed to  give  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir  income  to  their employers.  The  Government's  plan  to\r\n\r\nreduce  charges  is  also transferring  the  public's  money  to\r\n\r\ncompanies.  These decisions have been made in good faith and for\r\n\r\nour  common  good - the workers, the people, employers  and  the\r\n\r\nstate.   The  money  saved should thus be used  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  well-being - especially their future  employability  - and improve the companies' capability and competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrust of my speech today is that we are in this\r\n\r\ntogether,  and  each  of  us  - the  worker,  employer  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - must play our part to help our country's economy to\r\n\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While wage cuts are inevitable, it will not be fair to let\r\n\r\nworkers  shoulder the burden alone.  Employers  can  and  should\r\n\r\nmake that extra effort to do what they can to lessen the pain of\r\n\r\nwage  and  CPF cuts on our workers.  Now that we have agreed  to\r\n\r\ncut costs, let us not forget that human touch; that small act of\r\n\r\nkindness and that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngesture  of consideration.  Let us take that extra step to  make\r\n\r\neach  other's  journey a kinder and gentler  passage.   We  must\r\n\r\nthink  beyond this recession and for the longer run, I think  we\r\n\r\nwill  have to take a re-look at our cost structure and fine-tune\r\n\r\nour  wage  system,  worker  training system  and  pre-employment\r\n\r\ntraining  system  in  order  to  ensure  that  Singapore  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   When we work together even closer,  we  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  be  able to overcome the current economic crisis,  but  we\r\n\r\nwill make Singapore society even stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, I fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  recommendations of the  Committee  on  Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness, and I would like to add to some of  the  points\r\n\r\nthat have been discussed in the Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the development of entreprenuers. Many businessmen say\r\n\r\nthat we lack the entrepreneurship spirit seen in Hong Kong.   It\r\n\r\nis  timely  for  Government to create the right  environment  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  development  of an entrepreneurial  culture.   This\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  be  instilled early in the life  of  our  young\r\n\r\nchildren.   We  should encourage and nurture them in  school  by\r\n\r\nteaching them to be creative and understand that there  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  one way to approach problems.  We must teach them  not  to\r\n\r\nfear  mistakes  but  to learn from mistakes.  More  importantly,\r\n\r\nboth the employers of the public and private sectors must change\r\n\r\nthe  present  working environment and stereotyped  mindsets  for\r\n\r\nmore open environment where free flow of ideas are expressed and\r\n\r\nexchanged among all levels of the hierarchy.  We must not be too\r\n\r\nquick  to penalise those who make mistakes which are not due  to\r\n\r\ncarelessness, negligence or ill-intentions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the business world, businessmen have commented that the GLCs\r\n\r\nhave  moved  beyond their core businesses and  have  diversified\r\n\r\ninto  other  businesses to the extent they are found  in  almost\r\n\r\nevery  trade.   Because  of  their  sheer  size  or,  at  times,\r\n\r\nmonopoly, entrepreneurs feel stifled and are sometimes unable to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompete  not because they do not have a better product or  skill\r\n\r\nbut  because  they do not have the financial muscle  to  compete\r\n\r\nwith  GLCs  when GLCs enter into the fray.  Instead of  stifling\r\n\r\ncompetition,  GLCs  should  work  with  good  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nprovide  the  environment  for them  to  succeed  on  a  win-win\r\n\r\nformula.  Instead of competing with each other, GLCs should link\r\n\r\nup  with  some  of  these local enterprises to  compete  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on world-class companies, I support the move to make\r\n\r\nour  GLCs  into  world-class companies.  In  trying  to  recruit\r\n\r\nforeign  talents to increase our skilled manpower resources,  it\r\n\r\nis  important that we attract foreigners who are truly  talented\r\n\r\nand  not  people of second or third echelons but top echelon  to\r\n\r\nserve  these  companies.  Some have said that in many  countries\r\n\r\nthere  is  political  cronyism.  But in Singapore  there  is  no\r\n\r\npolitical  cronyism  but  there is public  cronyism.   GLCs  are\r\n\r\nfavoured.  I think we must dispel this notion.  This is all  the\r\n\r\nmore important during the process of making our GLCs into world-class  companies.  We must be able to show them  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nlevel-playing field and dispel that misperception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, managing our limited resources. As our manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry grows and as our economy continues to expand,  the  use\r\n\r\nof water will continue to increase.  We have already planned for\r\n\r\ndesalination plants and there are occasional campaigns  to  save\r\n\r\nwater.   But  it  is time that more forceful steps  need  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.   We  should inculcate water saving habits in  the  young\r\n\r\nchildren  in  schools.  They must be reminded that  water  is  a\r\n\r\nscarce resource and perhaps we should teach them to use water as\r\n\r\nif  they  were  living  in  a desert community,  so  that  their\r\n\r\ngeneration will learn to appreciate the importance of water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, reduction of wage cost to increase our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Mr Chiam has proposed that Ministers'  pay  be\r\n\r\ncut  by  25%.  Yes, I think Ministers' pay should be cut  as  an\r\n\r\nexample for others to follow.  However, even if you were to  cut\r\n\r\nthe  pay  by 25%, I could not see how it could help to  increase\r\n\r\nthe competitiveness of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore economy.  I think he has forgotten that the  main  aim\r\n\r\nof  wage  reduction  is  to increase our  competitiveness.   The\r\n\r\nperformance  of  our Government leaders in this economic  crisis\r\n\r\nhas   been  sterling.   They  have  helped  Singapore  gain   an\r\n\r\nimpeccable  reputation.   I  think they  deserve  better.   Yes,\r\n\r\nMinisters  and top civil servants should lead by  example.   The\r\n\r\nwage  cut that will be advocated for the public sector, I  think\r\n\r\nfor  Ministers and civil servants, they should be at the top  of\r\n\r\nthe  range.  But it does not serve any purpose if we  cut  their\r\n\r\npay excessively without any good reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that the effect of wage cut be cushioned\r\n\r\nfor  those  from the lower-income group.  We have to  understand\r\n\r\ntheir  needs  and ensure that they have a safety  net,  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir  families will not suffer excessively.  Yes,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on the bigger picture to stimulate the economy.  However,\r\n\r\nwe must also remember that there are many families out there who\r\n\r\nwill  face  increasing  financial hardship.   Government  bodies\r\n\r\nshould  make downward adjustment costs selectively, for example,\r\n\r\ndecreasing  transport cost.  Perhaps bus companies may  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider  decreasing  the  cost of bus stamps  for  school-going\r\n\r\nchildren.   These  are measures that will help the  lower-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Perhaps when rebates are given to hawker centres  and\r\n\r\nfood  courts, there might be a mechanism for these to be  passed\r\n\r\nback to the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want a situation where the families face so much\r\n\r\nhardship and are unable to get assistance that their spirit gets\r\n\r\nbroken  because of these setbacks.  For example, I have a family\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency who has gone without utilities for  months,\r\n\r\nand  when they came to my attention and we made several  efforts\r\n\r\nto  approach them, and when we said that we would help them  get\r\n\r\ntheir  utilities  (water and electricity) connected,  the  first\r\n\r\nresponse was, \"No, please don't do that, because I cannot afford\r\n\r\nthat.\"  It has come to a stage where they feel that there is  no\r\n\r\navenue for assistance.  I think we do not want them to reach  to\r\n\r\nthat  extent.   What we want to do is to help them regain  their\r\n\r\nconfidence and overcome their difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider increasing funding to CDCs\r\n\r\nso that they will be in a better position to help these families\r\n\r\ntide over their difficulties.  CDCs can become focal points  and\r\n\r\none-stop  assistance centres for families who are faced  with  a\r\n\r\nbarrage of unpaid bills and arrears from different agencies.  As\r\n\r\nwe  undertake  these measures to improve the competitiveness  of\r\n\r\nour economy, we must let Singaporeans know that while we have to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the big picture, we have not forgotten the individuals\r\n\r\nwho  face  hardship.  Instead, we will help them overcome  their\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   Together,  we  will  work  towards  building   a\r\n\r\nstronger and more resilient Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Report is\r\n\r\na  result of a lengthy deliberation involving the best  and  the\r\n\r\nbrightest minds in Singapore.  In terms of the depth of analysis\r\n\r\nand  the rationale of its recommendations, there is actually not\r\n\r\nmuch one could add to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we remove the emotional cobwebs surrounding the issue, the\r\n\r\nbasic  fact is that the cost of doing business in Singapore  has\r\n\r\ngone  up  dramatically versus our competitor nations.  Yes,  our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, our management expertise, our stable Government,\r\n\r\nthe  skills  of our workforce, etc, will allow us  to  charge  a\r\n\r\npremium,  but only so much.  Therefore, we must reduce the  cost\r\n\r\nto render ourselves more attractive to foreign investors.  There\r\n\r\nare  only  two  ways  of  doing it.  One way  is  through  self-engineered   currency  devaluation.   At  first   glance,   this\r\n\r\napparently  is  a painless approach.  Dr Ow Chin  Hock,  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech,  earlier has already touched on much of the pitfalls  of\r\n\r\ndoing  this.  So I would not go into it in detail.  I just  want\r\n\r\nto  say that in so doing, the cost of living inflation resulting\r\n\r\nin  a  weaker Singapore dollar will have its greatest impact  on\r\n\r\nretirees  who  are  living on their savings -  people  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed greatly to the prosperity of Singapore in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is through cost-cutting measures, as\r\n\r\nrecommended  by  the  CSC.  It is heartening  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  has  decided  to  take  the  correct  but\r\n\r\npolitically more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndemanding  route of reducing our wage cost and Government  fees.\r\n\r\nThis  reflects  the  long-term perspective  of  the  Government.\r\n\r\nCutting wages of the wage-earners is always very painful.   This\r\n\r\nrequires  political  courage  as well  as  a  well-informed  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  population  who  understands  the  needs  of  these\r\n\r\ndrastic  measures.   I  am  glad to say  that  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nresponding  positively to these Government policies through  the\r\n\r\nvarious feedback we have obtained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has conducted two sessions, one in English\r\n\r\nchaired  by myself, the second in Mandarin, chaired  by  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nMong Seng, the Member for Bukit Gombak.  In the English Language\r\n\r\nsession,  around  50  CEOs of small and medium  enterprises  and\r\n\r\nmulti-national companies attended.  From the comments,  I  could\r\n\r\neasily classify those comments into two major categories,  based\r\n\r\non  the  perspective  of  the  participants.   The  first  group\r\n\r\ncomprises  those who are concerned with the external  demand  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  goods and services, and the second  group  involves\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  serving  the domestic economy.   Not  surprisingly,\r\n\r\ntheir  perspectives and comments differ dramatically.  For those\r\n\r\nfaced  with  external  demand and external  competition,  almost\r\n\r\neveryone  lauded  the effort by the Government  in  recommending\r\n\r\nthis  package as appropriate and timely.  In fact,  the  foreign\r\n\r\nCEOs  were especially impressed by the ability of the Government\r\n\r\nto  put  forward such a comprehensive package.   In  fact,  they\r\n\r\nlamented  that  such packages and measures are  unlikely  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful or even contemplated in their own countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These participants were convinced that those measures\r\n\r\nrecommended in the Report would help their business overcome the\r\n\r\ncurrent  crisis over the next two years.  They said  that  while\r\n\r\nSingapore  does not suddenly become more attractive  to  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors,  at least the push factor of business migrating  away\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore has been reduced or eliminated.  In  fact,  they\r\n\r\nlooked  towards  the long term and expressed concern  that  cost\r\n\r\ncontainment should not be a once off\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  ad  hoc  process but should be an on-going process,  because\r\n\r\nSingapore  is no longer competing with under-developed countries\r\n\r\nbut  with developed countries.  They expressed the worry whether\r\n\r\nSingapore will revert to the past practice or behaviour of  cost\r\n\r\nescalation once the current crisis is over.  For those CEOs  who\r\n\r\nare in Singapore for their OHQ operation, they expressed concern\r\n\r\nabout other costs, other than wage cost.  For instance, one  key\r\n\r\nfactor is the high telecommunications cost.  If Singapore  wants\r\n\r\nto  evolve  into a IT society or knowledge society,  or  develop\r\n\r\ninto  e-commerce, they felt that our telecommunications cost  is\r\n\r\npretty high.  And those with major manufacturing operations also\r\n\r\nexpressed  concerns  of high energy cost, especially  electrical\r\n\r\nutilities costs.  Being CEOs, they all concluded that the  major\r\n\r\ndriving  force of escalating costs in Singapore, besides  wages,\r\n\r\nis  actually the land cost in Singapore.  Therefore, these  CEOs\r\n\r\nwould like to understand what is the Government's plan as far as\r\n\r\nland cost containment is concerned.  How do we contain land cost\r\n\r\nin   Singapore   such   that  the  two  factors   I   mentioned,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  and  electrical power  utilities,  will  not\r\n\r\nescalate out of reach?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second category that I mentioned earlier, those CEOs\r\n\r\nwho  deal  with  domestic demand are basically from  the  retail\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   In  fact,  they  are  very  concerned  about   the\r\n\r\ndiminishing purchasing power of Singaporeans after the  proposed\r\n\r\n15% manpower cost reduction.  In light of the reduced disposable\r\n\r\nincome, they expressed concerns about how the lower income group\r\n\r\nwould weather the wage reduction.  Many proposed a reduction  of\r\n\r\nGST  by  1%  to  2% or even the complete suspension  of  GST  to\r\n\r\nstimulate domestic demand.  When we pointed out to them that  3%\r\n\r\nis  a very small number and whether a $3 charge, based on a $100\r\n\r\npurchase, would influence the decision to spend or not to spend,\r\n\r\ntheir  response is that it is not a matter of money but a matter\r\n\r\nof  confidence.  So despite many clarifications on  GST  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in the past, most still asked for the major\r\n\r\nreasons why the Government is so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreluctant to consider a reduction of GST.  Perhaps, the Minister\r\n\r\nshould address this issue again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several participants commented that since manpower cost\r\n\r\nconstitutes  75% of this package while Government fee  reduction\r\n\r\nconstitutes  only 25% of the package, it would seem  that  wage-earners,  including workers as well as high-income earners,  are\r\n\r\nbeing  asked  to shoulder a high proportion of the  `sacrifice'.\r\n\r\nMany  would  like to see that the Government shoulder  a  higher\r\n\r\nproportion  of  this `sacrifice'.  In fact, a  number  commented\r\n\r\nthat  maybe there should be a 50%/50% contribution, ie, 50% from\r\n\r\nthe  wage-earners,  50% from the Government.   The  participants\r\n\r\nseem  to  be unaware that wage cost is close to 40% of  the  GDP\r\n\r\nwhile the various charges by the Government only amount to  10%.\r\n\r\nSo  in  fact, they are unaware that the proposed 15%  reduction,\r\n\r\namounting  to  $25  billion,  is  actually  more  than  the  15%\r\n\r\nrecommended by the Government.  It is actually coming up to 20%.\r\n\r\nSo if we were to approach an equal proportion of 50/50, it would\r\n\r\nmean  that  Government fees and other levies would  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreduced by a whopping 60% or more in order to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nSurely,  there  is no way to do so.  On the other  hand,  having\r\n\r\nsaid  so,  this particular message needs to be repeated  by  the\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I think the concerns of plunging\r\n\r\ndomestic demand is actually a very serious matter.  Many  retail\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  small and large, might be forced into  difficulties\r\n\r\nas   the  disposable  income  of  individuals  is  reduced.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the CSC Report touches on the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nreducing  company  tax or personal income tax.   Much  as  I  am\r\n\r\npersonally against unnecessary consumption, I think the  current\r\n\r\nbelt-tightening  by Singaporeans have actually  been  overboard.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would like to advocate a stimulative measure of  personal\r\n\r\nincome   tax  to  counteract  the  reduced  disposable   income.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  the  Minister can propose a  reduction  in  personal\r\n\r\nincome tax even before the March 1999 Budget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the $10 billion package, or US$6 billion\r\n\r\npackage, is equivalent to a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncash injection into the Singapore economy.  It is very hard  for\r\n\r\nindividuals to visualise what is US$6 billion and how  large  is\r\n\r\nthat number.  But if we consider that in the recent report,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, Japan and the World Bank will come together  and\r\n\r\npropose  a US$5 billion package for the ailing Thai, Korean  and\r\n\r\nIndonesian  economies,  perhaps we can  put  that  in  a  proper\r\n\r\nperspective.   Singapore  is a small country  with  3.5  million\r\n\r\npopulation, and yet we are going to inject close to $10  billion\r\n\r\na  year  into the economy for the next, hopefully, two  or  more\r\n\r\nyears.  So in that respect, I am very confident that our economy\r\n\r\nwill  turn  around  quickly in a V-shaped recovery  after  these\r\n\r\nparticular measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call of sacrifice by the Government to the people will\r\n\r\nbe  readily  heeded  if we can seize the opportunity  while  the\r\n\r\nsense  of  crisis is still very much heightened.  The  sense  of\r\n\r\ncrisis  was at this highest point several months back  when  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  Index  fell to about 800  points.   However,  as\r\n\r\ninterest rate eases and stock market prices recovered slowly  to\r\n\r\nthe  current 1,300 points, I believe the sense of crisis amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is slowly dissipating even though much work is  yet\r\n\r\nto  be  done.  Therefore, grasping the timing is very important.\r\n\r\nIf  we can get the present generation of young Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  facing their first major crisis to take this pain  together\r\n\r\nwith  the Government, this would definitely strengthen the  bond\r\n\r\nbetween   our   emerging   leaders  and   this   generation   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  And this bond will serve us well as we  ride  out\r\n\r\nthis  crisis and move confidently forward to claim our  rightful\r\n\r\nplace in the history in the 21st Century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister for a very comprehensive policy package.  I support the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the CSC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  congratulate the CSC  on  its  Report.   It  is\r\n\r\nattractive in more ways than one.  It is well written, pragmatic\r\n\r\nand  comprehensive.  There are six proposals to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\ncrisis and eight proposals to sustain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the longer term.  As they make sound economic\r\n\r\nsense, I agree with most of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight four main points. First, I would\r\n\r\nlike to discuss the cost-cutting measures; second, the long  run\r\n\r\nvision;  third, the process of crisis management  in  Singapore;\r\n\r\nand  fourth,  balancing  the  wage  and  CPF  cuts  with  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the cost-cutting measures. The economic crisis\r\n\r\nrepresents  for us in Singapore a severe external demand  shock.\r\n\r\nThe  CSC  advocates  essentially four  cost-cutting  measures  - labour  costs, exchange rate, land prices and taxes and  levies.\r\n\r\nThe key issues, I believe, are, first, the magnitude of the cost-cutting  measures; second, the balance of the various components\r\n\r\nof  the  package; and third, the timing of the measures.  Please\r\n\r\nallow me to discuss each of these in turn.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the magnitude of the package. The key cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasure is the reduction of labour costs by 15%.  The objective,\r\n\r\nas  stated  in  the  CSC Report, is to bring our  relative  unit\r\n\r\nlabour  cost  (RULC) back to 1994 levels.  While  I  agree  that\r\n\r\nlabour  cost  reduction  is  a drastic  measure  for  a  drastic\r\n\r\nsituation, it would have been good if there was more explanation\r\n\r\nof  why  the  Committee  thought that  15%  is  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasure.   First,  RULC  measures  only  unit  labour  cost   in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  vis-a-vis that of the Asian NIEs.  However,  unit\r\n\r\nlabour  cost  in the overall economy has increased  even  faster\r\n\r\nthan  that  of unit labour cost in manufacturing.  For  example,\r\n\r\nwhile  unit labour cost in manufacturing has risen by 27%  since\r\n\r\nthe  index was first compiled in 1988, unit labour cost for  the\r\n\r\nentire  economy has risen by much more, 43%.  It would therefore\r\n\r\nhave  been appropriate if the Committee had compared the overall\r\n\r\nunit  labour  cost  and  not  just  the  unit  labour  cost   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  to  that of other countries.   In  addition,  the\r\n\r\ncomparison is to the other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAsian  NIEs.  However, are they our main competitors these days?\r\n\r\nIn  what sectors?  And what weightage was given to each  of  the\r\n\r\nother  three Asian NIEs so that only one graph was obtained  and\r\n\r\npresented in the Report?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, while I agree with the fact that labour costs need to\r\n\r\nbe  cut,  I wish that more explanation were given as to why  the\r\n\r\nCommittee thought that 15% was the appropriate figure.   If  the\r\n\r\nreal  reason is that 15% was the figure achieved via the process\r\n\r\nof  bargaining and compromise between business and labour,  with\r\n\r\nthe  15% reduction in business cost in electronics sector as the\r\n\r\nbenchmark,  then  I  accept  that it  is  actually  a  political\r\n\r\ncompromise.  I realise that, ultimately, the practice of  policy\r\n\r\nis  an art, not a science.  Nevertheless, since it is stated  in\r\n\r\nthe  Report that it is to bring wage competitiveness back to the\r\n\r\n1994  levels  and the RULC was used specifically, then  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  one  should endeavour to be as rigorous as possible,  when\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the exchange rate, I agree with the Committee that the\r\n\r\nmain   target  of  exchange  rate  management  should  be  price\r\n\r\nstability.  Having said that, I believe that there is  room  for\r\n\r\nsome  flexibility in the management of exchange  rate  on  three\r\n\r\ncounts.  First, there is no risk today in the global economy  of\r\n\r\ninflation.  In fact, it is the very opposite.  In Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  experiencing not a positive inflation rate,  but  in\r\n\r\nfact a negative inflation rate for four months since June.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, while we are a very open economy and import most of our\r\n\r\nintermediate  products, there is still a domestic  component  to\r\n\r\ncosts, and an exchange rate depreciation would lower the cost of\r\n\r\nthe  domestic component in foreign currency terms.  For example,\r\n\r\nit  has often been cited that our imported components constitute\r\n\r\na  large  proportion of our total output.  That  is  true.   For\r\n\r\nexample,   materials   constitute  63%  of   total   output   in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   in  1997, but it is 63%.  Value  added  comprise\r\n\r\n23.5%.   So  therefore even though it is true that the  domestic\r\n\r\ncomponent  in  terms  of  the intermediate  inputs  do  actually\r\n\r\ncomprise a large percentage there is still room to effect a real\r\n\r\nexchange rate depreciation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to the extent that a nominal depreciation is not\r\n\r\nentirely wiped out by inflation and wage increases in the  other\r\n\r\naffected  countries,  then  for  them,  a  real  exchange   rate\r\n\r\ndepreciation  in  fact has been effected, thus increasing  their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   I  am  not  suggesting  that  we  engage   in\r\n\r\ncompetitive  devaluation  vis-a-vis these  other  countries.   I\r\n\r\nagree that this would prove counter-productive in the long  run.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that it is time and appropriate to adopt a more\r\n\r\nnuanced  approach.  In other words, I agree with the CSC's  view\r\n\r\nthat   a   delicate  balance  needs  to  be  maintained  between\r\n\r\nfacilitating  recovery of the domestic economy on the  one  hand\r\n\r\nand maintaining confidence in the Singapore dollar on the other.\r\n\r\nI  would  therefore echo the call of the CSC itself for  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  and a wider band in the management of the  exchange\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the issue of optimising resource management and\r\n\r\nthe  pricing of land in Singapore.  This is a policy too because\r\n\r\nthe JTC and HDB are major lessees of industrial land and zoning,\r\n\r\nplot   ratios,   usage  and  other  regulations  are   important\r\n\r\ndeterminants of land price.  In land scarce Singapore,  property\r\n\r\nprices  and rentals constitute one of the main reasons for  cost\r\n\r\nescalation  in the 1990s.  This was pointed out by Dr  Wang  Kai\r\n\r\nYuen  in his speech.  I therefore agree that land rentals should\r\n\r\nbe reduced.  I also support the CSC's call for an MTI-led multi-agency task force to develop competitive land pricing and zoning\r\n\r\npolicies  for our hub services.  However, I would  go  one  step\r\n\r\nfurther  and  ask that the terms of reference of  this  proposed\r\n\r\ntask  force  to  examine  land pricing policy  in  Singapore  be\r\n\r\nexpanded to include not just hub services but all other  sectors\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last cost-cutting measure advocated is that of Government\r\n\r\ntaxes  and levies.  It is here that I believe there is room  for\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring and some flexibility.  And this, I think is the  nub\r\n\r\nof  the issue: is $10 billion enough?  There is room to do more,\r\n\r\nif  needed.  I believe that budget considerations should not  be\r\n\r\nthe  main  consideration in this regard.  After all, the  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  in  fiscal year 1997 alone was $4.2  billion.   On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, in terms of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJune  cost-cutting  measures, the estimated budget  deficit  was\r\n\r\nonly  $0.8 billion.  In other words, there is room for much more\r\n\r\nexpansion  in  this  regard even without  touching  Government's\r\n\r\nreserves accumulated during pervious Governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe also that there is limited room for pump priming. And\r\n\r\nI believe that this should be seriously looked into particularly\r\n\r\nsince  the wage cuts will result in a decreased demand.  I  know\r\n\r\nthat two-thirds of demand is actually externally driven.\r\n\r\nBut if we look at some figures, in terms of the Input and Output\r\n\r\nTables  of 1990 - I realise that they are outdated but  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  most  recent that we have - the 1990 Singapore Input-Output\r\n\r\nTable states that for every dollar increase in final demand, the\r\n\r\nvalue-added  multiplier for commerce is 81 cents; for  transport\r\n\r\nand  communication, 67 cents; for seaport and related  services,\r\n\r\n61  cents;  for financial services, 89 cents; business services,\r\n\r\n88  cents.   For manufacturing, it is very low and  that  is  40\r\n\r\ncents   out  of  every  dollar  of  final  demand  for   non-oil\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.  In other words, the pump priming  measures  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  implemented should be seriously examined,  particularly\r\n\r\nsince  there is anticipated fall in domestic demand  because  of\r\n\r\nthe wage cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the timing? Is the timing appropriate? The\r\n\r\nquestion  here is whether the cut should actually be implemented\r\n\r\nsooner  than  early  next year. The reason why  I  say  this  is\r\n\r\nrecently,  both the IMF and OECD have come out to forecast  that\r\n\r\npositive  growth  is  expected in most  of  the  affected  Asian\r\n\r\nemerging economies by the second half of next year.  If that  is\r\n\r\nindeed the case, then it could be true that again, maybe by  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half or the later half of next year, we could also  have\r\n\r\npositive  growth in the economy.  If anything else, I think  the\r\n\r\ndepth  of  the  recession in Singapore would  be  for  the  last\r\n\r\nquarter,  this quarter and the first two quarters or  maybe  the\r\n\r\nthird  quarter  of  next year, provided there  is  nothing  more\r\n\r\nserious  in  terms of a fall in demand or a global deflation  or\r\n\r\nrecession in the economy, for example, if Japan fails to recover\r\n\r\nor  China devalues and a whole lot of other reasons.  The global\r\n\r\neconomy is very uncertain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is of course difficult to convince\r\n\r\nworkers  to  accept  a  wage cut if  the  economy  were  not  in\r\n\r\nrecession and I can imagine that it will be difficult  to  think\r\n\r\nof wage cut earlier than now because of the fact that we have to\r\n\r\nwait  for  the  third  quarter result of  -0.7%.   Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that now that we are considering all these cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures, it is better to implement them as soon as possible  in\r\n\r\norder  that  they can kick in as early as possible in  order  to\r\n\r\nsave jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is regarding the long run vision. I\r\n\r\nsuspect the CSC Report will be remembered for advocating the 15%\r\n\r\ncut  in  labour cost more than for its articulation of a  vision\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore for the next 10 years or so.  While the immediate\r\n\r\nsurvival  is understandably the paramount issue, we  should  not\r\n\r\nlose sight of the longer term issues.  It would be desirable  to\r\n\r\nre-visit  this  vision  again  when  the  economy  recovers  and\r\n\r\nimmediate  concerns  become  less critical.   Any  vision,  once\r\n\r\nformulated, needs to be disseminated.  There needs to be a  buy-in  and greater ownership by the relevant parties, in this case,\r\n\r\nthe  business  community  and labour.   In  future,  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  would  need greater and not less participation  by  the\r\n\r\nrelevant sectors, namely, business and labour.  A case in  point\r\n\r\nis  the  objective  of  developing  a  vibrant,  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nculture  and developing world-class companies that we  can  call\r\n\r\nour own.  How can we forge a better partnership between GLCs and\r\n\r\nlocal  companies?  How can flexi-work hours be implemented which\r\n\r\nwill  help  working mothers and the aged?  These are all  issues\r\n\r\nwhich can be deliberated in greater detail in the framework of a\r\n\r\npublic sector business-labour partnership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the CSC organise a\r\n\r\nconference  on  the long-term vision for the business  community\r\n\r\nand  labour sometime next year in order to extend the buy-in and\r\n\r\nownership of the vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some brief comments about the vision itself. One may ask:\r\n\r\nwhat is new about the vision?  I believe that more than being a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompletely new paradigm, the vision is a useful articulation  of\r\n\r\na  continuing trend towards greater technological sophistication\r\n\r\nand  stronger  capabilities.  I believe that  one  of  the  main\r\n\r\nhighlights  of  the  vision  is the  fact  that  it  articulates\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and services as twin engines of  growth  for  the\r\n\r\neconomy and, for the first time, we see services coming  to  the\r\n\r\nfore  in  terms of the pro-planning approach of the  Government.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly in line with Singapore's likely future cost  and\r\n\r\ncapabilities profile.  I therefore agree with this  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services as twin engines of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is regarding the process of crisis\r\n\r\nmanagement.  The economic crisis has revealed the importance  of\r\n\r\nfundamentals, not merely economic fundamentals but political and\r\n\r\nsocial fundamentals.  In this time of crisis, social capital and\r\n\r\nthe  legitimacy of the political leadership are crucial.  We  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are fortunate that at a time of crisis such  as  this,\r\n\r\nthe trade unions and politicians can gain support for a wage cut\r\n\r\nand  maintain social cohesion so that racial and ethnic fissures\r\n\r\ndo not appear.  There is no policy indecisiveness, no dithering,\r\n\r\nno  stalemate,  as  we see, for example, in some  of  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries  around  us.  Instead, not only  has  there  been  the\r\n\r\nability  to  garner  the support necessary  for  the  short-term\r\n\r\nmeasures, we have also been able to plan ahead and be pro-active\r\n\r\nand    take   measures   necessary   to   sustain   our   future\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Here, we see, in some ways, good governance in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  action  and I believe that good  governance  must\r\n\r\nsurely be one of Singapore's most precious assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and last point is regarding compassion. I would\r\n\r\nurge the Government to help ease the burden of the wage and  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts. Although interest rates have fallen in recent months  from\r\n\r\ntheir   high  early  this  year,  many  households  would   face\r\n\r\ndifficulties in meeting housing loans, and the wage  cuts  would\r\n\r\nmean  a consumption squeeze for many families.  I hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would adopt a compassionate approach by accompanying\r\n\r\nthe  labour cost reductions with measures, including schemes  to\r\n\r\nease or defer mortgage payments and an increase\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  educational  bursaries and textbook  allowances  for  school\r\n\r\nchildren for families with financial difficulties.  I would also\r\n\r\nargue for an income tax rebate to help alleviate the squeeze  on\r\n\r\ndisposable incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One alternative to the proposed differentiated CPF cut that\r\n\r\nhas  been  advocated by my Parliamentary colleagues is  to  find\r\n\r\nways  to reduce the financial burden of the lower income  group,\r\n\r\nfor example, in terms of rebate for S&C charges, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  can play its part.  Banks, in  particular,  can\r\n\r\nalso  help  by  providing bridging loans for  those  who  bought\r\n\r\nprivate properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to state that the CSC's Report\r\n\r\nis  indeed  a  well-conceived Report that not only provides  for\r\n\r\nimmediate relief but also for a long-term vision.  I salute  the\r\n\r\nCommittee for being able to complement each of them by the other\r\n\r\nand include them in one Report.  I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I support the motion as proposed by the Minister for Trade\r\n\r\nand Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the details, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the workers and the business leaders  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  working as a team to tackle a very tough problem that  they\r\n\r\nare facing by delivering this very comprehensive Report. We have\r\n\r\nseen many examples of how a seemingly good infrastructure breaks\r\n\r\ndown  in times of crisis. If we look around us in Asia,  in  all\r\n\r\nthe  countries affected by the economic crisis, there has either\r\n\r\nbeen  a  leadership  change  in  the  country  affected  or  the\r\n\r\ncountries  are  in  turmoil with political  and  social  reforms\r\n\r\ntaking place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a very stable Government with strong leadership to be\r\n\r\nwilling to take bold steps that have been suggested by the  CSC.\r\n\r\nIt also takes a committed and responsible business community and\r\n\r\ncitizens  to work hand in hand with the Government to  implement\r\n\r\nsome  very tough measures that we are talking about.  Sir, I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that  we in Singapore are sending a very strong and  clear\r\n\r\nsignal to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  rest of the world that Singapore consists of a strong  team\r\n\r\nof  partners from the public, private and people sectors who can\r\n\r\nwork  in  synergy to solve our problems despite the difficulties\r\n\r\nthat we face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have identified the solutions, they would only be\r\n\r\neffective  in  resolving  our  competitiveness  problems  if  we\r\n\r\nimplement  them  fast and decisively.  We have  done  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nplanning  and  talking in the past one year.  We  have  to  very\r\n\r\nquickly  set the actions in motion. So I hope we would implement\r\n\r\nthe measures that we have identified immediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recall that early this year when we were\r\n\r\ndebating  the  Budget  for  the  year  1998/1999,  many  of   us\r\n\r\nhighlighted  the perception gap between the way  the  Government\r\n\r\nand the private sector perceived the state of the economy.  Many\r\n\r\nof  us  had  projected a rapid decline in our economy while  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance had in his speech talked about the recovery\r\n\r\nand growth, especially in electronics and manufacturing sectors.\r\n\r\nBased on how the Government viewed the economy, we implemented a\r\n\r\nnumber  of conservative measures at that time.  Then we came  in\r\n\r\nwith  off-budget measures about four months later because things\r\n\r\nturned  out  to be different as planned.  However, things  again\r\n\r\ndeteriorated   and   the   off-budget   measures,   being   very\r\n\r\nconservative, did not do much to revive the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us look at the facts. While our economy is still\r\n\r\nin  a  much  better  position if we  compare  ourselves  to  our\r\n\r\nneighbours,  nonetheless, we have slipped into  a  recession  as\r\n\r\nmany of us had predicted early this year.  The worrying issue is\r\n\r\nnot just the recession but is also the rate of decline from 6.1%\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  the  first  quarter to 1.6%  growth  in  the  second\r\n\r\nquarter, and to a negative 0.7% in the third quarter.  The  rate\r\n\r\nof decline is quite fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point in bringing this out is that the mechanisms\r\n\r\nwe have in place are not accurately addressing the real problems\r\n\r\nseen  by  the  business community.  Many of us  have  asked  for\r\n\r\nbolder  measures from the Government, as far back as  July  1997\r\n\r\nduring  the 1997/1998 Budget debate.  Unfortunately, the outcome\r\n\r\nwas otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, it is a little difficult to assess the\r\n\r\nimpact of the measures that we have identified because we do not\r\n\r\nhave the details of the actions from the Government.  However, I\r\n\r\nhope  they  will  take  our request into serious  consideration,\r\n\r\nsince  we have not been very far off in the last one and a  half\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must be more aggressive and not rely on\r\n\r\nsmall  steps  or  piecemeal measures, like the $2  billion  off-budget  measures that we announced earlier this year.   That  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  in  my opinion did not move the economy even  a  little\r\n\r\nbit.   We  must  learn from Japan's struggle for  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears.   Japan also tried to take many piecemeal actions and  it\r\n\r\nresulted in wasted efforts and wasted money with Japan's economy\r\n\r\nstill in trouble today.  So I hope this time we do not waste our\r\n\r\nefforts and money and I hope we will be more aggressive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the Government's share of the $10\r\n\r\nbillion  reduction  proposed is not  sufficient.   While  I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  wages  make up a  large  proportion  of  total\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost, I feel that the reduction in Government charges,\r\n\r\nlevies,  utilities and so on needs to be higher  than  the  15%.\r\n\r\nFrankly, the 15% reduction in business cost falls short  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community's expectation of 20-25%.  In fact, even  the\r\n\r\n20-25% is not a cooked-up number.  In fact, I did a calculation.\r\n\r\nFor  the manufacturing sector, based on the real increases  that\r\n\r\nhave  gone on in the last three to four years, and based on  the\r\n\r\ncurrency  depreciation in our neighbours we really needed  about\r\n\r\n25-30%  of reduction to be competitive.  So 15% falls  short  of\r\n\r\nour  expectation.   However, I feel that  the  $7  billion  wage\r\n\r\nreduction is sufficient.  But the Government's portion needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  much  more and I am suggesting 30-40% reduction in  all  the\r\n\r\nareas  that I have just mentioned.  While I understand that  the\r\n\r\nreal Government charges form a very small component of the total\r\n\r\nbusiness cost, but really, there are many \"hidden costs\" in  our\r\n\r\nsystem of governance in Singapore.  Some of these are the  COEs,\r\n\r\nthe ERP, petrol tax, GST, worker levies, and many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore.   So although our official income tax is among the  lowest\r\n\r\nin  the  world,  the  net effect of all the indirect  taxes  and\r\n\r\ncharges is significant to the bottomline of businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach of autonomous agencies in the Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  statutory boards while,  in  principle,  looks\r\n\r\ngood, has resulted in `micro-managing' of our economy where  all\r\n\r\nof  them  either want to make surpluses or profits individually.\r\n\r\nCollectively, the impact on businesses can be very high.  So  if\r\n\r\nwe  look  at  the  charges  from all  these  agencies,  the  net\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  business  cost  is  more  than  what   we\r\n\r\nofficially  classify as business charges.  I feel  that  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  to make sacrifices in certain agencies where they must  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  have deficits or losses, as long as the  collective\r\n\r\nresult  to the Government's budget is positive, if that is  what\r\n\r\nwe aim for every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that the Government spend between $5 billion\r\n\r\nand  $7  billion to boost the economy, not just the $3  billion.\r\n\r\nOf  course, we have seen numbers that if we go for $5-$7 billion\r\n\r\nthat  would mean a 50-60% reduction in Government charges  which\r\n\r\nmay  not be realistic.  So, what we are asking for down here  is\r\n\r\nthat  part  of it should come in real reduction in  charges  and\r\n\r\nlevies, and the rest of it could come in the form of pumping  in\r\n\r\nsome   liquidity   to  boost  local  consumption,   which   also\r\n\r\ncontributes to about 30% of our economy.  These can be in  terms\r\n\r\nof more generous tax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that we temporarily bring down the GST charges\r\n\r\nfrom  3%  to  1%.  I am not suggesting a complete suspension  of\r\n\r\nGST,  as  many business leaders have suggested to us, because  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  we still have the right system in  place  and  we\r\n\r\nshould keep the machinery of the system going.  If we completely\r\n\r\nsuspend the GST, putting in the mechanism in place again in  the\r\n\r\nfuture will be troublesome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the $3 billion or so that the Government\r\n\r\nplans  to  reduce in terms of costs will come from  our  current\r\n\r\naccount.   I would like to suggest that we take this opportunity\r\n\r\nnow to dip into our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreserves.   Since  we were willing to do so for  our  neighbours\r\n\r\nlike  Thailand,  Indonesia and Malaysia, the  Government  should\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  giving  some  of  the  surpluses   and  the\r\n\r\nreserves back to Singaporeans who badly need it now.  It is  the\r\n\r\ntime to help stimulate domestic consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are looking forward to substantial reduction in\r\n\r\nrentals by JTC and HDB for industrial and commercial properties,\r\n\r\nthese  reductions  should not be in the form of  rebates.   They\r\n\r\nshould be permanent reductions if we really want to build  long-term  investor confidence in Singapore.  Rebates  will  go  away\r\n\r\nafter  some time and do not give a feeling of long-term thinking\r\n\r\non  the Government's part.  Given how much our land and property\r\n\r\ncost  has  gone up compared to our neighbours in  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  we need drastic reductions in rental, again to the  tune\r\n\r\nof 30-40% reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign workers form an important part of our economy. We\r\n\r\nknow  we cannot do without them.  While I understand and support\r\n\r\nthe  need to bring in mainly skilled workers, however we already\r\n\r\nhave  a  large pool of unskilled workers in Singapore.  It  will\r\n\r\ntake  some  time to either replace them or train them to  become\r\n\r\nskilled  workers.   Since  they are already  here,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  reduce the levies by 50% for  both  skilled  and\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers.   For skilled workers,  the  cut  should  be\r\n\r\npermanent.  For the unskilled workers, we can issue a time table\r\n\r\nof  increases back to the original levels over a period of three\r\n\r\nyears.   In  this way, we will help many companies survive  this\r\n\r\ndownturn  while we compel them to make long-term plans to  train\r\n\r\ntheir workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are\r\n\r\naffected  by  cash  flow  problems.  While  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nenhanced  the  Local Enterprise Financing Scheme  (LEFS)  to  be\r\n\r\nbroader based and pumped in more money to it, unfortunately, the\r\n\r\nbanks   are  still  the  deciding  bodies.   Given  the   ultra-conservative  stance  of  our  banks  in  this  environment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, many companies are still finding it very difficult to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the scheme.  I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that PSB or some other Government body  take  a\r\n\r\ndirect  approach  in  financing some of  our  viable  companies,\r\n\r\nbecause they are finding it very difficult convincing the banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traders also contribute substantially to our economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to credit squeeze from our ultra-conservative banks\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, they are not able to take  advantage of the still\r\n\r\nattractive  trades that exist in South Asia, China,  Africa  and\r\n\r\nEurope.   I  have  heard  of a number of  big  traders  who  are\r\n\r\nplanning to move and relocate out of Singapore to countries like\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and  Thailand to carry out their trading  activities\r\n\r\nbecause of lack of credit facilities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest some form of Government supported trade\r\n\r\nfinancing  scheme,  quite similar to the  LEFS.    Sir,  with  a\r\n\r\nbetter  trade  financing  scheme, we  can  avoid  the  drain  of\r\n\r\nexpertise out of Singapore or even prevent the collapse of  some\r\n\r\nstill viable traders who are located here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, I have focused on the immediate cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness issues and the short-term action  plan  proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Trade and Industry through the CSC Report.\r\n\r\nI  would now like to touch on the long-term strategies.   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, the strategies spelt out by the Committee are excellent\r\n\r\nand  will without doubt get the whole nation mobilised  to  work\r\n\r\ntowards achieving the plans that we have set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the longer term, I see the economic recovery coming in\r\n\r\na  few  stages.   First, we will have to focus on our  immediate\r\n\r\ncost  competitiveness issues which I believe we  are  very  well\r\n\r\nfocused  on.   The second stage will be to build  upon  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore and also in investor confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   This  is because a lot of investors, especially  those\r\n\r\nfrom  the West, look at the stability of the region as  a  whole\r\n\r\nand  they do not just look at Singapore as a country.  So if  we\r\n\r\ncan  bring stability and confidence in the region faster,  funds\r\n\r\nwill  flow in even faster.  The issue of confidence building  is\r\n\r\nan urgent issue and I hope that the Singapore leaders can take a\r\n\r\nlead to get ASEAN organised to speed up the recovery process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stage of recovery will have to be in finding new\r\n\r\nmarkets  and boosting demand.  We cannot rely on our traditional\r\n\r\nmarkets.   We  have learnt this lesson very well.  So  both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the private sector can play an important role  by\r\n\r\nexploring  new markets and regions.  I believe this has  already\r\n\r\nbeen set in motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of strategic land pricing, I am glad that the\r\n\r\nCSC  has  recommended  a new way to price  industrial  land  and\r\n\r\nproperties  and  to  benchmark increases  to  the  increases  in\r\n\r\ncountries  that are competing with us, as opposed  to  increases\r\n\r\naccording  to  the market rates in Singapore.   I  call  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  learn  from its past mistake  in  this  area  by\r\n\r\nputting  in  place measures that will prevent land  prices  from\r\n\r\nescalating  so  drastically  in a short  span  of  time,  as  we\r\n\r\nexperienced in the last few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land prices do make a big impact when it comes to selecting\r\n\r\nan  investment  site for a manufacturing facility,  although  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard leaders saying that it forms a very small  component\r\n\r\nof  total  operating  cost.  But when it  comes  to  deciding  a\r\n\r\nlocation to site a factory, it plays a major role.  In fact,  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few years, I have experienced two occasions  when  we\r\n\r\nwere  trying  to  select a new manufacturing facility.   On  one\r\n\r\noccasion,  the  land  cost played a major  role  in  causing  my\r\n\r\ncompany to select Thailand as the site rather than in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On entrepreneurism, I fully support the strategy because I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that if we have to compete as a global player, we  need\r\n\r\nto  have  more knowledge-based industries and we cannot continue\r\n\r\nto  rely on an asset based economy as we have done in the  past.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  create an environment in Singapore  that  promotes\r\n\r\nbusiness  risk  taking and to encourage more  technopreneurs  to\r\n\r\nemerge.   In  my opinion, the Government agencies that  we  have\r\n\r\ntoday are very entrenched in just supporting the MNCs, while the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  to  support  local technopreneurs  is  not  well\r\n\r\ndeveloped.   We  need mindset changes among  those  involved  in\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagencies.  Local start-ups and people who are involved in  these\r\n\r\nstart-ups feel discouraged by the lack of support given to  them\r\n\r\nand their projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to develop a culture of tolerance to failures and\r\n\r\nto  give  people  second chances.  Sir, success  should  not  be\r\n\r\nmeasured  by  straight 'As' alone.  How we  classify  and  label\r\n\r\npeople  at  such  an  early stage through practices  like  early\r\n\r\nstreaming in schools affects our children's self esteem and many\r\n\r\nwill  end up giving up and not willing to try again, as they  go\r\n\r\nalong  in life.  Society and Government's attitude towards those\r\n\r\nwithout academic excellence needs to change and we must  have  a\r\n\r\nbroader  definition  of  \"success\" that  goes  beyond  material,\r\n\r\neconomic and academic measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area that needs to be looked at is the help for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  who  need  to  raise funds  necessary  for  their\r\n\r\nprojects.  I call on the Government to further liberalise  rules\r\n\r\non  how  funds can be raised for start-up companies and unlisted\r\n\r\ncompanies.    Singaporean   venture   capitalists   are   highly\r\n\r\nconservative just as our banks are and we need more foreign ones\r\n\r\nto  set  up funds here in Singapore, so that they can create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment similar to the one in Silicon Valley in USA and  the\r\n\r\nHsinchu based Science Park in Taiwan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of developing more world class companies is excellent.\r\n\r\nWe  need  many more companies like Creative Technology  who  are\r\n\r\nglobal  players. Sir, being small is not an excuse for the  lack\r\n\r\nof  such  world  class companies.  We can learn from  the  small\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries like Finland and Switzerland who  have  many\r\n\r\nworld  class global companies like Ericcson and Nokia.  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the suggestion that the Government acts as  a  business\r\n\r\nfacilitator.   The  Government  should  indeed   only   play   a\r\n\r\nsupporting  role  and create space for the  private  sector  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  move  in.  So far, the  Government  has  been\r\n\r\ncrowding  some  parts  of the business environment.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies (GLCs) should not compete with local\r\n\r\nprivate  companies in the domestic market.  Instead, because  of\r\n\r\ntheir size and access\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  substantial  funds, GLCs should bring their  competition  to\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore and in addition, bring along with  them  some\r\n\r\nSMEs  by  getting  them to do parts of a big  overseas  project.\r\n\r\nThis initiative has not been fully explored by our local GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I am happy that the Government is willing to\r\n\r\nreact  fast  to tackle the problem of our declining economy.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  measures implemented will be bold  and  I  hope\r\n\r\neveryone  will  seriously implement them fast.   I  applaud  the\r\n\r\nworkers  for  their  understanding  for  the  wage  cuts.    The\r\n\r\nemployers  and the Government need to play their part  and  take\r\n\r\ntheir fair share of actions so that together we will emerge as a\r\n\r\nstrong economy and as a country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.56 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, under the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the  regional  economic crisis,  many  companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are in danger of having to close down, and  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  people  are  losing  their  jobs.   This  has  forced  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to admit that the business cost in Singapore is  much\r\n\r\ntoo high, and that Singapore has lost its competitiveness in the\r\n\r\ninternational market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) Report points\r\n\r\nout  that  even before the currency crisis broke out,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould no longer compete on the basis of business costs alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government's policy has all along been to adhere to the\r\n\r\nso-called  \"market economy\" principle, and to allow the  various\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  to  soar  unchecked. This  has  not  only  made\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost heavier, but has also caused the people's  burden\r\n\r\nin  life  to  be getting heavier and heavier.  When  the  market\r\n\r\nconditions  suddenly turn bad, the businesses which are  already\r\n\r\noverloaded  with very heavy business cost will immediately  find\r\n\r\nit  unbearable  and  face the danger of having  to  close  down.\r\n\r\nEventually, the workers will become unemployed, and their burden\r\n\r\nin life will be  made even heavier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, over the years, many businessmen have been\r\n\r\ncomplaining  of  high  business  costs.   I  have,  on  numerous\r\n\r\noccasions,  pointed out in this House  that with the  Government\r\n\r\ncontinously   increasing  the burden of  the  people,  once  the\r\n\r\neconomy  unfortunately  turns bad, the people  will  find  their\r\n\r\nburden in life unbearable.   But the Government  just  would not\r\n\r\nlisten to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh said, \"Because our business cost is too high,\r\n\r\nwe are losing our share in the United States' electronics import\r\n\r\nmarket.  Before the start of the regional crisis, in the  second\r\n\r\nquarter of 1997, Singapore's share in the US electronics  import\r\n\r\nmarket was 9.3%.  In August this year, it has dropped to 7.4%\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, during the same period, Malaysia's share in the\r\n\r\nUS  electronics import market rose from 7.1% to 8.2%.  For China\r\n\r\nit  rose  from  7.2% to 10.1%.  However, during this  period  of\r\n\r\ntime,   the renminbi did not suffer a huge devaluation like  the\r\n\r\nringgit and baht.  China has become more competitive, while  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness   has   substantially   diminished.    Had   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  made preparation for the people and  the  businesses\r\n\r\nduring  good times, and exercised some restraint in its  act  to\r\n\r\nprosper the coffers by increasing the business cost here,  today\r\n\r\nwe may not have to face such drastic wage-reduction measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report recommends a total wage-cost reduction of 15% and\r\n\r\nto  set  back  the  wages  to that  of  the  1994  level.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  immediately takes the cue and indicates that  it  is\r\n\r\naccepting  the  CSC's recommendation by proceeding  to  cut  the\r\n\r\nemployers' CPF contribution by 10%.  The National Wages  Council\r\n\r\n(NWC)  immediately responded by announcing that wages should  be\r\n\r\ncut by 5% to 8%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am puzzled with the CSC's recommendation of 15% cut in the\r\n\r\ntotal wage-cost to set back wages to that of the 1994 level.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Report does not give a clear explanation as to why it\r\n\r\ncame  to  the  conclusion  that the total  wage-cost  should  be\r\n\r\nreduced  by  15%.  Neither  did the Report  list  out  the  cost\r\n\r\nstructures of the various\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsectors in the economy nor produce convincing data to prove that\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation  for  wage cut is necessary  and  cannot  be\r\n\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although the CSC Report mentions that the currencies\r\n\r\nof the other countries in the region have devalued substantially\r\n\r\nsince  July  1997,  resulting in Singapore  further  losing  its\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,   DPM Lee did not seem to think  so.   On  19th\r\n\r\nFebruary 1998, he said in Parliament, I quote :\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): \"Luckily, we are competitive. Our costs are not\r\n\r\nout  of  line.   If you measure exchange rates  against  the  US\r\n\r\ndollar,  the baht, the ringgit, the rupiah and the won have  all\r\n\r\ngone  down much more than the Singapore dollar.  This  has  made\r\n\r\nthese  countries  cheaper than us, in a way,   more  competitive\r\n\r\nthan us.  But the effect is smaller than these numbers suggest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he went on to explain why he said so, and he concludes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So overall, although the exchange rate of the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar has gone down much less than our neighbour's, I am  still\r\n\r\nconfident that our exporters can compete.  They have problems if\r\n\r\nthey are working in the region.   They have problems if they are\r\n\r\nin  difficult businesses like disk drives. But it is not because\r\n\r\nwe are out of line and uncompetitive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is what DPM Lee said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): That being the case, why has the Government\r\n\r\nsuddenly  decided  to cut the wages of the workers  because  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness is in trouble?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, although some people are worried that many companies\r\n\r\nmay close down and result in serious unemployment if our workers\r\n\r\ndo  not  accept  a  wage  cut,  the Secretary-General  of  NTUC,\r\n\r\nMinister Lim Boon Heng, did not feel that we should worry  about\r\n\r\nthis  problem.   He was reported in the Straits  Times  of  16th\r\n\r\nNovember 1998 as saying that Singapore had enough jobs for every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  and  no one would starve because of  this  economic\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if DPM Lee is confident that even when other\r\n\r\ncountries'  currencies  have been devalued,  our  exporters  can\r\n\r\nstill  compete  and the Cabinet Ministers are not worried  about\r\n\r\nunemployment,  then why do we need to reduce our workers'  wages\r\n\r\nand employers' CPF contribution?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report has recommended that the total wage cost be\r\n\r\nreduced  by 15%-10% reduction in the employers' CPF contribution\r\n\r\nand  5%  from  the wages.  The whole cost-reduction  package  is\r\n\r\nworth  $10 billion, of which $7 billion will come from the wage-cost  and  $3 billion from non-wage cost.   Just now,  some  MPs\r\n\r\nmentioned that it was fair.  Is this really fair?  The  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the NWC announced that labour, management and the Government\r\n\r\nshould  be  in  the  same boat to share the same  happiness  and\r\n\r\ntroubles.   But now we can see that when there is  trouble,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are the first to bear the brunt. They  have to shoulder\r\n\r\n70%  of  the sacrifice.  But when times are good, do the workers\r\n\r\nenjoy  the profit on a 7:3 ratio?  Or do they just get  3:7?   I\r\n\r\nshall leave it to everyone to make his own judgement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, in the present circumstances, to reduce the\r\n\r\nworkers'  wages and to ask the workers to bear 70% of the  cost-reduction  burden  is  very  unfair.   As  of  March  1998,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  actual gross revenue was $27  billion,  which  was\r\n\r\nsome  $550  million  more  than  the  projected  revenue.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  take  the lead to substantially  reduce  its\r\n\r\ncharges  and  rentals  and not reduce  the  workers'  wages  and\r\n\r\nsubject them to much hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report has recommended that the wage level be\r\n\r\nreduced  to that of the 1994 level.  This is a regressive  step.\r\n\r\nThe  cost of living now  is significantly higher than  in  1994.\r\n\r\nBut amazingly, the Government accepted this recommendation.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   seems  to have forgotten that it  has  promised  to\r\n\r\nbring our standard of living to that of the Swiss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to newspaper reports, the taxation experts are of\r\n\r\nthe  view  that  there  is  nothing new  in  this  Report.   The\r\n\r\nExecutive Director of the International Chamber of Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  seems to want to see some meat left on the  bone.   He\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  although  the  report  recommended  a  total\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the  wage-cost, it  did  not  give  any  specific\r\n\r\nsuggestion on how to execute it, apart from the CPF cut.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot an economist, but I must point out that this Report has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfailed to give adequate grounds and data to prove that the total\r\n\r\nwage-cost must be reduced by 15%.  We are asking the workers  to\r\n\r\naccept 1994 wages to pay for 1998 cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should not mandate a 10% cut in the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF contribution, or for that matter, the amount  of\r\n\r\nwages  to  be  reduced.    With the economy  turning  bad,  many\r\n\r\nworkers  are already suffering a loss of income.   I  feel  that\r\n\r\nwages of the workers will be automatically adjusted according to\r\n\r\nthe   market  situation,  and  the  profits  or  losses  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.   What  the  Government  should  do  is   to   reduce\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate to the Special Account and Medisave  Accounts\r\n\r\nof  the  workers.  And also it should reduce the employees'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  so  that they could have higher take-home  pay  to\r\n\r\ntide  over the difficult times.  Although wage-cost takes  up  a\r\n\r\nbigger  part of our total business cost, I feel that by reducing\r\n\r\nother  non-wage  business costs would also help to  achieve  the\r\n\r\ntarget of reducing the total business cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information given by the Ministry of Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry, in the the manufacturing sector,  51% of its  business\r\n\r\ncost  came  from  service  cost,  including  transportation  and\r\n\r\ncommunications, utilities and rentals, and other  indirect taxes\r\n\r\nsuch  as GST, import duty, property tax, etc.  Among the  labour\r\n\r\ncosts,  apart  from salaries, there is also the  foreign  worker\r\n\r\nlevy, SDF, training and welfare funds, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time of economic depression, the Government should\r\n\r\ntake the lead and make use of the reserves accumulated over  the\r\n\r\nyears  to  help  reduce  business cost by  cutting  the  various\r\n\r\ncharges  and  taxes, in order that Singapore  would  regain  its\r\n\r\ninternational competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the most important thing to do is to help our companies\r\n\r\nlook  for  and penetrate  into new markets.  At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nstimulate  consumption  in  the domestic  market,  so  that  our\r\n\r\nproducts  may  be  marketed, and there will be capital  to  roll\r\n\r\nover.   If a company has no business, its products cannot  sell,\r\n\r\nthen even if business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncost  is reduced, wages of the workers are cut, the company will\r\n\r\neventually  have to close down, and the workers will lose  their\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I remember\r\n\r\nwhen I was a little boy, I used to venture into the compound  of\r\n\r\na  certain   house  in the kampong where I lived.   This  family\r\n\r\nreared  a  few hens and a pig.  I particularly enjoyed  watching\r\n\r\nthe  hens  laying their eggs.  What amused me was  the  rate  at\r\n\r\nwhich different hens laid their eggs.  Some laid a lot of   eggs\r\n\r\nwhile some laid not as many.  One day I asked the master of  the\r\n\r\nhouse,  who  was a respected kampong elder, why it was  so.   He\r\n\r\nsmiled  and  told me, \"The healthier hens, those well  nourished\r\n\r\nand  better fed ones, naturally are  more productive and can lay\r\n\r\nmore  eggs.   The  under-nourished and sickly ones,  of  course,\r\n\r\ncannot  lay  as  many  eggs. But, If I were to  slaughter  these\r\n\r\nweaker ones, then I would not even get one single egg from them.\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like what the Chinese say, \"If there is no soil, there\r\n\r\nare no flowers.\"  Without hens, how do we get eggs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same with our workers today. They have answered the\r\n\r\ncall  for a wage reduction.  They are prepared to accept a  wage\r\n\r\ncut,  not that they derive any pleasure in doing so, but because\r\n\r\nthey  know  that this is a bitter pill they have to  swallow  in\r\n\r\norder  to  help  their employers tide over the  difficult  times\r\n\r\nahead.   If  the company can survive, they can keep their  jobs,\r\n\r\nand  they   can then have take home pay to support the families.\r\n\r\nWe  should not slaughter the hens to get their eggs.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nour   opposition  party  members  and  their  employers   should\r\n\r\nunderstand the plight and intention of the workers.  Our workers\r\n\r\nhave  made  short term sacrifices and we hope that the employers\r\n\r\nwill  respond in kind.  They should manage their companies  well\r\n\r\nso  that  the workers' sacrifices will not be in vain.  The  10%\r\n\r\ncut  in  CPF  is painful but cannot be avoided. We must  prepare\r\n\r\nwell in advance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not prepared, Mr Low would ask why we did not see it\r\n\r\nfit to be prepared.   When we are prepared, he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasked why should we do so.  We do so in order to ensure that our\r\n\r\nworkers would keep their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers have shown guts and determination. They are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take  a  wage  cut.   However,  the  higher-income\r\n\r\nexecutives  should make even bigger sacrifices  by  accepting  a\r\n\r\ndeeper  pay-cut.   If possible, the lower-income workers  should\r\n\r\nbe   spared  the  wage  cut.    As  the  biggest  employer,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should take the lead.  I believe our Government  will\r\n\r\ndo   so.    Sir,   today,  our  workers  have  manifested   such\r\n\r\ndetermination  and spirit of unity and their sacrifice  deserves\r\n\r\nour  applause.  They must not be forgotten when the  good  times\r\n\r\nreturn.   The  employer should do the same.  We should  not  act\r\n\r\nlike the Opposition Members.  We should not add more troubles to\r\n\r\nour  workers. If we are pragmatic, adjust our measures,  we  can\r\n\r\nstill live a comfortable life in Singapore.  Our market economy,\r\n\r\naccording to Mr Low, is without restraint.  Our economy develops\r\n\r\nwithout  restraint.  Therefore, we are in this plight.  However,\r\n\r\nwhat  I learnt from the various reports, I see quite a different\r\n\r\npicture.  Many economists agree that because the Government  has\r\n\r\nmade proper policies to guide our economy, therefore, we are not\r\n\r\nlike  other  countries in this region who suffer gravely  during\r\n\r\nthe economic and financial turmoil.  He said we are unreasonable\r\n\r\nin asking our workers to meet  the 1998 cost of living with 1994\r\n\r\nlevel of wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the figures carefully, we will find that various\r\n\r\ntypes  of  daily  necessities have fallen in prices.   The  NTUC\r\n\r\nFairPrice  has benefited from the off-budget measures and  these\r\n\r\nbenefits  are  passed  on  to  the  consumers.   We  hope  other\r\n\r\nbusinessmen should not find any pretext not to do so.   Whatever\r\n\r\nsavings they get, they should pass them on to the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make another suggestion that our public\r\n\r\ntransport  cost be lowered. According to estimates, out  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost  in operating public transport, 50% comes  from  the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>workers' wages. So, with a 10% cut in the employers' CPF contri-Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbution,  the operational cost should be reduced by at least  4%.\r\n\r\nI  suggest that the public transport operators give a 5%  rebate\r\n\r\nto  passengers who purchase farecards.  For every  $10  farecard\r\n\r\npurchased, a  50 cent rebate should be given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC cooperatives have also announced a series of measures\r\n\r\nto  help  the workers. For example, NTUC FairPrice has announced\r\n\r\nprice reduction to  some of the sundry and daily essential goods\r\n\r\nin  its  outlets. This will help to lower the cost of living  of\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary  workers.    We  hope all  these  well-intentioned\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  receive  similar  response  from  merchants  and\r\n\r\nsupermarket operators to see how prices can be lowered.  When we\r\n\r\nare  facing  an  economic crisis, we need to have  a  spirit  of\r\n\r\nunity.   We  should look for the root causes of our  malaise  to\r\n\r\nfind out how the employers, Government and workers can unite and\r\n\r\nwork together to solve the problems.  If we take a short cut, as\r\n\r\nwhat  our  neighbouring  countries have  done,  to  devalue  our\r\n\r\ncurrency  or to make use of our financial surpluses and  reserve\r\n\r\nto  tide  us  over the crisis,  we will bring more troubles  and\r\n\r\npains  to our economy, although these measures may appear to  be\r\n\r\npainless  and  superficially effective.   Therefore,  we  should\r\n\r\nthink   of  pragmatic  measures.   We  should  bear  some  pain.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as long as we believe all these efforts and sacrifices\r\n\r\nare  for  a  better tomorrow, then I think we are in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification from the Member, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Member mentioned\r\n\r\nthe   hen-and-egg dilemma. In his speech, he said that the  wage\r\n\r\ncut  was to prepare for a rainy day.  If what he said was indeed\r\n\r\ntrue, then I shall question the motive of the cuts in employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution rate and wages.  Are the cuts  necessary  now?\r\n\r\nOr  is there a political motive over the proposed cuts?  You cut\r\n\r\nthe wages and CPF contribution now and then just before the next\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election  in  the year 2002, the  PAP  Government  will\r\n\r\nincrease the workers' wages to show that this Government is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter  than those in the other countries.  When we were at  the\r\n\r\noutset of the economic crisis, many of our leaders said that our\r\n\r\neconomy  was  very  strong and our fundamentals  were  firm  and\r\n\r\nsound. However, these fundamentals seem to be pretty shaky  now.\r\n\r\nIf the Government has been very effective, then our workers will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to face this drastic wage cut now.  This is like  two\r\n\r\nathletes  taking part in a 400-metre race.  Athlete A fell  down\r\n\r\nat  the  200-metre mark, while Athlete B continued  running  but\r\n\r\ncollapsed at the 300-metre mark.  Although both athletes did not\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  race,  Athlete B turned to Athlete  A  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  I ran 100 metres more than you did. Therefore, I am  the\r\n\r\nwinner.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was not going into the\r\n\r\nargument  of  whether we have hens first  or  eggs  first.   The\r\n\r\nexample I quoted was to illustrate the point that  we must  have\r\n\r\na  healthy  hen  in  order to get good  eggs.   The  recommended\r\n\r\nmeasures are meant to prepare us for the worst.  Just now Mr Low\r\n\r\nremarked  that in February this year, DPM Lee had  claimed  that\r\n\r\nour  economy  was  quite all right.  I do not know  whether  our\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  are  in  the  habit  of  not  reading   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.   The   economy  changes  every  week,  every   day!\r\n\r\nToday's  situation is very much different from what it  was  six\r\n\r\nmonths ago.  As a matter of fact, even in the second quarter  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, we still had a positive growth.  But, by  the  third\r\n\r\nquarter of this year, we began to have negative growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the various economic reports, we can see that certain\r\n\r\ncountries were not seriously affected by the financial crisis in\r\n\r\nthe  beginning.  However, they are in a significantly  different\r\n\r\nsituation  now.   For  example, a worker told  me  that  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the crisis, people called it the \"tongyam  effect\",\r\n\r\nbecause  it  originated  in Thailand.  Soon  after  that,  other\r\n\r\ncountries in the region were affected, and it became the  \"Asian\r\n\r\nflu\".   With  the  troubles in Russia and  Latin  America,  this\r\n\r\ncrisis  is going   globalised.  It has become a global  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.   The  world of economics is dynamic. It is not  static.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  say  that  the  across-the-board  wage  cut   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  No doubt, some companies are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstill  making good profit.  To them, I say, \"Please do not  take\r\n\r\nthese wage-cut measures rigidly.\"   They can reduce the price of\r\n\r\ntheir  services  or  goods to help the workers.   Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  look  at the situation as a whole.  If we  look  at  the\r\n\r\nsituation  from  some  small micro-perspectives,  then  it  will\r\n\r\nenhance our workers' anxiety, as they do not know what to expect\r\n\r\nnext.   We  should be united, work as a team, be pragmatic,  and\r\n\r\nthen we will have a better tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): We often hear that the Singapore political\r\n\r\nleaders  are far-sighted, having good judgement, and  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  \"helicopter views\".

But we are considered not  bad.\r\n\r\nOn the Internet, someone remarked that in Singapore, the acronym\r\n\r\nIMF stand for \"I am fine.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  effects of this severe recession are well known and  keenly\r\n\r\nfelt  in  all sectors of the economy.  Companies have borne  the\r\n\r\nbrunt of falling businesses, rising unemployment, increases  the\r\n\r\nanxieties of the consumers.  In turn, the contraction of  demand\r\n\r\nsets   off  another  cycle  of  business  downturn.   Some  have\r\n\r\ncriticised  the  Government for responding  too  slowly  to  the\r\n\r\nrecession.   On the other hand, the Government has  earned  high\r\n\r\nmarks  both  internationally and from a majority of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfor  her steady and measured response.  On a macro level, we are\r\n\r\nprogressing  well  to  address  the  problems  thrown  up.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  instituted steps to prepare  and  persuade  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  accept the bitter medicine.  It has to be  taken  at\r\n\r\nthis juncture.  This is but the first step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic situation is regional but could be global\r\n\r\nsoon,  if  Japan does not stimulate its economy.  We  also  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  American demand is already flagging as is evident  by\r\n\r\nthe latest report on non-oil domestic exports.  We should not be\r\n\r\ngloomy  and  just wait for changes in the region to benefit  us.\r\n\r\nWe know this will not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  in the near future.  Even then, things will not be the  same\r\n\r\nagain  and  we, the people of Singapore, must stand together  to\r\n\r\ndefine  and achieve relevant new roles in the future millennium.\r\n\r\nCost-cutting  measure  is  a temporary  step  to  help  business\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  save  jobs.  Doing this alone  cannot  ensure  our\r\n\r\nsuccess  in the new environment of a global economy.   Continual\r\n\r\nlong-term  development  towards a creative  and  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy has to be pursued vigorously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness has recommended six\r\n\r\nstrategic responses to the crisis and recommended five  specific\r\n\r\nmeasures to deal with immediate challenges posed by the regional\r\n\r\ncrisis.  I do not propose to read out what is clearly stated  in\r\n\r\npages 2 to 5 of the Report.  I think the one item that has  made\r\n\r\nthe headline is item 20.a. of the Report and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Reduce total wage costs (including contributions to the Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund (CPF) by 15% from 1997 level to bring  our  wage\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, as measured by RULC, [that is the relative unit\r\n\r\nlabour  cost] back to the level of 1994.  To achieve  this,  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF  contribution rate  should  be  reduced  by  10%\r\n\r\npoints.   The  rest  of the cost reduction  should  be  achieved\r\n\r\nthrough the flexi-wage scheme, by a reduction in the annual  and\r\n\r\nmonthly variable components of wages.  The public sector  should\r\n\r\ntake the lead in this;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this recommendation. It\r\n\r\nwill  affect all individuals with CPF accounts.  It will  affect\r\n\r\ntheir  housing loans and mortgage payments.  And it will  affect\r\n\r\ntheir  overall  old age savings.  It will mean  that  they  will\r\n\r\nsuffer  a drop in their take-home pay if there is a further  cut\r\n\r\nin  the  variable  wage  component.   All  these  will  have   a\r\n\r\ntremendous  effect on Singaporeans, especially  the  middle  and\r\n\r\nlower-income group.  Added to this is the fear of  job  loss  or\r\n\r\nretrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC's recommendation had been hotly debated by many.\r\n\r\nSome  good and useful suggestions have been made.  But one thing\r\n\r\nis  for  sure, people are agreeable fundamentally to the various\r\n\r\ntough measures recommended.  They differ only in the sharing  of\r\n\r\nthe  burden  over the three sectors - the employees,  Government\r\n\r\nand  the private business.  Although it has been explained  that\r\n\r\nthe employee's share is in line with its proportion in the total\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncost, I think that there is a case for the Government to take on\r\n\r\na bit more of the burden.  It is not that the Government has not\r\n\r\ndone  anything.  It has already given property tax  rebates  and\r\n\r\ntaken other steps to alleviate various sectors in the $2 billion\r\n\r\noff-Budget package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the labour movement, through NTUC union\r\n\r\nleaders'   alertness  and  tireless  work,  not  only  persuaded\r\n\r\nsuccessfully workers' acceptance of wage cuts but work  speedily\r\n\r\nto come out with a package to help reduce the pain.  The various\r\n\r\nsteps  taken  by  NTUC  to  help is commendable  and  should  be\r\n\r\nhighlighted.  The NTUC should be praised for taking  steps  like\r\n\r\ncutting  the  prices of groceries, 122 items had about  9%  cut,\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres,  NTUC pharmacies, Denticare,  and  providing\r\n\r\nabout  $2  million  loan  grant scheme  for  students  who  need\r\n\r\ntextbooks, and food outlets.  In addition, I learn that NTUC  is\r\n\r\nusing  $12  million  to  help  NTUC Income  policy  holders  and\r\n\r\nborrowers  to  pay premiums and housing loans.   These  measures\r\n\r\nworth $23 million will help to soften the effect of CPF and wage\r\n\r\ncut  to  lower-income Singaporeans.  Singaporeans, on the whole,\r\n\r\nas  I said, should be thankful that NTUC has come out to provide\r\n\r\nthis  safety net for some of the domestic costs.  For those  who\r\n\r\nlost  their  jobs,  there  are  many  agencies  trying  to  find\r\n\r\nalternative   jobs  for  them.   These  include  our   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils, the Ministry of Manpower and, again, NTUC.\r\n\r\nWorkers who need jobs should not be too fussy.  They should take\r\n\r\nup the jobs given to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always depended on foreign workers to clean the tables\r\n\r\nat  our hawker centres, domestic help and construction work.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  time has come for Singaporeans to do some  of  these\r\n\r\ntasks and be less dependent on foreign workers.  Attitudes  must\r\n\r\nchange to accept these jobs as an honest and respectable way  to\r\n\r\nearn  a living.  I have come across many retrenched workers  who\r\n\r\nare  unable  to  meet  payments  in  utilities  and  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges.   Yet, they are reluctant to accept lower paying  jobs.\r\n\r\nThere  are  twin problems facing them.  One is in  the  area  of\r\n\r\nutilities and conservancy charges.  The other one is to meet the\r\n\r\ndaily household\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeds.  I have therefore proposed to my Bukit Timah CDC to  help\r\n\r\npay  part of their arrears in utilities and conservancy  charges\r\n\r\nprovided  they first accept available jobs and show a commitment\r\n\r\nto stay employed.  This will go a long way to ease their worries\r\n\r\non  overhanging  debts.  Businesses have also responded.   Banks\r\n\r\nlower  interest rates and reschedule loans.  Rentals are falling\r\n\r\neverywhere and in every sector, although my feedback is that the\r\n\r\nlargest property players are not responding in a significant way\r\n\r\nto  the  tenants'  cries for help.  I hope  this  perception  is\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people at the business sector are stretched. But the\r\n\r\nGovernment still has substantial reserves and this is  the  time\r\n\r\nto  stretch that hand and use that umbrella for a while.   Limit\r\n\r\nto  a  quantum  we can afford without seriously undermining  the\r\n\r\neconomic  foundation.  I ask the Government to  look  into  this\r\n\r\nbecause a fair number of Singaporeans cannot reconcile the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they have to take cuts on their wages and CPF, and yet  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is prepared to give billions of dollars of  loans  to\r\n\r\nour neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchment and wage cuts are a real blow to many Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThere  are a few categories.  (1) Those who have been retrenched\r\n\r\nand  cannot find another job easily.  Many are sole breadwinners\r\n\r\nof  the family.  (2) Young couples have problems with their  20%\r\n\r\ncash  payment for the new HDB flats.  Perhaps, we should  reduce\r\n\r\nthis  to  10% on a case-by-case basis.  (3) Those whose CPF  are\r\n\r\nfully  committed to housing loans but have no disposable  income\r\n\r\nleft  to  make up for the shortfall of the 10% cut.  The present\r\n\r\nunemployment figure of 20,000 and above will be growing.  Unlike\r\n\r\nin  1985,  this economic downturn is going to be more  prolonged\r\n\r\nand its effects will be worse, primarily because of heavier loan\r\n\r\nmortgages and a higher cost of living.  In 1985, housing was not\r\n\r\nso expensive and people's commitments were less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer term issue is how are we to compete with our\r\n\r\nneighbours when recovery comes as costs of doing business in the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare very much lower.  This is one big challenge we face: how  to\r\n\r\nconvince investors to want to come here and set up business  and\r\n\r\nthus  create jobs for our people despite our higher costs.   Our\r\n\r\nstrong  Singapore dollar compared to the devalued  baht,  rupiah\r\n\r\nand  ringgit is an obvious factor.  But we have no intention  to\r\n\r\ndevalue our currency.  The Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister  for  Trade and Industry  have  many  a  time\r\n\r\nexplained why and I do not think I can do any better except that\r\n\r\nI  support this view that our imports are obviously cheaper with\r\n\r\na  stronger Singapore dollar.  Our measures to bring down  costs\r\n\r\nwill  definitely help.  But I think it is still  not  enough  to\r\n\r\ncounter  the  much  lower business costs in Thailand,  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Korea.  Either we move our business to the region,\r\n\r\nas some are doing, or we stay and find niche businesses that the\r\n\r\nothers are not able to compete with us.  It is easier said  than\r\n\r\ndone.   But we hope the EDB team will scout the globe  and  come\r\n\r\nback  with  businesses  that will capitalise  on  our  country's\r\n\r\nmanpower and skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has made recommendations on the strategies for the\r\n\r\nfuture  competitiveness.   In particular,  emphasis  is  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services sectors as its twin engines of growth\r\n\r\nand  these  are  correct  strategies.  We  must  avoid  being  a\r\n\r\nproperty  economy as it is very unproductive.  The  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nhub  services is a good move in the right direction.  We  should\r\n\r\nbuild  Singapore  as a premier service hub in Asia,  emphasising\r\n\r\nour  existing  hub services where we have achieved international\r\n\r\nrepute,  for example, financial services, international trading,\r\n\r\ntransport and logistics, exhibition management and tourism,  and\r\n\r\nof  course develop new high growth hub services in health  care,\r\n\r\neducation,   media  communication  and  information   technology\r\n\r\nservices, e-commerce and direct marketing.  All these are in the\r\n\r\nReport, and they are good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these recommendations by the CSC, page 118 of the\r\n\r\nReport  calls on the Government to review Government regulations\r\n\r\nand bureaucratic red tape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPage  118  of the Report, item 12.b., lays down how to  minimise\r\n\r\nthe costs of compliance incurred by businesses, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We should consider setting up an Inter-Ministry Committee to\r\n\r\ncoordinate the formulation and implementation of all  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  to  ensure that there is no  conflict  or  overlap.\r\n\r\nThis  Committee  should be an extension of the SIU.   Government\r\n\r\nagencies can further increase their cooperation so as to improve\r\n\r\nefficiency;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reminded, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Feedback Unit, there was a call for the  setting\r\n\r\nup of an Inter-Ministry Committee.  Many similar calls were made\r\n\r\nby  the  private sector then to see whether we could  coordinate\r\n\r\nmany  of  the issues that involve different Ministries  and  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of an Inter-Ministry Committee was called upon.   It\r\n\r\nnever took off.  Now that the Committee has made such a call,  I\r\n\r\ndo  hope it will be implemented.  And I guess one reason for the\r\n\r\nMinistry in not setting up this Inter-Ministry Committee is that\r\n\r\nmost  Ministries guard their turfs very jealously.  I think  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's  Office should take the lead  in  establishing\r\n\r\nthis Inter-Ministry Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lose out in labour cost, we must make up through a\r\n\r\nhighly-skilled,  well-trained, disciplined and agile  workforce,\r\n\r\nable   to   master  new  technologies,  especially   information\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  new  skills.  We must always  be  prepared  for\r\n\r\nchange.   I agree with the Deputy Prime Minister when  he  said,\r\n\r\n\"Change  will  affect  not  just individuals,  but  also  entire\r\n\r\nsectors of the economy.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is to strengthen our\r\n\r\nkey  success  factors, that is, to build on our  strength,  good\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  good communication links, good services,  clean\r\n\r\nGovernment  and, of course, very important, political stability.\r\n\r\nAn  investor wants to make sure he gets returns for his  capital\r\n\r\ninvestment  as quickly as possible.  Through today's  debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  CSC's  Report  and other sub-committees' reports,  we  have\r\n\r\nshown  the  world  that Singapore is determined  to  better  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  climate.  This will be a clear signal that  we  will\r\n\r\nadapt  change  to meet the new business climate and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill be seen as a unique\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople,  ready to accept even pay cuts at a tremendous  personal\r\n\r\nsacrifice  to  meet this challenge, a gesture  that  shocked  my\r\n\r\nfriends in the West and in Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time nor will\r\n\r\nit be a one-off affair.  We did it in 1985 and I am sure we will\r\n\r\ndo  it  again, if need be.  Those who are watching how we manage\r\n\r\nthe  recession will marvel at our people's sacrifice.  They know\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  a  tough  people, that we  tackle  our  difficult\r\n\r\nproblems head on and that Singaporeans work and fight as a  team\r\n\r\nwhen the going gets tough.  I support the recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, after much deliberation for more than a year,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) presented  this\r\n\r\nReport and its contents are down-to-earth and has touched a wide\r\n\r\nspectrum  of issues.  It has comprehensively reviewed the  long-term  competitiveness  of Singapore in the international  market\r\n\r\nand  put forward many truly feasible recommendations.  This  can\r\n\r\nwell  be said to be the compass to guide Singapore's economy  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  its  competitive edge to  face  challenges  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Report comprises two main components: short-term\r\n\r\nmeasures  and long-term strategies.  As a Nominated MP  speaking\r\n\r\nin  this solemn forum on national affairs as a representative of\r\n\r\nthe  industrial and commercial sector, I would like  to  present\r\n\r\nour  views  and  raise some supplementary suggestions  from  the\r\n\r\nangle  of  the  industrial and commercial sector.   This  is  my\r\n\r\nobligation, as well as my duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me reflect to\r\n\r\nthis House the views of the industrial and commercial sector  on\r\n\r\nthe  short-term measures as recommended in this Report.  The CSC\r\n\r\nReport  has  recommended  certain measures  such  as  wage-cuts,\r\n\r\nreduction  in  foreign worker levies, land and factory  rentals,\r\n\r\nGovernment  charges, etc.  As a representative of the industrial\r\n\r\nand  commercial sector, I am most concerned with  business  cost\r\n\r\nand therefore I will spend some time on this aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industrial and commercial sector, particularly the\r\n\r\nSMEs, is facing unprecedented operational difficulties.  At this\r\n\r\ncritical  moment of life and death for companies and enterprises\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  the  suggested package of  $10  billion  or  15%\r\n\r\nreduction  in  business cost is like sending a  pot  of  red-hot\r\n\r\ncharcoal in a snowy weather, something deserving our support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we feel that in order to assist our local\r\n\r\nenterprises  effectively, particularly the SMEs, to continue  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  in  this economic crisis, the business cost  should  be\r\n\r\nreduced  by  at  least  20%.   Only then  can  we  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.    Under   the  present   economic   situation,\r\n\r\nparticularly at a time when our currency is much higher than the\r\n\r\nother countries in this region, we feel that a 15% reduction  in\r\n\r\nthe  total  business  cost  may not be  enough  to  enhance  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the international market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as early as the beginning of this year, based on\r\n\r\nfeedback from our members and businessmen in the industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial sector, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and  Industry\r\n\r\nhas recommended some cost-saving measures such as a reduction on\r\n\r\ntotal  wage-cost, Government taxes, foreign worker levies,  land\r\n\r\nand factory rentals, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent interview with Lianhe Zaobao, the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council (NWC) Prof. Lim Chong Yah, said  that  in\r\n\r\norder  for Singapore to be competitive, business cost should  be\r\n\r\nreduced  by at least 20%.  Prof. Lim is a very serious economist\r\n\r\nand  since he holds such a view, I feel that our request  for  a\r\n\r\n20% reduction in our business cost is a reasonable one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the CSC Report has recommended an annual 15% reduction\r\n\r\non  the  total  business cost in five areas, namely,   wage-cut,\r\n\r\nreduction in foreign worker levies, lowering of land and factory\r\n\r\nrentals and  lowering of Government charges, and tax-cuts, apart\r\n\r\nfrom recommending a 10%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the  employers' CPF  contribution  rate  and  the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker levies to be reduced by $50-$100,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nspecific suggestion on the other areas.  It is indeed a pity!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the figures released by the National Wages Council,\r\n\r\nthe 10% cut in employers' CPF contribution would reduce the wage\r\n\r\ncost  by  $4  billion.  By reducing 5% to 8% in the total  wage-cost,  there will be a further reduction of $2.5 billion  to  $4\r\n\r\nbillion.  By combining these two measures, the wage-cost can  be\r\n\r\nreduced by a total of $6.5 billion to $8 billion or 13%  to  16%\r\n\r\nof the employee's national total income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when announcing these guidelines,\r\n\r\nthe  NWC has also urged the employers to consider a smaller  cut\r\n\r\nfor  employees  in the lower income group and a bigger  cut  for\r\n\r\nhigher  pay  senior executives in cutting the  wage  costs.   Mr\r\n\r\nStephen  Lee,  President  of the Singapore  National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Mr  Wee  Cho  Yao, Chairman  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nFederation  of Chinese Clans Association, also appealed  to  the\r\n\r\nCEOs and senior managerial staff, including company shareholders\r\n\r\nand   directors,  to  lead  in  taking  bigger  cuts  in   their\r\n\r\nremuneration.  We welcome this appeal and pledge to give it  our\r\n\r\nfull support.  At the same time, we hope that Government leaders\r\n\r\nand  senior civil servants would also take the lead in having  a\r\n\r\nbigger  wage  cut  to show they are prepared to sacrifice  along\r\n\r\nwith the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a comment in the latest issue of the NTUC News, the\r\n\r\ncost-reduction  package,  recommended  by  CSC,  totalling   $10\r\n\r\nbillion is made up of  15% reduction each from the wage cost and\r\n\r\nnon-wage  cost components in the total business cost.   Although\r\n\r\nin  percentage terms, they are 15% each, in real terms the wage-cost  reduction  amounts to $7.5 billion but the  non-wage  cost\r\n\r\nreduction  is  only $2.5 billion.  All the time,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nemphasising the close tripartite relationship and cooperation of\r\n\r\nworkers, employers and Government.  DPM Lee has also pointed out\r\n\r\nrecently that this is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunique  feature  in our economy that gives us  our   competitive\r\n\r\nedge.   We  feel  that  this very close tripartite  relationship\r\n\r\nshould  not  be undermined.  What we are worried  is  that  this\r\n\r\nlopsided  arrangement, with the workers taking the bulk  of  the\r\n\r\ncut,  may  cause them to be unhappy, thereby weakening our  such\r\n\r\nstrong tripartite relationship.  We are however relieved to note\r\n\r\nthe  clarifications by the leadership of the NTUC that the  wage\r\n\r\ncost  and  non-wage cost reductions are of equal  magnitude  and\r\n\r\nthere is no question of unfairness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: does the reduction of wage cost and non-wage\r\n\r\ncost  components  have  to  be the same?   Should  the  workers'\r\n\r\nsacrifice  and the Government's cost-saving offers  be  matched?\r\n\r\nWe  are  of  the  view  that the Government being  the  national\r\n\r\nresource controller and mobiliser should bear a larger burden of\r\n\r\nsocial  responsibility.  So long as it is within its means,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should make bigger sacrifices than the workers.   The\r\n\r\nnon-wage  cost  reduction should be bigger than  the  wage  cost\r\n\r\nreduction, and it should not be a 50-50 ratio between the two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, when the Singapore economy was\r\n\r\nperforming  well,  like the private sector, Government  agencies\r\n\r\nhave  been making profits or at least not operating at  a  loss,\r\n\r\nand  they  have  therefore accumulated lots of  assets  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people.  However, when the country is  facing\r\n\r\nan   economic  downturn,   the  Government  should  change   its\r\n\r\nstrategies  and make expedient plans to save the situation.   It\r\n\r\nshould reduce service charges and taxes so as to create a better\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  the  business, and ensure  that  companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  continue to survive and the workers'  rice-bowls  are\r\n\r\nprotected.   This  would  also  help  to  attract  more  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments   to   Singapore,   thereby   creating   more    job\r\n\r\nopportunities for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese proverb which says, \"Store your grains to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  lean  years\".  In  the  ancient  agricultural\r\n\r\nsociety,  whenever  there was a bumper  harvest,  the  authority\r\n\r\nwould store the grains in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwarehouse, so that when there was a lean year and when you faced\r\n\r\nfamine,  the local government would open the warehouses and  use\r\n\r\nthe  stored  grains to feed the people.  Now that the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  is  encountering a lean year, should not the Government\r\n\r\nconsider taking out part of its accumulated budget surpluses  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the people?  When the other countries in this region, such\r\n\r\nas  Japan  and Malaysia, proposed their packages to  save  their\r\n\r\neconomies,  they  did not ask their people to accept  wage-cuts.\r\n\r\nBut  in Singapore, we are asking our people to make such  a  big\r\n\r\nsacrifice and the Government is only matching it with  an  equal\r\n\r\npercentage of reduction in non-wage costs.  I think this is  not\r\n\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its Report, the CSC made some recommendations for non-wage cost reductions. Basically, we agree with these\r\n\r\nrecommendations  but we feel that the non-wage  cost  reductions\r\n\r\ncan be more substantive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we suggest that the rebate given by\r\n\r\nJTC  on land rents be raised to 30%, and the factory rentals  be\r\n\r\nreduced by 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also request the HDB to reduce the commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nproperty  rental prices to that of the 1990 level, and  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat Singapore Power could  pass its savings in operational cost\r\n\r\nto  the  consumers by reducing the electricity tariffs. We  also\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  property  tax  rebates  for  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial properties be raised from 55% to 65%, and the rebates\r\n\r\nbe  extended to cover residential properties as well.  This will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  stimulate the property market.  The Government  should\r\n\r\nalso  review  the  annual value of these properties  quickly  to\r\n\r\nreflect the current market value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate income tax should be reduced from 26% to 25%. Petrol\r\n\r\nduties  should be reduced by 30%, and road tax should be further\r\n\r\nreduced by 30%.  Port charges should be reduced by 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We commend the CSC for suggesting that the foreign worker\r\n\r\nlevy be reduced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetween $50 and $100.  But, we feel that it should be reduced by\r\n\r\nat  least $200.  At the same time, the Government should cut the\r\n\r\nforeign maid levy  down from $345 to $200.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also suggest that the ERP charges should be capped at a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $5  per day.  We feel that the LTA  should  further\r\n\r\nreduce  the ERP charges so as to reduce the transportation  cost\r\n\r\nto   help  particularly  the  commercial  sector,  and  also  to\r\n\r\nstimulate growth in the retail industry.  We would, once  again,\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to reduce the GST by 2% so that we pay only\r\n\r\n1% GST.  This will stimulate consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Telecom should reduce the charges for commercial\r\n\r\ntelephone  lines by 30% and the residential lines by  20%.   For\r\n\r\nmobile  phones,  the air-time charges should be  reduced  to  10\r\n\r\ncents per call and the changes should only be levied on outgoing\r\n\r\ncalls.  We are of the view that Singapore Telecom should use the\r\n\r\ncost   savings   from   wage   cuts   to   reduce   its   entire\r\n\r\ntelecommunication charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the costs mentioned above are tangible costs.\r\n\r\nApart  from all these, there are also the intangible costs,  eg,\r\n\r\ntime  cost.  What is time cost?  Time cost is something that  is\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the  bureaucracy in the Government departments.   In\r\n\r\nsome companies, some officers have been deployed specifically to\r\n\r\ndeal  with correspondence with ministries, statutory boards  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies.   These  are very  complicated  and  time-consuming  matters.   Sometimes, you have to  wait  one  to  two\r\n\r\nmonths for a simple application to be processed and approved  by\r\n\r\nthe relevant authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the businessmen, time is money. If\r\n\r\nthe processing procedure of official documents takes such a long\r\n\r\ntime, it is not in line with the PS21 spirit of high efficiency,\r\n\r\nparticularly in application processing.  DPM Lee Hsien Loong has\r\n\r\nrecently made an illustration to describe the difference between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Hong Kong.  He\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaid, \"In Hong Kong, if there is no law to say specifically that\r\n\r\nyou cannot do a certain thing, then you can just go ahead and do\r\n\r\nit.  But  in Singapore, if the law does not specifically provide\r\n\r\nfor you to do it, then you are not allowed to do it!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are about to enter the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThis  is going to be a brand new era.  It will be a sorry  state\r\n\r\nof  affair  if  Singaporeans are still  stuck  in  the  backward\r\n\r\nmentality  of \"no law to say you can do it, then you  cannot  do\r\n\r\nit\".  This certainly does not encourage creativity.\r\n\r\nOf course, we should not be like Hong Kong where \"so long as the\r\n\r\nlaw  does not say you cannot do, then you can do it\".  We do not\r\n\r\nwant  to have that!   However, we should find a point of balance\r\n\r\nbetween  these two extremes.  I feel that if the Government  can\r\n\r\nchange   old  mindset  and to be more  open-minded,   a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary bureaucracy can be done away, and its efficiency can\r\n\r\nbe greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey conducted on the 3rd November by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  among  the\r\n\r\n101  people who responded to the survey, 28% indicated that they\r\n\r\nwere prepared to use the savings from the cost-reduction package\r\n\r\nto  discharge  the company's outstanding debts.  44%  said  that\r\n\r\nthey would use the money to seek and open new markets.  38% said\r\n\r\nthey  would  strengthen their marketing activities to  stimulate\r\n\r\nsales  and  62% said that they would use the savings from  cost-reduction to keep their existing employees in employment.    36%\r\n\r\nsaid  that they would pass on the savings to their customers  by\r\n\r\nreducing  the prices of their products and services.   26%  said\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  use the money to invest  in  new  plants  and\r\n\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government can make bigger reductions in non-wage cost, I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the companies would be more active in responding to\r\n\r\nthe  appeal  of  the  Government and the NTUC  to  make  greater\r\n\r\nefforts in the interest of their own survival and development to\r\n\r\nimprove on their operations, explore new source of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome, reduce wasteful expenditure and endeavour to reduce  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  their  products and services.   By so  doing,  their\r\n\r\nproductivity  will  go  up,   their  sales  will  pick  up,  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  will  be  restored to the market,  thereby  assuring\r\n\r\nworkers of their job security and career advancement prospects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\ncall  upon  all  the businessmen to lower the  prices  of  their\r\n\r\nproducts and services by making use of the savings from the cost-reduction  measures, and thereby alleviating the burden  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other five short-term strategies recommended by\r\n\r\nthe  CSC,  that is, to prevent a credit crunch, to  sustain  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of our investors, to restructure our economy, to open\r\n\r\nnew  markets,  and  to look for new regional opportunities.   We\r\n\r\ntotally  agree  with  the recommendations but  the  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are feasible or not.  For example,  the  CSC  has\r\n\r\nrecommended a strategy to prevent a credit crunch by saying that\r\n\r\nwe  should expand our Local Enterprise Assistance schemes to our\r\n\r\nSMEs,  so  as to give our promising companies more liquidity  in\r\n\r\ntheir  capital.   This  is good.  But the  banks  are  now  very\r\n\r\ncautious  and have tightened their credit facilities.   They  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to commit themselves in providing more assistance  to\r\n\r\nour SMEs.  This may contradict the recommendation of the CSC and\r\n\r\nwarrant our attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CSC Report has also proposed eight major strategies in\r\n\r\nthe long-term development of Singapore economy.  Let me give  my\r\n\r\nview  on these strategies.  The CSC believes that, for the  next\r\n\r\n10  years,   manufacturing and services should  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nemphasised  as  the twin engines of growth to develop  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto   an   advanced   knowledge-based  economy    with   global\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Such  a vision is undoubtedly  wonderful,  and\r\n\r\nvery   attractive.   If   realised,   it  would  certainly  make\r\n\r\nSingapore a paradise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific recommendation by the Committee is that our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industry, including our local enterprises\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the  MNCs, should work together to produce high value-added\r\n\r\nproducts  and  to  provide a base for related services  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.   As  for  the service industry, it should  develop  its\r\n\r\npresent  areas of service, to cultivate new areas and to develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  Asia's No. 1 service hub.  The  Committee  also\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  the Government should appoint  a  lead  economic\r\n\r\npromotion agency to review and champion the developments of each\r\n\r\nservice  industry with the support of other Government  agencies\r\n\r\nas a total approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully appreciative of the CSC for this specific\r\n\r\nrecommendation,   particularly the part that calls for a  review\r\n\r\nof  the existing policies and the departments which provide  the\r\n\r\nregulatory  framework.  We  feel  that  the  Government   should\r\n\r\nimmediately  establish an inter-Ministry task-force,  preferably\r\n\r\nto  be  led  by  the  Prime  Minister's  Office,  to  conduct  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review  on the bye-laws and  regulations  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Government departments.  All those which are no  longer\r\n\r\nrelevant,  not conducive to business operations, or  unnecessary\r\n\r\nover-lapping should be repealed and removed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, strengthening our external wing. We agree that we\r\n\r\nshould  help our companies to go regional because the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndomestic  market is much too small.  Opening of oversea  markets\r\n\r\nwill  beneft our local enterprises.  However, we hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could set up an Overseas Investment Risk  Fund.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, when our investments in the overseas markets were  to\r\n\r\nencounter   unfavourable   situations,  such  as  the  political\r\n\r\nturmoil  in  Indonesia, then we would at least have  some  basic\r\n\r\nprotection and we would not lose every cent of our investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third long-term strategy is to build up world-class local\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Our Government-linked companies are very  strong  in\r\n\r\nresources.   They are in the best position to take the  lead  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping our local skills, venturing overseas, and  eventually\r\n\r\nevolving into our very own MNCs.  But the question is: is  there\r\n\r\nany part where our SMEs can play in the process?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  hope  that Singapore will emulate the companies in Japan  or\r\n\r\nItaly, such as Toyota or Fiat.  They go to various countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  world to open their markets and their local  SMEs were able\r\n\r\nto   hitch-hike   on  their  successes.   The  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  should provide opportunities for SMEs to  participate\r\n\r\nin providing peripheral services.  They should not be completely\r\n\r\nprofit-orientated  and go for the kill in all their  endeavours,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  speculating in the property market.  It was said  that\r\n\r\nrecently a Government-linked company even wanted to venture into\r\n\r\nthe  roast duck business.  Of course, there are many avenues for\r\n\r\ninvestment.  But if you are using a cannon to hunt for sparrows,\r\n\r\nthen  you  are  wasting  your talents  and  resources  on  petty\r\n\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, strengthening our base of SMEs. The report\r\n\r\nrecommended that  we should help the SMEs to give full  play  to\r\n\r\ntheir   potential  so  that  they  could  be  strengthened   and\r\n\r\neventually  developed into our future MNCs.  But  there  are  no\r\n\r\nspecific recommendations on how to go about doing it.   We  feel\r\n\r\nthat the Government should grant more concessions to our SMEs on\r\n\r\ntaxes,  skill  development opportunities and on the distribution\r\n\r\nof  resources, so that they will not be stagnated at its present\r\n\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully agree with the fifth long-term strategy on having\r\n\r\nhuman and intellectual capital as a key competitive edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth strategy of leveraging on science and\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  innovation, we feel that  it  is  a  very  good\r\n\r\nsuggestion.    The  question  is whether  or  not  our  business\r\n\r\nadministration  concept can catch up with the express  train  of\r\n\r\ninformation era, for example, whether or not we can  accept  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  having  our  employees  working  from  home,  using\r\n\r\ncomputer  network  and  other information technology  equipment.\r\n\r\nThen, they will not need to go to office to work.  If we can let\r\n\r\n30% of our employees operate from their homes, then we would  be\r\n\r\nable to save a lot of office space, which means savings\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  office  rents as well as transport expenses.  The  employees\r\n\r\nwill  save  a  lot  of time travelling to and from  office.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  LTA  may  lose some revenue as the number  of  vehicles\r\n\r\npassing through the ERP gantry points during peak hours will  be\r\n\r\nsignificantly  reduced.   In any event,  if Singapore is  really\r\n\r\ngoing to leverage on the cutting edge of information technology,\r\n\r\nthe  most  important  thing  is  to  change  from  our  outdated\r\n\r\nindustrial age  business administration  concept to fit into the\r\n\r\nvarious policies based on the latest information technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh strategy is to optimise resource management.\r\n\r\nYes, we agree that we should make full use of our land resources\r\n\r\nand  to  have  better  management of our  water  resources.   We\r\n\r\nsupport  the recommendation to set up a committee or  agency  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  our land distribution and pricing policy. We  should\r\n\r\nalso  proceed to have the desalination plant as planned so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  make full use of the abundant water resources from  the\r\n\r\nocean  around us.  I suggest that the relevant authority  should\r\n\r\nperhaps  learn from the Chinese scientists and try to  introduce\r\n\r\nthe Chinese technology of desalination to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully agree with the eighth long-term strategy ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, your time is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday  we  meet under difficult circumstances.  Our  economy  is\r\n\r\ntechnically in recession.  Many of my fellow workers  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched.   More  will lose their jobs, not because  they  are\r\n\r\nincompetent  or  because the companies are  badly  run.   It  is\r\n\r\nbecause we are victims of the regional economic crisis.  But  we\r\n\r\nwill  fight to regain our competitiveness.  That is why we  have\r\n\r\naccepted  an overall wage reduction.  We in the labour  movement\r\n\r\nfully  support  the  measures recommended by  the  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness.  The CSC has not only proposed wage\r\n\r\ncuts,  but  it has charted a more durable future for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt is a future where the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfortunes of one sector of the economy will not have too great an\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the  development of our economy as  a  whole.   Yes,\r\n\r\ndiversification  is the in-thing.  Over the  years,  our  unions\r\n\r\nhave  secured  better  wages and more fringe  benefits  for  our\r\n\r\nmembers.   Despite  this,  we have been  able  to  attract  more\r\n\r\nforeign  investments.  Why?  Because we have shown to be capable\r\n\r\nand  productive  workers.   Regrettably,  the  currency  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours depreciated to a larger extent than ours in  relation\r\n\r\nto the US dollar.  This has eroded our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an employee in the electronics industry, I can sense the\r\n\r\nsharp  downturn.   It  is  difficult to have  to  tell  workers,\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, you have to go on shorter work week or you have to  stay\r\n\r\naway  from  work  for  a  while.\"   This  means  not  only   the\r\n\r\ndisappearance  of overtime, but also a pay cut in basic  salary.\r\n\r\nIt is even more heart-rending when you have to tell the workers,\r\n\r\n\"Very  sorry,  you  are retrenched.\"  Many of  those  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers have given the best years of their lives to the company.\r\n\r\nI   must  acknowledge  here  that  it  is  equally  painful  for\r\n\r\nmanagement  to  part with loyal and hardworking  employees.   To\r\n\r\ntheir credit, some managements have gone all the way out to work\r\n\r\nwith unions to help these workers marked for retrenchment.  They\r\n\r\ngive us advance notice so that we can do two things:  to arrange\r\n\r\nfor  training  of  these workers and find alternative  jobs  for\r\n\r\nthem.   Other  companies have also been just as  helpful.   They\r\n\r\ntake  these retrenched workers on board, send them for  training\r\n\r\nunder  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme and give  them  every\r\n\r\nencouragement  to do well, sometimes entirely in  the  new  work\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Without such caring employers, our workers  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  face even more trying times.  But this is not  to  say\r\n\r\nthat   all  managements  are  reasonable.   Some  have   behaved\r\n\r\ndisgracefully and treated workers with little or no  compassion.\r\n\r\nBut by and large, our managements are an enlightened lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the problems faced by retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers.  Those with families to look after and housing loans to\r\n\r\nservice  are  the ones who need to get jobs quickly.   But  what\r\n\r\nkind of jobs are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\navailable  in  the market?  Sometimes these retrenched  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially the older ones, face particular difficulties.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  because  they  want  to pick and  choose.   Please  let  me\r\n\r\nexplain.  A factory operator may have a low education.   But  if\r\n\r\nhe  is laid off, can he find another similar post?  In the past,\r\n\r\nyes.   Today, it is not that easy.  His low education,  his  low\r\n\r\nlevel  of  skills,  his  age - these all  become  barriers.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we can tell him to go for training to acquire new skills\r\n\r\nbut  this  is  easier said than done.  If he cannot upgrade  his\r\n\r\nskills,  does it mean that he will face structural unemployment?\r\n\r\nThe  answer is yes, unless he can change his mindset and  accept\r\n\r\nany job open to him.  Again, this is easier said than done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have 600,000 foreign workers in our midst. So even if\r\n\r\n20,000  or  30,000 Singaporeans lose their jobs, we  should  not\r\n\r\nhave  any problems finding jobs for them.  No, we are not asking\r\n\r\nfor  every  retrenched Singaporean we should get a foreigner  to\r\n\r\nmake way for a Singaporean.  This is not the way things work and\r\n\r\nthis  is not the way we do it.  Foreign workers are here because\r\n\r\nwe  need  them.   Just  because we run into a  serious  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  does not mean that we have to send them back  just  like\r\n\r\nthat.   The  point I am making is that there are jobs for  those\r\n\r\nwho  are retrenched and they can apply for them.  But these  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  kind  of  job that they want.   That  is  why  our\r\n\r\nretrenched workers should reconsider the options.  Is it the pay\r\n\r\nthat  is a deterrent?  Is it the distance from home?  Is it  the\r\n\r\nconditions of work?  Whatever it is, we must solve this problem,\r\n\r\notherwise we will be stuck with structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, employers can help by not turning people down\r\n\r\nfor  work simply on account of age.  Allow me to raise the  case\r\n\r\nof  a  man.   He  is  52 years old and who used  to  work  as  a\r\n\r\nstorekeeper in  a fashion house.  He was retrenched.  He applied\r\n\r\nfor many jobs but was turned down.  He thinks it was because  of\r\n\r\nhis  age.   Even  when  he applied for a  job  in  a  Government\r\n\r\nMinistry, the first question he was asked was to state his  age.\r\n\r\nThe man could not understand why his age was so critical when he\r\n\r\nwas applying for the post\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  an  office attendant.  By the way, the man remains  jobless,\r\n\r\nworried sick and he has to support his family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no longer an economy with full employment. The\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate  has risen to 4.5% in  September,  but  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that we can have what it takes to overcome our present\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Tripartism in Singapore is not a slogan.  It is a\r\n\r\nreality.  So there is no need for us to be despondent.   We  can\r\n\r\nand we will emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in the past, in good times when NWC announced the\r\n\r\nguidelines,  food prices, especially cooked food, coffee  prices\r\n\r\nand  transport charges went up.  I hope today in this  difficult\r\n\r\nsituation, when NWC has already announced a wage cost reduction,\r\n\r\nthe hawkers, the coffeeshop owners and the bus operators are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsympathetic enough to reduce their prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Debate to be continued on what day, Mr\r\n\r\nLee?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-nine Minutes to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REVAMPING OF EDUCATION SYSTEM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Progress)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) what\r\n\r\nis  the  progress  of his Ministry's efforts  in  revamping  the\r\n\r\neducation system; (b) whether his Ministry has been implementing\r\n\r\nthis  on a pilot basis in primary and secondary schools and,  if\r\n\r\nso,  whether there are any specific results; and (c) what is his\r\n\r\nassessment  of the revamp in terms of preparing our students  to\r\n\r\nconfront the new challenges of a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system has served us well over the years. Today,\r\n\r\nwe have a fundamentally sound system where  quality education is\r\n\r\ndelivered  to  all  our  pupils,  not  just  the  best  and  the\r\n\r\nbrightest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE thus does not intend to revamp our whole system radically.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  seek to do is to re-position and refine the system  to\r\n\r\ndevelop our young to meet future challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three key trends have emerged for the future: globalisation,\r\n\r\nrapid  technological change and transition to a knowledge  based\r\n\r\neconomy.    Given   these  trends  and  the  challenges   facing\r\n\r\nEducation, we have to re-align the focus of our education system\r\n\r\ntowards developing the full spectrum of talents and abilities of\r\n\r\nevery child, and not just in terms of academic achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-positioning of the education system aims to put in place\r\n\r\nways  to  identify  and help every child  maximise  his  or  her\r\n\r\ntalents  and abilities and harness their potential.  As part  of\r\n\r\nthe process, we have identified six strategic areas of focus for\r\n\r\nthe next five years.  These are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, designing a responsive education structure. We want\r\n\r\nto be able to identify the talents and abilities of our students\r\n\r\nearly,  and to design educational programmes to cater  to  their\r\n\r\ndifferent needs.  We want to customise, as much as possible  and\r\n\r\nwithin limits of our resources, the education being delivered to\r\n\r\neach child;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, inculcate values and nurture thinking skills\r\n\r\nthrough  the  formal  and  informal curricula.   The  three  big\r\n\r\ninitiatives that we have embarked on, namely National Education,\r\n\r\nNurturing  Thinking Skills, and Masterplan for IT in  Education,\r\n\r\nare part of overall efforts to achieve this;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, creating a leaner-centred school environment.

The teacher\r\n\r\nis  key to everything we do in Education.

As a\r\n\r\ncritical  part  of Singapore's transition towards  a  knowledge-based  economy, we need  to position ourselves  as a talent  and\r\n\r\nknowledge capital.  MOE's role is to develop Singapore  into  an\r\n\r\neducation  hub  through a two-prong approach: first,  developing\r\n\r\nand hosting institutions that can provide an excellent education\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans, and second, to attract quality  talent,  both\r\n\r\nlocal and foreign to these institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, MOE will provide excellent\r\n\r\nadministrative support to our schools and institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have embarked on the new initiatives in recent years.\r\n\r\nAfter  some  initial adjustment problems, schools are  embracing\r\n\r\nNational Education and the introduction of IT.

For example,  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of Division I officers in the Service  has  doubled,\r\n\r\nfrom  17%  of the total population in 1988 to 34% in 1997  while\r\n\r\nthe percentage of Division III officers has dropped from 31%  to\r\n\r\n25%,  and  Division IV officers, from 19% to 10%, over the  same\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large increase in 1994 (14.0%) was due to a major\r\n\r\nsalary  revision exercise in that year. The salary revision  was\r\n\r\nintroduced in conjunction with the introduction of co-payment of\r\n\r\nmedical  expenses.  Civil Servants who accepted the new  medical\r\n\r\nschemes  which  required them to co-pay  medical  expenses  were\r\n\r\ngiven salary revisions averaging about 7%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in 1996 (10.4%) was also larger than normal\r\n\r\nbecause  of the relatively bigger NWC wage adjustment (6.5%)  in\r\n\r\nthat year. In addition, there was also an increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  Division I officers in 1996 by 16.5%, which is significantly\r\n\r\nhigher than the average increase of 9.3% per year for the period\r\n\r\n1988  to 1997. The increase of  Division I officers in 1996  was\r\n\r\nlargely due to an increase in the recruitment of teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIVIL SERVICE VACANCIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Prime Minister what is the\r\n\r\nprogress   from  August  1998  to  October  1998  in  recruiting\r\n\r\ngraduates to fill vacancies in the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service recruited 359 graduate officers from Aug-Oct 98.

Nearly  one-fifth\r\n\r\n(19%) were aged 50 or older.

The annual gross salary\r\n\r\nof  a  CEO is US$178,000 in Singapore, higher than US$96,000  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  marginally  higher than  US$167,000  in  Taiwan,  and\r\n\r\ncomparable to US$173,000 in US.  Please see tables 1, 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine whether wages in Singapore are high, low or medium,\r\n\r\none  way is to compare wages of people in equivalent occupations\r\n\r\nwith  other countries.   Within the domestic economy, we  should\r\n\r\nalso  benchmark  the growth in wages against  output,  that  is,\r\n\r\nwhether productivity growth has been in tandem with wage growth.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, productivity growth lagged behind real earnings\r\n\r\ngrowth in Singapore.  While real earnings increased by around 4-5%  annually over the past 5 years, productivity growth  lagged,\r\n\r\nat  1-2% in 1996 and 1997.  In contrast, in Taiwan, productivity\r\n\r\ngrowth  outstripped earnings growth substantially. In  developed\r\n\r\neconomies,  although productivity growth rates were lower,  real\r\n\r\nearnings   growth  was  even  more  subdued.   We   have   hence\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseen Singapore's relative unit labour cost rising gradually  but\r\n\r\nsteadily  over  the years.  It has worsened further  since  July\r\n\r\n1997  as  the depreciation in regional currencies was not  fully\r\n\r\noffset by a rise in their nominal wages.

Transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1988 to 1997, two major revisions were made to bus and\r\n\r\nMRT  fares.   The first revision took place in 1990  when  fares\r\n\r\nwere  revised after remaining unchanged for more than  6  years.\r\n\r\nThe  second  fare revision was 7 years later in 1997.There  were\r\n\r\nalso  two minor adjustments, in 1994 and 1995, when the  maximum\r\n\r\nfare was raised by one fare stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase in bus and MRT fares over this period kept pace\r\n\r\nwith the general increase in consumer prices, and were way below\r\n\r\nthe increase in wage levels. (See Table 1 below).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi fares have increased faster than MRT and bus fares.\r\n\r\nHowever,  although  taxi fare increases  exceeded  that  of  the\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the  CPI,  taxis remain  affordable  because  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in taxi fare is significantly lower than the  increase\r\n\r\nin average wage levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>PSA</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For PSA terminals, local stevedorage is the single largest\r\n\r\ncharge  paid  by  container shipping lines for the  handling  of\r\n\r\nlocal containers, forming up to 70% of total port charges.  From\r\n\r\n1988  to  1997, PSA has reduced local stevedorage  charges  from\r\n\r\n$160 to $150 for a 20 ft. container, and from $228 to $215 for a\r\n\r\n40  ft. container.

They believe that the reputation of\r\n\r\na university rests not only on teaching but also on its research\r\n\r\nexcellence,  and that a strong research standing  attracts  good\r\n\r\nacademic  staff  and students.  The universities have  generally\r\n\r\nfocused their research efforts on niche areas, including  multi-disciplinary  research, in which they can  make  an  impact  and\r\n\r\nwhich are of strategic relevance to Singapore and the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY97, MOE allocated the universities a budget of $94.5\r\n\r\nmillion  to  be  used  on  research  activities,  including  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  equipment and recruitment of supporting  manpower.\r\n\r\nThis  is  almost  9%  of  the  total  budget  allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversities, and does not include the salaries of the  academic\r\n\r\nstaff   which   are  covered  under  the  universities'   normal\r\n\r\nallocations.   The  universities also have  access  to  research\r\n\r\nfunding  from  other  sources, eg  NSTB,  MOH,  MINDEF,  various\r\n\r\nfoundations, and the industry.  In total, they obtained  another\r\n\r\n$68.8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some 19 national research institutes and research\r\n\r\ncentres  hosted  by our universities.  These institutions  focus\r\n\r\nmainly  on research that has high national relevance.   NUS  and\r\n\r\nNTU  also have faculty-based research centres which nurture  new\r\n\r\nniche areas in research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our vision for Singapore to be a centre of\r\n\r\nexcellence in education, our universities, together with various\r\n\r\nGovernment   agencies,  have  recently  initiated  international\r\n\r\ncollaborations   at   an   institutional   level.    Cooperative\r\n\r\narrangements have been formed with top institutions like MIT and\r\n\r\nJohns Hopkins.  These seek to uplift the quality of research and\r\n\r\nteaching  at our universities and to help them reach world-class\r\n\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, the researchers in our universities\r\n\r\nhave   fostered  strong  links  with  industry  and   Government\r\n\r\nagencies.   There  are also numerous projects conducted  jointly\r\n\r\nwith  researchers  from top institutions around  the  world,  eg\r\n\r\nStanford   University,   University   of   Cambridge,   Tsinghua\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of postgraduate research students has more than\r\n\r\ndoubled in the past 5 years from 1551 in 1994 to 3956 this year.\r\n\r\nThis  is due to the aggressive recruitment drives undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  universities to bring in the best students  from  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  around the world.  Selected undergraduates are also exposed\r\n\r\nto  research work through specially tailored programmes in order\r\n\r\nto cultivate their interest in research at an early stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities have made concerted efforts to ensure that\r\n\r\ntheir   R&D   works  are  commercially  viable  or  academically\r\n\r\nrelevant.    Both  have  institutional  outfits   that   promote\r\n\r\ncommercialisation and technology transfer, namely  the  Industry\r\n\r\nand Technology Relations Office in NUS and the Innovation Centre\r\n\r\nin  NTU.   Over  the  past 3 years, they have  been  granted  65\r\n\r\npatents  and  have set up 20 spin-off companies.   Successes  in\r\n\r\ncommercialising staff research cover a broad range of areas from\r\n\r\nwaste  water treatment to orthopaedic implant products to sensor\r\n\r\nsystems.  Beyond commercially oriented research, there is also a\r\n\r\nsignificant  level  of  basic  research  which  encompasses  the\r\n\r\nbreaking of new frontiers in knowledge and innovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HELP FOR NEEDY STUDENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation (a) if his Ministry has set up a mechanism during this\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn to identify needy children who cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto  pay for school fees, new textbooks and uniforms in 1999; (b)\r\n\r\nwhether  provision has been made to help out such students  and,\r\n\r\nif  not,  where  can  parents find help; and  (c)  whether  such\r\n\r\ninformation is made known to all schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education gives free textbooks and school fee\r\n\r\nsubsidies   to   students   who   need   financial   assistance.\r\n\r\nApplication  forms for the Financial Assistance  Scheme  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained   from   schools.
