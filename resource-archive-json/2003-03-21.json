Member Irene Ng left off\r\n\r\nyesterday,  this cut on the abandoned babies  has  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the  situation  as we currently  have.   Given  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law  at the same time and our concern  for  the\r\n\r\nwell-being of the abandoned babies, what can the Ministry\r\n\r\ndo  to  help the community understand the issues  and  to\r\n\r\nfind  ways  and means to help abandoned babies and  their\r\n\r\nmothers and/or putative fathers so as to send a signal to\r\n\r\nthe  society  at large that, while we do not condone  the\r\n\r\nabandonment of babies, we would still help the  expecting\r\n\r\nmothers  and  their  babies and,  where  possible,  their\r\n\r\nfathers too?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, yesterday, my\r\n\r\ncolleague spoke on the abandonment of babies and the need\r\n\r\nto  provide  a safe environment for them.   I  could  not\r\n\r\nagree more because, each year, there are many couples who\r\n\r\nhead  for  places elsewhere to look for babies to  adopt.\r\n\r\nYet,  in  Singapore, we have, on average,  five  or  more\r\n\r\nabandoned  babies each year.  I was told there were  five\r\n\r\nin 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many well-meaning Singaporeans out\r\n\r\nthere  who  are more than happy to accept these  children\r\n\r\nand  we give them a safe and warm environment.  They  are\r\n\r\nprepared to give our babies a second chance.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  judge the morality of the parents  who  dump\r\n\r\nthese children.  There are reasons for wanting to abandon\r\n\r\nthe  babies, albeit anonymously.  The law, as Prof. Ngiam\r\n\r\nhas  earlier  pointed out, does not  make  it  legal  for\r\n\r\nanyone to abandon babies.  They could be jailed for up to\r\n\r\nseven  years  and  be fined.  There are penal  provisions\r\n\r\nlike  these,  and  we wonder why people are  not  leaving\r\n\r\ntheir  babies  at HDB doorsteps, or even offering  babies\r\n\r\nfor adoption at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister, in his recent reply, said that\r\n\r\nonly  a  few  jurisdictions allow for legal  dropping  of\r\n\r\nbabies.   I  had wanted to ask the Minister if  in  these\r\n\r\njurisdictions,  the introduction of such legislation  has\r\n\r\nresulted in an increase in the number of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbabies  being abandoned.  Even if it has, does it matter?\r\n\r\nThe  issue at hand is one of morality.  Of course, it may\r\n\r\nbe  said  that  permitting mothers to drop  their  babies\r\n\r\nanonymously  may encourage foreign workers to  unlawfully\r\n\r\nget  pregnant, and to choose baby abandonment as  opposed\r\n\r\nto  abortion  as  the preferred route to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  I am referring here to the sex workers and work\r\n\r\npermit  holders.  The problem may be more  apparent  than\r\n\r\nreal,  as it can be dealt with administratively.  We  can\r\n\r\nrequire  them to go for more regular check-ups to surface\r\n\r\ntheir  pregnancy  way  before the full  term.   And  this\r\n\r\nleaves  us  only  with  a  very  small  segment  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation  who could possibly get away with an  unlawful\r\n\r\npregnancy.  My suspicion is that, as in the days when  we\r\n\r\ntacitly  allowed  babies to be dropped at  CHIJ,  we  may\r\n\r\nnever have a greater number of abandoned babies than  was\r\n\r\nthe case previously.  This baby drop was stopped sometime\r\n\r\nin the 1980s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that allowing parents to anonymously leave\r\n\r\ntheir  babies  will  allow  for greater  opportunity  for\r\n\r\ncounselling and advice since they will have the  absolute\r\n\r\nassurance  that the full weight of the law  will  not  be\r\n\r\nthrown at them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to relook at our policies. The problem will\r\n\r\nnot go away by denying the legality of baby drops.  Think\r\n\r\nof  the  babies who have been abandoned in  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear.   One was left bloodied and naked, in a lift  lobby\r\n\r\nat  Sims  Place.  She was lying on newspapers  and  could\r\n\r\nhave  been easily mauled by stray dogs, attracted by  the\r\n\r\nsmell of the mother's blood fresh on the skin of the new-born baby.  Another was left on the bench at the basement\r\n\r\nof  KK  Women's  and Children's Hospital  on  a  November\r\n\r\nevening.   Yet, a third was found in a cardboard  box  in\r\n\r\nthe  lift  landing of a block of flats  in  Tiong  Bahru.\r\n\r\nOver  the  last  month, we had two abandoned  babies  who\r\n\r\ndied.   How  many  more babies have  to  die  before  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will act?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not personally think that there are compelling\r\n\r\nreasons not to allow legal baby drops for adoption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin, could you finish your speech\r\n\r\nsoon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Yes, I am finishing.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to thank hon. Members who have spoken about our  TFR\r\n\r\nand  the  need for us to look into the issue of abandoned\r\n\r\nbabies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry defines its policy goal on family in a\r\n\r\nsimple phrase:  \"More Strong and Stable Families\".  Short\r\n\r\nand sweet, to the point.  Our policies are designed to be\r\n\r\npro-family, pro-marriage and pro-children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first talk about our policy goal of \"More\r\n\r\nFamilies\".   Mr Charles Chong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee  Shoon,  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer  Lee and Dr Maliki have asked about our marriage\r\n\r\nand  birth trends.  Sir, Members must well know that  the\r\n\r\nbirth  rates have not been very encouraging in  the  past\r\n\r\nfew  years.  The number of resident births fell to 38,700\r\n\r\nin  2002, compared to 39,300 in 2001 and nearly 45,000 in\r\n\r\n2000.   The total fertility rate has continued  to  fall,\r\n\r\nfrom  1.6 in 2000 to 1.41 in 2001.  Last year, it  hit  a\r\n\r\nrecord low of 1.37.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2000, the Prime Minister announced the Baby\r\n\r\nBonus  and the Third Child Paid Maternity Leave  schemes.\r\n\r\nTogether  with  these  two schemes,  we  also  introduced\r\n\r\nmarriage  and  paternity leave in the civil service,  and\r\n\r\nextended  the  childcare subsidy to non-working  mothers.\r\n\r\nIn  2002, the child sick leave was made available to male\r\n\r\ncivil  servants and extended to children up to  12  years\r\n\r\nold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of measures we introduced in 2000 takes\r\n\r\na   holistic  approach,  providing  not  only   increased\r\n\r\nfinancial   support,  but  also  measures  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nchildcare options, work-life practices as well as  public\r\n\r\neducation.   Our  approach has been  to  create  a  total\r\n\r\nsocial   environment  conducive  to  family  and   having\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my Ministry is concerned with the fall in\r\n\r\nfertility rates, we think that it would be too  hasty  to\r\n\r\nconclude that these initiatives are ineffective.   Family\r\n\r\npolicy,  however well developed, requires  a  strong  and\r\n\r\nstable economic environment to achieve its purpose  of  a\r\n\r\nstable  or  high  TFR.  Let me quote  the  experience  of\r\n\r\nanother  country  to  explain.  Between  1990  and  1993,\r\n\r\nSweden suffered from an economic crisis.  The Swedish GDP\r\n\r\ndeclined  by  5%.  At the same time, the number  of  jobs\r\n\r\nfell  by  nearly 10%.  Along with the economic  recession\r\n\r\ncame  the  decline in TFR, from 2.14 in 1990 to  1.59  in\r\n\r\n1996.   Since  then it has hovered around 1.5.   Economic\r\n\r\ncycles and economic prospects impact fertility rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all we know, our birth rates could have been\r\n\r\nworse  if  not for the schemes that I mentioned  earlier.\r\n\r\nLet  me quote another example.  Quebec introduced a  baby\r\n\r\nbonus scheme, formally known as the Allowance for Newborn\r\n\r\nChildren in 1988.  After an initial rise in TFR, Quebec's\r\n\r\nTFR started falling.  Many thought the scheme had failed.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1997, the scheme was removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, an empirical study published in 2002 by\r\n\r\nKevin Milligan, an Associate Professor in Economics  from\r\n\r\nthe   University   of  British  Columbia,   has   a   new\r\n\r\nperspective.  Milligan says that Quebec's fertility  rate\r\n\r\nwas  worse  than the rest of Canada throughout the  1980s\r\n\r\nbefore  the  baby bonus.  But after the  baby  bonus  was\r\n\r\nintroduced, the fertility gap between Quebec and the rest\r\n\r\nof  Canada  was reduced by 86%.  Milligan estimates  that\r\n\r\nthe  baby  bonus  probably resulted in  an  extra  93,000\r\n\r\nbirths,  over and above the births that would have  taken\r\n\r\nplace  even if there was no baby bonus.  This represented\r\n\r\na  14.5% increase.  While Milligan's study may not be the\r\n\r\nlast   word,   it  does  serve  to  caution  us   against\r\n\r\nprematurely evaluating our policies.  So let us not be in\r\n\r\na  hurry  to  throw  the proverbial  baby  out  with  the\r\n\r\nbathwater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's baby bonus helps couples to defray part\r\n\r\nof  the cost of bringing up their children.  Couples  can\r\n\r\nuse the baby bonus to pay for infant care, childcare and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkindergarten fees for all their children.  As at the  end\r\n\r\nof  February 2003, some 31,800 children and 3,400 mothers\r\n\r\nhave  benefited from the Baby Bonus and Third Child  Paid\r\n\r\nMaternity  Leave  schemes respectively. They  received  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $46 million under the Baby Bonus scheme.   For\r\n\r\nthe  Third  Child  Maternity  Leave,  $18.8  million  was\r\n\r\ndisbursed for the same time period.  Close to 90% of  the\r\n\r\nfamilies  have  co-saved into the Children's  Development\r\n\r\nAccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee suggested that we study the European\r\n\r\ncountries  which  have higher fertility  rates.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nsome   countries  have  bucked  the  trend   of   falling\r\n\r\nfertility.   One  example  is  Norway.   Norway's   total\r\n\r\nfertility  rate has remained around 1.8 in  the  past  10\r\n\r\nyears.   Another  example is France.  In  1993,  France's\r\n\r\ntotal  fertility  rate was 1.66, but 10 years  later,  in\r\n\r\n2002, total fertility rate had rebounded to 1.9, which is\r\n\r\nhigh  among  developed countries.   The  relatively  high\r\n\r\nbirth  rates  in both countries were often attributed  to\r\n\r\ngenerous maternity and parental leave schemes, as well as\r\n\r\nfamily   and  child  support.   Interestingly,  the   CNA\r\n\r\nreported  last  month  that Singaporeans  living  in  the\r\n\r\nCazaux Airbase in France are enjoying a baby boom!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are valuable lessons that we can learn. My\r\n\r\nMinistry is far from throwing in the towel.  Instead,  we\r\n\r\nare  studying the policies implemented in those countries\r\n\r\nto  see what we can learn and adapt to the local context.\r\n\r\nWe,  of  course,  have to bear in mind  the  culture  and\r\n\r\nsocietal  norms which enabled those policies to  work  in\r\n\r\nthe  countries  I mentioned earlier.  The  challenge  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  to  replicate the successful  policies  of\r\n\r\nthose countries in a different operating environment  and\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Jennifer Lee also notes that immigration\r\n\r\nshould  not be the only solution to our falling fertility\r\n\r\nproblem.   I agree with her.  Whilst we must continue  to\r\n\r\nattract new citizens to top up our population, we must be\r\n\r\nmindful that many countries are also competing for  them.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry  believes  that the  renewal  of  the  local\r\n\r\npopulation will remain critical in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has suggested that there be an\r\n\r\nInter-Ministerial  Committee called  Making  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nCommittee to arrest the decline of our TFR.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  assure  the  Member that the two existing  committees\r\n\r\nthat  he mentioned will continue to consult our community\r\n\r\npartners  and  the  public,  particularly  young  married\r\n\r\ncouples,  in reviewing our policies to achieve that  much\r\n\r\nneeded breakthrough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Singaporeans are marrying later. In 2002, the\r\n\r\nmedian age of marriage was 26.2 years for women and  28.9\r\n\r\nyears for men.  In 1990, it was 25.3 years and 27.9 years\r\n\r\nrespectively.  At the same time, not many married couples\r\n\r\nwould have their first child immediately.  And if we  are\r\n\r\nlucky,  some may even consider having a second or even  a\r\n\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this phenomenon is understandable. Our young,\r\n\r\nespecially those who go on to tertiary education, spend a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of time studying. But once they start\r\n\r\nworking,  they  want to focus on building their  careers.\r\n\r\nGraduate  women tend to start a family when they  are  30\r\n\r\nwhile  those  with  post-secondary  education  are   only\r\n\r\nslightly earlier, usually starting their family when they\r\n\r\nare  about 29 years old.  After all, multi-tasking  is  a\r\n\r\nfavourite  buzzword  today, but when  it  comes  to  life\r\n\r\ngoals, we seem to be single-mindedly single-tasking!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who wait longer would come across another\r\n\r\nbarrier, and Dr Balaji has mentioned this earlier.   This\r\n\r\ntime it is mother nature.  In a Straits Times' article on\r\n\r\n3rd January 2003, Dr Christopher Chen from the Gleneagles\r\n\r\nHospital  estimates  that  1  in  5  couples  here   face\r\n\r\nfertility  problems.  Conceiving at a later  age  reduces\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to have more children as  the  fertility\r\n\r\nwindow is narrower.\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I would like to cite my own personal\r\n\r\nexample.   I followed the model that I mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nI met my wife in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe US, got married, but both of us were studying and had\r\n\r\nour  first  child when I was 40 years old,  after  I  had\r\n\r\nestablished my career in NUS and bought a home.   We  had\r\n\r\nour second child when I was 42 years old.  If you ask  me\r\n\r\nnow  whether we want to have a third child, my wife would\r\n\r\nsay  no,  only because she is getting older.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery difficult that, as we try to plan for our lives,  we\r\n\r\nalso  have to understand that there are choices  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to make and, as we make the choices much later,  we\r\n\r\nactually  reduce the opportunity for us to have a  larger\r\n\r\nfamily.   I  came from a family of nine; I wish  to  have\r\n\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how do we overcome this challenge? It is not\r\n\r\neasy,  but  we  must  try. As Mr  Charles  Chong  rightly\r\n\r\npointed out, there must be both monetary support and non-monetary   incentives   to  help   create   a   conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment for Singaporeans to have more children.   So,\r\n\r\nwe  facilitate  interactions through  the  SDU  and  SDS,\r\n\r\nintroduce  procreation measures to help couples  to  have\r\n\r\nmore  babies,  and provide care services  for  the  young\r\n\r\nones,  so  that the parents can continue to  build  their\r\n\r\ncareers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Maliki have asked about the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of the Social Development Unit  (SDU)  and\r\n\r\nthe Social Development Services (SDS).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDU and SDS ran an operating budget of about\r\n\r\n$3.7  million  in  FY2002.   Together,  they  have  about\r\n\r\n105,000   members.   On  average,  about   2,500   social\r\n\r\nactivities   are   run  every  year   for   over   74,000\r\n\r\nparticipants.  In addition, about 10,000 members actively\r\n\r\nparticipate in both the units' dating services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proportion of married female graduates\r\n\r\nincreased from about 44% in 1987, to 57% in 2001.   Since\r\n\r\nits inception 19 years ago, I am happy to say that nearly\r\n\r\n30,000  SDU members have gotten married.  For  SDS,  more\r\n\r\nthan 100,000 members have married since 1985.  This is  a\r\n\r\nsuccess rate of about 55% of total SDS membership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki asked if we do review the effectiveness of\r\n\r\nour  SDU  programmes in view of the changing  profile  of\r\n\r\nsingles.  Indeed, SDU reviews its programmes regularly to\r\n\r\nattract the interest of the changing needs of each cohort\r\n\r\nof  singles.  Towards the end of 2000, SDU outsourced the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  its socialisation activities  to  Premier\r\n\r\nClub,  a  private company.  Since then, many  new  dating\r\n\r\nprogrammes have been introduced, including Speed  Dating,\r\n\r\nBlind  Dates, and Zodiac Dates, which have proven  to  be\r\n\r\nvery popular.  This positive change is evidenced by a 20%\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  participation from  members  who  were\r\n\r\npreviously inactive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Dr Maliki's concern about marriage not being\r\n\r\na  priority among his students.  From a survey  conducted\r\n\r\nby  my  Ministry,  18% of couples met their  partners  at\r\n\r\ntheir workplace, while another 17% met them at school  or\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Dr Maliki would thus be pleased to know that\r\n\r\nthe  SDU is pro-active, and will be rolling out a funding\r\n\r\nscheme  by the new academic year, called Project  Network\r\n\r\nto  co-fund student bodies' activities aimed at promoting\r\n\r\ngender interaction and relationship-building skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, Mr Eddie Teo, Permanent Secretary in\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's Office, was asked what he would like\r\n\r\nto  say  about the President's scholarship that  he  got.\r\n\r\nHis  last words on this were: Oxford was where I  met  my\r\n\r\nwife.  A year or two later, when he was addressing a  PSC\r\n\r\nseminar,   he  reminded  the  young  crowd  of  potential\r\n\r\nscholars and their parents of the importance of balancing\r\n\r\nschool  and social life.   He shared how he had bought  a\r\n\r\nbicycle  so  that  he  could visit  his  wife,  then  his\r\n\r\ngirlfriend, every day.  His only lament was that the  PSC\r\n\r\nrefused  to  up  his allowance, and thus  he  could  only\r\n\r\nafford  a  pounds5 bicycle with no brakes and no  lights!\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  PSC  knew better, for who needs a  bright  lamp\r\n\r\nwhen romance is in the air?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my fellow MPs will agree that socialising is\r\n\r\nindeed  important, and it is important to balance  school\r\n\r\nand social life, or work and social life. SDU and SDS\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  our  singles get that balance.  Given  Dr  Maliki's\r\n\r\nfervent  interest in the subject, I hope I can  count  on\r\n\r\nhis  support and assistance to promote social  activities\r\n\r\nin  the university; so too Prof. Ngiam.  Dr Jennifer  Lee\r\n\r\ntalked  about  the importance of institutions.   I  would\r\n\r\ncall   on  the  universities  and  institutes  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning  to  play an active role in facilitating  social\r\n\r\nactivities  for their students.  In fact,  I  would  also\r\n\r\nurge  all employers to play their part to help us address\r\n\r\nthis national concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Ms Irene Ng asked about childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.   They  have  indeed raised a  highly  pertinent\r\n\r\npoint,   for   the  availability  and  affordability   of\r\n\r\nchildcare  are  critical, if we are to  encourage  family\r\n\r\nformation.  There are now 632 childcare centres providing\r\n\r\n53,000 places, and the take-up rate is about 72%.   Thus,\r\n\r\nthere  are  enough places to meet demand at  the  moment.\r\n\r\nWhile  we have plans this year to develop 50 more centres\r\n\r\nto provide an additional 3,500 places, we will only do so\r\n\r\nwhen  the  enrolment  picks up.  We will  also  encourage\r\n\r\nemployers  to  set  up workplace childcare  centres  but,\r\n\r\nultimately, this will have to depend on demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childcare centre subsidy rate is currently $150\r\n\r\nfor  working mothers who place their children in full-day\r\n\r\ncare,  and  $75  for  working  mothers  who  place  their\r\n\r\nchildren in half-day care.  Non-working mothers who place\r\n\r\ntheir  children  in full or half-day care  also  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy of $75.  In this financial year, my Ministry  has\r\n\r\ndisbursed a total of $54 million of subsidies so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed this Committee last year that my Ministry\r\n\r\nwould  look into a pro-rated childcare subsidy to mothers\r\n\r\nwho  need  flexible childcare.  I am happy to inform  the\r\n\r\nCommittee that my Ministry has introduced such a  subsidy\r\n\r\nprogramme from January this year.  As of 13th March 2003,\r\n\r\n140 children are benefiting from the pro-rated subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Ms Irene Ng have also spoken on\r\n\r\ninfant  care.  I agree with them that more  needs  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  to  develop infant care.  Presently, there  are  13\r\n\r\ninfant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncare  centres with 170 places.  Centres that offer infant\r\n\r\ncare  have  stricter requirements in terms of staff-child\r\n\r\nratios.  This is because babies need a greater amount  of\r\n\r\nindividual  attention.  Staff are also specially  trained\r\n\r\nfor  infant  care.  Because of this, the fees for  infant\r\n\r\ncare range from $650 to $1,500, which are higher than the\r\n\r\nfees  for  the older age groups.  My Ministry  recognises\r\n\r\nthat  the  childcare  subsidy may  be  insufficient  when\r\n\r\ncompared to the infant care fees.  While I have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  that the baby bonus may also be used  to  offset\r\n\r\nthe  infant  care  fees, we are currently  reviewing  the\r\n\r\nsituation  to ensure that services remain affordable  for\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng mentioned that when she surveyed her\r\n\r\nconstituency, she found that the demand for  infant  care\r\n\r\ncentres  was  high.  The waiting lists  at  the  existing\r\n\r\ninfant  care centres are also testimony that centre-based\r\n\r\ncare  can be a suitable option for some families.  Ms  Ng\r\n\r\nwill  be pleased to know that MCDS is looking at  how  to\r\n\r\nincrease the supply of infant care across the island.\r\n\r\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS has no objection, should operators want to\r\n\r\noperate their centres round the clock, if this is to meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of parents working night shifts and irregular\r\n\r\nwork  patterns.  However, our regulations state  that  no\r\n\r\none  child  should remain in the centre for 24  hours  or\r\n\r\nmore  continuously.  Members would agree with me  that  a\r\n\r\nchildcare  centre should not be operated as a residential\r\n\r\ninstitution  for young children.  My Ministry  takes  the\r\n\r\nview  that  no baby or pre-school child should remain  in\r\n\r\ncentre-based care for the better part of 24  hours  on  a\r\n\r\nregular basis.  Home care, at least for part of the  day,\r\n\r\nand   the   opportunity  to  bond  with  one   consistent\r\n\r\ncaregiver,  preferably a parent, is in the best  interest\r\n\r\nof babies and young children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is consistent with the practices\r\n\r\nobserved  in  other developed countries.   Thus  far,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has not received any application for a  24-hour\r\n\r\nchildcare centre licence.  I assure the Committee that my\r\n\r\nMinistry will assess all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications  carefully to prevent abuse,  and  that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopmental   well-being  of  the   children   is   not\r\n\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to centre-based infant care, my\r\n\r\nMinistry has piloted the Family Day Care, which is  home-based infant care with trained babysitters.   This scheme\r\n\r\nallows  housewives  and retirees to care  for  babies  or\r\n\r\nyoung  children, and earn income in their  own  home.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  Dr Lily Neo mentioned this yesterday.  It  could\r\n\r\nbe  a  suitable  option,  particularly  for  infants  and\r\n\r\nchildren  under  18 months, as it provides  care  by  one\r\n\r\nconsistent  caregiver  in  a  home  setting.   Since   my\r\n\r\nannouncement last year that the scheme would  be  piloted\r\n\r\nby  Southeast and Southwest CDCs, Northeast CDC has  also\r\n\r\njoined in the pilot.  So far, 600 care-providers and  300\r\n\r\nparents have registered for this scheme.  It is premature\r\n\r\nto  consider  accrediting the caregivers at  this  stage.\r\n\r\nHowever  the three CDCs keep a record of those  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen trained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are possibly many more models of care which\r\n\r\ncan  be  explored to suit the needs of different parents.\r\n\r\nMy   Ministry   welcomes  more  suggestions,   and   also\r\n\r\nencourages more organisations and enterprises to come  up\r\n\r\nwith innovative ideas and solutions to meet our childcare\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have asked also about what we are\r\n\r\ndoing to strengthen families in Singapore.  I will ask my\r\n\r\nMinister  of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to respond to  these\r\n\r\nquestions  later.   Let me now turn  to  the  subject  of\r\n\r\nabandoned babies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concerns of Ms Irene Ng, Prof. Ngiam Tee\r\n\r\nLiang  and  Mr Sin Boon Ann about the plight of abandoned\r\n\r\nbabies.  On average, five babies were abandoned each year\r\n\r\nfrom  1997 to 2002.  Since January 2003, two babies  were\r\n\r\nabandoned and two were found dead.  Of the two  dead,  we\r\n\r\nknow  for  sure  that  one  of them  was  stillborn;  the\r\n\r\nCoroner's   report  on  the  second  is  still   pending.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  these clarifications, I  share  Members'\r\n\r\nconcern  that  babies are involved.   This  is  a  highly\r\n\r\nemotive issue,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand there are no easy answers.  What we all share is that\r\n\r\nwe  want babies to be safe, and we also want to help  the\r\n\r\nmothers as well.  Indeed, our hearts go out to the babies\r\n\r\nand  their mothers.  The question is how to help both  of\r\n\r\nthem effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, pregnant women in distress can seek help.\r\n\r\nThey  must  be aware that, if they come forward  and  say\r\n\r\nthat they are unable to keep their babies, they will  not\r\n\r\nbe  prosecuted  for  abandonment.  We  have  a  care  and\r\n\r\ncounselling system that has prevented desperate  acts  of\r\n\r\nendangering a baby's well-being. This system has  worked.\r\n\r\nLast   year,  515  enquiries  on  pregnancy  issues  were\r\n\r\nreceived  through  the hotlines.  Of these,  33  pregnant\r\n\r\nwomen were helped at the shelters, 19 later gave up their\r\n\r\nbabies  for adoption, while the rest were helped to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  babies.   In  assisting the  pregnant  women,  the\r\n\r\nsocial  workers walk through all the options  with  them,\r\n\r\nand  support them all the way.  This will ensure that the\r\n\r\nwell-being of both the baby and the mother is taken  care\r\n\r\nof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is a role for the community.\r\n\r\nPregnancy takes nine months.  A woman cannot go about her\r\n\r\nlife   unnoticed.   Those  around  her  can  and   should\r\n\r\nencourage her and even accompany her to come forward  for\r\n\r\nhelp.  Whatever the circumstances she faces,  abandonment\r\n\r\ncan  never be the solution. She could alert someone, even\r\n\r\na  stranger,  to hand over the child, if she cannot  take\r\n\r\ncare of the baby.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity about the help is also very important.\r\n\r\nEven countries that have tried safe havens or baby drops,\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  able  to  stop abandonment  and  related\r\n\r\ndeaths,  either because the mothers are in  no  frame  of\r\n\r\nmind  to  use such baby drops, or because they  were  not\r\n\r\naware  of them.  Ours is an approach that seeks  to  help\r\n\r\nboth the mother and the baby.   Of course, it is best for\r\n\r\nwomen  to  seek assistance early, before the birth  of  a\r\n\r\nbaby  but,  even if they do not, we can still  help  them\r\n\r\nafter  the  delivery, if they feel unable to  keep  their\r\n\r\nchild.  It is never too late to come forward for help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to further publicise the system and,\r\n\r\nespecially, the helplines and hotlines for pregnant women\r\n\r\nin  distress.  In this regard, my Ministry has  made  24-hour  helpline  numbers readily available at  the  notice\r\n\r\nboards of Residents Committee centres.  This is the flyer\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  put  up  in all the  Residents  Committee\r\n\r\ncentres [indicating].  Anyone who is facing problems  and\r\n\r\nneeds  support  should tap into the care and  counselling\r\n\r\nsystem.   Confidentiality is assured  for  all  who  come\r\n\r\nforward  for  help,  and we will increase  our  publicity\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls for legislative changes and to\r\n\r\nset  up baby drops. Both Mr Sin Boon Ann and Ms Irene  Ng\r\n\r\nhave said that it is not for us to judge the morality  of\r\n\r\nthe  parents who dump their children.  Let me assure them\r\n\r\nagain  that  if mothers come forward, they  will  not  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted  for abandonment.  That is key.  Let  me  also\r\n\r\nsay that it is not so much a question of morality as much\r\n\r\nas  it  is  a concern that we will inadvertently endanger\r\n\r\nthe lives of more babies, if we legalise abandonment.  By\r\n\r\nlifting the inalienable responsibility of parents to care\r\n\r\nfor  and  protect their children, we risk the safety  and\r\n\r\nlives  of many more babies and children.  Moreover, there\r\n\r\nis no evidence to suggest that, by legalising abandonment\r\n\r\nat  baby  drops,  desperate  acts,  such  as  the  recent\r\n\r\ninstance  where a baby was found with the umbilical  cord\r\n\r\nintact, would be stopped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a system where those who step forward\r\n\r\nearly  are supported by social workers and given shelter,\r\n\r\nif necessary.  There are many instances where both mother\r\n\r\nand baby have been helped this way and have moved on with\r\n\r\ntheir lives.  The system does not discriminate, and  will\r\n\r\nhelp  all those who come forward, local or foreign alike.\r\n\r\nI  assure  Members  that the help  is  given  with  great\r\n\r\nsensitivity and, in really desperate situations,  nothing\r\n\r\nwill  compromise  the  safety and health  of  mother  and\r\n\r\nchild.   Contrary  to what Ms Irene  Ng  thought,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure her that there is no obsession about obtaining the\r\n\r\nbiological  information of the mother. The priority  must\r\n\r\nalways be the safety of the mother\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  child. In fact, we walk her through the process\r\n\r\nand  allow her, at her own time and own pace, to give  us\r\n\r\nwhatever  information that she is prepared to share  with\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has alluded to the point that for\r\n\r\nbaby  drops  to  be  effective, they have  to  be  easily\r\n\r\naccessible and known to those who are likely to use them.\r\n\r\nSir,   based  on  my  staff's  consultations  with  their\r\n\r\nAmerican counterparts, the US experience continues to  be\r\n\r\ncontentious as to whether baby drops are a good  approach\r\n\r\nor  whether publicity focusing on engaging pregnant girls\r\n\r\nearly  in  their pregnancy might be a safer approach  for\r\n\r\nboth the mother and baby.  For baby drops to work, almost\r\n\r\nevery  front  door has to be a potential  baby  drop,  as\r\n\r\nthose in desperation will not be in any frame of mind  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  designated places.  That is why the role  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and the public is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will a change of legislation and the setting up of\r\n\r\nbaby   drops  really  stop  the  abandonment  of  babies?\r\n\r\nCountries that have implemented baby drops have not  seen\r\n\r\na  decrease in baby abandonment.  In the US, some see the\r\n\r\n\"Baby  Drops\" as an encouragement to abandon the  babies.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  a  State  Legislative  report  by  the  US\r\n\r\nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the Baby Drops\r\n\r\nwere  not \"receiving\" as many babies as expected.   There\r\n\r\nwere  still  cases of abandonment in public places,  even\r\n\r\nwith the presence of \"baby drops\". Ms Ng spoke about  the\r\n\r\nSafe  Haven law in the United States.  An article in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  last  week (12th  March  2003)  had  this\r\n\r\nheadline  \"US safe haven laws fail to save  babies\".   In\r\n\r\nthe  Los  Angeles County, despite its Safe Haven law,  14\r\n\r\nbabies were found abandoned in 2001, and 11 of them died.\r\n\r\nNot  a single woman that year took advantage of the  Safe\r\n\r\nHaven law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, 10 babies were safely surrendered, but 13\r\n\r\nwere  abandoned, eight of whom died, according to  county\r\n\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaby  drops  are  only a piecemeal solution  to  unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies and they may have unintended consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng is right that we should not think of\r\n\r\nbaby  abandonment  as  only a woman's  problem.  We  must\r\n\r\neducate the men too. If the men are more responsible  and\r\n\r\nstand by the women they made pregnant, then the women are\r\n\r\nless likely to abandon their babies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, everyone has a part to play. Parents\r\n\r\ntoo  have  an  important role in the  education  process.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  there  were about 850 births  among  teenage\r\n\r\nmothers.   We  should be mindful not to tar  all  teenage\r\n\r\npregnancies as `unwanted' pregnancies.  However,  besides\r\n\r\nMOE's  sexuality  programmes in schools,  MCDS,  together\r\n\r\nwith   community  partners,  has  also  implemented   two\r\n\r\nsexuality  education programmes for teenagers  and  their\r\n\r\nparents. They are called - No Apologies and WAIT (Why  Am\r\n\r\nI  Tempted).   Both  are designed to  help  young  people\r\n\r\ndevelop responsible attitudes and character traits and to\r\n\r\nassist  parents to work with their teenagers on sexuality\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, men whose partners are grappling with unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies  must be more responsible and  encourage  and\r\n\r\nsupport  the women to seek help.  The community can  help\r\n\r\nby  being  alert to pregnant women in distress.   Parents\r\n\r\ncan  be  good  role  models and be  supportive  if  their\r\n\r\nchildren get into trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, each and every one, do our part, we can be a\r\n\r\nmore caring community.  More babies will be saved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I begun my response this morning to Members\r\n\r\nearlier  by talking about babies, and ending  it  now  by\r\n\r\ntalking  about  babies  as well. I cannot  emphasise  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of babies to Singapore more.  The  causes  of\r\n\r\nfalling  fertility are many and complex,  and  it  is  of\r\n\r\nconcern  to  us,  as a country and as  individuals.   Our\r\n\r\npackage  of  incentives and support programmes  may  take\r\n\r\ntime  for it to be effective. We may need to modify  them\r\n\r\nalong the way.  I thank my parliamentary colleagues for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  many  suggestions, such as to look at policies  of\r\n\r\nthe  Nordic countries, expand the infant care support and\r\n\r\nmany other useful comments.  We would certainly look into\r\n\r\nall  of  these  to see how else we should  approach  this\r\n\r\nmatter.   This  is a national problem. We need  all  your\r\n\r\nsupport to see how we can help resolve this together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now call upon MOS, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to reply\r\n\r\nto the second part of the cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I would like to thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  his  reply.   I have three points for clarification.\r\n\r\nThe  first  point  is that I would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconfirm  whether or not I heard him right  when  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will not prosecute a mother who,  in\r\n\r\ndesperation, decides to leave the baby at the appropriate\r\n\r\ncentre,  that is, all forms of prosecution and  not  just\r\n\r\nthe  act  of leaving the baby behind.  Will the  Minister\r\n\r\nplease confirm this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> If a mother walks\r\n\r\ninto  the  shelter, we will walk her through the process.\r\n\r\nIf  she is a Singaporean and she has not contravened  any\r\n\r\nlaw,  she  will not be prosecuted.  The act of coming  to\r\n\r\nthe  shelter  means that she is not abandoning  the  baby\r\n\r\nand,   therefore,   she  will  not  be   prosecuted   for\r\n\r\nabandonment.  But if she is a foreign worker or she is of\r\n\r\nany  other citizenship, other laws will probably have  to\r\n\r\ncome into play.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would not the Minister therefore\r\n\r\nagree  with  me  that the prospect of  prosecution  under\r\n\r\nother laws itself may serve as ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is not a clarification, Mr Sin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Okay, I will save this for another\r\n\r\nday.  My second clarification is this.  The Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid that legalising baby drops is going to endanger  the\r\n\r\nbaby  more.   I  do  not  understand  why.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister can explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, our view is\r\n\r\nthat, by having a baby drop,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  may  not  be able to trace the mother  nor  know  the\r\n\r\nbackground  of  the family nor what we can  do  with  the\r\n\r\nbaby.   If the mother comes to our shelter, we can  do  a\r\n\r\nlot more.  What I have been demonstrating this morning is\r\n\r\nthat  the system that we have in place is indeed  helpful\r\n\r\nto  both  mother and baby.  The statistics  that  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  earlier this morning demonstrate that there  is  a\r\n\r\nsystem that can help the mother walk through the process.\r\n\r\nIf  the  baby  is  dropped somewhere,  it  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  us  to trace the parents  and  help  them\r\n\r\nthrough the process.  But, at this point in time, Sir, if\r\n\r\na  baby  is  dropped,  I  would like  to  call  upon  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  to also help us. As I mentioned in my  speech,\r\n\r\nevery  front door is almost a baby drop, so, the role  of\r\n\r\nthe  community  is  also important to  help  us  in  this\r\n\r\nsensitive issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, how would not knowing the\r\n\r\nbackground of the mother endanger the baby any more  than\r\n\r\nif she just leaves him anonymously somewhere else?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, at the end of\r\n\r\nthe  day,  we  have to look at both the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nmother  and  baby.  The mother must have been very,  very\r\n\r\ndesperate  to  abandon  the  baby.   So,  there  must  be\r\n\r\nsomething that we can do to help her to walk through  the\r\n\r\nprocess.   If  you ask me, I would prefer the  mother  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the baby, because we want the baby to be raised  in\r\n\r\nthe  comfort of his or her natural parents.   If  we  can\r\n\r\nhelp  them  as  a family, that would be a better  outcome\r\n\r\nthan  just to leave the baby by the roadside, and for  us\r\n\r\nto deal with the baby alone.  I am not saying that if the\r\n\r\nbaby  is  dropped, we are not helping the baby. We  will.\r\n\r\nBut  together, with the mother, we can do a lot  more  to\r\n\r\nensure that her family is being helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> That is precisely my point, is it\r\n\r\nnot?   By  providing  a safe place for  the  baby  to  be\r\n\r\ndropped will enhance the safety of the baby, rather  than\r\n\r\nto  leave  things as they are at the moment where  babies\r\n\r\nare just left off at public places.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is not a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nMr Sin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Can I seek a further\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Minister agree with me\r\n\r\nthat  with  legal  baby drop, it reduces  the  chance  of\r\n\r\nbabies  being left in places which are not frequented  by\r\n\r\npeople.  Even in the statistics cited by the Minister for\r\n\r\nthe  other  countries, there are legal baby  drops  which\r\n\r\nreduce  the  number of babies being abandoned  at  places\r\n\r\nthat  are  not  desirable.   I  did  not  say  that,   by\r\n\r\nlegalising  baby  drops, we are going  to  do  away  with\r\n\r\nabandonment of babies. That is not the point.  The  point\r\n\r\nis  that it gives the babies a safe haven for them to  be\r\n\r\nlegally placed and be put up for adoption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> I do not\r\n\r\nnecessarily disagree with the Member that if  we  have  a\r\n\r\nbaby  drop,  it  may help. But we have  to  look  at  the\r\n\r\nexperiences of other countries and look at the experience\r\n\r\nof  the system that we have in place. The system we  have\r\n\r\nin place, so far, is effective.  Maybe there is a lack of\r\n\r\npublicity.   That  is why we will step up  the  publicity\r\n\r\nefforts  to encourage mothers, who want to give up  their\r\n\r\nbabies, to come to the shelters.  The statistics  that  I\r\n\r\ncited  earlier show that the system works.  So  far  this\r\n\r\nyear,  out of the five who have been abandoned, two  have\r\n\r\nbeen  found  and the first one was still born.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Sin that one baby dying is one too many. We have\r\n\r\nto  find  a way to help them. We are confident that  with\r\n\r\nthe  current system in place, we will be able to help all\r\n\r\nmothers  who  either  want to give  up  their  babies  or\r\n\r\nwhatever their choices may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin, I think we can pursue this\r\n\r\nanother day.

It  would  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  to  promote support options for the family.  The\r\n\r\ncommunity  can  support the family.  Families,  in  turn,\r\n\r\nshould support one another as well as the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many partners under our Many Helping Hands\r\n\r\napproach.  We actively consult them as we do not own  all\r\n\r\nthe wisdom on family issues.  In fact, everybody can be a\r\n\r\nfamily  expert.  One important partner in family  is  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Family.  This is headed by  Mr  Noel  Hon.\r\n\r\nThis is a people-sector led committee.  It has, over  the\r\n\r\nyears, provided invaluable advice on family initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another committee that has allowed us to tap the\r\n\r\nstrength   of  the  community  is  the  Family   Matters!\r\n\r\nSingapore  Committee, which I chair, but I  have  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  most  of the work is done through the various  sub-committees  headed by people from the people sector.   We\r\n\r\nare  carrying out the blueprint developed by  the  former\r\n\r\nPublic  Education Committee on Family or  PEC  which  was\r\n\r\nthen chaired by Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 40 of the 70 PEC recommendations are being\r\n\r\nimplemented,  some  18 months after the  PEC  Report  was\r\n\r\nreleased.  Some  of  the initiatives  undertaken  include\r\n\r\npartnership with the Singapore History Museum to organise\r\n\r\na  wedding exhibition aimed at reinforcing the importance\r\n\r\nof marriage as an institution, and a recent collaboration\r\n\r\nwith  the  advertising industry to launch  annual  Family\r\n\r\nMatters   Awards   for   the  most  pro-family   TV/radio\r\n\r\ncommercials and print advertisements because  we  believe\r\n\r\nthat people look at advertisements quite seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May this year, we will be collaborating with\r\n\r\nMedia  Development  Authority  (MDA)  and  Institute   of\r\n\r\nAdvertising  Singapore to organise a  regional  broadcast\r\n\r\nconference  focusing  on how the  media  impacts  on  the\r\n\r\nvalues of the young and the families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also later highlight two key recommendations\r\n\r\nof the PEC, namely,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomancing  Singapore  and  the  School  Family  Education\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Matters! Singapore Committee continues to\r\n\r\nbe   the   people-movement  that   the   PEC   envisaged.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon  is  not  here.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I want to thank her for the good work done at  the\r\n\r\nPEC  as well as for her foresight in putting together  an\r\n\r\nextensive network of people- and private-sector partners.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  succeeded  her  to  be  the  PEC's  Chairman,  I\r\n\r\ncontinued with her legacy of engaging the people- as well\r\n\r\nas   private-sector  agencies.   Today,  many   community\r\n\r\npartners are leading the initiatives as well as corporate\r\n\r\ndonors,  like  Singapore  Totalisator  Board,  have  come\r\n\r\nforward   to   provide  substantial   funding   for   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Maliki has asked about Romancing Singapore.\r\n\r\nMy  Minister  has  earlier shared with Members  the  very\r\n\r\nserious  challenges facing us as a result of the changing\r\n\r\nattitudes towards marriage and procreation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now seeing more \"young\" marriages breaking\r\n\r\nup.  And  by  \"young\" marriages, we mean those  marriages\r\n\r\nthat break up within five years.  The proportion of civil\r\n\r\ndivorces among marriages under five years increased  from\r\n\r\n9.6%  (208  out  of 2,178 divorces) in 1990.   This  9.6%\r\n\r\nincreased to 15.3% (533 out of 3,491 divorces)  in  2001.\r\n\r\nMuslim  divorces  of similar marriage  duration  remained\r\n\r\nhigh  at  34.7%  (467  out of 1,347  divorces)  in  2001.\r\n\r\nThough  the  number  is still small,  compared  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries, divorce is certainly an area of concern and we\r\n\r\ncannot be complacent about it.\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context, and with these concerns in\r\n\r\nmind,   that   the  Romancing  Singapore   Festival   was\r\n\r\ninitiated.    Romancing  Singapore  is  a   people-sector\r\n\r\ninitiative  led  by  two  private-sector  volunteers,  Dr\r\n\r\nFinian  Tan  and  Ms Claire Chiang.   It  was  funded  by\r\n\r\ndonations from the Singapore Totalisator Board  at  about\r\n\r\n$400,000.  It generated good media coverage with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500,000 people participating in over 100 Festival events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Festival reminds us all to build relationships\r\n\r\nthat  are  vital to marriage and family.  It is not  just\r\n\r\nabout  getting  singles to consider romance.   It  is  as\r\n\r\nmuch,  if not more, for married couples to nourish  their\r\n\r\nrelationships  like  the case of Mr and  Mrs  Valberg,  a\r\n\r\ncouple  in their 70s, who renewed their 50-year  marriage\r\n\r\nvow at a Romancing Singapore event.  When asked about the\r\n\r\nlove  of  her  life,  Mrs  Valberg  remarked,  \"Once,  my\r\n\r\nhusband,  who is usually very quiet, broke  into  a  love\r\n\r\nsong  while we were walking along the Esplanade.\"   Small\r\n\r\ngestures  like these are really romantic.  Yes,  we  need\r\n\r\nsuch  small acts of romance to keep marriages  alive.   I\r\n\r\nhave to say that that story is very inspiring to me too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hope you do not break into a song!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, perhaps some other day, when\r\n\r\nmy wife is around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Maliki suggested a Men's Movement for\r\n\r\nmen  to understand the feelings of women, and for us  men\r\n\r\nto  be  able  to  run after the women.  I  fully  concur.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to some of the feedback from SDU, as well\r\n\r\nas  SDS,  that the Minister talked about, there  was  one\r\n\r\nfeedback  which said that a girl called up SDU and  said,\r\n\r\n\"The  man you chose for me was really unromantic  because\r\n\r\nat  the  first dinner we had to go Dutch.\"  I  never  did\r\n\r\nthat  while I was courting in Oxford.  There was  another\r\n\r\ninteresting  story  of a man calling up  SDU,  after  the\r\n\r\nfirst  date, and said, \"Can you tell me when I  can  hold\r\n\r\nher hand?\"  I was totally speechless when I heard that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I wonder if the aim of the movement should\r\n\r\nbe  how to be gentlemen.   And maybe to learn the wonders\r\n\r\nof   falling  in  love,  staying  in  love,   and   being\r\n\r\nspontaneous in small gestures of romance like Mr  Valberg\r\n\r\nwho is in his 70s with 50 years of marriage behind him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on a more serious note, while Family\r\n\r\nMatters!  Singapore Committee organises  programmes  like\r\n\r\nRomancing Singapore, the Ministry supports VWOs like  the\r\n\r\nCentre  for Fathering to run programmes like Father-Child\r\n\r\nbonding camps - one of the phenomena that we always  hear\r\n\r\nabout  is  that  the  father had  disappeared  -  couples\r\n\r\nadventure camps, as well as to conduct  talks for  single\r\n\r\nmen on how they can be good husbands and fathers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar programme is Forum Adam, an initiative\r\n\r\nstarted by none other than Dr Maliki in 2001, which  aims\r\n\r\nto  provide  a platform for Malay men to share challenges\r\n\r\nas  husbands  and fathers.  My Ministry is  working  with\r\n\r\nYWMA  Mendaki Family Service Centre, Al Khair Mosque,  to\r\n\r\nstart a Father Support Group, following this year's Forum\r\n\r\nAdam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have strong marriages, we must ensure that we\r\n\r\nstart  them right.  In a survey conducted by my  Ministry\r\n\r\nrecently, twice the number of participants found marriage\r\n\r\npreparation courses to be highly useful as compared to  a\r\n\r\nsimilar survey conducted in 1999.  So, perhaps there  was\r\n\r\na  general agreement that such courses are getting to  be\r\n\r\nmore important.  We are encouraged by these findings.  We\r\n\r\nwill  make marriage preparation more accessible. One such\r\n\r\ninitiative   is   the  launch  of  an  on-line   marriage\r\n\r\npreparation programme on the \"About Family Life\" website.\r\n\r\nThat  will  be in about three months' time, in June  this\r\n\r\nyear,  so that people who are too busy to come to us  can\r\n\r\naccess the website.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang would be happy to know\r\n\r\nthat  since last year, a number of Deputy Registrars  and\r\n\r\nLicensed Solemnisers have agreed to expand their role  to\r\n\r\nbe  Marriage  Mentors, and we have developed  a  training\r\n\r\nprogramme for them.  A number of them are JPs, grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  as  well as religious leaders.  Underlying  this\r\n\r\ninitiative  is the premise that, being respected  members\r\n\r\nof  the  community, couples will welcome their advice  as\r\n\r\nwell as counsel.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the Healthy Marriage Programme, which\r\n\r\naims  to  better prepare Malay/Muslim youths for  married\r\n\r\nlife.   The  programme is a developmental and  preventive\r\n\r\ninitiative.   It  aims  at  inculcating  teenagers   with\r\n\r\nhealthy values and positive views about marriage as  well\r\n\r\nas family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has called for MCDS to work with agencies\r\n\r\nlike  the Ministry of Education to put our young  through\r\n\r\nlife  skills  and  character building programmes.   I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to  report  that  MCDS  is  implementing  the  PEC\r\n\r\nrecommendation on the School Family Education  Programme.\r\n\r\nLast year, together with Fei Yue Counselling Centre,  the\r\n\r\nNorth  West, South East and South West CDCs, my  Ministry\r\n\r\npiloted  the  School Family Education Programme  in  four\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme has reached out to almost 12,000\r\n\r\npeople within a year of its implementation.  The idea  is\r\n\r\nto  reach out to the parents through their children.   It\r\n\r\nequips  parents with effective parenting skills, children\r\n\r\nwith  life skills, and supports all parents, as  well  as\r\n\r\nteachers,  to  balance career, school  life  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfamily life.  The bonus is that, in the process, in  line\r\n\r\nwith my Ministry's vision to promote strong families  who\r\n\r\nhelp  others,  parent  volunteers now  run  some  of  the\r\n\r\nschools'  family  life  centres  and  are  starting  peer\r\n\r\nsupport groups.  So we are beginning to reach a stage  of\r\n\r\nparents beginning to inspire other parents.  We see  that\r\n\r\nthe  pilot  is a success and my Ministry will expand  the\r\n\r\nprogramme to more schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also looking into another programme\r\n\r\ncalled  Journey  of  Life.  It  is  being  developed  for\r\n\r\nstudents  in  polytechnics, whereby through  experiential\r\n\r\nlearning,  students  are  imbued with  healthy  attitudes\r\n\r\nabout  love,  spousal relations, family relationships  as\r\n\r\nwell as aging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been working in partnership not\r\n\r\nonly  with the Ministry of Education, but with the people\r\n\r\nand  private  sector in family life education.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso like to report that we are trying all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings  possible to engage families, and to  empower  our\r\n\r\npartners,  such  as  Family  Life  Ambassadors,   through\r\n\r\nsharing   of  resources,  experience  as  well  as   best\r\n\r\npractices.  Working with our partners, we find  there  is\r\n\r\nno  shortage of bright and creative ideas.  Indeed, there\r\n\r\nis  no  monopoly of good ideas and wisdom if we  can  all\r\n\r\nencourage everybody to come forward and contribute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We communicate our messages through as many channels\r\n\r\nas  possible. One effective way has been through  various\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  and MediaWorks TV programmes in all  the  four\r\n\r\nlanguages.  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has this idea  of  a  TV\r\n\r\ndocumentary and that she will be pleased to know that her\r\n\r\nidea of a TV documentary called \"My Home\", based on real-life stories of individuals and their families overcoming\r\n\r\nchallenges,  telecast  over a period  of  two  years,  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  and Chinese, since 2000, has already  seen  four\r\n\r\nseasons so far. Each episode on average reaches more than\r\n\r\n700,000 viewers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our latest TV family programme on Vasantham Central\r\n\r\nhas  also  achieved  an  unprecedented  drama  viewership\r\n\r\nrating  of 30% of the Indian population.  I am told  that\r\n\r\nthis  is equivalent to the most popular Bollywood movies.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe we are beginning to see Sollywood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Malay human interest stories with family life\r\n\r\nmessages  in  \"K  Inc\" on Channel Suria was  consistently\r\n\r\namong  the top 10 programmes broadcast. Besides, we  also\r\n\r\nhave  other  popular TV programmes on parenting,  eg,  an\r\n\r\nEnglish  TV drama called \"First Touch\" and the  drama  \"I\r\n\r\nNot Stupid\", which carry our parenting messages.  We have\r\n\r\nused  TV  stars such as Xiang Yun, Gurmit Singh  and  top\r\n\r\nMalay  and  Indian TV stars to promote the importance  of\r\n\r\nfamily  in  TV  commercials.  We accept the reality  that\r\n\r\npeople  do  not listen to us, Members of this House,  but\r\n\r\nthey  listen  to  messages from people whom  they  really\r\n\r\nenjoy seeing, eg, film stars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadshows in the heartlands and in the central\r\n\r\nbusiness district featuring\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomedians  such  as  Jack  Neo have  also  helped  widely\r\n\r\ndisseminate   family   messages,  ranging   from   inter-generational bonds, to parenting as well as marriage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another channel that we use to communicate our\r\n\r\nfamily  life messages is the National Family Week.   This\r\n\r\nyear,  we  will adopt the theme \"Parenting Teenagers\"  to\r\n\r\nhelp parents better connect with their growing teenagers.\r\n\r\nFor  this, I have a personal interest because I  do  have\r\n\r\ntwo  teenage sons.  So you will see me participating more\r\n\r\nactively this year in the programme.  The programmes will\r\n\r\ninclude  bonding activities such as \"Parent-Teen obstacle\r\n\r\nchallenge\" in a TV reality programme, as well as a multi-media  contest involving the family unit in the Singapore\r\n\r\nStreet  Festival.  The Festival, by the way, is organised\r\n\r\nby the Orchard Road Business Association and supported by\r\n\r\nseveral statutory bodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as we try different communication media,\r\n\r\ndepending  on our audiences, my Ministry is  also  paying\r\n\r\nmore  attention to inter-generational communication.   In\r\n\r\nJuly  2002, a Task Force was formed under Family Matters!\r\n\r\nSingapore   Committee  to  promote  the   importance   of\r\n\r\ngrandparenting     and     positive    inter-generational\r\n\r\nrelationships.  We  also launched  a  funding  scheme  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the private and people sectors to develop  and\r\n\r\nimplement   programmes  that  promote  inter-generational\r\n\r\nbonding.  At the time when we were young, we remember our\r\n\r\ngrandparents very dearly.  I think we do notice that  our\r\n\r\nchildren  do  not  seem to share such sentiments  towards\r\n\r\ntheir  grandparents, and yet grandparents are potentially\r\n\r\na   very,  very  important  part  in  encouraging  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to have more children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2001, we have celebrated Grandparents Day. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  may be the first in the world  to  celebrate\r\n\r\nGrandparents Day, during Senior Citizens' Week, and it is\r\n\r\ndone on a larger scale to recognise the contributions  of\r\n\r\ngrandparents as well as to honour their important roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 200,000 people signed up for Family Life\r\n\r\nEducation  programmes in 2002.  Since 2000, participation\r\n\r\nrates at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   programmes  have  also  been  increasing   at   a\r\n\r\nphenomenal rate of 25% per annum.  We could not have done\r\n\r\nthis  without some 700 dedicated Family Life  Ambassadors\r\n\r\nwho  comprise individuals, organisations and corporations\r\n\r\nfrom the private as well as the people sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chan, please speed up your reply.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of cuts to deal with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Yes, Sir. That being the case,\r\n\r\nperhaps I will just conclude by saying that every year we\r\n\r\ncelebrate  family  three times.   In  February,  we  have\r\n\r\nRomancing  Singapore.  In May/June, we  have  the  Family\r\n\r\nWeek, and in November, we have the Senior Citizens'  Week\r\n\r\nand  Grandparents  Day.  We involve  various  sectors  to\r\n\r\npromote  family  and  we have been receiving  better  and\r\n\r\nbetter responses.  I characterise the situation of family\r\n\r\nwhen  I  began my reply by saying that family is in  good\r\n\r\nshape, though under pressure.  But, on the other hand, we\r\n\r\nsee  many  people  wanting to be part of  our  effort  to\r\n\r\npromote  family.   So, we are very  encouraged.   We  are\r\n\r\nconfident that we will do well.\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, despite an MCDS'\r\n\r\nsocial  attitudes  survey of 2001  showing  that  98%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  polled agreed that they would  support  and\r\n\r\nspend  time  with their elderly parents,  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nneglect  and abuse of the elderly may be on the increase,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  increasing financial and  other  constraints\r\n\r\nwithin  the family, and in changes in the sense  of  duty\r\n\r\nand filial piety to the elderly.   What causes this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, some of the elderly do not have enough CPF\r\n\r\nasset  or  assets to last their remaining years.   Others\r\n\r\nhave problems after upgrading to bigger flats because  of\r\n\r\nthe  downturn  in the property market.  Early  retirement\r\n\r\nand retrenchment may take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  toll not only on the elderly but  also  on   the\r\n\r\nadult  children upon whom they might have depended.   The\r\n\r\nelderly may also be targets of schemes to relieve them of\r\n\r\ntheir  assets,  either from people within the  family  or\r\n\r\nfrom outside the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, families are already under stress for time\r\n\r\nand  caregivers' roles.  Double incomes are  a  necessity\r\n\r\nand  people face retrenchments and redundancy.   Extended\r\n\r\nfamily  networks  are fast disappearing  with  increasing\r\n\r\npressure on time for work, procreation, childcare, skills\r\n\r\nretraining,  upgrading, continuing education.   There  is\r\n\r\nlittle  time  for  people  to spend  with  their  elderly\r\n\r\nparents.   When  the  elderly become frail,  it  is  even\r\n\r\nworse.   There is often no respite for those who have  to\r\n\r\nlook after the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think medical doctors in the House are familiar\r\n\r\nwith the term \"dumping syndrome\" to denote the phenomenon\r\n\r\nof  elderly  patients  with only vague  medical  problems\r\n\r\nbeing  brought  to  A&E departments for admission  during\r\n\r\nfestive  seasons.   In many cases, the  medical  problems\r\n\r\nwere  stable,  but  the  social  problems  were  obvious.\r\n\r\nRelatives  would disappear soon after the old person  was\r\n\r\nadmitted  only  to reappear after Chinese  New  Year,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever festival, was over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, elderly people who, in the past, neglected\r\n\r\nor abused their family members.  Others may have been too\r\n\r\nbusy to bond with their children when they were young and\r\n\r\nmay have left them to the care of maids or foster parents\r\n\r\nto  an excessive degree.  I think these people would have\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulty in expecting a high degree of care  and\r\n\r\nconcern from their own children when they are old.   Just\r\n\r\nas  we  have developed a legal and service infrastructure\r\n\r\nfor  child abuse and neglect, I believe, because  of  all\r\n\r\nthese  reasons,  we  should develop a national  eldercare\r\n\r\nprogramme of support infrastructure for the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nincreasingly, I see elderly residents coming to my  meet-the-people session asking for a 1- or 2-room rental flat,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause they feel unwanted by their adult children.  Many\r\n\r\nof  these elderly people have several children, but  they\r\n\r\nclaim that their married children have no place for them,\r\n\r\nor  that they all could not get along.  Some would  break\r\n\r\ninto tears when they relate how difficult life is at home\r\n\r\nwith their children's families.  And several say that  if\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  get a rental flat, that they  would  rather\r\n\r\njump  down from a HDB block than to carry on living  with\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it might be better for them to live\r\n\r\napart if it means a happier life for them all.  But I  am\r\n\r\nalso  concerned that this might point to a trend in which\r\n\r\nchildren, valuing their own privacy and space, have  been\r\n\r\nmaking  their  elderly  parents feel  unwanted,  and  are\r\n\r\nlooking to pass on the responsibility of caring for their\r\n\r\nparents  to  the State.  Rental flats, as  we  know,  are\r\n\r\nheavily subsidised by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel there is a need to educate children from\r\n\r\nyoung, but also those who are adults now, on the need  to\r\n\r\nsupport their aged parents without being forced to do  so\r\n\r\nby  the  law.   And we need to strengthen the  values  of\r\n\r\nfilial piety in this society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must try to check this trend early to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  we do not see more and more elderly parents  coming\r\n\r\nforward to say that they feel unwanted by their children,\r\n\r\nespecially  given our greying population.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, we need to step up our services for the elderly, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  spend their days enjoying programmes  at\r\n\r\nthese  service centres and perhaps return  home  only  at\r\n\r\nnight.   This might minimise the friction at home.   Sir,\r\n\r\ncan  I  ask  the  Minister what is  being  done  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight another trend of\r\n\r\nsingles,    especially   women,    bearing    the    main\r\n\r\nresponsibility of caring for their elderly parents.  Some\r\n\r\nare finding it very hard to cope.  They say that they get\r\n\r\nlittle  help  from  their married  siblings.   They  need\r\n\r\nsupport.   I  would urge MCDS to look into  this  growing\r\n\r\ntrend  and  see how we can support singles who  care  for\r\n\r\ntheir elderly parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it has been\r\n\r\nthree-plus  years since the IMC on the Ageing  Population\r\n\r\npublished its report with 78 recommendations covering six\r\n\r\nbroad  areas in which attention was required to ready  us\r\n\r\nfor the successful greying of our population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Ministries and agencies have moved at\r\n\r\ndifferent  speeds  to  act on the  recommendations  under\r\n\r\ntheir  purview.   The Health Ministry has  launched  many\r\n\r\ninitiatives,  but I believe significant fine-tuning  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  done  as  it monitors whether  the  desired\r\n\r\nprogress  and outcomes are being achieved.  The Transport\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  responded in part, but has made  it  quite\r\n\r\nclear that the requirement to move the masses efficiently\r\n\r\nmust  take precedence over the needs of the small numbers\r\n\r\nof the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has already so much it\r\n\r\nneeds  to  do  with refocusing CPF back to  the  original\r\n\r\nintent  of taking care of the basic retirement  needs  of\r\n\r\naccount   holders  and,  at  the  same  time,  facilitate\r\n\r\ncontinuing employment of older workers.  It does not want\r\n\r\nto open another front on special accounts for homemakers.\r\n\r\nSo  its  response is simply that this should be  achieved\r\n\r\nthrough the current provision of voluntary contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand all their reasons and priorities.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  have been so farsighted in identifying  the\r\n\r\nimpending  demographic challenge so early and recognising\r\n\r\nthe   need   for  across-the-board  cooperation   between\r\n\r\nmultiple  agencies  that need to  act  together  to  have\r\n\r\nconvened  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  it  will  be  a shame to lose  this  good  start,\r\n\r\nespecially  in danger now, as we face the toughest  times\r\n\r\nthat we have had to weather since the earlier days of our\r\n\r\nhistory  as an independent  nation.  I am concerned  that\r\n\r\nin  the midst of addressing pressing economic issues,  we\r\n\r\nsideline   and   neglect  to  push   onwards   with   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the recommendations.  We should persist\r\n\r\neven  while  dealing with the current hardships.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  because  many  of the  policies  and  measures\r\n\r\ninvolve interlocking components of our infrastructure  on\r\n\r\nthe one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand, and attitudes and mindsets on the other, that  will\r\n\r\ntake  a  long  time to do, to change and  to  take  root.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we say that it will hit almost 20% of over  65s\r\n\r\nonly in 2030, the truth of the matter is that our rate of\r\n\r\nageing  will increase exponentially from 2010,  which  is\r\n\r\nnot so far away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister, who has the unenviable task\r\n\r\nin  MCDS of coordinating our efforts on the elderly, give\r\n\r\nus  an  update  and  his assessment of  progress  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the IMC recommendations, and  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  priorities  and main challenges  for  the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears?   Particularly important, I believe, will  be  the\r\n\r\nefforts directed to helping caregivers cope, as this will\r\n\r\nbe  a  growing  group which deserves  our  attention  and\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee, you can take your two\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, I recognise that there are\r\n\r\nprovisions  in our laws to protect the elderly,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Women's Charter, the Penal Code, the Maintenance  of\r\n\r\nParents  Act and the Mental Disorders and Treatment  Act.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is,  currently,  no  over-arching  legal\r\n\r\nframework,  like  the Protection of  Children  and  Young\r\n\r\nPersons Act.  There are, apparently, lots of complex grey\r\n\r\nareas  and  a  lack  of consensus about what  constitutes\r\n\r\nelder abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are difficulties about what constitutes a\r\n\r\nminimum standard of care for the elderly.  If we  are  to\r\n\r\ngo  after  family  members for delay in  seeking  medical\r\n\r\ncare,  for example, do we also recognise that the elderly\r\n\r\nmay refuse to accept medical care?  If the working adults\r\n\r\nin  the family can barely put food on the table for their\r\n\r\nown  children,  how  much more can they  be  expected  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for their elderly parents?  There is a  need  to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  independence and  personal  choice  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly  who may choose to continue to live in an abusive\r\n\r\nsituation  at home, and the role of the State  to  uphold\r\n\r\njustice.  Perhaps there is a place for a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Act to provide for the State to assume  the\r\n\r\nrole of guardian and protector in selected cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, laws are not enough. We need to\r\n\r\nprovide practical help to families to help them to  cope.\r\n\r\nI  would urge the Government to consider two suggestions:\r\n\r\nfirstly,  increasing  resources  for  the  MCDS'  Elderly\r\n\r\nDevelopment Division to develop a whole new framework  of\r\n\r\ncare for the elderly, to increase detection and expertise\r\n\r\nand  to develop a national consensus on the issue as well\r\n\r\nas  to improve on existing institutional and VWO services\r\n\r\nfor  the elderly.  Just like there are women's clubs  and\r\n\r\nmen's  clubs,  perhaps  we  also  need  to  have  elderly\r\n\r\nactivity  clubs  along the lines of  SAGE  and  even  our\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens' clubs, which would form areas of mutual\r\n\r\nsupport  and help the elderly age gracefully together  in\r\n\r\nsmall and closely-knit groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister would also consider an elderly\r\n\r\nprotection  and  care service along the  lines  of  MCDS'\r\n\r\nChildren  and  Young Persons Service.   The  emphasis  is\r\n\r\nreally  not  about  wayward working  adult  children  but\r\n\r\nfinding workable solutions for families in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, going by the latest\r\n\r\nfigures on rental flats, about 66% of those who stay in 1- and   2-room   rental  flats  are  singles,  widows   and\r\n\r\ndivorcees.   Most are above 40, with a higher  proportion\r\n\r\nbeing  above  60.  All are considered lower income,  with\r\n\r\nhousehold incomes below $800 a month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the greatest problems faced by ageing\r\n\r\nlower   income  singles,  which  I  include  widows   and\r\n\r\ndivorcees  as  well, are loneliness, depression  and  the\r\n\r\nfear  of  dying alone.  They suffer from low  self-esteem\r\n\r\nand  a  sense  of  exclusion.  The  job  market  in  this\r\n\r\nknowledge-economy  often shut  the  door  on  them.   The\r\n\r\nmarriage option is not always open to them.  Most of  the\r\n\r\nsingles  in  this  group often find it  hard  to  find  a\r\n\r\npartner,  unless they venture further afield  to  Vietnam\r\n\r\nand  China.   But even this has its attendant  risks  and\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is little help preaching to them to get\r\n\r\nmarried.   Few  of  these low income singles  mix  around\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  neighbourhood coffeeshop, mainly because  of\r\n\r\nmoney and transport problems.  We need to zoom in on  the\r\n\r\nplight of older singles, many of whom lead depressing and\r\n\r\nisolated   lives.   The  isolation  of   older   singles,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  lower income, will  become  increasingly\r\n\r\nmore prevalent as the population greys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is being done\r\n\r\nto  reach  out to this group of ageing singles,  to  make\r\n\r\nsure   that  they  are  integrated  into  the  mainstream\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, there is a saying\r\n\r\nwith  regard to growing old gracefully  -  use it or lose\r\n\r\nit.   Yes,  use  your brains, spread your experience  and\r\n\r\nwisdom  or you stand to lose them.  Keep up the  physical\r\n\r\nactivity or you may lose your muscle and strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are one of the fastest ageing societies, the\r\n\r\nbest  approach for us to adopt is to ensure that all  our\r\n\r\nelderly,  especially our retired, are  encouraged  to  be\r\n\r\nactive  physically,  mentally and socially  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  good health.  This will not only  prevent  many\r\n\r\nillnesses  but  will  also  result  in  happier   people.\r\n\r\nPrevention  of illnesses and keeping the mind active  and\r\n\r\nhealthy should be prioritised.  Depression which is  more\r\n\r\nprevalent in the elderly can be prevented by getting  the\r\n\r\nelderly more engaged socially and involving them with new\r\n\r\nhobbies  and  purposes in life.  We need to do  more  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  better in achieving total holistic  care  for\r\n\r\nthe  well-being of our elderly.   And this should be done\r\n\r\nisland-wide,  not  just  through the  Ministry  but  also\r\n\r\nthrough voluntary organisations, grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nand charitable organisations.  Of course, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development and Sports should facilitate  these\r\n\r\norganisations in setting up care centres that aim  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nand Sports started care centres a  few years ago with the\r\n\r\nabove\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews in mind, and catering not only for the elderly  but\r\n\r\nalso  for the children.

Ms Braema.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do know that there is a growing number of single\r\n\r\nwomen in our midst.  Women also tend to live longer,  the\r\n\r\nmedian age being 80.4.  More women are also prone to long-term  illnesses, such as osteoporosis and gynaecological-related  problems.  And there are also more women without\r\n\r\nCPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the Ministry of Manpower and the\r\n\r\nstatistics that were released last year, 52% of  the  1.5\r\n\r\nmillion  inactive CPF holders were women.  Of  this  lot,\r\n\r\n330,000  were  aged 40 and above.  In the  singles  camp,\r\n\r\nfrom the data of the Department of Statistics, 64,000 out\r\n\r\nof  the  193,000  are women aged 35  and  above.   Widows\r\n\r\nnumbered 11,500; divorcees took 20,600.  Median income of\r\n\r\nsingles,  I am told, is about $2,000.  Widows,  divorcees\r\n\r\nand singles with qualifications of below secondary school\r\n\r\nlevel   are  about  1,000.   Against  the  map  of  these\r\n\r\nstatistics  as well as the access to financial resources,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Ministry whether it  is  timely\r\n\r\nperhaps to conduct a comprehensive study on how our women\r\n\r\nare coping where their financial resources are concerned.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the services that need to be put in  place  so\r\n\r\nthat  we meet this need before it descends on us?   Also,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time, let us also look at the  roles  that\r\n\r\nwomen  have  been  playing for the  longer  time  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   Till today, they are still the main caregivers\r\n\r\ntaking care of, as we have heard, the elderly, the  young\r\n\r\npeople, etc.  For doing all that work, at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday, what is it that we are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give  them  where  financial  independence  is\r\n\r\nconcerned?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank the Members who have spoken on a matter that is\r\n\r\nclose  to  our hearts - caring for our aged and preparing\r\n\r\nfor an ageing population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the point raised by Ms Braema\r\n\r\nMathiaparanam.   As Ms Braema Mathiaparanam  has  pointed\r\n\r\nout, there are certain segments of our population who are\r\n\r\nless financially secure.  In general, women may need more\r\n\r\nretirement savings as they tend to live longer than  men.\r\n\r\nFor  women  who  have  less capacity and  opportunity  to\r\n\r\naccumulate  financial resources, for example,  housewives\r\n\r\nfrom  low income families with no CPF accounts, the  low-income, or lower-educated singles and divorced women,  it\r\n\r\nis even more important for them to develop adequate means\r\n\r\nand  resources to support themselves in their  retirement\r\n\r\nyears.  Work is still the best form of welfare.  And  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  are unable to support themselves, our  social\r\n\r\nsafety net schemes would help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has asked whether or not we have done a study on\r\n\r\nhow  our women are coping.  I cannot say for certain that\r\n\r\nwe  have done a particular study in this area.  But  part\r\n\r\nof  the  IMC focus is to understand how Singaporeans,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral, including single women who are older, cope  with\r\n\r\nthe financial demands of their retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is aware that there may be women who\r\n\r\nneed  help  in  coping  especially  with  the  impact  of\r\n\r\neconomic restructuring.  In fact, we have begun dialogues\r\n\r\nwith  the  three key women's organisations,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Council  of  Women's Organisations,  the  NTUC\r\n\r\nWomen's  Committee  and the PA Women Integration  Network\r\n\r\n(WIN).   The aim, as I said earlier, is to try  and  help\r\n\r\nour  women  folks  to explore what are the  collaborative\r\n\r\nopportunities  in training and re-skilling  of  women  in\r\n\r\nareas, such as IT\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  domestic services. So the long-term goal is to  give\r\n\r\nthem  some skills so that they can find jobs and  develop\r\n\r\nsome  financial  independence.  Together with  other  key\r\n\r\nagencies, we will study the long-term financial needs  of\r\n\r\nwomen,  as part of our strategy of taking a more sectoral\r\n\r\napproach  towards  addressing  the  ageing  concerns   of\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups of Singaporeans.   So I would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  Ms  Braema that we will look into this matter  as\r\n\r\npart  of our effort to understand better how Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  coping in their retirement age.  In this regard, the\r\n\r\nservices that are needed will be put in place as and when\r\n\r\nthere are service gaps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng spoke about the need to educate our\r\n\r\nyoung   about  supporting  their  aged  parents.   Filial\r\n\r\nresponsibility  has  and will continue  to  underpin  our\r\n\r\nphilosophy of the \"family as the first line of  support\".\r\n\r\nWith  an ageing population, smaller families and a rising\r\n\r\ndependency  ratio,  we must continue to  reinforce  these\r\n\r\nsocial values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, we have been strongly promoting the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Family  Values,  one  of  which   is   filial\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  These values are taught  in  the  Civics\r\n\r\nand Moral Education, a compulsory subject for our primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary  students,  and Civics  at  pre-university\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS also undertakes a year-round public education\r\n\r\ndrive  to  foster positive attitudes towards  family  and\r\n\r\nolder  persons.  As  part of this  effort,  we  are  also\r\n\r\nstressing strong inter-generational ties and the need  to\r\n\r\ncare for our elderly parents, not just their physical and\r\n\r\nfinancial  needs but also seeing to their  emotional  and\r\n\r\nsocial  needs.   And Mr Chan Soo Sen has alluded  to  the\r\n\r\nGrand  Parenting  Day that we have started  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, over the years, introduced tax\r\n\r\nreliefs  and  other schemes to encourage Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of their parents.  These schemes include  the\r\n\r\nparent   relief,  relief  for  CPF  top-up  of   parents'\r\n\r\nretirement account and the use of Medisave savings to pay\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents'  hospital bills.  Our housing policies encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to live with or near their parents,  and  Ms\r\n\r\nIrene  Ng would be pleased to learn that close to 88%  of\r\n\r\nour seniors still live with their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the few who do not provide for their parents,\r\n\r\nthe  Maintenance of Parents Act provides a legal recourse\r\n\r\nfor  the aged parents to seek financial maintenance  from\r\n\r\nthese children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we promote filial piety, we also\r\n\r\nempathise with families that are struggling to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  demands  of caregiving.  A few MPs have  called  for\r\n\r\nmore to be done to help our elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that my Ministry has\r\n\r\ninvested  substantially  on eldercare  and  developmental\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   In fact, our expenditure in this  area  has\r\n\r\nmore than doubled over the past four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Jennifer Lee has asked for an update of the\r\n\r\nEldercare   Master   Plan.    Briefly,   86%    of    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations would be implemented and we  are  looking\r\n\r\ninto  launching a new round of policy deliberations.   At\r\n\r\nthe  next  round  of  deliberations,  we  will  focus  on\r\n\r\nemployment and sectoral needs, especially single elderly,\r\n\r\nboth  male  and female, and what are the things  that  we\r\n\r\nneed to do to help them so that they can continue to  age\r\n\r\nactively in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, many of the programmes are\r\n\r\nalready  in  place.   For example, we  have  revised  the\r\n\r\nfunding  norms  to  give the VWOs more resources  to  run\r\n\r\nprogrammes, such as day care, befriending and counselling\r\n\r\nservices.  Six new day care centres have been set up over\r\n\r\nthe  past  two  years.  There are now  more  support  and\r\n\r\nresources for caregivers, through a caregiver centre  and\r\n\r\nthe availability of carers' manuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from setting up facilities, we have made\r\n\r\nefforts  to  develop new capabilities in anticipation  of\r\n\r\nfuture needs, such as gero-counselling and upgrading  the\r\n\r\nskills\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  aged  care workers to enable them to  deliver  a\r\n\r\nhigher  quality  of  service.  I have mentioned  some  of\r\n\r\nthese initiatives yesterday, for example, developing bite-sized  eldercare  training  courses  under  the  National\r\n\r\nSkills Recognition System.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to allude to the point that Dr Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee  has  mentioned about the IMC and whether or  not  we\r\n\r\nhave   been   making  headway.   Sir,   one   significant\r\n\r\nbreakthrough  is  that our policies  now  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nentry of more players into the eldercare industry.   This\r\n\r\nwill gradually grow the pool of service providers and the\r\n\r\nvariety  of  services, hence providing  more  choices  to\r\n\r\nusers.   For  example, last July, we extended  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy  to  co-operatives  providing  services.   I   am\r\n\r\npleased  to  say that two day care centres  run  by  NTUC\r\n\r\nEldercare Co-operative have come on board.  We will  move\r\n\r\ntowards  extending the user subsidy to private  providers\r\n\r\nwithin the next two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a second breakthrough is that we now provide\r\n\r\nnot  just eldercare but developmental programmes for  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  and  opening  up  additional  avenues  for  our\r\n\r\nseniors to contribute and remain active.  Active aging is\r\n\r\nstill  the cornerstone of our philosophy for the elderly.\r\n\r\nInitiatives  include the Active Seniors  Programme  which\r\n\r\nhas  involved 1,200 senior volunteers.  We also have nine\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Links located in different  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland,  which  encourage inter-generational  interaction\r\n\r\nand  mutual  help.  So these are opportunities  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  created  on  the ground for the elderly  to  remain\r\n\r\ntogether with the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third breakthrough is that starting from April\r\n\r\nthis  year,  my  Ministry will be funding community  case\r\n\r\nmanagement  service as a national programme.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  development as it would  pave  the  way  for\r\n\r\nbetter  coordination  of community  care  for  our  older\r\n\r\npeople.   The service has been piloted locally  and  over\r\n\r\n97% of the caregivers surveyed have found the service  to\r\n\r\nbe  beneficial.   This service provides a one-stop  entry\r\n\r\npoint for frail elderly who have multiple and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplex  needs.  Case managers will assess the  elderly's\r\n\r\nneeds  and put together a package of appropriate services\r\n\r\nand  continue to monitor the progress of the  individual.\r\n\r\nWe  will spend about $400,000 on this programme annually.\r\n\r\nOver  the  next  couple of years,  MCDS  will  study  the\r\n\r\nfeasibility of a one-stop assessment and referral service\r\n\r\nfor  our  elderly.  Such a facility could bring  about  a\r\n\r\nquantum improvement in the care of our aged.  My Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  study  this  issue closely  with  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a much needed breakthrough is in terms of\r\n\r\nemployer  mindset in hiring older workers.  We will  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry  of Manpower and  other  partners  to\r\n\r\naddress this issue, but there is a need for employers  to\r\n\r\ndo  their part.  In this regard, I commend the KK Women's\r\n\r\nand  Children's  Hospital and Dr Lee  for  being  a  fine\r\n\r\nexample in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has asked about the progress of the\r\n\r\n3-in-1 elderly care centre.  She is probably referring to\r\n\r\nthe  Tampines 3-in-1 Family Centre, which was set  up  in\r\n\r\n1995,  not by my Ministry, but at the initiative  of  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Community Foundation branch in Tampines.  The centre\r\n\r\nis  progressing  well and is a good example  of  how  the\r\n\r\nproximity of services can promote social integration  and\r\n\r\ninter-generational  bonding.  In  planning  services,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry will continue to explore co-location of services\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are opportunities to do so.   Dr  Lily  Neo\r\n\r\nwould   be   pleased  to  learn  that  we  are  currently\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a multi-service centre in Jurong West,  which\r\n\r\nwill house services for the young and old under one roof.\r\n\r\nThe  centre is expected to be ready by the end  of  2004.\r\n\r\nWe will study the benefits of this pilot before expanding\r\n\r\nthe concept to other housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all our seniors have families to turn to, and Ms\r\n\r\nIrene Ng has touched on the needs of one such group - the\r\n\r\nelderly singles.  Our programmes, such as befriending and\r\n\r\nhome help, have succeeded in reaching out to some of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  individuals, offering them much needed social  and\r\n\r\nemotional  support.  Notwithstanding this, we agree  that\r\n\r\nmore could be done, particularly for those living alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, we are working towards\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the  community support  network  for  this\r\n\r\ngroup,  through  developing  a  manual  that  will  guide\r\n\r\nagencies  on the action to take when they encounter  such\r\n\r\nindividuals  and how to link them to support services  in\r\n\r\nthe  community, such as the Neighbourhood  Link  and  the\r\n\r\nBefriending Service.  I spoke about this yesterday as  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  community resilience and  that  we  want  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  support groups for all who are in Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthem to continue to have social and emotional support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee suggested an Elderly Protection and\r\n\r\nCare  service along the lines of MCDS' Family  and  Child\r\n\r\nProtection  Service and the Children  and  Young  Persons\r\n\r\nAct.   We agree with Dr Lee that the emphasis must  first\r\n\r\nbe on finding workable solutions for the family and not a\r\n\r\npunitive, legalistic approach.  This is why it is best to\r\n\r\nadopt a multi-agency approach and ride on the established\r\n\r\nFamily  Violence  Dialogue Group and  Networking  System,\r\n\r\nrather than set up a separate machinery and legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any elderly person requiring help can access\r\n\r\nservices  through  a number of contact points,  including\r\n\r\nthe Family Service Centres, GPs, community agencies, MCDS\r\n\r\nor   the   hospitals.    Healthcare   professionals,   in\r\n\r\nparticular,  are  all well placed to identify  and  refer\r\n\r\nsuspected elderly abuse cases for help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are actively working to educate those in the\r\n\r\nNetwork  on how to deal with elderly abuse.  We  recently\r\n\r\nran   a  seminar  on  this  subject  for  social  service\r\n\r\npractitioners   and  health  care  personnel   and   made\r\n\r\navailable  a booklet entitled 'Understanding Elder  Abuse\r\n\r\nand Neglect - Detecting and Helping'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the initiatives I have mentioned are part of\r\n\r\nour overall strategy to prepare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  the  challenges of an ageing  population.\r\n\r\nOur   approach   is   threefold  -   promoting   personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility   through   public   education,   creating\r\n\r\nopportunities for our seniors to contribute  and  play  a\r\n\r\nrole,  and strengthening our eldercare services  to  help\r\n\r\nfamilies cope with caregiving.  The challenges are multi-faceted  and require a coordinated effort not just  among\r\n\r\nthe  Government agencies, but also among all  sectors  of\r\n\r\nthe  society.   The  desired outcome  is  for  our  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  age with dignity  and  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nremain  healthy, active and secure in their golden years.\r\n\r\nI think I have addressed most of the concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki, you have five cuts back to\r\n\r\nback.  You can take them altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, on Family Service\r\n\r\nCentres, I would want to declare my interest as a  member\r\n\r\nof  the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre.  We have  heard\r\n\r\nthe initials FSCs for the umpteenth time in this Chamber.\r\n\r\nSet  up  in  the early 1990s, we now have about  35  FSCs\r\n\r\nserving  a population of 3.3 million people.  This  works\r\n\r\nout   to   approximately  96,000   persons,   or   24,000\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  per FSC.  I wonder if this is an  acceptable\r\n\r\nratio of FSCs to households in MCDS' view.  Otherwise, is\r\n\r\nMCDS  planning to allow more FSCs to be set up  to  cater\r\n\r\nfor  the  growing  need of so-called social  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my understanding is that MCDS provides 50% of\r\n\r\nthe  recurrent cost of running an FSC that  it  approves.\r\n\r\nAs I have many questions for the Minister on this cut,  I\r\n\r\nwill  just go straight to the questions.  First, who  are\r\n\r\nthe  service users of the FSCs?  What percentage  of  the\r\n\r\ngeographical population is the FSC actually serving?\r\n\r\n<br>12.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on funding justification, what were the\r\n\r\noutcome measures of FSCs and whether they have been  met?\r\n\r\nHave FSCs been effective?  What are the criteria used  to\r\n\r\nassess their effectiveness?  What service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards  are set, and how are these standards  ensured?\r\n\r\nWhat criteria are used in granting organisations licensed\r\n\r\nto  operate  FSCs?   Is  there a licensing  mechanism  in\r\n\r\nsetting  up  and operating FSCs?  Does MCDS  license  and\r\n\r\nmonitor  those FSCs that do not receive funding from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?   How  are these standards assessed  in  such\r\n\r\nFSCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this latter issue is of importance as, unless\r\n\r\nFSCs,  whether  funded by MCDS or not, are  subjected  to\r\n\r\nclear guidelines and service standards, residents may  be\r\n\r\nusing  services from these FSCs without knowing  if  they\r\n\r\nhave   the  requisite  staff  qualification  and  service\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the pioneer FSCs are operated by VWOs.\r\n\r\nHowever,  lately, I note that many of the  new  FSCs  are\r\n\r\naffiliated  to  religious institutions.  I  was  informed\r\n\r\nthat  in  some of these FSCs, there are religious symbols\r\n\r\nand  paraphernalia.  In this regard, I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nhow does MCDS ensure that these do not become barriers to\r\n\r\naccess  by  those  who  do  not  profess  the  particular\r\n\r\nreligion of the organisation.  How does MCDS ensure  that\r\n\r\neveryone   has   access  and  is  not  disadvantaged   by\r\n\r\nstructural  characteristics of the FSCs?  In short,  what\r\n\r\nis the MCDS' policy on this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another critical issue relates to the access to\r\n\r\nservices,  ie, the language proficiency of the  staff  in\r\n\r\nthe  FSCs.   Not everyone speaks English, especially  the\r\n\r\nelderly and low-income families, who are the bulk of  the\r\n\r\nservice users.  Are there guidelines to ensure that every\r\n\r\nFSC  has a sufficient range of staff members who are able\r\n\r\nto  speak all the official languages, to ensure access is\r\n\r\nnot denied through language gaps?  I would also encourage\r\n\r\nMCDS  to  monitor  issues  of cross-cultural  interaction\r\n\r\nbetween helpers and services users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on domestic violence. Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  also declare that I am the adviser to a  Centre\r\n\r\ncalled Promoting Alternatives to Violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday we heard about the start of Gulf War\r\n\r\nII.  We have talked about the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevastating  impact  of terrorism on  people.   Yet,  for\r\n\r\ngenerations,  another form of terrorism has  been  taking\r\n\r\nplace in our midst, ie, terrorism in our homes.  Domestic\r\n\r\nviolence,  which encompasses psychological  and  physical\r\n\r\nterrorism, has a debilitating effect on the family.   The\r\n\r\n1997  amendment to the Women's Charter has  opened  doors\r\n\r\nfor victims and their families to seek help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the first source of help for the\r\n\r\nvictims  of violence is the police.  I must applaud  MCDS\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore  Police Force  for  spearheading  the\r\n\r\nNational Family Violence Police Networking System,  which\r\n\r\nallows  victims  needing help to  go  to  Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres.   This system has been in place for five  years.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know what is the extent of the  problem\r\n\r\nnow.   How  many incidents of violence have been reported\r\n\r\nto the police in the last five years?  I have heard that,\r\n\r\nwhen  incidents of violence occur and families  call  the\r\n\r\npolice  for  assistance, there is  a  tendency  for  some\r\n\r\npolice  officers to downplay the violence,  because  they\r\n\r\nperceive  it  as  a  private domestic quarrel.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I would like to ask what is the police  protocol\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to handling domestic violence cases.   Even\r\n\r\nwith the protocol in place, what is being done by way  of\r\n\r\nmonitoring  to  ensure  that these  protocols  are  being\r\n\r\nadhered to?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is that victims of violence are\r\n\r\nalready  being  disempowered.  It takes a great  deal  of\r\n\r\ncourage and will for them to seek help.  When attempts of\r\n\r\nhelp  are  thwarted  by  well-intentioned  officers,  who\r\n\r\nsometimes confuse family violence with marital and family\r\n\r\ndisputes,  it  is harder for the victims to come  forward\r\n\r\nagain.   Some  clients actually tell social workers  that\r\n\r\nabusers tell them that it is no point seeking help, as no\r\n\r\none would believe them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all they are asking for is for the violence to\r\n\r\nstop,  not  for  the relationship to end.  Perhaps,  this\r\n\r\nmessage  needs  to be stressed to the very  people  whose\r\n\r\nmandate is to stop violence, ie, the police.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus,  my question is: how does MCDS work with the police\r\n\r\nin  ensuring  that  cases  of domestic  violence  receive\r\n\r\nappropriate and immediate attention?  What are the  legal\r\n\r\nobligations of the police to help?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is critical in repeated cases of abuse\r\n\r\nthat  we  see - because of what is known as the \"battered\r\n\r\nwomen\"  syndrome,  ie, the sense of helplessness  or  the\r\n\r\nfear  of further abuse to them and their children -  many\r\n\r\nof  these victims are extremely fearful to seek help.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister how are such cases helped.\r\n\r\nWould  MCDS  consider a system like the one in  Australia\r\n\r\nwhere,  in  very  serious cases of  domestic  abuse,  the\r\n\r\npolice  can  apply what is known as an interim protection\r\n\r\norder?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of child abuse, there are laws to\r\n\r\nremove children from abusive homes.  In cases of violence\r\n\r\nin  the  home,  eg,  in  cases  of  elder-abuse,  spousal\r\n\r\nviolence, are there laws that give the police the mandate\r\n\r\nto remove adults from their homes when they are abused?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, we hear of cases of victims\r\n\r\nin  cohabitative relationships being abused.  While  they\r\n\r\ncan seek private summonses, there is no formal protection\r\n\r\naccorded  to them.  How is domestic violence with  regard\r\n\r\nto  such couples handled?  MCDS has indicated that it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to look into this matter.  I would like to ask what\r\n\r\nis  the status of the situation now.  In the light of the\r\n\r\nrecent  murder cases involving couples who have  resorted\r\n\r\nto  the most extreme form of violence - and some of  them\r\n\r\nare  in  cohabitative relationships - does MCDS  plan  to\r\n\r\ndeal with violence in an intimate relationship?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the reasons, violence can and should\r\n\r\nnever  be  condoned.  It is our moral responsibility  not\r\n\r\nonly to respect but to protect the dignity of individuals\r\n\r\nand families from abuse.  The world may be turbulent, and\r\n\r\nwar  may  be  going on as we speak.  We must continue  to\r\n\r\nstrive for peace.  Let peace begin within the four  walls\r\n\r\nof our homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we deal with domestic violence, there is what is\r\n\r\ncalled a personal protection\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  (PPO), which can be taken up by victims to protect\r\n\r\nthemselves  from further abuse.  It is an instrument  and\r\n\r\nan  avenue for them in this regard.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  how many personal protection  orders  have\r\n\r\nbeen  issued to victims of abuse in the last  five  years\r\n\r\nand, if the trend is increasing, whatever the reasons may\r\n\r\nbe,  will  greater resources be allocated  in  addressing\r\n\r\nthis trend?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, violence does not occur once. There is such a\r\n\r\nthing  that is called the cycle of violence.  Thus,  many\r\n\r\nof  the victims are protected by PPOs from further abuse.\r\n\r\nHowever, because violence occurs again, there is what  is\r\n\r\ncalled  a  breach of PPOs.  I would like to ask how  many\r\n\r\ncases  of  PPOs have been breached.  How does the  police\r\n\r\ndetermine a breach?  I ask these questions because I know\r\n\r\nof  many situations where victims are told by the  courts\r\n\r\nand their social workers that, should a breach occur, all\r\n\r\nthey  need  to  do is to call the police.  However,  when\r\n\r\nthey seek police assistance, they perceive that no action\r\n\r\nis  taken although, according to documents given to  them\r\n\r\nin  court, a breach has occurred.  It is even harder  for\r\n\r\nthem when psychological abuse takes place in the form  of\r\n\r\nthreats  and harassment, as these are often difficult  to\r\n\r\nprove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not questioning the professionalism of the\r\n\r\npolice  force.   Like many others, I am  proud  of  their\r\n\r\nachievements.  I know that they maintain high  standards.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to know what happens when a  person\r\n\r\nbreaches an order, ie, what kind of action is taken  when\r\n\r\na  breach occurs.  In the most recent year, what  is  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  the  different kinds of action  taken  for\r\n\r\nbreach  cases?   As  one of the key stakeholders  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Family Violence Networking System, what is MCDS'\r\n\r\nposition  or  policy on breach cases?  How does  it  work\r\n\r\nwith the police in this regard?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the reasons, violence is disrespectful\r\n\r\nbehaviour.   Violence is also about making a choice  and,\r\n\r\nwith choices, come consequences.  When an abuser breaches\r\n\r\nthe PPO, he is in fact breaking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  law  and,  when someone breaks the  law,  there  are\r\n\r\npunishments to be meted out.  Thus, the issue  of  breach\r\n\r\nof PPOs is important, because we need to send the message\r\n\r\nto  both victims and perpetrators that the law has to  be\r\n\r\nrespected.  The actions of the relevant agencies, eg, the\r\n\r\npolice  and  MCDS,  must  also  reflect  this  very  same\r\n\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware that, with issues of interpersonal\r\n\r\nviolence, getting the cooperation of victims when  action\r\n\r\nis  taken is sometimes difficult, as victims do back out.\r\n\r\nThis  is  expected,  as no one wants the  member  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily to be convicted.  However, we also need to keep in\r\n\r\nmind that reporting a person for breaking the law is  not\r\n\r\n-  and  I  stress, is not - about breaking up the family.\r\n\r\nIt  is  about  stopping  violence  and,  as  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, we want to stop abuse and help families  rebuild\r\n\r\ntheir relationships.  By doing so, we can keep the family\r\n\r\nunit intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part of preventing a breach from happening is\r\n\r\nthe issuance of Mandatory Counselling Orders by the court\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that abusers and victims of violence  receive\r\n\r\ncounselling services.  This is laudable, as we know  that\r\n\r\nfamilies  experiencing violence need  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\ntrauma  of violence.  I have heard from many social  work\r\n\r\ncolleagues  how,  with  the introduction  of  counselling\r\n\r\norders, the entire family experiencing the violence  gets\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to deal with the violence in their  home.\r\n\r\nMCDS   should   be  congratulated  for  including   these\r\n\r\namendments  in the Women's Charter.  It can,  I  believe,\r\n\r\ncontribute to stronger family bonds and healthier  family\r\n\r\nrelationships.    Since  the  inception  of   counselling\r\n\r\norders, I would like to ask the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How many counselling orders have been issued in\r\n\r\nthe last five years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) For each of the five years, what is the\r\n\r\nproportion of counselling orders issued to the number  of\r\n\r\npersonal protection orders issued?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Is this seen as an acceptable proportion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) What is the likely explanation for this, and\r\n\r\nwhat happens to the rest of the cases that were not given\r\n\r\ncounselling orders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked with families which have been mandated\r\n\r\nto  come  for counselling and, though there is resistance\r\n\r\nfrom  some  of them in the beginning, when they  see  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  how their families can be helped, they  become\r\n\r\nopen to the counselling process.  I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  what are MCDS' assessment and plans on  how  we\r\n\r\ncan  reach  out  to more families experiencing  violence,\r\n\r\nthrough   the  counselling  order  process.    Have   the\r\n\r\nexperiences  of  other  countries been  studied  in  this\r\n\r\nregard, and what are the outcomes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues of family violence, though small in\r\n\r\nnumber  in comparison with other countries, are a concern\r\n\r\nfor  us  in Singapore.  The impact of family violence  on\r\n\r\nchildren growing up in homes has been documented in other\r\n\r\ncountries.   We  know  also of  how  adult  survivors  of\r\n\r\nviolence  have difficulty coping with relationships  when\r\n\r\nthey  have  grown up in violent homes.  I am not  talking\r\n\r\nabout    physical   violence   alone;    emotional    and\r\n\r\npsychological  abuse  is  often  more  debilitating  than\r\n\r\nphysical violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, reaching out to these families who actually\r\n\r\ntake  the first step to seek help through the application\r\n\r\nof  a PPO is critical.  The counselling orders reach  out\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  victims and abusers but, more importantly,\r\n\r\nperhaps  to  the  hidden victims  of  violence,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nchildren.   These  children  may  grow  up  learning  and\r\n\r\ninternalising  that  violence is  part  of  their  lives.\r\n\r\nStudies  have shown that this can happen.  We  must  stop\r\n\r\nfamily  violence,  and  I urge the Ministry  to  continue\r\n\r\nworking  with the courts in acknowledging the  importance\r\n\r\nof  counselling orders in helping address the problem  of\r\n\r\nfamily violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we talk about the children, I want to wrap up my\r\n\r\nlast cut with the issue of teenage birth and delinquency.\r\n\r\nSir, issues\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof delinquency and teenage pregnancies are inter-related.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that statistics show that they are starting\r\n\r\nto  move towards an increasing trend.  I cannot help  but\r\n\r\nnotice it also, as I see many teenagers getting pregnant,\r\n\r\nsome forced to get married, others choose abortion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the girls are getting pregnant, the boys are\r\n\r\ngetting  into trouble with the law, either due  to  their\r\n\r\nsexual  behaviours or sometimes due to other  anti-social\r\n\r\nand   criminal  behaviours.   If  not  assisted,  we  are\r\n\r\nbreeding potentially new multi-problem families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are these kids? Is it part and parcel of a\r\n\r\ncountry's  development  that  we  have  such  issues   of\r\n\r\njuvenile   delinquency   and  teenage   pregnancies?    I\r\n\r\nrecognise that dealing with youth problems is not an easy\r\n\r\ntask and requires the collaboration of many parties.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  set up the Inter-Ministry  Committee  on\r\n\r\nJuvenile  Crime a couple of years ago.   I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  has  done much to curtail  the  incidences  of\r\n\r\njuvenile crime.  But the problem of teenage pregnancy  is\r\n\r\na  serious  one  as,  often times, the  future  of  these\r\n\r\nchildren  is  at stake.  As I mentioned earlier,  I  have\r\n\r\nseen   cases  of  16  and  17-year-olds,  who  are  still\r\n\r\ndependent   on   their  parents,  now  becoming   parents\r\n\r\nthemselves and have dependants of their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also called earlier for a detailed study\r\n\r\nof  these  youngsters, not just the girls  but  also  the\r\n\r\nboys.   What is their profile like?  Are they not fitting\r\n\r\ninto  the education system and its demands?  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education has argued that streaming will allow them to\r\n\r\nstudy  at their own pace, and should enable them  to  fit\r\n\r\ninto  the  system well.  Were these kids wrongly streamed\r\n\r\nthen?  I urge the Ministry to work with MOE to conduct  a\r\n\r\nstudy to allow us to understand the problem better and to\r\n\r\ndevelop more preventive programmes in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, delinquency does not happen overnight. Social\r\n\r\nscientists  have  identified the stage of pre-delinquency\r\n\r\nwhere   children  begin  to  manifest  early   signs   of\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  I would like to ask whether the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry   works   with  schools  in   identifying   pre-delinquents.    If  so,  how  many  pre-delinquents   are\r\n\r\nidentified  every year and what is being done  to  assist\r\n\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the response given by MOE, I am sure MCDS\r\n\r\nwill also tell us that the role of dealing with the issue\r\n\r\nis  not  theirs alone.  Certainly, parents  must  play  a\r\n\r\npart.  The Children and Young Persons Act was amended  in\r\n\r\n2001  to  allow courts to instruct parents to be involved\r\n\r\nin  the  rehabilitation process  of  children.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard, I would like to ask the Minister how many parents\r\n\r\nhave been involved in the rehabilitation process of their\r\n\r\nchildren since the amendment of the Act took effect.  Are\r\n\r\nboth  parents actively involved in the rehabilitation  or\r\n\r\nonly  the mothers are involved, with the fathers  missing\r\n\r\nagain?   What are some of the problems that MCDS face  in\r\n\r\ngetting  parents  to  be involved in  the  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprocess?   How  are  these  problems  overcome,  and  how\r\n\r\nsuccessful have these efforts been?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the plight of many young teenage\r\n\r\nmothers in the US dependent on the Government for aid and\r\n\r\ncontinuing  the poverty cycle.  We cannot allow  this  to\r\n\r\nhappen  to our youth.  They are our future, and we cannot\r\n\r\nallow  them to ruin their own future and, in that regard,\r\n\r\nour country's future.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, like my\r\n\r\ncolleague before me, Dr Maliki, I am also concerned about\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the figures released by the Police recently\r\n\r\nshowed  that the number of juveniles arrested  last  year\r\n\r\nrose  by  an  alarming 55.8%.  More than 2,200  juveniles\r\n\r\nwere  arrested, with students forming the bulk  of  those\r\n\r\narrested.   The number of juveniles arrested for  rioting\r\n\r\nincreased  by  138.7%  to  179 persons,  and  for  simple\r\n\r\nthefts,  the number arrested increased by 116.6%  to  483\r\n\r\njuveniles.  It was estimated that 85% of these  juveniles\r\n\r\narrested  were first-time offenders.  Addressing juvenile\r\n\r\ncrimes cannot just be the concern of the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by Dr Maliki, the parents, the educators and\r\n\r\nthe  community  must all play a part  in  instilling  the\r\n\r\nright values in our youths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-ministerial Committee on Youth Crime has\r\n\r\nbeen in existence for a number of years already. Are  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations and the initiatives of this Committee and\r\n\r\nthe programmes of the many agencies that are involved  in\r\n\r\nyouth    activities   preventive   enough?     Are    our\r\n\r\ninterventions reaching out to youths at risk early enough\r\n\r\nbefore  it becomes a crime statistic?  Could the Minister\r\n\r\ntell  us  what  new  initiatives  his  Ministry  will  be\r\n\r\nundertaking to arrest the rising youth crime rate?  Is he\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  there  is  enough  coordination  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries  and agencies to  effectively  tackle\r\n\r\nthis urgent problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore has undergone major changes in the economy,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in  our  social structure over the  last  three\r\n\r\nyears.  In  fact,  there are also major  changes  in  the\r\n\r\nregion and around the world.  These are tumultuous times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the outbreak of the Iraqi war, the world will\r\n\r\nonce  again be plunged into another crisis and it is  yet\r\n\r\nuncertain how it will eventually turn out.  One thing  is\r\n\r\nfor sure - more changes in the world can be expected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amidst all these major changes, I am concerned\r\n\r\nthat   our  younger  generation,  which  grew  up  in   a\r\n\r\nrelatively secure and prosperous environment, may not  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for the challenges that are coming  their  way.\r\n\r\nThey  may  be somewhat detached, somewhat indifferent  to\r\n\r\nthe  happenings in the world.  On the other hand,  trends\r\n\r\nin  juvenile crime are most worrying. The statistics that\r\n\r\nare shared by Mr Charles Chong a while ago tell us why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to do more to help our youths and help\r\n\r\nprepare them for the future.  We need to understand their\r\n\r\naspirations  and their concerns. We need to  engage  them\r\n\r\nand give them a clear\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsense of direction and purpose. Our youth programmes  and\r\n\r\nactivities must be relevant to them.  We must  help  them\r\n\r\nstay connected and stay out of trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  if  he  could elaborate on the youth  programme\r\n\r\nthat  comes  under his Ministry. What are the main  focus\r\n\r\nand objectives of the youth programme?  How do we measure\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness  of  the programme  in   engaging  our\r\n\r\nyouths  and  preparing  them for the  challenges  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture?   How  do we reach out to the youths  to  involve\r\n\r\nthem in the programme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the spirit of remaking, I would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest to the Minister to consider undertaking a\r\n\r\nthorough  review  of  the youth programme  to  ensure  it\r\n\r\nremains  effective and relevant.  The  review  should  be\r\n\r\nconducted  by the young people for the young people.   In\r\n\r\nthis way, we can ensure that the outcome will be relevant\r\n\r\nto  them.   As  I  am no longer young,  it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  for  me to propose what  the  review  should\r\n\r\ninvolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to propose to the Government\r\n\r\nto  consider appointing a Minister or a Minister of State\r\n\r\nto  be  in  charge  of  youth development.   He  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  spearheading new initiatives  aimed  at\r\n\r\nengaging  our  youths. This will provide greater  mandate\r\n\r\nand sharper focus on the youth programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I am quite happy to receive this MCDS booklet on\r\n\r\n\"Key  Social  Statistics - Singapore 2002\" recently.   On\r\n\r\nits  back  page, it has 19 toll-free hotlines to  various\r\n\r\nservices that Ministries offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I cannot seem to find a crisis hotline\r\n\r\nnumber.   Is there no such service or is the service  not\r\n\r\nimportant?  I remember that a crisis hotline is available\r\n\r\nand  widely  publicised inside army  camps  for  soldiers\r\n\r\nhaving problems in crisis or feeling suicidal.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  that service counselling hotline has been effective\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreducing suicides for soldiers having suicidal thoughts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When citizens are faced with violence, crime or\r\n\r\ndisorder,  they know how to call \"999\".  When faced  with\r\n\r\nfire  or  the  outbreak of fires, they know how  to  call\r\n\r\n\"995\".   But  when overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness\r\n\r\nand  contemplating suicide, there is no  easy  number  to\r\n\r\ncall  to  for  help.  An easy to remember hotline  number\r\n\r\nlike  \"444\"  or  in Chinese, \"si, si, si\", meaning  \"die,\r\n\r\ndie, die\" should be made available for citizens in crisis\r\n\r\nto   call   to  for  help,  especially  when   they   are\r\n\r\ncontemplating  suicide.  Manned by  trained  professional\r\n\r\ncounsellors, such a last call for help could be a  matter\r\n\r\nof  life  and death for that suicidal person, overwhelmed\r\n\r\nby that sense of helplessness and loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand that such crisis helplines are\r\n\r\nprovided  by VWOs, like the SOS, the number is not  well-publicised  nor  easily remembered.  An  easy-to-remember\r\n\r\nand  well-publicised national helpline number  should  be\r\n\r\nset  up  to  supplement the works of the VWOs.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  critical  in  these difficult  times,  as  we\r\n\r\nobserve a higher incidence of elderly suicides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry can look into this request and\r\n\r\nprovide this additional and important service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I thank Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki for raising some of the issues.  Let me take  them\r\n\r\none at a time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we would know, Family Service Centres (FSCs) are\r\n\r\nneighbourhood-based  focal  points  of  family  resource.\r\n\r\nThey  provide  services such as casework and counselling,\r\n\r\ninformation and referral, and family education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCDS supports 35 Family Service Centres island-wide. One more FSC will start operating in Chua Chu Kang\r\n\r\nthis   year.  Each  FSC  serves  an  average  of   20,000\r\n\r\nhouseholds  within a neighbourhood. Last year,  the  FSCs\r\n\r\nserved  an  average of one out of every  five  households\r\n\r\nwithin their service boundary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance the effectiveness of the FSCs, my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  together with the National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService   (NCSS),  introduced  the  Programme  Evaluation\r\n\r\nSystem  (PES)  and Customer Satisfaction Surveys  in  all\r\n\r\nFSCs  in 2001.  Sir, I am pleased to report that  80%  of\r\n\r\nthe FSCs have met the standards set by MCDS and NCSS.  We\r\n\r\nare currently working with NCSS and FSCs to develop a set\r\n\r\nof best practices and service quality standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the standards, we expect FSC\r\n\r\nservices to be open to all families, regardless of socio-economic  class  or race or religion.  Our  records  show\r\n\r\nthat FSCs' clients generally do not face language barrier\r\n\r\nwhen  seeking  help from FSCs.  Moreover, we  expect  all\r\n\r\nfunded  FSCs  to  operate  on a  secular  basis  to  help\r\n\r\nfamilies who come to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some family service providers\r\n\r\nwhich  do not receive funding from MCDS.  They have  been\r\n\r\nset  up  as  community initiatives to serve the  specific\r\n\r\nneeds of their target group in the locality.  My Ministry\r\n\r\ndoes  not monitor them. However, they will have to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  meet  the  needs of  their  constituents  who\r\n\r\nsupport  their programmes.  My Ministry and the  National\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Social Service will be most happy  to  advise\r\n\r\nand  work  with  the  providers to better  improve  their\r\n\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not go into the details of the\r\n\r\nProgramme  Evaluation System. I would be  most  happy  to\r\n\r\nprovide this to Dr Maliki, and there are about eight FSCs\r\n\r\nknown  to MCDS which are not funded by MCDS but  some  of\r\n\r\nthem  are funded through NCSS. So, there is a way for  us\r\n\r\nto   work   with  them  on  how  we  can  improve   their\r\n\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of domestic violence, I am glad that Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki  sees it as a form of terrorism.  I would be  most\r\n\r\nhappy  to  provide  some of the specific  details  to  Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki's  questions.   But let me  address  some  of  the\r\n\r\nconcerns on a more general note.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki's questions about domestic violence centre\r\n\r\non three main areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirstly, the trend in domestic violence in the last  five\r\n\r\nyears; secondly, how Police handle domestic violence; and\r\n\r\nthirdly, how cases of non-spousal violence are handled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, between 1998 and 2002, the number of Personal\r\n\r\nProtection Order (PPO) applications averaged 2,866  cases\r\n\r\nper  year.   More than half (about 52%) are  issued  with\r\n\r\nPPOs.  The number of breach of PPOs averaged at 147 cases\r\n\r\nper  year.  The  average  number  of  persons  placed  on\r\n\r\ncounselling  is 770 per year.  I would just like  to  add\r\n\r\nthat  as a result of the downturn, the number of casework\r\n\r\nand  counselling cases that we have seen through the FSCs\r\n\r\nfor 2001 was 10,300 and it went up to 11,200 families  in\r\n\r\n2002.  This is an increase of 9%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaches of PPOs are considered offences and the\r\n\r\nperpetrator  is  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine   or\r\n\r\nimprisonment or both. The Police investigate all cases of\r\n\r\nbreach  and either issue warnings or put the perpetrators\r\n\r\nin  the lock-up.  For persistent perpetrators, the Police\r\n\r\nwill institute prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPOs for children are also available to protect them\r\n\r\nfrom  adult  perpetrators, without having to remove  them\r\n\r\nfrom  their  homes.  And in the case of severe  violence,\r\n\r\nthe  Police will not hesitate to apply the Penal Code  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  perpetrator to task.  So the example  of  the\r\n\r\nAustralian practice that Dr Maliki gave, we already  have\r\n\r\nthe provision for the Police to handle such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As research has shown that not all perpetrators or\r\n\r\nvictims  benefit  from counselling, there  is  a  set  of\r\n\r\ncriteria  to  screen out those who are less  amenable  to\r\n\r\ncounselling.    Their   outcomes   of   counselling   are\r\n\r\nmonitored,  and  these  will  be  reviewed  against   the\r\n\r\ncriteria to ensure that it is indeed targeting those  who\r\n\r\nwill  turn over a new leaf with counselling. As Dr Maliki\r\n\r\nis  aware, we adopt a multi-agency approach in addressing\r\n\r\ndomestic   violence.   The  established  Family  Violence\r\n\r\nDialogue  Group  and Networking System allows  anyone  to\r\n\r\naccess help through any of the agencies that they get  in\r\n\r\ntouch with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system also focuses on preventing domestic\r\n\r\nviolence through on-going public awareness and education.\r\n\r\nThe  latest  effort  in  public education,  for  example,\r\n\r\naddresses dating violence as a preventive measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to learn from other countries\r\n\r\non  how  to  address domestic violence and what  measures\r\n\r\nwork  and what do not, so that our efforts will  help  to\r\n\r\nreduce violence in the families, as also mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the protocol and the specific\r\n\r\nquestions   regarding  Police  action,  I   think   these\r\n\r\nquestions  can  be  directed  to  the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.   I will be most happy to assist the  Member  to\r\n\r\nredirect  the questions to MHA for us to provide  a  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  answer on some of the queries  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen raised by the Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the points raised by Dr Maliki,\r\n\r\nMr  Gan  and  Mr  Charles Chong regarding our  youth  and\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquents.  Youth, aged  10-30  years,  forms\r\n\r\nabout 28% of our population.  We must see how we can help\r\n\r\nthem  develop  their potential and mature  into  socially\r\n\r\nresponsible  citizens, with a strong sense  of  belonging\r\n\r\nand rootedness in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like youths the world over, our young people are of\r\n\r\na  diverse  group, with different needs,  depending  upon\r\n\r\ntheir  age,  education  and interests.   As  Mr  Gan  has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  their  aspirations  and  expectations  are\r\n\r\nchanging  rapidly and are quite different from  those  of\r\n\r\nthe older generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we engage our youths must therefore be tailored\r\n\r\nto the segment that we want to reach. Thus, many players,\r\n\r\nGovernment,   non-government  and  even  private   sector\r\n\r\norganisations,  are  involved in a wide  range  of  youth\r\n\r\nprogrammes today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong, Mr Gan and Dr Maliki have expressed\r\n\r\nconcerns about juvenile delinquency.  Dr Maliki has  also\r\n\r\nraised about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteenage pregnancies, out-of-school youths and families at\r\n\r\nrisk.   Over the last five years, about 2% of  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of births were from teenage mothers.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nassure   Dr  Maliki  that  the  numbers  have  not   been\r\n\r\nincreasing.  In fact, it decreased from 953  in  2000  to\r\n\r\n849  in  2002.   Nevertheless, MCDS,  together  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  partners,  will continue to  conduct  relevant\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  target  both the  teenagers  and  their\r\n\r\nparents.  For  example, we have two  sexuality  education\r\n\r\nprogrammes, which I have mentioned earlier, that  promote\r\n\r\nabstinence until marriage and are designed to help people\r\n\r\ndevelop  positive character traits and to assist  parents\r\n\r\nto work with their teenagers on sexuality issues.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for juvenile delinquency, the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  has  responded earlier that the  rise  in  youth\r\n\r\ncrime is part of the overall increase in crime rate.   We\r\n\r\nagree that juvenile delinquency, problems of families  at\r\n\r\nrisk, and out-of-school youths are best addressed through\r\n\r\na  coordinated inter-agency approach.  That  is  the  key\r\n\r\nfocus  of  the  Inter-Ministry Committee on  Youth  Crime\r\n\r\n(IMYC)  chaired by Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee.  As  further\r\n\r\nsupport  of a coordinated approach, my Ministry  is  also\r\n\r\nworking  with our strategic partners to build  integrated\r\n\r\ncase management systems.  The systems will enable service\r\n\r\nproviders  to  consult  with each  other  on  the  common\r\n\r\nfamilies  whom they are working with.  This  will  reduce\r\n\r\nduplication   of   work  and  ensure  there   is   better\r\n\r\ncoordination among the service providers.  Of course, the\r\n\r\nprinciple of confidentiality will govern the workings  of\r\n\r\nthe systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry agrees with Dr Maliki on the\r\n\r\nimportance of identifying and helping potential premature\r\n\r\nschool-leavers. For pupils who have persistent  tardiness\r\n\r\nor truancy, the schools will undertake a pastoral role in\r\n\r\nproviding advice and counselling.  Schools may also refer\r\n\r\nsuch  pupils  to  external agencies,  such  as  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  or  voluntary  welfare  organisations  for  their\r\n\r\nassistance.   Programmes, such as Project Reach  and  PAL\r\n\r\nare coordinated efforts by various\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagencies targeted at early school-leavers who are at risk\r\n\r\nyouths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Children and Young Persons Act was amended\r\n\r\nin  October 2001, parents of about 124 juvenile offenders\r\n\r\nhave  been given mandatory orders.  We are in the process\r\n\r\nof   assessing   whether   such  mandatory   orders   are\r\n\r\nsuccessful.   The assessment will focus on whether  there\r\n\r\nis  an improvement on the parent/child relationship.   In\r\n\r\nour  preliminary studies, we are encouraged to hear  from\r\n\r\nthe  parents that they are now better equipped to  manage\r\n\r\nand communicate with their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mr Charles Chong have asked\r\n\r\nhow  we  can effectively engage our young.  The  National\r\n\r\nYouth Council aims to empower mainstream youths with  the\r\n\r\nvalues  and the skills to thrive and succeed in a  global\r\n\r\nworld.   It  engages youths by giving them the  space  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and allowing them to form their own views through\r\n\r\nexperiential learning.  The Council supports  youths  and\r\n\r\nyouth organisations through grants, awards, national  and\r\n\r\ninternational  programmes.  For example,  it  administers\r\n\r\nthe  Youth  Development Fund which provides  youths  with\r\n\r\nseed  funding  to  run  community programmes.   NYC  also\r\n\r\nsupports the Youth Expedition Project (YEP), where youths\r\n\r\nundertake  community projects in the regional  countries.\r\n\r\nThrough  the project, youths would have the opportunities\r\n\r\nto  reflect on issues concerning the economic, social and\r\n\r\ncultural developments of the country that they visit,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as Singapore.  Both programmes encourage youths  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  leap  to initiate and develop their  areas  of\r\n\r\npotential and interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan and Mr Chong would appreciate that the impact\r\n\r\nof many of these programmes would only be felt over time.\r\n\r\nSo  where possible, proxy or interim indicators have been\r\n\r\nused  to  measure their effectiveness, and these  include\r\n\r\nindicators   such  as  the  outreach  of  the  programme,\r\n\r\ncompletion  rate,  and participants'  evaluation  of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Periodic youth surveys are done which provide\r\n\r\ninsight as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  whether we are moving towards our objective.  Let  me\r\n\r\nshare with Members one example in which Mendaki has  been\r\n\r\nable  to  reach  out  to  a  group  of  youths  who   are\r\n\r\nundertaking  a  project  under the  NYC,  called  Service\r\n\r\nLearning.   We  have  matched that  particular  group  of\r\n\r\nyouths  or  young Singaporeans to run a reading programme\r\n\r\nfor   low  income  families.   These  are  some  of   the\r\n\r\ninitiatives  that  are in place to  help  us  engage  the\r\n\r\nyouths  so  that  they  understand better  what  are  the\r\n\r\nchallenges facing Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan also asked if we would review and revamp\r\n\r\nmajor  youth  programmes.  I would  like  to  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember   that   all   major   programmes   are   reviewed\r\n\r\nperiodically.  What is more critical is whether there are\r\n\r\ngaps in the way we look at youth issues today, given  the\r\n\r\ncomplexity  of  the  subject  and  the  numerous  players\r\n\r\ninvolved.  We must ensure that our existing policies  are\r\n\r\nin  line  and new policies are introduced, if  necessary.\r\n\r\nRelevant  programmes can then follow.  So, with  this  in\r\n\r\nmind, last year my Ministry formed a committee chaired by\r\n\r\nmy  Permanent Secretary, Ms Lim Soo Hoon, sitting  there,\r\n\r\nand  involving officials from MOE, MHA, MINDEF, NYC,  MOF\r\n\r\nand  PA.   I want to point to Ms Lim because Mr Gan  said\r\n\r\nthat  the committee should be chaired by a young  person.\r\n\r\nShe  is  indeed young, in fact, younger than I am.   This\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  review  and  coordinate  existing  youth\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  identify gaps and propose  new  policies  or\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  as appropriate.  As the Committee  is  still\r\n\r\nnew, let us give it some time to do its work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the issues.\r\n\r\nMay I invite Minister of State, Mr Chan,  to reply to  Mr\r\n\r\nChia's question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before Mr Chan replies, Dr Maliki has\r\n\r\ngot something to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Just a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

We do  have\r\n\r\ntwo  national  helplines.  One is by  the  Samaritans  of\r\n\r\nSingapore (SOS).  The number is 1800-221-4444.   This  is\r\n\r\nfor   people  who  feel  desperate,  discouraged  or   in\r\n\r\ndistress,  in  other  words,  with  suicidal  tendencies.\r\n\r\nEvery  year, they receive about 37,000 calls.  About  90%\r\n\r\nare non-suicidal and they very often refer these cases to\r\n\r\nother  agencies.   The  other helpline  is  the  National\r\n\r\nFamily Centre hotline.  It is 1800-838-0100.  This is for\r\n\r\npeople  with any social problems and who need  help  from\r\n\r\nFamily Service Centres.  We will accept the point  by  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve   Chia  that  both  these  numbers  can  be  better\r\n\r\npublicised  and  we  will look into  how  we  can  better\r\n\r\npublicise these numbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, the Committee on Sporting\r\n\r\nSingapore  (CoSS) was formed some years ago and  included\r\n\r\nthree Ministers and a Senior Minister of State.  The CoSS\r\n\r\nmade  a  number of recommendations to create  a  sporting\r\n\r\npopulation.   Could the Minister give an  update  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber of recommendations that have been implemented  and\r\n\r\nalso  when  will  the  rest  of  the  recommendations  be\r\n\r\nimplemented?   In  particular, what  are  we  doing  with\r\n\r\nregard   to  participation  rather  than  excellence   in\r\n\r\ncompetition  alone, as there are many health benefits  to\r\n\r\nthose who exercise regularly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, we recognise that sports\r\n\r\nexcellence  is an important means to help our  people  to\r\n\r\nbond  as  a  nation.  To the credit of the Government  we\r\n\r\nhave embarked on various programmes to that end.  We have\r\n\r\ngone  some  way  towards improving some selected  sports,\r\n\r\nincluding  table tennis, bowling and bodybuilding.   Yet,\r\n\r\ndespite  our  efforts,  and with imported  talents,  that\r\n\r\nfirst  Olympic gold medal still eludes us.   We  used  to\r\n\r\nthink that our ability\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  excel  is  constrained by the size of our population.\r\n\r\nHowever,  that seems like a fallacious argument as  there\r\n\r\nare many other nations that are of the size of Singapore,\r\n\r\nor  even  smaller, that have gone on to  sporting  glory,\r\n\r\nwhile all we can claim for our sporting glory is our  own\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Howe Liang.  He won our only Olympic medal  more\r\n\r\nthan 40 years ago.  I would like to ask the Minister  for\r\n\r\na realistic assessment of our potential to achieve world-class status in selected sports.  Are we not hindered  in\r\n\r\nour approach by requiring sporting talents and potentials\r\n\r\nto  be  scholars as well?  Will the Minister please  tell\r\n\r\nthis House what else the Government is planning to do  to\r\n\r\nensure that our vision of sports excellence will come  to\r\n\r\npass?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may take a leaf out of the Australian\r\n\r\ngovernment's  book.  In the Australian Sports  Commission\r\n\r\nStrategic  Plan 2000-2005, it said that it will  continue\r\n\r\nto  improve  programmes  for  elite  athletes  to  ensure\r\n\r\nAustralians  remain  in  the  vanguard  of  international\r\n\r\nsports.  At the same time, it said that it was to develop\r\n\r\nnew  sources  of  income through effective  marketing  of\r\n\r\nproducts and services and an increase in support from the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  For the first point, I believe  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  on the right track.  The Government has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  working to change the mindsets of Singaporeans that\r\n\r\nsports  can  provide  an equally good alternative  career\r\n\r\npath.  Our insistence on some minimum academic standards,\r\n\r\nhowever,  as  was indicated recently, may  count  against\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is less well known - that sports\r\n\r\nneeds  a large amount of funding.  The Government  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  only one to fund this national effort.   We\r\n\r\nought  to  have  a  commercial strategy to  fund  already\r\n\r\npopular  sports  that have a following in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthere should be concerted efforts to promote sports as  a\r\n\r\nworthwhile corporate expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, we ought to have more role models besides\r\n\r\nFandi  and perhaps Mr Tan Howe Liang.  We need  stars  to\r\n\r\nbring attention of our people to sports and this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  quality that we can tap.  This will not only serve\r\n\r\nas  a  public  relations tool but also  an  easy  way  to\r\n\r\ninspire  and  encourage younger Singaporeans to  identify\r\n\r\nwith sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, I agree that funding is a very\r\n\r\nimportant point.  But perhaps a broad base of support for\r\n\r\nsports  from  the population is just as important.   From\r\n\r\nthe perspective of myself, someone who only started being\r\n\r\nactive  in  sports in my secondary school  years,  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  the following, and I must say that this is  also\r\n\r\nbased on observations of Australia:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, start them young. Again I make the plea\r\n\r\nfor  a  broad-based participative approach  even  at  the\r\n\r\nprimary school years, especially since we know that  many\r\n\r\nparents  and  grandparents have a rather  over-protective\r\n\r\nattitude  towards their children, while others  may  feel\r\n\r\nthat this is a waste of time, which could be better spent\r\n\r\non studies and assessment books.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would say that we should not forget the\r\n\r\nparents  and the adults because active parents,  who  are\r\n\r\nthemselves  into sports, are more likely to  be  able  to\r\n\r\npersuade the young children to take up sports.   Or,  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  already  have sporting talent,  to  encourage\r\n\r\ntheir children and give them the practical support needed\r\n\r\nfor  them  to develop, such as bringing them to the  5-11\r\n\r\ntraining  sessions  a  week, if we  really  want  to  get\r\n\r\nsporting excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would say, do not forget the young\r\n\r\npeople.   We  have  often lamented the  fact  that  young\r\n\r\npeople  tend to be rather inactive once they start  their\r\n\r\nworking  years.   But we must remember that  things  like\r\n\r\nextreme sports, golf, triathlon and trail biking and even\r\n\r\nrock  climbing,  tend to be taken up by  people  who  are\r\n\r\nolder   teenagers  or  young  working   adults.    Having\r\n\r\nopportunities  for these young people to learn  and  take\r\n\r\npart  in these sports would also give them an opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  interaction and, hopefully, this might  lead  on  to\r\n\r\nmarriage.   So  you will have a synergy  of  the  various\r\n\r\nagencies within the MCDS where SDU might\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually  end  up  being  a synergistic  agency  for  the\r\n\r\nsporting excellence for Singapore agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, when I read about the\r\n\r\nGovernment's world-wide advertisement campaign to promote\r\n\r\nSingapore, I immediately looked up the posters  published\r\n\r\nin  some of the British and American media.  The campaign\r\n\r\nprofiles  seven personalities.  It includes  jazz  singer\r\n\r\nand   actress  Jacinta  Abisheganaden,  fashion  designer\r\n\r\nAndrew  Gan, SSO Music Director Liang Shui, and  some  of\r\n\r\nthe other personalities from the science and technologies\r\n\r\nfield.   I  looked in vain for a sports figure but  there\r\n\r\nwas none.  Apparently, we have none to boast about to the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made some steps towards sports\r\n\r\nexcellence, one which I applaud is the move to set up the\r\n\r\nfirst Government Sports School to develop budding talents\r\n\r\nin the sports arena.  But the announcement of the minimum\r\n\r\ncriterion that it needs an academic criterion,  which  is\r\n\r\nExpress stream as a minimum admission criterion,  to  me,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  seem to be a step forward.  If  you  use  this\r\n\r\nyardstick,  sports talents such as Fandi would  not  have\r\n\r\nmade it.  He was from ITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, each of us has different gifts and talents.\r\n\r\nSome  who  excel  in  sports may not  be  good  in  their\r\n\r\nstudies.   Of  course, some athletes can  excel  in  both\r\n\r\ntheir  studies and sports but, more often than  not,  for\r\n\r\nmost  top  athletes  who are serious about  excelling  in\r\n\r\nsports,  something has to give.  And, if  they  chose  to\r\n\r\nexcel  in sports, it often means that what will give  are\r\n\r\ntheir  other  aspects of life, including  being  good  in\r\n\r\ntheir studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be quite focused about what we hope to\r\n\r\nachieve in the Sports School.  The stated mission of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Sports  School  is  to  develop   Singapore's\r\n\r\npromising  sportsmen  and sportswomen  to  their  fullest\r\n\r\npotential.   It  aims  to  raise  the  level  of   sports\r\n\r\nexcellence achievements in Singapore, and the stated hope\r\n\r\nis  that this will help us to reach the Government's goal\r\n\r\nof becoming one of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by\r\n\r\n2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this aim in mind, I feel that the Sports\r\n\r\nSchool  should  not  be run like an academic  institution\r\n\r\nwhich  puts  grades  first,  where  there  must  be  some\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  academic qualifications.  We should  allow\r\n\r\nTechnical  and  Academic stream  students  who  excel  in\r\n\r\nsports  equal opportunity to enter the Sports School  and\r\n\r\nto  maximise their sporting talents and to contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in this way, not on a case-by-case basis,  but\r\n\r\nas a rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I think that if we are serious about\r\n\r\nproducing  world-class athletes, we  should  take  sports\r\n\r\nexcellence a step further.  We should go all the way  and\r\n\r\nset  up a sports institute for elite athletes.  This will\r\n\r\nbe where all the sporting needs of elite athletes will be\r\n\r\ntaken  care  of.  It is like the Sports School,  but  for\r\n\r\nnational  athletes  who are recognised  by  the  relevant\r\n\r\nnational  sporting bodies, elite or potential  elite.   A\r\n\r\ngood  model  that  we should look at  is  the  Australian\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Sports (AIS).  It leads the development  of\r\n\r\nelite sports and is widely acknowledged in Australia  and\r\n\r\ninternationally as the world's best practised  model  for\r\n\r\nelite   athlete  development.   It  offers   scholarships\r\n\r\nannually to about 700 athletes.  The Institute was set up\r\n\r\nfollowing  the disappointing results from the  Australian\r\n\r\nteam  at  the  1976 Montreal Olympics.  But  since  then,\r\n\r\nsince  the  development of AIS, Australia has made  great\r\n\r\nstrides  in  its sporting talents.  Indeed, in  the  2000\r\n\r\nSydney  Olympics Games, the athletes that came  from  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  contributed to more than half  of  the  medals\r\n\r\nthat were won in the Sydney Olympics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The athletes also get help to make sure that there\r\n\r\nis  life after sports.  One of our main concerns is  that\r\n\r\nif  we train them in sports, would they have a life after\r\n\r\nsports,  whether they can get jobs?  So I am saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  AIS  is  not an academic institution  but,  however,\r\n\r\nthere  is  help  to make sure that they have  life  after\r\n\r\nsports, they have to take technical or academic course or\r\n\r\nfind suitable full-time or part-time employment.  I would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister  to  consider  setting  up  a  sports\r\n\r\ninstitute  to  help  us make our mark  in  the  world  of\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, following the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Sporting Singapore Report, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  earmarked $500 million under the Athletes Career and\r\n\r\nTraining  scheme to boost sports.  I spoke at  length  on\r\n\r\nthis subject last year, but I also pointed out that since\r\n\r\nthis  sum was being spread over three objectives, namely,\r\n\r\nachieving  sports  excellence, sports  for  all  and  the\r\n\r\nnurturing of a sports industry, the sum just appeared  to\r\n\r\nbe too little.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am one who would, in fact, advocate more money\r\n\r\nthan  what we have earmarked annually for sports, so that\r\n\r\nwe  can attain our dreams of achieving sports excellence.\r\n\r\nBut  I  was  a  bit surprised when I heard  the  Minister\r\n\r\nannounce  a  few  weeks ago that a  $650  million  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex  will  be  built  in  Kallang  comprising  a  new\r\n\r\nstadium, a new indoor stadium as well as offices,  shops,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and other recreational facilities.   We  are\r\n\r\ntold  that  the  two new stadiums can also  be  used  for\r\n\r\nevents  such  as concerts.  And all these  are  meant  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the new complex will be for  multi-use  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  complex will be a lively place the whole  year\r\n\r\nround, and not just when there are sports events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that this is a case of putting the cart\r\n\r\nbefore  the horse.  We will be spending so much money  on\r\n\r\nhardware  that  we  will not have enough  money  for  the\r\n\r\nsoftware  which,  to  me,  is  more  important,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nnurturing and development of sports talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore already has 13 stadiums, 12 public sports\r\n\r\nhalls, one indoor stadium.  Our present National Stadium,\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  1974,  can seat 55,000 persons.   In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nremember  that  in  one Malaysia Cup match  in  1974,  we\r\n\r\nactually  squeezed in 70,000 people.   The  new  proposed\r\n\r\nstadium will seat approximately 50,000 people, about  the\r\n\r\nsame number as what the existing one caters for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new stadium, I agree, can make use of the\r\n\r\nlatest technology and we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave the latest facilities.  One that is often used as an\r\n\r\nexample of the latest is the Sapporo Dome in Japan  which\r\n\r\nwas  used in the World Cup last year.  This one  has  the\r\n\r\nlatest works  -  one field inside the stadium, one  field\r\n\r\noutside  the  stadium,  so  that  during  matches,   they\r\n\r\nactually move the outdoor field into the stadium so  that\r\n\r\nplayers  play under the best conditions.  But right  now,\r\n\r\nthey  are  wondering how to earn enough to maintain  this\r\n\r\nstadium, just as both Korea and Japan are wondering  what\r\n\r\nthey  are going to do with all the 20 stadiums they built\r\n\r\nto  host the World Cup, and they spent $131/2 billion  on\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same too for Sydney Homebush Stadium, the home\r\n\r\nof  the  2000  Olympics.   Even  Malaysia's  Bukit  Jalil\r\n\r\nStadium, built for the Commonwealth Games in 1998, has  a\r\n\r\nproblem  to  cover its operating costs of RM2  million  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  Unless we plan to host the Commonwealth Games  or\r\n\r\nAsian  Games,  in  which case building just  one  stadium\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  enough, I am not so  sure  what  the  new\r\n\r\nstadium hopes to achieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we really need a complex with more shops,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and  more office space to compete  with  the\r\n\r\npresent glut?  We already have eight million square  feet\r\n\r\nof  empty  office space at the moment.  Are there  really\r\n\r\nthat many pop concerts that can fill a stadium of such  a\r\n\r\ncapacity?   Are  there  not  already  enough  venues   in\r\n\r\nSingapore for such non-sporting activities?  Do we really\r\n\r\nbelieve  that it will be such a vibrant sports  hub  that\r\n\r\nfamilies  will flock there all the time?  I do not  think\r\n\r\nwe  have  the  critical mass to keep  this  going.   Most\r\n\r\nlikely, it will turn out to be a ghost town.  Sir,  there\r\n\r\nare  better  ways to spend $650 million in  the  name  of\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Associations have complained\r\n\r\nthat the $500 million in the ACT hardly trickles down  to\r\n\r\nthem,  and they are the ones who need the money  most  to\r\n\r\nnurture  sports talent.  Why can we not look at providing\r\n\r\nmore  facilities for the Sports School, and I  will  have\r\n\r\nmore  to say about this later so that more talent can  be\r\n\r\nnurtured.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, your time is almost up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> I am summing up, Sir. If we have\r\n\r\nthis  $650  million  to  spend,  let  us  spend  it  more\r\n\r\nsensibly, so that we can really develop sports talent and\r\n\r\nproduce sports heroes.  Otherwise, the rationale given is\r\n\r\njust  wishful thinking, and I think we will probably  end\r\n\r\nup  with the eighth wonder of Singapore!  Sir, I  am  all\r\n\r\nfor putting more money for sports excellence but, in this\r\n\r\ncase, I fear that we are putting our wrong foot forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the vision\r\n\r\nof  a  sporting  Singapore  has  brought  much  hope  and\r\n\r\nexcitement about the future of sports.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  how the additional  $500  million  in\r\n\r\nsupport of sports has been allocated to support the three\r\n\r\npillars  of  a  sporting  Singapore,  which  are   sports\r\n\r\nexcellence, sports for all and sports industry.  And  how\r\n\r\nmuch  of  it has been disbursed and are we on  target  to\r\n\r\nachieve the objective of the three pillars?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports School is a critical component of the\r\n\r\nstrategic plan for Singapore to become the top 10 nations\r\n\r\nin Asia by 2010.  It will nurture our top talents so that\r\n\r\nthey  will become champions and, at the same time,  offer\r\n\r\nthem an opportunity to excel in life through sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Sports School will also bring about\r\n\r\na  mindset change and a clear message that we also  value\r\n\r\nsports   talents,   not  just  linguistic   and   logical\r\n\r\nmathematical  intelligence.  Therefore, I  would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat we should avoid admission criteria that put academic\r\n\r\nresults  first and sports talent second, to the exclusion\r\n\r\nof our top talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 165 secondary schools in Singapore that\r\n\r\nput academic results first, and rightly so.  But a sports\r\n\r\nschool  is  a  sports school, and perhaps  sports  talent\r\n\r\nshould  come  first.  Just imagine a sports  school  that\r\n\r\nrejects top talents like Fandi Ahmad and Andrew Fang, but\r\n\r\nperhaps  accept  lesser  talent  like  myself  who  could\r\n\r\nprobably make the Express stream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask about the criteria for\r\n\r\nsports to be included in the Sports\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSchool.   For  example, how would netball  contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore becoming the top 10 in Asia when only a handful\r\n\r\nof  Asian countries play netball and is never included in\r\n\r\nthe  Asian Games and appeared only once in the SEA  Games\r\n\r\nin  Kuala  Lumpur  in  2001?  Sir,  I  must  say  that  I\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  support  the  promotion  of  netball   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But  the Sports School  must  not  lose  its\r\n\r\nstrategic  focus  and be over stretched  in  its  limited\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that when considering sports science and\r\n\r\nsports  medicine  support, the Sports  School  will  also\r\n\r\nsynergise with NIE and the Singapore Sports Council, both\r\n\r\nof  which have built considerable expertise in this area,\r\n\r\nso that there will be no wasteful duplication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many Singaporeans, I am overjoyed that a sports\r\n\r\nhub  will be built in Kallang.  It will become a thriving\r\n\r\ncentre  for  our  citizens  and  a  hub  for  our  sports\r\n\r\nindustry.  It should be a public facility that will cater\r\n\r\nto  the National Day Parade, mega events and future major\r\n\r\ngames.   I hope that the public will be invited  to  give\r\n\r\ninputs  on  its  development.  It should  be  built  with\r\n\r\npassion  and  not  just numbers.  And together  with  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade,  it could make Singapore the lifestyle  centre\r\n\r\nof Asia, just like Monte Carlo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Code of Governance for the\r\n\r\nnational  sports  associations, as it would  bring  about\r\n\r\nmore  professional management and greater  accountability\r\n\r\nfor  the  good  of  sports promotion.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nenquire about the progress of its introduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you can take your\r\n\r\ntwo cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Much\r\n\r\nobliged, Sir.

In the old days, I remember the late\r\n\r\nMr  E W Barker always wanted to be a Minister for Sports,\r\n\r\nbut  there  was no such Ministry.  And I hope with  that,\r\n\r\nthe  standard of sports should increase in Singapore, not\r\n\r\nonly  at  the local regional level but also international\r\n\r\nlevel.   In  that  connection, has the  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil or the Ministry as a whole done enough to promote\r\n\r\nsports  persons at the national and international levels?\r\n\r\nWhat  are the incentives and what are the steps taken  to\r\n\r\nremove  the  disincentives?  We had,  in  the  old  days,\r\n\r\nsportsmen  and  sportswomen  in  the  50s  and   60s   in\r\n\r\nbadminton, weightlifting, hockey and athletics. I hope we\r\n\r\nwill bring back the glorious days soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned, Sir, on the admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  for Sports School, I think it is important  for\r\n\r\nus  not  to be too idealistic in wanting them to be  both\r\n\r\nsports boys and also to be good in studies.  I think  the\r\n\r\nmain  criteria  must be sports and, if at all,  education\r\n\r\ncan  be a criterion but it should not be one of the  main\r\n\r\ncriteria, because we must produce sports boys and  sports\r\n\r\ngirls, and that must be the priority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Council has a Code of Governance for\r\n\r\nnational sports associations, popularly known as  the  10\r\n\r\ncommandments.  There appears to be a maximum term for NSA\r\n\r\nofficers to serve in the various NSAs.  Could I ask  also\r\n\r\nthat  for  the  Singapore Sports Council members,  whilst\r\n\r\nthey  have done well, perhaps there should be a term  for\r\n\r\nthem  also, so that there is rejuvenation and new persons\r\n\r\ncoming at the helm to be in charge of sports?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about office bearers also in the Singapore\r\n\r\nNational Olympic Council, Singapore Football Association,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Badminton Association?  I see a trend  towards\r\n\r\npoliticians  being more involved in these bodies.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  our  politicians are very busy, and  I  think  more\r\n\r\nleeway  should be given for the citizenry to  participate\r\n\r\nin leadership roles.  Therefore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would  urge the politicians to be perhaps  patrons  of\r\n\r\nthese associations and not as Chairpersons or Presidents.\r\n\r\nGive others a chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the approximately $500 million that has been\r\n\r\nearmarked  for  sports as a result of  the  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSporting Singapore Report, how much has actually gone  to\r\n\r\nthe  NSAs?   Since the announcement of the  above  grant,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the specific budgetary plans for  the  various\r\n\r\nsports  development objectives?  What  monies  have  been\r\n\r\nspent  and under what headings?  What outcomes,  tangible\r\n\r\nor intangible, have been recorded or accounted for?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is learnt that foreign consultants have been\r\n\r\nemployed  to the administration or divisions  within  the\r\n\r\nSports  Council.   How  experienced  are  they  and   how\r\n\r\neffective  have they been?  What is their  experience  as\r\n\r\ncompared to local sports administrators who probably  can\r\n\r\ndo  a job as well?  If not, could we send them abroad for\r\n\r\ntraining so that they come back with expertise and remain\r\n\r\nloyal  to  Singapore?  How many talented athletes  do  we\r\n\r\nhave   and  are  receiving  funding  and  how   much   in\r\n\r\npreparation  for  the  2003 South East  Asian  Games  and\r\n\r\nbeyond?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the MCDS propose to make sports less\r\n\r\ndefined  by  race?   As  we know, sports  creates  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.  It is one of the best ways for different races\r\n\r\nto play and grow together as friends, and gel together as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  In this connection, I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhy,   in   many  of  these  games  like  table   tennis,\r\n\r\nbasketball, swimming and wu shu, for instance, are played\r\n\r\nmainly  by  the  Chinese, whilst sepak  takraw  and  even\r\n\r\nsoccer  by the Malays; and hockey and cricket by Indians.\r\n\r\nWhat can the Ministry do to minimise this problem and get\r\n\r\nour Singaporeans to gel together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, the setting up\r\n\r\nof  the  Sports  School  to  provide  world-class  sports\r\n\r\ntraining to talented student athletes to help them  reach\r\n\r\ntheir fullest potential is indeed a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood step.  I understand the first batch of students will\r\n\r\nbe recruited in January next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a local newspaper reported recently that\r\n\r\nonly  Express  stream students will be  admitted  to  the\r\n\r\nschool,  there  was  public  uproar.   Many  objected  to\r\n\r\nsetting   high  academic  qualification   as   an   entry\r\n\r\ncriterion.  It was even reported in the Straits Times  on\r\n\r\n12th March that based on a survey of some 100 readers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times, only three agreed that high  academic\r\n\r\nqualification is needed.  Even Khoo Swee Chiow, our well-known Mt. Everest hero, objected to the criterion.  In an\r\n\r\ne-mail to the Straits Times, he wrote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our Government wants to stress sports.

Michael Jordan\r\n\r\nonly  does one thing in life  -  play basketball.   Tiger\r\n\r\nWoods  only  does one thing in life  -  play  golf.   Ask\r\n\r\nthem  how  much  time they spend in practice,  they  will\r\n\r\nprobably say, \"All my life\".

Could the Minister also tell us what\r\n\r\nplans he has to ensure that the Sports School would  help\r\n\r\nfulfil our dream of becoming a sporting nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, like my many\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  Mr  Sin Boon Ann, Ms Irene Ng,  and  several\r\n\r\nothers  who have spoken before me, and many Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nI  am  dismayed  that  only Express stream  students  can\r\n\r\nqualify  for  a  place  in the  Sports  School.   If  the\r\n\r\nintention was to establish an academic institution,  then\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see the relevance of constituting the  Sports\r\n\r\nSchool  under  the purview of the Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Sports.  In fact, I recently read in  the\r\n\r\nmedia   that  10  schools  in  the  Woodlands  area   are\r\n\r\nintroducing a sports programme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the schools to nurture sport talents.  Other secondary\r\n\r\nschools  and JCs have also signalled the same  intention.\r\n\r\nDo they see an opportunity to outdo the Sports School?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree with the Sports School that\r\n\r\nour sportsmen and women should be educated.  We want them\r\n\r\nto  be  functional  citizens.  This means  they  must  be\r\n\r\nliterate,  able to read and write.  They must  reach  the\r\n\r\nbasic  academic  standards, able to live  a  normal  life\r\n\r\nafter their sports days are over, or if they fail to make\r\n\r\nit in sports.  For those able to go further academically,\r\n\r\nthey  must  have the opportunity to do so in  the  Sports\r\n\r\nSchool.   They must have the opportunity to  be  as  best\r\n\r\nthey  can be academically while perfecting their sporting\r\n\r\ntalent.   But the focus of the Sports School must  be  on\r\n\r\nsports.  The intention of setting up the Sports School is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  to nurture academic excellence  that  our\r\n\r\nexisting schools are doing very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, I feel that the Sports School should\r\n\r\nidentify those who have the talents to be good in sports,\r\n\r\nregardless of academic abilities.  The School should then\r\n\r\nwork  with  them  to ensure that they achieve  the  basic\r\n\r\nacademic   education  to  be  functional  citizens,   but\r\n\r\nnurturing  them in their sports talent.  By  putting  the\r\n\r\nfocus  or emphasis on the sports, the Sports School would\r\n\r\nbe able to achieve the goals for which it was set up.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that the academic emphasis by the Sports School  is\r\n\r\nnot  a cop-out for fear of not being able to produce  the\r\n\r\nsports  talents  but  making sure  that  they  cannot  be\r\n\r\naccused of destroying the student's life, for the  latter\r\n\r\nhas his or her excellent academic qualification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki is not in.

By setting the entry level  at  the\r\n\r\nExpress stream, the Sports School\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  actually  looking  for  sportsmen  with  brains.   An\r\n\r\nofficial  was quoted as saying that this is in  order  to\r\n\r\nprepare  students who, if they eventually do not make  it\r\n\r\nin  sports,  can switch to academic pursuit.   Sir,  such\r\n\r\nthinking is like admitting defeat even before the  School\r\n\r\nis open.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a stand actually means that aspiring sportsmen\r\n\r\nand  sportswomen can only pursue their sporting  interest\r\n\r\nif  they  can excel academically.  Sir, in that  case,  I\r\n\r\nwould just submit that we do not need a Sports School for\r\n\r\nthis.   There are already many schools in Singapore doing\r\n\r\nthis for a long time.  Schools like RI, ACS and a host of\r\n\r\nothers  produce all-round students all the time, students\r\n\r\nwho excel academically as well as in sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that, by setting such a standard, the\r\n\r\nSchool may have missed the objective of why it was set up\r\n\r\nin  the  first  place  and  that  is  to  produce  sports\r\n\r\nchampions.   Not all sports champions excel academically.\r\n\r\nAs  has  been  pointed out by Mr Chew,  I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nsomeone like Michael Jordan, or for that matter, you  can\r\n\r\nname a lot of other top sportsmen, Ronaldo and the like - I  do  not  think they were that great in their  studies.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  like the same as if you want  to  have  good\r\n\r\nmusicians.  If the guy is gifted in musical talent or  in\r\n\r\nsinging,  you do not say that he needs to be academically\r\n\r\nqualified before he can pursue such a career.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  for  that matter the Rolling Stones  members  were\r\n\r\ngreat shakes in their studies when they were young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, is setting a minimum standard of 200 points in\r\n\r\nthe  PSLE result too high and actually depriving us of  a\r\n\r\nlarger  talent  pool?   Even in the  United  States,  the\r\n\r\nsports  colleges there require only an entry level  of  a\r\n\r\nminimum of 2.0 grade point average - they call it the GPA\r\n\r\n-  on  a scale of 4.0.  This grading is what I would term\r\n\r\nas  a  fair pass, which is lower than our Express  stream\r\n\r\nqualification and probably 2.0 grade point is  closer  to\r\n\r\nour  Normal stream standard.  Furthermore, their  grading\r\n\r\ntakes place at a higher age for everybody, that is, after\r\n\r\nHigh School.  Whereas in our case,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe child is already streamed at a very young age and  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of just one single examination, ie, the PSLE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sports School must be seen as another route\r\n\r\nfor  those  who,  though they may have less  intellectual\r\n\r\ncapabilities, have other talents which, given  the  right\r\n\r\nenvironment,  can be nurtured, exploited to the  fullest,\r\n\r\nand that such people can bring honour to the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports recently  launched  the\r\n\r\nCode  of  Governance for the National Sports Associations\r\n\r\n(NSAs).

I know that the  task  is  not\r\n\r\neasy,   given  the  initial  resistance  to  change   and\r\n\r\ncompliance and having to educate the many people involved\r\n\r\nin the management of these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous seminars and workshop sessions have to be\r\n\r\nheld  to  explain  the code.  In the end,  we  could  get\r\n\r\ncompanies to comply with the code in spirit and in  form,\r\n\r\nbut  ensuring  that the substance and the commitment  are\r\n\r\nalso  there is more difficult.  It takes time  to  change\r\n\r\nmindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I raise this concern because I believe that\r\n\r\nimplementing the Code of Governance among NSAs is  easier\r\n\r\nsaid than done.

Just as pupils are  offered\r\n\r\na broad range of subjects in schools, they should also be\r\n\r\noffered  a  range of ECA that exposes them  to  different\r\n\r\nexperiences  and  encourages the exploration  of  diverse\r\n\r\ninterests.   Presently, schools where  these  broad-based\r\n\r\nopportunities should be given are presently left  to  the\r\n\r\nindividual  school's own resources to select and  nurture\r\n\r\ncertain  sports  which  they feel  they  are  capable  of\r\n\r\nproviding.   This negates the aim of a clear  broad-based\r\n\r\npolicy to provide ample opportunities for pupils to excel\r\n\r\nin sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give one example. My little girl\r\n\r\nwanted  to  play tennis and went for selection,  just  to\r\n\r\nplay  the  sport.  She was thrown five balls for testing,\r\n\r\nand she came home telling me that she had managed only to\r\n\r\nhit  one ball.  Hence, she was not allowed to play tennis\r\n\r\nin school.  I have no choice but to send her to a private\r\n\r\nclass on Sunday and to pay $50 an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhour.   I am able to afford it, but how many parents  can\r\n\r\nafford  it.   I  concur with Dr Warren Lee that  we  must\r\n\r\nstart  the  young in sports early.  It is at this  tender\r\n\r\nage  of  7 to 12 that world champions can develop and  be\r\n\r\nnurtured.     Talents    can   be   identified    through\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  participate  in  a  diverse  range  of\r\n\r\nsporting  activities and outstanding pupils can  then  be\r\n\r\nidentified to provide the excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, the excellence factor has already\r\n\r\ncome  in  when  you  just  want  to  play  and  have  the\r\n\r\nexperiences  and,  most  often, the  excuses  are  always\r\n\r\nlimited facilities and human resources.   Presently,  the\r\n\r\nSports for All goals and programmes are developed by MCDS\r\n\r\nand  the  opportunities given to the children are decided\r\n\r\nby  the Ministry of Education.  There is obviously a need\r\n\r\nfor   total  coordination  and  commitment  between   the\r\n\r\nMinistries.   I  would like to ask for an  inter-Ministry\r\n\r\ncommittee to be set up to ensure that goals are  set  and\r\n\r\nimplementation  is carried out to ensure that  there  are\r\n\r\nphysical  and  human resources for maximum  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor the children to participate in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is small, and to build many stadiums and\r\n\r\nrunning tracks is impossible.  We must build these scarce\r\n\r\nresources where maximum shared uses are encouraged.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be built near the schools and conveniences,  such\r\n\r\nas  near  to  MRT  and LRT stations, where  children  and\r\n\r\nadults  can maximise the usage.  And what is the planning\r\n\r\nprovision for such stadiums and sports centres?  When was\r\n\r\nthe  last review done?  As for people resources, what  is\r\n\r\nMCDS'  plan  to increase the number of sports instructors\r\n\r\nin  schools as well as for the public sector, if we  want\r\n\r\nto cultivate a sporting Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki is not present.

This has provided a clear direction\r\n\r\nfor the sporting fraternity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as I can see, the allocation of $5\r\n\r\nmillion, stretched over a period of five years,  and  the\r\n\r\nblueprint  on 'Excellence in Sports' do not  reflect  the\r\n\r\ntrue  situation.  Neither has the committee made  a  fair\r\n\r\nallocation   of   funds   to  the  sporting   fraternity,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those sports associations not  regarded  as\r\n\r\nhaving merit status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before the CoSS took over the centralised\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  funds,  other sports  associations  could\r\n\r\napproach  the Singapore Sports Council and the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPools  for  funds  to finance their sporting  activities.\r\n\r\nNow,  with centralised coordination of all funds  by  the\r\n\r\nSSC,  those  National Sports Associations  without  merit\r\n\r\nstatus  have  no recourse to financial assistance.   They\r\n\r\nare expected to get help from the corporate sector.  With\r\n\r\nthe  current  economic slowdown, some sports associations\r\n\r\nare  no  longer able to get help from the private  sector\r\n\r\nand thus are not able to implement their annual plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that sponsorship for sports should be\r\n\r\nprioritised  but  no  sport  can  achieve  a   level   of\r\n\r\nexcellence  overnight.  Ideally, each sports  association\r\n\r\nshould have a home of its own where its national team can\r\n\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land-scarce Singapore, I understand this\r\n\r\nconstraint, but the Ministry should try to help them on a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case  basis.   There are sports  that  can  share\r\n\r\nfacilities.  There are others which cannot.  One  example\r\n\r\nis   basketball.   Since  the  Gay  World   Stadium   was\r\n\r\ndemolished  in  2001, the national  team  has  no  proper\r\n\r\ntraining ground where they can train adequately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, I think quite a lot\r\n\r\nhas  been said about sports, sporting nation and sporting\r\n\r\npeople and, therefore, I have nothing more to add.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  fully subscribed  to  the  notion  of\r\n\r\nsporting  Singapore.  Sports, along with the  arts,  make\r\n\r\nthe  continued development of the character of  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no surprise that residents in the Sengkang new\r\n\r\nestate  look  forward  eagerly to their  sports  stadium,\r\n\r\nespecially  since  it  features so prominently  in  their\r\n\r\nmaster plan.  Additionally, this sports stadium is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  the first stadium to be co-located with a  modern\r\n\r\ncommunity club.  This CC is going to be a key centre  for\r\n\r\nthe  community  in the Anchorvale and Fernvale  areas  of\r\n\r\nSengkang.   Co-locating  allows  maximum  utilisation  of\r\n\r\ncommon  areas,  such as the carparks,  as  well  as  non-duplication of sports amenities.  At the same time,  both\r\n\r\nfacilities can take full advantage of the Sungei  Punggol\r\n\r\nriver frontage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the need for the SSC to now fully cover\r\n\r\nboth  operating and building development costs has put  a\r\n\r\nyear's  delay  in  the plans.  Previously,  the  building\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the sports stadium has been on  Government\r\n\r\ngrants.   Moreover, the bundling of four sports  stadiums\r\n\r\ntogether  for  assessment  and  approval  compounds   the\r\n\r\nmagnitude  of  the problem for the SSC.  May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  could  review  the  need  for  the\r\n\r\nbundling  of  the  four stadiums and allow  the  Sengkang\r\n\r\nSports  Stadium  to proceed ahead, as the  CC's  fate  is\r\n\r\ninextricably  tied  to  that of the  sports  stadium.

Of the $500 million Sporting  Singapore\r\n\r\nFund  set up in September 2000, we have thus far utilised\r\n\r\nabout  $125  million.  Out of the 40 recommendations,  we\r\n\r\nhave started implementing 36 of them.  The remaining four\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  which primarily  concern  the  National\r\n\r\nSports Associations (NSAs), will be implemented when  the\r\n\r\nNSAs are more ready for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to elaborate on some of the key\r\n\r\ninitiatives  in  the three pillars of sports  excellence,\r\n\r\nsports  for  all and sports industry.  Along the  way,  I\r\n\r\nwill  address  some  of the concerns raised  by  Members.\r\n\r\nTogether,  these  three pillars  form  our  vision  of  a\r\n\r\nsporting  nation,  where  our athletes  do  us  proud  in\r\n\r\ninternational  competitions,  our  people   play   sports\r\n\r\nregularly, and where our sports industry is vibrant  with\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of Sports Excellence, our aim is to be\r\n\r\none of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by 2010.  2002\r\n\r\nwas  a  watershed  year  for us.  We  achieved  our  best\r\n\r\nresults  ever  in the Commonwealth Games  and  the  Asian\r\n\r\nGames.   We also had major international achievements  by\r\n\r\nour  athletes  in  major  single-sport  competitions  for\r\n\r\nbadminton, bowling, table tennis and silat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree with Mr Sin Boon Ann that a small\r\n\r\npopulation  base  does  not preclude  us  from  producing\r\n\r\nOlympic  or world champions.  Although Singapore has  yet\r\n\r\nto  produce  an Olympic gold medallist, we have  athletes\r\n\r\nwho  have  done  well in world or regional  competitions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Jennifer Tan and Jesmine Ho are the current\r\n\r\nWorld    Bowling    Masters   champion   and    runner-up\r\n\r\nrespectively.  Remy Ong is ranked as Asia's  top  amateur\r\n\r\nbowler,  and Ronald Susilo is among the top 20  badminton\r\n\r\nplayers in the world today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to achieve greater heights in sports\r\n\r\nexcellence,  on a more consistent basis, we  have  to  do\r\n\r\nmore.   We  have  already started  to  do  so  under  the\r\n\r\nSporting Singapore blueprint, and our efforts are focused\r\n\r\non three broad areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The development of the NSAs into effective\r\n\r\nsports bodies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The setting up of a Sports School to develop\r\n\r\nelite student athletes; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Our support for elite athletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NSAs are an important component of our\r\n\r\nsports   delivery   system.  They  are  national   bodies\r\n\r\nrepresenting  Singapore,  and  supported  as   the   sole\r\n\r\nauthorities  for their respective sports.  Hence,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nChew  Heng  Ching  has  pointed out,  accountability  and\r\n\r\nperformance  standards must be closely  monitored.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  after  months of consultation  with  the  sporting\r\n\r\nfraternity,  we  launched  the  Code  of  Governance  for\r\n\r\nNational Sports Associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the Code of Governance will\r\n\r\naddress a few key critical areas.  First, it will address\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of leadership renewal and fair representation\r\n\r\nof  stakeholders in the leadership of the NSAs.   Second,\r\n\r\nthe  Code will address the concern of accountability  for\r\n\r\npublic   funds.   Increased  funding  support   must   be\r\n\r\naccompanied by increased accountability.  Third, the Code\r\n\r\nwill  put  in place a system to ensure that the selection\r\n\r\nof   athletes   for  major  competitions  is   fair   and\r\n\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching has asked about the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the Code, and Mr  Ng  Ser  Miang  has\r\n\r\nenquired  about its progress.  The NSAs for the Core  and\r\n\r\nMerit sports are expected to comply with the Code by  end\r\n\r\nof  FY2003.  However, we will consider NSAs' request  for\r\n\r\nexemptions from, or delayed implementation for,  selected\r\n\r\nclauses  in the Code on a case-by-case basis.  To  assist\r\n\r\nthe  NSAs  as  they comply with the Code,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSports Council (SSC) has already followed up with some of\r\n\r\nthe  NSAs.   SSC  will provide the necessary  assistance,\r\n\r\nsuch   as   support   for   legal   advice,   review   of\r\n\r\norganisational  structures  and  systems,  as   well   as\r\n\r\ntraining.  We will work with each NSA to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  Code  is  reasonable  and  well-supported.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  that several NSAs have already started  this\r\n\r\nreview process on their own accord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the performance expectations of NSAs\r\n\r\nmust  be  made clear.  In 2002, a review of  the  various\r\n\r\ncategories  of NSAs was done and a comprehensive  set  of\r\n\r\ncriteria was put in place for the classification of  NSAs\r\n\r\ninto   \"core\",  \"merit\"  and  \"others\"  categories.    In\r\n\r\nessence,  when  SSC assesses the NSAs, it  looks  at  the\r\n\r\nNSAs'  performance  in  international  competitions,  its\r\n\r\nelite  athlete management, its promotion of the sport  to\r\n\r\nthe public, and its internal administrative systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For core and merit NSAs, SSC will set annual targets\r\n\r\nthrough  the Partnership Agreements that it has with  the\r\n\r\nNSAs.   Last  year, strategic NSA-specific  reviews  were\r\n\r\nconducted for some NSAs, so that they know the areas that\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  improve on.  Some NSAs  involved  include\r\n\r\nthose  in  shooting,  netball,  sailing,  billiards   and\r\n\r\nsnookers, swimming, badminton and triathlon.  This  year,\r\n\r\nwe will share best practices among the NSAs, so that they\r\n\r\ncan learn from one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC supports the NSAs, mainly through financial\r\n\r\ngrants  and  the use of its facilities.  Last  year,  the\r\n\r\nceilings  of the total grants to NSAs were raised  to  $3\r\n\r\nmillion,  $2  million and $0.5 million respectively,  for\r\n\r\nNSAs in the \"core\", \"merit\" and \"others\" categories.  The\r\n\r\nactual grants given out have increased over the last  two\r\n\r\nyears,  and will increase further in the next few  years,\r\n\r\nif  the  NSAs have effective programmes.  Mr Ong Ah  Heng\r\n\r\nhas cited the case of basketball.  I am pleased to inform\r\n\r\nhim  that  the Basketball Association of Singapore,  like\r\n\r\nother NSAs in the \"others\" category, is also eligible for\r\n\r\nmore  funding  support, as long as  they  have  effective\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  are in line with our  overall  national\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong raised this in another matter, but\r\n\r\nI want to address it, and he will be glad to know that we\r\n\r\nhave  not  left  out  our  elite disabled  athletes.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  our  funding support for the Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  for the Disabled has increased by eight-fold  in\r\n\r\nFY2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach towards athletes is focused on\r\n\r\nproviding  them  with  assistance and  financial  support\r\n\r\nduring  their  training, rather than monetary  incentives\r\n\r\nafter  they have won medals.  This applies to both  able-bodied and disabled athletes.  There are private sponsors\r\n\r\nand  people-sector organisations, such as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational Olympic Council, which have monetary awards  for\r\n\r\nmedal  winners.   They have their internal  policies  and\r\n\r\nguidelines on how such awards should be given out, and we\r\n\r\nshould leave these to their discretion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng also talked about the centralised\r\n\r\ncoordination of funds.  We think this is very  important.\r\n\r\nFunds must be allocated to the most appropriate areas and\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  most effective programmes,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nvision of Sporting Singapore can be realised.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nwe  may  end  up  over-spending in one  area  and  under-spending in another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also help the key NSAs to set up their Centres of\r\n\r\nExcellence,  which  typically are used  for  training  of\r\n\r\ntheir   elite   athletes.   These  are  costly   projects\r\n\r\nrequiring both funds and land.  It is therefore  critical\r\n\r\nthat  we  weigh the costs and benefits carefully,  before\r\n\r\ncommitting  to  any new Centre of Excellence.   In  cases\r\n\r\nwhere a Centre of Excellence cannot be built immediately,\r\n\r\nwe  will  help the NSA to find a place for its  training.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  this  will  have  to  be  shared  with  other\r\n\r\nparties.    So,  we  will  continue  to  work  with   the\r\n\r\nBasketball  Association of Singapore to find  a  suitable\r\n\r\nplace  for its elite training.  I think the hon.  Member,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong, was referring to your goodself, Sir, and not me,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  talked about the Minister watching a basketball\r\n\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second area is the setting up of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports  School,  which  aims  to  provide   an\r\n\r\nenvironment for promising student athletes who want to do\r\n\r\nwell  in their respective sports without compromising  on\r\n\r\ntheir  education. The Sports School will begin operations\r\n\r\nfrom  next  year,  and we expect to  have  about  100-150\r\n\r\nstudents  in the first year.  Most of these  will  be  in\r\n\r\nSecondary 1 and some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be in Secondary 2.  In the steady state, we  should\r\n\r\nhave about 600 students.  The School will also be open to\r\n\r\nelite  disabled  athletes.  The Singapore Sports  Council\r\n\r\nfor  the  Disabled  is currently helping  the  School  to\r\n\r\nselect suitable candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members of this House, ie, Ms Irene Ng, Dr Tan\r\n\r\nBoon Wan, Mr Ng Ser Miang, Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan  and  Mr Tan Soo Khoon, and members of  the  public\r\n\r\nhave  spoken about the admission criteria of the  School.\r\n\r\nLet  me  explain why we set up the Sports School  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, Singapore loses many talented student\r\n\r\nathletes because of the difficulties they face in  trying\r\n\r\nto  balance their studies and sports training. These  are\r\n\r\nstudents  who have the potential to excel in  both  their\r\n\r\nstudies  and  sports but, unfortunately, have  tremendous\r\n\r\ndifficulties  balancing them both today.  Something  must\r\n\r\ngive  in  the process and, sadly, it is often the  sport.\r\n\r\nAs we already have such a short supply of talented sports\r\n\r\npeople,  we must help these young athletes realise  their\r\n\r\nsporting  potential whilst at the same time  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey  meet  their academic potential.  This is  therefore\r\n\r\nthe target group of the Sports School.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked if we would not be losing out on\r\n\r\ntop  student athletes who cannot qualify for  the  School\r\n\r\nbased  on  their  academic results.   I  want  to  assure\r\n\r\nMembers  that the very talented student athletes will  be\r\n\r\nassessed  on  a  case-by-case  basis.   Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nSports  School, as rightly mentioned by several  Members,\r\n\r\nis not the only path for promising young athletes.  Other\r\n\r\nschools,  clubs,  and  NSAs  will  continue  to  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant  role  in  developing elite athletes.   Student\r\n\r\nathletes,  who cannot qualify for the Sports  School  but\r\n\r\nwho  have sports potential, will be trained by the  NSAs,\r\n\r\nas  they  are  doing today.  The resources  that  we  are\r\n\r\npouring  in  to  develop the NSAs will  ensure  effective\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for such young athletes.  These talents  will\r\n\r\nnot  be neglected.  The Sports School also plans to  work\r\n\r\nwith the NSAs to facilitate joint\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining sessions with the Sports School students,  where\r\n\r\nappropriate.   In  this way, we will  still  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  their potential in sports, even if they are  not\r\n\r\nin the Sports School.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a misperception that the admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  place  more emphasis on academic qualification,\r\n\r\nrather than on the sports talent. I would like to clarify\r\n\r\nthat the first criterion for admission into the School is\r\n\r\nthat  the student must be talented in sport.  He will  be\r\n\r\namong  the  very top of his cohort in that  sport.   Only\r\n\r\nafter  he  has crossed this hurdle will we  look  at  his\r\n\r\nacademic  results.   So, indeed,  sport  is  the  primary\r\n\r\nconsideration for admission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan noted that some mainstream schools\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to  put  more  emphasis  into  sports  and\r\n\r\nwondered if they would outdo the Sports School.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  good  that  mainstream  schools  are  emphasising\r\n\r\nsports,  as  this  will  raise the overall  standards  of\r\n\r\nsports among schools in Singapore.  Some of these primary\r\n\r\nschools  will  feed  talented athletes  into  the  Sports\r\n\r\nSchool.   And  some of the Junior Colleges will  probably\r\n\r\ntake in graduates from the Sports School.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng Ser Miang asked about the choice of sports in\r\n\r\nthe  School.  We will focus on eight sports in the  first\r\n\r\ninstance, namely, badminton, table tennis, bowling, track\r\n\r\nand  field,  sailing,  swimming,  football  and  netball.\r\n\r\nThese  are key sports in Singapore.  Even if some of  the\r\n\r\nsports  may  not  be  included in the major  multi-sports\r\n\r\nGames,   such  as  Asian  Games,  there  are   equivalent\r\n\r\ncompetitions  that  are equally  important  to  us.   The\r\n\r\nSchool  will also take in promising student athletes  who\r\n\r\nspecialise  in  sports  outside of  these  eight  sports.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the sports training will have to be taken  care\r\n\r\nby the NSA, unless there is a critical mass.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School will have a modular approach to its\r\n\r\neducation so that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudent  athlete can better organise his  modules  around\r\n\r\nthe  training and competition schedules.  There  will  be\r\n\r\ngood  facilities, training programmes and sports  science\r\n\r\nsupport  to  ensure  that his sports potential  is  fully\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  Finally, there will be hostel  facilities  so\r\n\r\nthat  students  can stay in the School as effective  time\r\n\r\nmanagement will be key to the students' success  in  both\r\n\r\nsports training and academic education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ng Ser Miang has suggested that we work\r\n\r\ntogether with NIE and the School of Physical Education in\r\n\r\nthe  areas of sports medicine and sports science so  that\r\n\r\nwe  will not duplicate these efforts.  I would assure him\r\n\r\nthat  both  sports  medicine and sports science  services\r\n\r\noffered  to  our  students in the Sports School  will  be\r\n\r\noffered, in collaboration and consultation with  SSC  and\r\n\r\nthe  School of Physical Education.  There will not be any\r\n\r\nduplication  of  such  services as  both  the  School  of\r\n\r\nPhysical Education and SSC are in discussion on how  best\r\n\r\nto work together on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sports School is a pioneer project in our\r\n\r\nsports  development. I thank Members for their  interest,\r\n\r\nconcerns and suggestions. I am aware that there are  some\r\n\r\nwho  support our approach to the Sports School  and  some\r\n\r\nwho  do  not.  I would urge all to let the Sports  School\r\n\r\ncommence  operations  first.   Let  us  learn  from  this\r\n\r\nexperience.   If there are reasons to review  our  policy\r\n\r\nlater on, we will certainly do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third broad area for sports excellence is to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  comprehensive support system  for  our  elite\r\n\r\nathletes.   This  will include funding support,  training\r\n\r\nadvice,  overseas scholarships as well as sports  science\r\n\r\nand  sports  medicine support. For instance, the  Athlete\r\n\r\nCareer  and Training programme was launched in  2002   to\r\n\r\nprovide customised support to our top elite athletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has suggested that we consider setting\r\n\r\nup  a  Sports Institute for our elite athletes.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to thank her for this good idea which we will study\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther.  The setting up of the Sports School is  a  step\r\n\r\ntowards  a similar concept for Singapore. And,  again,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  we gather the experience  of  running  the\r\n\r\nSports School first before we take this next step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the second pillar, which\r\n\r\nis  the  Sports for All. I agree with Dr Warren Lee  that\r\n\r\nrecreational sport for the general public is important. A\r\n\r\nsporting   lifestyle  can  lead  to  a  healthier   body,\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of positive attributes among our  young  and\r\n\r\nfoster  closer bonding among our communities.  Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong   has  asked  about  the  progress  of  the  sports\r\n\r\nparticipation rate.  I am glad to inform him that it  has\r\n\r\nincreased from 34% in 1997 to 38% in 2001.  Our aim is to\r\n\r\nincrease  it  to  50%  by 2005. I  hope  all  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament will support this effort and take up one sport\r\n\r\ninitially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be easy to achieve the 50% rate, but we\r\n\r\naim to get as close as possible to our target.  First, we\r\n\r\nneed  to create and customise sporting opportunities  for\r\n\r\nthe different segments of the general public.  Second, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  ensure that the sports facilities are available\r\n\r\nand well-utilised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC has made a fundamental shift in its approach to\r\n\r\nSports  for  All from one of doing it itself  to  working\r\n\r\nwith   various  partners.   As  partners   have   to   be\r\n\r\nidentified,  enlisted  and  equipped  with  the  required\r\n\r\ncapabilities, this change cannot happen overnight, but it\r\n\r\nhas most definitely started.  SSC has also re-focused its\r\n\r\nefforts on youth sports programmes.  SSC wants to nurture\r\n\r\na  lifelong love of sports in our youth for all its broad\r\n\r\nmerits,  and  not  just for healthy  lifestyle  purposes.\r\n\r\nThis  has  to  be inculcated in our children  right  from\r\n\r\nprimary  school.   Yet, another area  of  opportunity  is\r\n\r\nwomen  sports,  which is given special  study  and  being\r\n\r\nchampioned by certain NSAs, such as netball.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the students, SSC works with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation,  schools and various NSAs. For  instance,  SSC\r\n\r\nworked with MOE and the Football Association\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  to  extend  the  \"C\"  Division   Football\r\n\r\ntournament played by schools so that the school teams get\r\n\r\nto  play  more  football matches. SSC also  supports  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives  such  as the \"Catch Them  Young\"  initiative\r\n\r\nthat  many schools have expressed interest in.   SSC  and\r\n\r\nNSAs  have also organised sports camps, mini-leagues  and\r\n\r\ncompetitions for children and youth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target is not just the school players. We also\r\n\r\nwant  to  encourage non-school team players to learn  and\r\n\r\nplay  sports.  Hence, SSC has introduced to  schools  the\r\n\r\nSports@Basic programme, which teaches students the  basic\r\n\r\nskills   of   a  sport.  Some  50  schools  have   either\r\n\r\nparticipated  or  expressed interest in participating  in\r\n\r\nthe Sports@Basics programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general public, the Sports for Life Centres\r\n\r\nmanaged by SSC organise a wide range of sports activities\r\n\r\nat  the  community level, such as sports  programmes  for\r\n\r\nsenior citizens and women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree with Mr Ong Ah Heng that we need to\r\n\r\nleverage on our partners in sports, if we hope to  create\r\n\r\nmore sporting opportunities for Singaporeans. This is one\r\n\r\nreason why we decided to transfer the Constituency Sports\r\n\r\nClubs from the SSC to the People's Association (PA)  last\r\n\r\nyear.  The SSC also works very closely with the Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Councils (CDCs), NSAs,  Constituency  Sports\r\n\r\nClubs  and  grassroots organisations to organise  a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of sports activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we also launched the Sports Partners\r\n\r\nPromotion Programme to support our sports partners in the\r\n\r\norganisation of sports events for the general public. To-date,  more than 60 applicants have been supported  under\r\n\r\nthe  scheme.   Assistance provided  by  SSC  ranges  from\r\n\r\nfinancial support, knowledge transfer and networking.  By\r\n\r\nsupporting more sports partners, we hope to play the role\r\n\r\nof  a  catalyst  and  encourage more partners  to  create\r\n\r\nsporting opportunities for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong Ah Heng talked about the role of SSC in\r\n\r\norganising mass sports\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevents.   SSC  is already working with various  agencies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  PA,  in the organisation of  such  events.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this year, we will review how  we  can  make\r\n\r\nbetter  use of our resources, whether they belong to  SSC\r\n\r\nor  our partners, so that we can re-channel resources  to\r\n\r\nthe more effective programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the issue of sports\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Singapore has a large  number  of  sporting\r\n\r\nfacilities on a per capita basis.  SSC manages  an  array\r\n\r\nof facilities such as swimming pools, football fields and\r\n\r\nindoor  sports halls. This supplements the facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe   HDB  common  areas,  eg,  basketball  courts,  CCs,\r\n\r\nschools,  private housing and corporations. In  addition,\r\n\r\npublic  parks  and  even Sentosa can  also  be  used  for\r\n\r\nselected sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC is reviewing its masterplan for sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  so  as  to  cater to changes  in  demographic\r\n\r\ntrends,  preferences,  as  well  as  to  achieve   better\r\n\r\nutilisation,  accessibility and  cost  effectiveness.  As\r\n\r\npart  of  this exercise, SSC will review planning  norms,\r\n\r\ndesign   of   facilities  and  operations   of   existing\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better utilise these facilities, we are looking\r\n\r\ninto  arrangements to share some of these facilities,  as\r\n\r\nMdm Cynthia Phua has suggested.  SSC and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  have started a pilot scheme on  Co-sharing  of\r\n\r\nSchool Fields with the community. Under the pilot scheme,\r\n\r\nseven  school  fields  will be  open  for  community  use\r\n\r\noutside  the  school curriculum time. SSC  will  maintain\r\n\r\nthese   fields  and  manage  the  usage  outside   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum  time. Two school fields, Serangoon  Secondary\r\n\r\nand  Dunearn  Secondary, have been upgraded  with  simple\r\n\r\nchanging  rooms for the players. Upgrading work  for  the\r\n\r\nremaining  five  schools is targeted  to  finish  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond half of 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where appropriate, parks also allow and provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  recreational  non-competitive   sporting\r\n\r\nactivities.  For\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstance, woodball is played in Sun Plaza Park,  mountain\r\n\r\nbiking  is  done in Tampines Biking Trail and  soccer  in\r\n\r\ndesignated areas in Bishan Park, Pasir Ris Park and  East\r\n\r\nCoast  Park.   NParks  and SSC also collaborated  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  launch of Keep-Fit-Taiji-in-Parks as yet  another\r\n\r\nmeans to promote parks for healthy recreational activity.\r\n\r\nConcurrently,   we  are  also  making   better   use   of\r\n\r\ntemporarily vacant state land.  SSC has taken  possession\r\n\r\nof two sites in Ubi Avenue 1 and Marina South and built a\r\n\r\ntotal  of eight football fields on these two sites.  They\r\n\r\nare  now  very  popular  among football  lovers.  We  are\r\n\r\nlooking into more of such opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim talked about the funding framework\r\n\r\nfor  sports facilities. We aim to seek greater efficiency\r\n\r\nand  effectiveness  in the use of our  capital.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  will  not  slow  down the building  of  new  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities if the project is justifiable. I assure Mr Wee\r\n\r\nthat  we are in discussion with the relevant agencies  on\r\n\r\nthe  development  of several sports complexes,  including\r\n\r\nthe  one in Sengkang. The fact that we are pursuing these\r\n\r\ncomplexes jointly should not affect their implementation.\r\n\r\nWhere  necessary,  we will proceed on  any  one  of  them\r\n\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the third pillar, which is\r\n\r\nthe  sports  industry.   It is  our  aim  to  double  the\r\n\r\neconomic  contribution of the industry from $680  million\r\n\r\nin 1998 to $1.4 billion by 2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key strategy in developing the sports industry\r\n\r\nis  to  create  and  attract major  international  sports\r\n\r\nevents  to  Singapore.  In  FY  2002,  a  total   of   29\r\n\r\ninternational sports events were supported by SSC through\r\n\r\nsponsorship and grants. These included the Rugby  7,  the\r\n\r\nCaltex  Masters  and  the  Standard  Chartered  Singapore\r\n\r\nMarathon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC also successfully secured the bid for Singapore\r\n\r\nto  host the IOC Session 2005, thanks to efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Chairman, Mr Ng Ser Miang.  This is the  annual\r\n\r\nmeeting  of the most prestigious world body on  sports  - the International\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympic Committee.  More than 120 members of the IOC will\r\n\r\nmeet  in Singapore in 2005 to elect the host city of  the\r\n\r\n<br><br>2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer  Olympic  Games. We  expect  this  event  to\r\n\r\nreceive a lot of media attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a feasibility study on redeveloping the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium  into a multi-purpose  Sports  Hub  was\r\n\r\ncompleted  last year.  I would like to thank Mr  Tan  Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon for raising this matter.  The Government has agreed\r\n\r\nwith  its  recommendation  to build  the  Sports  Hub  in\r\n\r\nKallang.   The exact mix of facilities in the Sports  Hub\r\n\r\nwill  be  decided after a masterplanning of  the  Kallang\r\n\r\narea  is  done. We aim to start construction in 2005  and\r\n\r\ncomplete the Sports Hub by 2009.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Hub will be a national landmark, and will\r\n\r\nnot be a ghost town.  It will bring Singaporeans together\r\n\r\nto watch and participate in sports, and at the same time,\r\n\r\ncater  to  major  local  and  international  sports   and\r\n\r\nentertainment  events. It will help foster  the  sporting\r\n\r\nculture among Singaporeans and boost the sports industry.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, the construction and operation of  the\r\n\r\nSports  Hub  will  generate economic spin-offs  and  help\r\n\r\ncreate  jobs.  Details on the construction of the  Sports\r\n\r\nHub,  including  its design, its exact location  and  its\r\n\r\ncost estimate, are currently being studied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan has addressed the concern of why is it\r\n\r\nthat  we need to build the Sports Hub together with other\r\n\r\nfacilities.  The Sports Hub is about a lifestyle that  we\r\n\r\nwant  to develop in Singapore, which not only focuses  on\r\n\r\nsports,  but  other related activities.  If you  look  at\r\n\r\nexamples  of  the various sports stadiums in  the  world,\r\n\r\nsuch as in France and other parts of the world, they have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  their stadiums into more than just a  sporting\r\n\r\nstadium.   It  has, in fact, generated a lot of  interest\r\n\r\namong  its local population.  The more recent example  is\r\n\r\nthe  Stadia  De  France in Paris which, despite  all  the\r\n\r\ninitial  cost,  has been able to turn around  and  become\r\n\r\nmore  profitable. Our initial study shows that the Sports\r\n\r\nHub in Kallang can be profitable, not only due to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsports  events  but other events that will  generate  the\r\n\r\nhuman traffic that we desire.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan has commented that there are\r\n\r\ntoo   many   politicians  involved  in  national   sports\r\n\r\nassociations.  Sir, if they are passionate  about  sports\r\n\r\nand willing to contribute to sports, then I welcome their\r\n\r\ninvolvement.    Mr  Chandra Mohan  felt  that  we  should\r\n\r\ninvolve  our  sports  people in these  organisations.   I\r\n\r\nagree   that  former  athletes  can  often  provide   the\r\n\r\nathlete's  perspective and add value to the organisation.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  such  examples in  the  various  sports\r\n\r\nassociations,  such as Mr Desmond Koh, a former  Olympian\r\n\r\nswimmer,  sitting  on the newly formed  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nSchool  Board.   Ms  Grace  Young,  our  former  national\r\n\r\nbowler,  is  assisting the Bowling  Association,  and  Ms\r\n\r\nAnnabel Pennefather, a former hockey national player, now\r\n\r\nVice-President of the Hockey Federation.   Even  the  new\r\n\r\nSSC Board is headed by a former national swimmer, Mr Alex\r\n\r\nChan,  and has six other members who are former  national\r\n\r\nathletes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by Mr Chandra Mohan on\r\n\r\nwhether or not we should rejuvenate the SSC, in fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave  done so.  Mr Ng Ser Miang has done a good job.   He\r\n\r\nwas  at  his  peak when we decided that we need  to  also\r\n\r\nbring in new blood.  Mr Ng Ser Miang is now supporting us\r\n\r\nthrough   his   various  connections  in   the   sporting\r\n\r\nfraternity to help us further achieve our goal of being a\r\n\r\nsporting  nation  in  2010.  Sir, I must  emphasise  that\r\n\r\nappointments as Board members or staff should be based on\r\n\r\nthe person's ability to contribute and not simply because\r\n\r\nhe was a sports person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer briefly some of the other points\r\n\r\nraised  by other Members.  I agree with Mr Sin  Boon  Ann\r\n\r\nthat  we need to attract corporate sponsors, and that  is\r\n\r\nthe purpose of building up the sports industry.  Based on\r\n\r\nour  recent examples, the Rugby 7 and the Caltex Masters,\r\n\r\nwe  are  able  to  generate that.  So,  it  is  not  only\r\n\r\nGovernment funding, but also the corporate sponsorships.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan raised a very good point regarding the\r\n\r\nbalance between hardware and software, and why we  should\r\n\r\nspend $650 million on hardware.  Mr Tan would agree  that\r\n\r\nwe  need  both, hardware and software.  He is nodding  in\r\n\r\nagreement and that is good.  Not enough?  Well,  I  would\r\n\r\nagree  with  him  that we can do with a little  bit  more\r\n\r\nmoney,  but the $500 million that we have is being  spent\r\n\r\nwell  on  the right areas, to ensure that we can  develop\r\n\r\nnot only the athletes but the supporting systems.  So  we\r\n\r\nwant to strengthen our NSAs, we want to help our athletes\r\n\r\nand  we  want to encourage a larger base of people  going\r\n\r\ninto sports - the point raised by Dr Warren Lee and other\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House  - and  we  need  to  get  enough\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to want to do sports and play sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan raised the specific point\r\n\r\nabout  foreign sports administrators.  We hired the  most\r\n\r\nsuitable  candidate for the job, and this  has  been  the\r\n\r\nresult  of Sporting Singapore blueprint because  we  need\r\n\r\npeople who are capable, who have done the work before  in\r\n\r\ntheir own country and can share their experiences.  It is\r\n\r\nnot  that we are selecting foreigners, but we are  trying\r\n\r\nto  select the best person.  So, in this regard, we  have\r\n\r\ngone beyond Singapore to find people who are capable and,\r\n\r\nat the same time, we are looking for Singaporeans who are\r\n\r\nable  to help us in this effort.  So we will try our very\r\n\r\nbest  and,  at the same time, we will train  our  people,\r\n\r\nthrough the various programmes that we have under SSC, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  themselves  also can  develop  the  necessary\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of racial integration and sports, I\r\n\r\nagree  entirely  with him that, at the end  of  the  day,\r\n\r\nsports  should  be  the  basis for  us  to  bring  people\r\n\r\ntogether.   But, I do not think that we can force  people\r\n\r\nto  play  a sport if they are not comfortable with.   You\r\n\r\ncannot  ignore the fact that, for example, silat is  part\r\n\r\nof  Malay culture, and predominantly you will see  Malays\r\n\r\nin  silat.   But  it does not mean that  people  are  not\r\n\r\nintegrating.  If you go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto a community centre on any one night, you will have the\r\n\r\nsilat  group at one corner, the wushu at another  corner,\r\n\r\nbut  they  are  all  under  the same  roof,  interacting,\r\n\r\ntalking, discussing with one another.  So I do not  think\r\n\r\nwe  should fault people for wanting to take up  only  one\r\n\r\nparticular sport.  We should encourage as many people  as\r\n\r\npossible to adopt all sports that they are interested in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Dr Warren Lee raised a very good point\r\n\r\nthat  SDU  could  promote sports as part  of  the  social\r\n\r\ninteraction activities.  I would be most happy  to  learn\r\n\r\nfrom him what more that we can do because, at the moment,\r\n\r\nboth  SDU  and SDS have regular followings amongst  their\r\n\r\nSSC   members  in  golf,  beach  volleyball,   badminton,\r\n\r\ncycling, bowling and yoga.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the last three years have been\r\n\r\nvery exciting for sports in Singapore.  I must thank  you\r\n\r\nfor  your  good  work, Sir.  For the first  time  in  our\r\n\r\nsporting history, we have a clear blueprint to chart  our\r\n\r\ncourse towards sporting excellence, promoting sports  for\r\n\r\nall and developing a sports industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, underlying the specific programmes\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  mentioned earlier, is  the  need  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to support sports.  They  can  do  this  by\r\n\r\nencouraging their children to be active in school sports,\r\n\r\nby  attending  and  supporting local  sports  events,  by\r\n\r\nparticipating in sports activities in their  communities.\r\n\r\nAll  these  will  underpin the gradual development  of  a\r\n\r\nsporting  culture.   If  I might  cite  my  own  personal\r\n\r\nexample,  Sir.  I am a cyclist and I have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nteach  my  7-year-old son to cycle.   Every  weekend,  we\r\n\r\ncycle together at the East Coast Parkway.  As a result of\r\n\r\nmy  interest  in  cycling, I have been  able  to  enthuse\r\n\r\nanother  Singaporean to be interested in  cycling.   But,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  reverse  has  also  happened.   My  5-year-old\r\n\r\ndaughter  is a very good roller-skater.  As a  result  of\r\n\r\nher  interest,  I  have begun to take up  roller-skating,\r\n\r\nSir, with a lot of bruises to show for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the emergence of a sporting culture is best\r\n\r\nexemplified when Ronald Susilo\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  it  to  the  semi-finals and finals  of  the  5-day\r\n\r\nSingapore   Badminton  Open  last   year.    Some   5,500\r\n\r\nsupporters  came  to  cheer  him  on  each  day.   School\r\n\r\nchildren  of  all races and gender cheered him  at  every\r\n\r\nsmash.   Aunties,  makciks and pakciks  were  waving  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  flag.  The atmosphere was electric,  something\r\n\r\nwe  have  not felt in a long time.  People from different\r\n\r\nraces,   different  ages,  and  different  socio-economic\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, all came together for a common cause  -  and\r\n\r\nthat  was  to cheer on our Singapore hero, and  that  was\r\n\r\nTeam Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Singapore, Sir, is about working and playing\r\n\r\ntogether,  supporting one another  for  a  common  cause.\r\n\r\nTeam  Singapore is about being proud of Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nconcept goes beyond sports.  It is equally applicable  to\r\n\r\nmany  areas  where  our multi-racial  and  multi-cultural\r\n\r\nsociety works together as one united people.  Sir, I look\r\n\r\nforward to the support of this House as we seek to  build\r\n\r\nTeam Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.   The Minister said that for Sports School, it would\r\n\r\nlook,  first  at  sporting talent and then  the  academic\r\n\r\nqualifications.  Can I ask the Minister whether it  means\r\n\r\nthat if a student has great sporting talent ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, are you raising a\r\n\r\nclarification?  That is not a clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The clarification is that\r\n\r\nif  the  student has great sporting talent but  does  not\r\n\r\nmeet  the  minimum qualification, and he is not from  the\r\n\r\nExpress  stream  but from the Normal or Academic  stream,\r\n\r\ncan he make it to the Sports School?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nin my reply, we will look at such cases on a case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis.   Ultimately,  it  is sporting  talent  that  will\r\n\r\nbecome  the  first criterion but, yet, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  academic standards of the particular child will have\r\n\r\nto  be  considered.  Because, at the end of the  day,  we\r\n\r\nalso want the child to be able\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  study  in  school,  and to balance  both  sports  and\r\n\r\nstudies.  So, if there is a child that does not meet  the\r\n\r\nacademic criterion, as I said, we will consider it  on  a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, point of clarification. My\r\n\r\nconcern is not that schools should share facilities  with\r\n\r\nthe public, but our schools do not have enough facilities\r\n\r\nand  sports  personnel  to  allow  our  children  maximum\r\n\r\nopportunities to enjoy sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, my apologies.\r\n\r\nLast  year, SSC launched a programme, together  with  the\r\n\r\nschools, where we gave a small funding to each school for\r\n\r\nit  to  hire  a  coach  or someone  who  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nvolunteer  to run sporting programmes for the non-athlete\r\n\r\nstudents.   This is one way in which we can  address  the\r\n\r\nlack  of  manpower  within the school system.   I  cannot\r\n\r\nrecall  the exact numbers, but more than 40 schools  have\r\n\r\njoined  the  scheme, and a good number of  students  have\r\n\r\nbeen involved in games in which they otherwise would  not\r\n\r\nhave been involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I do not quite understand\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  when he said that he is  now  prepared  to\r\n\r\nlower the admission standards to the Sports School  on  a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case basis.  If he is now prepared to lower it on\r\n\r\na  case-by-case basis, why stop at that?   Why  not  just\r\n\r\nallow it for everybody?  I recall that one of the reasons\r\n\r\nstated for not allowing admission for those with just the\r\n\r\nnormal  standards was that the school would not have  the\r\n\r\nfacility  to cater for Express and Normal streams.   But,\r\n\r\nif  you are now prepared to allow people in on a case-by-case basis, that means you still have to run courses  for\r\n\r\nthose from the Normal Stream.  So why do it on a case-by-case basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of the sports city, I\r\n\r\nthink he has missed the point ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It was not a clarification, Mr Tan.\r\n\r\nWas the first one a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes, I am clarifying something on\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, you were asking a question.

But I do not understand him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do not understand him?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> On the question of the sports\r\n\r\ncity, I find that he misses the point.  Do we really need\r\n\r\na  whole  complex with all the extra office space,  shops\r\n\r\nand  recreational facilities?  Does he really think  that\r\n\r\npeople  will  be  flocking there?  He has  to  understand\r\n\r\nthat,  in  Singapore, if you really want to  have  people\r\n\r\ngoing  to your sports stadium, the trick here is to build\r\n\r\nmore stadiums all over the island.  I do not think if you\r\n\r\nbuild a multi-complex, people are going to flock over  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   That was the same argument we used  when  we\r\n\r\nbuilt  the  National Stadium in 1974.  But just  see  how\r\n\r\nmany  people go to the National Stadium every day?  After\r\n\r\nthe Malaysia Cup matches were over, you hardly could fill\r\n\r\nthe  stadium at all.  I must also tell him that the  cost\r\n\r\nof  $650  million  for  the whole complex,  probably,  is\r\n\r\nwrong.   Because,  to  build a  top-class  stadium  would\r\n\r\nalready  cost you $600 million, at least, and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink for that price you could build a whole complex with\r\n\r\nall the other facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Yaacob, the second one is not a\r\n\r\nclarification.  Just answer the first one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the Sports\r\n\r\nSchool,  as  I  clarified earlier,  we  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider on a case-by-case basis.  I will leave it to the\r\n\r\nSports  School to decide what sort of criteria they  will\r\n\r\nuse  when  there is a very, very good athlete, but  whose\r\n\r\nacademic qualification may not meet our mark.  The reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we  are prepared to do so, and I think Mr  Tan  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  this, is that even in schools,  for  example,\r\n\r\nthere  are  children  who are just slightly  one  or  two\r\n\r\npoints  off a certain benchmark.  They can be  helped  to\r\n\r\ncross over to that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular  benchmark.   We understand  the  concerns  of\r\n\r\nMembers that we should not miss out on such talent.   But\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to appeal to Members to  also  allow  the\r\n\r\nSports  School to start the programme and learn from  our\r\n\r\nexperience before we undertake a major review in terms of\r\n\r\nits admission criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> On a point of order,\r\n\r\nSir.

This change should  begin  with\r\n\r\nthe  community.  In  the  same report,  MUIS  stated  its\r\n\r\nobjectives  to lead the community in Islam,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nprovide guidance in its efforts to produce a community of\r\n\r\nexcellence that contributes to the prosperity of  Muslims\r\n\r\nand  the  nation.  MUIS accepts its duty in  leading  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community in this aspect.  My question is: what is\r\n\r\nthe  position of MUIS' leadership at the moment?   Is  it\r\n\r\nbecoming more effective?  How could this effectiveness be\r\n\r\nmeasured?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there were voices that questioned MUIS'\r\n\r\ncredibility,  that  is, at the time  when  the  community\r\n\r\ndebated  on  the tudung, NEWater and JI issues.   I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  before in this House that MUIS' credibility  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  questioned.  But this does not  mean  that  this\r\n\r\nwould  always be guaranteed and should not be a  concern.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand,  MUIS' credibility  and  leadership\r\n\r\nshould be nurtured\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  strengthened all the time.  Among the elements which\r\n\r\ninfluence MUIS' leadership is its relationship  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Is the question of MUIS' credibility  that  I\r\n\r\nhave   mentioned  earlier  connected  to  its  ties  with\r\n\r\nsociety?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a large part of MUIS' Executive Council members\r\n\r\nare  made  up of those who are nominated by the community\r\n\r\norganisations.  There are also members of  the  community\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  a few of MUIS' sub-committees.  Both  these\r\n\r\nstructures  have  the  potential to  bring  about  closer\r\n\r\ncooperation  between MUIS and the community.   Can  these\r\n\r\nties  be enhanced?  What measures can be taken, in  terms\r\n\r\nof  its  structure or programmes, in order to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe ties between MUIS and the community?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MUIS' report for the year 2001 also states\r\n\r\nthat   the   challenge  today  is  to   build   on   past\r\n\r\nachievements, without being shackled by old mindsets, yet\r\n\r\nstill  firmly  upholding true religious teachings.   With\r\n\r\nsuch  challenges, what factors should MUIS give  priority\r\n\r\nto?   What is being undertaken by MUIS so as to make  the\r\n\r\ncommunity share the same perspective?\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I just want to\r\n\r\necho what Mr Khalis has said and this is basically on the\r\n\r\nrole  of MUIS and its leadership.  What I am saying today\r\n\r\nis very much what I hear on the ground with regard to the\r\n\r\nperception  on the role of MUIS.  The role  of  MUIS  has\r\n\r\neven  been more critical over the last year or so,  given\r\n\r\nthe fact that the Malay/Muslim community has been put  on\r\n\r\nthe  forefront quite a bit.  And often times, the  ground\r\n\r\nis  asking  what is the position of MUIS in many  aspects\r\n\r\nthat  affect  the Muslim community.  In  this  regard,  I\r\n\r\nwould appreciate it if the Minister could clarify what is\r\n\r\nthe   relationship   between   MUIS   and   the   various\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim  organisations.   Because  some   of   these\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim    organisations    are    not     religious\r\n\r\norganisations.

In this regard  also,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  members  of  the  community  question  the\r\n\r\ndirections  of  MUIS, because I think they  see  MUIS  as\r\n\r\ndoing  a  lot of things but without a clear focus  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  directions.  Could  the  Minister  please\r\n\r\nclarify that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another perception is that MUIS is spending a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney  on the media to enhance its image, which was never\r\n\r\ndone before.

May  I  ask   the\r\n\r\nMinister to share with us how he sees that role and  what\r\n\r\nare some of its challenges?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, MUIS' position is also unique. Its\r\n\r\ncredibility must be preserved and indeed enhanced, not by\r\n\r\nthe  nature of its statutory position, but by the rapport\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  respect  from the people.

Who issues these licences?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not too long ago, I also understand that MUIS\r\n\r\nembarked  on  a thorough review of the Islamic  education\r\n\r\nsystem, including its curriculum, structures, etc.  Can I\r\n\r\nask the Minister for an update of that review?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani:</b> Sir, about three\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  the Government decided to enforce compulsory\r\n\r\neducation (CE).  Madrasah students are exempted  but  not\r\n\r\ntotally  spared.  They are required to achieve a  certain\r\n\r\nstandard  in  English, Mathematics and Science  at  PSLE.\r\n\r\nThis  standard  is pegged to the average score  in  those\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  six lowest scoring national  schools.   The\r\n\r\nfirst batch of madrasah students who are so affected will\r\n\r\nsit for their PSLE in 2008.  They are now in Primary One.\r\n\r\nThis  CE requirement means that madrasahs have to  revamp\r\n\r\ntheir   curriculum.   This,  in  turn,  calls   for   new\r\n\r\ntextbooks,  new  materials,  even  changes  in  teachers,\r\n\r\nteacher   training  and  teaching  methods.    MUIS   has\r\n\r\nembarked  on a curriculum development programme  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.   Could  the  Minister give  an  update  on  this\r\n\r\neffort?   What has been achieved thus far and  what  more\r\n\r\ncan we expect?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PSTE, which is the Malay acronym for\r\n\r\nSecondary Four Certificate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamination,  in the madrasahs conducted by  MUIS  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  ago  had  introduced a degree  of  standardisation\r\n\r\namong our full-time madrasahs, at least for the religious\r\n\r\nknowledge component.  The CE requirement infuses  further\r\n\r\nstandardisation,  this  time  in  relation  to   English,\r\n\r\nMathematics  and  Science.  Does this not  bring  greater\r\n\r\ncoordination  and cohesion among the madrasahs  now  that\r\n\r\nthey have to meet more common standards?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are seeing advancements made in the realm of\r\n\r\nknowledge  at a rate unimagined before.  It is imperative\r\n\r\nthat MUIS resources be allocated to enhance the relevance\r\n\r\nand  quality of madrasah education in Singapore.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, all the madrasahs, MUIS and the community need\r\n\r\nto  work  more closely together to meet these challenges.\r\n\r\nThe global landscape is undergoing changes in the wake of\r\n\r\nthe Sudanese side events.  We saw 9/11 and the threat  of\r\n\r\ntrans-national terrorism.  Ethnic conflicts and  tensions\r\n\r\noccurred  and are still brewing in several parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld and, even as we speak, there is now a war in Iraq.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are beginning to wonder whether the\r\n\r\ntheory  of the crash of civilisations is more valid  than\r\n\r\nwas  originally thought.  Do our madrasahs and MUIS  take\r\n\r\nthis  into  account  - the scenario  which  I  have  just\r\n\r\npainted  -  when formulating or reviewing the curriculum?\r\n\r\nI  believe they should, Sir, if the madrasah is  to  play\r\n\r\nits role effectively in contributing towards the progress\r\n\r\nof the community and the well-being of the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, like other\r\n\r\ncommunities, the Muslim community in Singapore must  also\r\n\r\ndo  its  part to strengthen our multi-racial  and  multi-religious social fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Mr Ahmad Khalis and Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki  have spoken about the important role of  MUIS  in\r\n\r\nguiding the religious development of the Muslim community\r\n\r\nand  the  need  to  forge greater  partnership  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  I fully agree with the concerns raised by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree  Members.  Since September 11, MUIS has  made  even\r\n\r\ngreater efforts to galvanise the Muslim community towards\r\n\r\nnational unity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I agree with Mr Ahmad Khalis that the members of\r\n\r\nthe MUIS Council, as part of the leadership of MUIS, have\r\n\r\na  special responsibility to bring MUIS and the community\r\n\r\ntogether  in  fruitful  partnership.   MUIS  also   works\r\n\r\nclosely with its networks of mosque committees, religious\r\n\r\nand  community leaders and other key Muslim organisations\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the public has access to sound religious\r\n\r\nteaching.   MUIS  makes  use of platforms,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nMosque  Council,  Asatizah Network, Muzakarah  Mosque  or\r\n\r\nmosque  leaders' platform for coordination,  sharing  and\r\n\r\nnetworking.  Such networks also strengthen MUIS'  ability\r\n\r\nto  reach  out,  build a common vision and implement  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS also seeks to develop a corps of progressive\r\n\r\nand  credible  local religious leaders.  It is  revamping\r\n\r\nthe  religious studies curriculum of the madrasahs.  MUIS\r\n\r\nalso  runs  a scholarship programme to ensure the  future\r\n\r\nsupply of well-qualified teachers and officials.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwill  touch  on  the  aspects of religious  education  in\r\n\r\ngreater   detail  in  response  to  Dr  Mohamad  Maliki's\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while MUIS is the key authority on Islamic\r\n\r\nissues, it carries out its work with the support  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community.  For example, MUIS and Pergas  have  a\r\n\r\njoint committee on asatizah development.  MUIS also works\r\n\r\nwith Mendaki and AMP to bring in speakers who can add  to\r\n\r\nthe  discourse on Islam and with Perdaus on  publications\r\n\r\nto  guide the public on religious issues.  MUIS would not\r\n\r\nhave been able to do its work without the support of  the\r\n\r\nwider  community.  Since 1975, 19 new mosques  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt with the contributions of 130,000 Muslims from  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life.   Every year, some  3,500  haj  pilgrims\r\n\r\nundertake   the  pilgrimage  to  Mecca.    Besides   MUIS\r\n\r\nofficials, we are also accompanied by volunteers, such as\r\n\r\ndoctors and nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir  tireless  contribution had  won  praise  from  the\r\n\r\npilgrims   and   the  Saudi  government   had   expressed\r\n\r\nappreciation for the well-organised Singapore contingent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also encouraged by the number of\r\n\r\nvolunteers  wo have come forward to serve on the  various\r\n\r\nMUIS  committees.  For example, there are 870  volunteers\r\n\r\nin   the   Mosque  Management  Boards  and   other   MUIS\r\n\r\ncommittees.  The MUIS Council and Fatwa Committee members\r\n\r\nare  also volunteers.  Volunteers also serve in the Young\r\n\r\nMuslim   Secretariat  and  as  teachers   for   religious\r\n\r\nprogrammes   in   the  prisons  and  drug  rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I assure Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed that MUIS\r\n\r\nwill  continue  its  outreach to  strengthen  racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious harmony and to correct the misconceptions about\r\n\r\nIslam  and  the Muslim community following the events  of\r\n\r\nSeptember   11.   MUIS  has  indeed  stepped  up   public\r\n\r\neducation  efforts, including goodwill visits, talks  and\r\n\r\ndialogues and mosque open houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, more than 12,000 people attended\r\n\r\nMUIS'  talks on \"Understanding Islam and the Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nCommunity\"   both  in  English  and  in  Mandarin.    The\r\n\r\nprogrammes have received good feedback.  MUIS also hosted\r\n\r\nstudents  for Learning Journeys and will extend these  to\r\n\r\ncivil   servants   this  year.   As  for  inter-religious\r\n\r\ndialogue, MUIS actively participates in activities of the\r\n\r\ninter-religious organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media in all languages have been helpful and\r\n\r\nimportant  to  MUIS.   The Chinese media  has  been  very\r\n\r\nforthcoming  in helping MUIS to reach out to the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Maliki raised the concern whether MUIS is\r\n\r\nspending  too  much  money  on publicity.   MUIS'  Public\r\n\r\nAffairs and Public Education Department is a small outfit\r\n\r\nof  four officers and its public education budget in 2002\r\n\r\nwas $800,000.  To MUIS' credit, it has done a lot with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese resources.  It has not spent the money on publicity\r\n\r\nas  much as on delivering public education programmes  to\r\n\r\nMuslims  and non-Muslims and responding to the challenges\r\n\r\nin September 11.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these efforts, the Muslim community will be\r\n\r\nin  a  better  position  to weather  the  impact  of  the\r\n\r\nexternal  developments, such as the US war  on  Iraq,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  maintain mutual understanding  and  trust  with\r\n\r\nother  communities.  With the support of  the  community,\r\n\r\nMUIS  will continue to guide the community in becoming  a\r\n\r\nmodel Muslim community in our plural society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed has also touched on the\r\n\r\nrole of the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.  I  see\r\n\r\nmy  role  as galvanising the Muslims to take their  place\r\n\r\nproudly  in the Singapore society, progressing  alongside\r\n\r\nothers  and contributing to Singapore's peace, prosperity\r\n\r\nand progress.   Many I have spoken to share in this wish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last year, I have met with the leaders of\r\n\r\nover  30  mosques,  sometimes  joined  by  my  Malay   MP\r\n\r\ncolleagues.   We  also  held  seven  dialogues  with  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community and religious leaders over  issues\r\n\r\naffecting the community.  The Malay MPs have also visited\r\n\r\nnon-Muslim  organisations, especially Chinese  employers,\r\n\r\nto enhance mutual understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the question raised by Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki  concerning religious education and the  religious\r\n\r\nteachers'   director.   MUIS  has  formed   a   Religious\r\n\r\nEducation and Advisory Panel to advise it on improvements\r\n\r\nto  religious education for the Muslim public,  including\r\n\r\ntarget  groups, such as children and adults.  The  review\r\n\r\ncovers  areas, such as the curriculum, training  for  the\r\n\r\nasatizah,  or religious teachers, as well as how  various\r\n\r\ninstitutions, such as our mosques and private  providers,\r\n\r\ncan help enhance the quality of religious education.  The\r\n\r\nadvisory  panel is also actively gathering feedback  from\r\n\r\nvarious stakeholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosque leaders have also actively contributed their\r\n\r\nsupport and ideas to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprove religious education through the Muzakarah Masjid,\r\n\r\na  regular  platform  which MUIS initiated  in  1997  for\r\n\r\nsharing and networking among mosque leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch now on some of the areas that MUIS and\r\n\r\nits  key  partners are reviewing.  First,  the  religious\r\n\r\neducation  curriculum.   MUIS  has  already  developed  a\r\n\r\nreligious  education  curriculum  to  teach  school-going\r\n\r\nchildren basic Islamic knowledge.  This material is  used\r\n\r\nin  classes run by our mosques.  And adults attend  talks\r\n\r\nand forums conducted by various teachers at the mosques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, religious teachers. For classes held at\r\n\r\nmosques,  the  mosque management boards ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nspeakers  and  teachers are qualified.  Last  year,  MUIS\r\n\r\nprovided  training  for  some 450 religious  teachers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their religious knowledge as well as expose  them\r\n\r\nto issues in the economic and social spheres.  This would\r\n\r\nput  them  in  a  better position to help their  students\r\n\r\napply Islamic principles to life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing the efforts of mosques, there are also\r\n\r\nother  providers,  as alluded to by Dr Maliki,  including\r\n\r\nthe  Islamic  Missionary Committee, Muslim  organisations\r\n\r\nand private education centres.  Whilst there is no formal\r\n\r\naccreditation or licensing of these private centres, MUIS\r\n\r\nkeeps  regular contact with them to share and  update  on\r\n\r\nthe  developments.   These providers use  the  curriculum\r\n\r\noffered  by  MUIS and actively keep MUIS  informed  about\r\n\r\ntheir   classes.   The  mosques,  together   with   these\r\n\r\nproviders, cater to some 32,000 school-going children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time religious education is carried out by the\r\n\r\nsix madrasahs, with an annual intake of 400 pupils.  MUIS\r\n\r\nadministers the madrasahs and assists them with resources\r\n\r\nfor  teacher training, student development and curriculum\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked about the religious teachers'\r\n\r\ndirectory launched in July last year.  The directory  now\r\n\r\nlists 317\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers.   Members  of the public have  been  using  the\r\n\r\ndirectory  as a means to verify whether an individual  is\r\n\r\nregistered  with MUIS.  If an individual is  not  listed,\r\n\r\nthe public can still check with MUIS.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Muslims engage religious teachers for home-based teaching. Most home-based teachers teach\r\n\r\nrecitation  of  the  Qur'an, and do not  teach  religious\r\n\r\nclasses.  Increasingly, more people are approaching  MUIS\r\n\r\nand  the  mosques  to  ask about the credentials  of  the\r\n\r\nreligious  teachers  or to recommend  suitable  religious\r\n\r\nteachers.   At  the same time, various study  groups  and\r\n\r\nteachers  have also approached the mosques  to  let  them\r\n\r\nknow  about  their classes, so that the  mosque  is  kept\r\n\r\ninformed   of   the   developments.    These   are   good\r\n\r\ndevelopments taking place in the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I answer Mr Ahmad Khalis' question on\r\n\r\nmadrasah   education,  let  me  just  clarify  that   the\r\n\r\nbenchmark  to  be achieved by the madrasah  students  for\r\n\r\nPSLE is pegged at the average PSLE aggregate score of EM1\r\n\r\nand   EM2  Malay  pupils  in  the  six  lowest-performing\r\n\r\nnational schools, ranked according to the performance  of\r\n\r\ntheir  EM1 and EM2 Malay pupils in the PSLE of that year.\r\n\r\nSo,  we take the six lowest-performing schools, take  the\r\n\r\nMalay  students, and take that as the benchmark.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  pegged to the average score in those subjects of the\r\n\r\nsix  lowest  scoring national schools, as the Member  has\r\n\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the madrasahs, with the support of MUIS, have\r\n\r\nstrengthened  the  delivery of English,  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience to meet the requirements of compulsory education.\r\n\r\nMUIS will ensure that madrasah students are given all the\r\n\r\nnecessary help to be ready for the PSLE in 2008.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the madrasahs have significantly increased the\r\n\r\ncontact  time  for English, Mathematics  and  Science  to\r\n\r\nmatch  the  same exposure time that the national  schools\r\n\r\ndevote to these subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madrasahs have hired 14 more teachers with the\r\n\r\nrelevant   qualifications  and  teacher  training.    The\r\n\r\nmadrasah   teachers   also  attend  in-service   training\r\n\r\nconducted  to  enhance their teaching  skills  and  their\r\n\r\nproficiency  in  English.    NIE  has  agreed  to   MUIS'\r\n\r\nproposal  to accept madrasah teachers who meet the  entry\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  the Diploma of Education Programme  from\r\n\r\nthis  July.   MUIS is seeking nominations  from  the  six\r\n\r\nmadrasahs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Curriculum Development Project (CDP), which\r\n\r\ntakes  place  over six years, will revamp the  curriculum\r\n\r\nfor  Islamic  studies and Arabic language programme  from\r\n\r\nPrimary  One  to Pre-U 2.  The materials for Primary  One\r\n\r\nhave  been  completed, and teachers have been trained  to\r\n\r\nuse  them  from this year.  The next phase will focus  on\r\n\r\nthe Primary Two and Secondary One levels.  Some madrasahs\r\n\r\nprefer to deliver the new curriculum in Arabic and Malay,\r\n\r\nrather  than  in  Arabic  and English.   MUIS  will  work\r\n\r\nclosely with the madrasahs to facilitate this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS and the madrasahs fully share Mr Ahmad\r\n\r\nKhalis' views that madrasah education must be relevant to\r\n\r\nour  knowledge-based  economy and  plural  society.   The\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  will work together, in partnership with  MUIS,\r\n\r\nto  achieve  these  goals.  As I understand  it,  in  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  being rolled out by the CDP, they have  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account  some  of  the social  contexts  which  are\r\n\r\nrelevant to our Muslim students here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up on the issues raised on MUIS, let me\r\n\r\nassure  Members that MUIS will spare no effort in helping\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community move forward  as  a  community  of\r\n\r\nexcellence.   MUIS will continue to work  in  partnership\r\n\r\nwith  Muslim  or  Malay  organisations  which  share  its\r\n\r\nvision.   I  thank all those who have given their  strong\r\n\r\nsupport, and urge every member of the community to  rally\r\n\r\ntogether with MUIS.  MUIS is our institution, and  it  is\r\n\r\nour   collective  responsibility  to  work  together   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen MUIS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Dr Tan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Yes, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  seek two clarifications from the Minister.   He\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  MUIS has allocated $800,000  for  public\r\n\r\neducation.  I think that is quite a good sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many of us on the ground always have this\r\n\r\nfeeling that we are not so sure as to how ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, what is your point of\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I am coming to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please make it quick.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Yes, I think there is a lot of\r\n\r\ntime.   Very  briefly, there are so  many  practices  and\r\n\r\nsocial behaviours that non-Muslims are actually not  very\r\n\r\nsure  about,  and  I was wondering whether  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  ask  MUIS  to  give  those  on  the  ground  clear\r\n\r\ndirectives  as to what is correct behaviour and  what  is\r\n\r\nnot.   Because, sometimes, we do not know whether or  not\r\n\r\nto  shake hands with a person, and why at a function  all\r\n\r\nthe  food  must  be  halal.  We want to  get  some  clear\r\n\r\ndirective as to what is correct and what is wrong.   That\r\n\r\nis one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to seek clarification on is\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the matter on religious teachers which  I\r\n\r\nbrought  up previously, because I want to make sure  that\r\n\r\npolitics and religion are not mixed at the mosque.  Can I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister whether there are any more PAS members\r\n\r\nteaching at our mosques?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If I may clarify, actually both your\r\n\r\nquestions are not clarifications.  I think there is  some\r\n\r\nconfusion as to what is a clarification and what is  not.\r\n\r\nA  clarification  is  not  for  Members  to  ask  another\r\n\r\nquestion, but to clarify if Members do not understand  or\r\n\r\nthe   answer  is  not  clear  or,  like  you  said,   was\r\n\r\nmisunderstood.   Nevertheless, I will let  that  one  go!\r\n\r\nYou can answer Dr Tan's questions, Dr Yaacob.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the second\r\n\r\npoint,  I think Dr Tan has made a mistake there.  No  PAS\r\n\r\nteachers  are teaching in our mosques.  What happened  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  was that we had invited speakers from Malaysia\r\n\r\nwho,  when we started inviting them, were not members  of\r\n\r\nany  political party, but who have since then joined one.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  I  have  told the House, we  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation to make sure that whatever they  do\r\n\r\nin  the  mosques,  they  do  it  properly  and  meet  the\r\n\r\nobjectives that we want to meet.  This is being monitored\r\n\r\nby  MUIS.  We work together with the mosque officials  to\r\n\r\nencourage  them to first get local speakers, if possible.\r\n\r\nIf  they  really cannot and want to get foreign speakers,\r\n\r\nthey  should  be  more selective.  So, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure Dr Tan that the system is in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about practices on the ground, I would\r\n\r\nbe most happy to ask MUIS officials to speak to Dr Tan to\r\n\r\nclarify  on  some of the matters.  If Members  need  some\r\n\r\nclarification,  I  think  MUIS would  be  most  happy  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the annual report of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association (PA) provides in its vision  to\r\n\r\nbe   the  leading  organisation  in  building  an  active\r\n\r\ncommunity  where all contribute readily  to  the  nation.\r\n\r\nThe  mission provides:  to promote active citizenship and\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   harmony,  to  connect  the  citizens   for\r\n\r\ncommunity   bonding  and  volunteer  work,   to   provide\r\n\r\naffordable access to life-skill and lifestyle activities,\r\n\r\nand  to  bring the people closer to one another  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA has done well over the years. It has\r\n\r\nhistorically  grown with the progress of  Singapore  from\r\n\r\nthe  1960s  till now.  It was the brainchild of  the  PAP\r\n\r\nleadership.  It was a machinery to get the pulse and feel\r\n\r\nof  the  citizenry.   Today, PA has bloomed  on  its  own\r\n\r\nthrough  the management and administrators, organising  a\r\n\r\nwide  range of activities for our people.  PA's board  of\r\n\r\nmanagement comprises 15 members, two-thirds of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhom are PAP members, and include the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nthree Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I ask the Minister why the need for this? The\r\n\r\nMinisters  are busy people, and they should  be  released\r\n\r\nfrom  such responsibilities, unless, of course,  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to for political reasons.  Should  PA  not  be\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  the people of Singapore and  not  political\r\n\r\nleaders?  Politicians should learn to govern the  country\r\n\r\nand  leave the governing of PA and other associations  to\r\n\r\nthe  citizenry.   Would the Minister not  agree  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  preferable  if power and  responsibility  with\r\n\r\nregard to associations registered under the Societies Act\r\n\r\n-  and I believe PA is one - are spread to citizens,  and\r\n\r\nthe  political leaders should be more sporting  and  must\r\n\r\nlearn  to  be  confident  of  their  own  citizens?   Our\r\n\r\ncitizens  should be allowed to bloom and they  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the chance to hold senior positions.  Politicians,\r\n\r\nespecially  Cabinet Ministers, can always be  patrons  or\r\n\r\nadvisers of PA.  PA is an association of the people.   It\r\n\r\nshould  not be labelled as a PAP organ anymore.  It  must\r\n\r\nbe  an  institution  for  the  people  and  the  people's\r\n\r\nactivities,  and  it  must  be  depoliticised.   I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore   urge   the  Minister  to   relook   at   this\r\n\r\norganisation  and make it a people's association  without\r\n\r\ntoo  much connection with the PAP leadership in its board\r\n\r\nof management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been commented, Sir - and PA recognises this\r\n\r\n-  that  activities organised by PA are  being  supported\r\n\r\nmainly by a particular race.  I am sure PA is trying  its\r\n\r\nlevel  best  to  ensure that this problem  is  minimised.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister  consider having,  perhaps,  in  the\r\n\r\noffice-bearers  of  PA  top  management,   more   Malays,\r\n\r\nEurasians and Indians, and have this advertised, so  that\r\n\r\nall races would feel they are made welcome in PA?  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  important and crucial that all races  treat  it  as\r\n\r\ntheir   national  duty  to  participate  in  PA-sponsored\r\n\r\nactivities.   Race-related organisations must  also  help\r\n\r\nthe PA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo, you can take your\r\n\r\ntwo cuts together, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise   three  issues  with  regard  to  the   role   and\r\n\r\nperformance of the CDCs to-date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs, together with the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, have done a great job in fostering bonding\r\n\r\namong  residents.   In  the last  two  years,  CDCs  have\r\n\r\nenlarged  their scope to embrace programmes initiated  by\r\n\r\nother Ministries to help the citizens, eg, job fairs, job\r\n\r\nplacements,   and   dispensing  financial   and   welfare\r\n\r\nassistance  to  the community.  This administrative  task\r\n\r\ncan  be  very labour intensive.  My question is:  is  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  manning  strength at the CDCs adequate  for  the\r\n\r\nservice providers to do an expeditious job?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second issue, recently the newspapers\r\n\r\ncarried  some write-up on the CDCs, and the role  of  the\r\n\r\nMayors  was also questioned.  In order to keep the public\r\n\r\nmore  informed  of the work of the CDCs and  the  Mayors,\r\n\r\nperhaps  it  is  timely to produce an  annual  report  to\r\n\r\nhighlight  their milestones.  Many of our CDCs have  been\r\n\r\nrehoused  with better facilities and amenities  to  serve\r\n\r\nthe  community.  Such projects do incur expenses,  and  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they  can be  quite  substantial,  even\r\n\r\nthough they may be for a good cause.  But the public  may\r\n\r\nnot  see  it in the same light.  As such, it is important\r\n\r\nto  showcase  the CDCs' performance in an annual  report.\r\n\r\nWould  the Minister consider such a suggestion?   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe   CDCs  can  also  establish  their  key  performance\r\n\r\nindicators  as  benchmark targets, so  that  no  one  can\r\n\r\nallude  to  the Mayors of the CDCs for playing  a  lesser\r\n\r\nrole, as we have read recently in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, five CDCs had accumulated massive surpluses\r\n\r\nlast  year, some as high as $20 million.  At a time  when\r\n\r\nthe people need help, more financial assistance should be\r\n\r\nextended  to  help  the  needy.   There  should  be  less\r\n\r\nemphasis   on  accumulation  of  surpluses.   Could   the\r\n\r\nMinister provide a breakdown on the amount spent by  CDCs\r\n\r\non projects to help the needy?  Also, what is the amount\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspent   on   job  assistance,  compared  to   the   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the CDCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second cut, Sir, having been involved in\r\n\r\nchairing  feedback sessions, I would like to submit  some\r\n\r\nsuggestions   that  I  have  gotten  from  the   feedback\r\n\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the issue of closing the loop in our\r\n\r\nfeedback  process.  That was talked about before,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould still like to raise it again.  A good communication\r\n\r\nprocess  inevitably  involves  an  exchange  between  two\r\n\r\nparties.  Simply put, in a lively and dynamic process, an\r\n\r\naction  should  elicit  a reaction.   That  being  so,  a\r\n\r\nfeedback  from one party must also result in  a  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom another party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is seemingly a 2-way process during a\r\n\r\nfeedback  session,  where participants  will  share,  and\r\n\r\npanel   members   will  facilitate   by   verifying   and\r\n\r\nclarifying.  Is this good enough?  Here, I would like  to\r\n\r\nshare  typical  dialogue  and  seminar  settings  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.  Typically, after such a session,  we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  search  too  far to hear  groups  of  employees\r\n\r\ngathered  together, making such comments as:  \"As  usual,\r\n\r\nsomeone else would make the decisions that we would  have\r\n\r\nto  work and live with\", or \"Those who make the decisions\r\n\r\nrarely,  if  ever, ask us what we should  do.\"   Finally,\r\n\r\nthese  same  people vent their frustrations in personally\r\n\r\nunique  ways,  bad-mouth  their  employers  or  clam  up.\r\n\r\nConsider  the  dollars  spent  in  these  dialogues   and\r\n\r\nseminars, and ask ourselves what is really accomplished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an enterprise, the single most untapped\r\n\r\nresource  is  the  wisdom of the people who  work  there.\r\n\r\nKnowledge and expertise are the raw materials; wisdom  is\r\n\r\nthe  finished product.  When companies just focus on  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  and overlook wisdom, they are wasting  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir   greatest  assets.   Similarly,  in  our  feedback\r\n\r\nsessions,  we  are  just  focused  on  netting  the   raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  which  flow one way from the audience  to  the\r\n\r\npodium,  in  the belief that they will add value  to  the\r\n\r\nfeedback  databank.   Undeniably, such  meetings  do  add\r\n\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  they  also  squander a perfect  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nreverse  the  flow and further tap into a  resource  that\r\n\r\nwill  yield even richer returns, ie, the support  network\r\n\r\nfor implementation of policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have often asked what has happened to their\r\n\r\nfeedback.   Why  is there no feedback to their  feedback?\r\n\r\nThe process of feedback must translate into an engagement\r\n\r\nof participants.  Participants feel engaged when they see\r\n\r\nwhat   they  say  matter.   Feedback  News,  a  quarterly\r\n\r\nnewsletter  of the Feedback Unit, can be a good  feedback\r\n\r\ntool  on the feedback we have received.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether Feedback News is distributed  to\r\n\r\nevery   participant  invited  to  attend   the   feedback\r\n\r\nsessions.   At the same time, can we create a  column  in\r\n\r\nFeedback   News  that  would  highlight  the   bites   of\r\n\r\nparticipants attending the various feedback sessions  and\r\n\r\nhave   specific   commentaries  or  response   from   the\r\n\r\nsecretariat as to the follow-up action and final outcomes\r\n\r\nfor  each  of  the bites from the participants?   Through\r\n\r\nFeedback  News,  we  can  begin  to  demonstrate  that  a\r\n\r\nfeedback mechanism to the feedback sessions is indeed  in\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, are there any other ways that the Ministry\r\n\r\nis looking into to ensure an engaged process?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you have two cuts.\r\n\r\nTake them together, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Feedback Unit is\r\n\r\na  useful  tool  for our people to give  their  views  on\r\n\r\ncurrent  issues,  be  it politics,  economics  or  social\r\n\r\nmatters, and the feedback being relayed to the Government\r\n\r\nis useful to the Government for policy making.\r\n\r\nHowever, the perception must be right.  Whilst the senior\r\n\r\nofficials   have   done  a  good   job,   including   the\r\n\r\nchairpersons, the view may be that the chairperson, being\r\n\r\na  PAP  member,  may not be the ideal situation,  because\r\n\r\nthis  is a feedback session from the people.  It  may  be\r\n\r\ntimely to consider whether we should have an independent,\r\n\r\nnon-partisan person\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  repute  to  be the overall chairperson.   This  might\r\n\r\ncreate  greater  participation amongst thinking  citizens\r\n\r\nand  people  with  differing views and even  the  cynics,\r\n\r\nbecause the feedback coming from them will be very useful\r\n\r\nto our Government.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the chain of commands and what happens once\r\n\r\nfeedback  is  given to the Feedback Unit?   What  is  the\r\n\r\nfollow-up action from the Feedback Unit to the Government\r\n\r\nauthorities?  How many views given by citizens have  been\r\n\r\nadopted  by the Government in one way or other?  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  means  of  reporting back by the Government  to  the\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit  and, thereafter, to the participants  who\r\n\r\nparticipated in these feedback sessions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Feedback Unit has had several\r\n\r\nchairpersons.   Do  we  have a basis  for  assessing  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of the Feedback Unit as a whole, and is it  still\r\n\r\nconsidered a viable organisation worth keeping?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will just quickly go on to my next cut. Our\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  given  a great deal  of  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nparticipate    in   Singapore   life   through    various\r\n\r\norganisations,   including  Government  committees,   PAP\r\n\r\ncommittees,   RCs  and  other  organisations   and   also\r\n\r\nassociations formed under the Societies Act, through  the\r\n\r\nvarious 6,000-over associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, would the Minister look at the promotion of\r\n\r\ncitizenry\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticipation on a higher level, in political discussions\r\n\r\nthrough  NGOs,  and  not restrict it  to  just  political\r\n\r\nassociations?  Politics belongs to the people.   We  must\r\n\r\nencourage  them  so  that they will  show  concern  about\r\n\r\npolitical life in Singapore and more would participate in\r\n\r\npolitical activities and, hopefully, in politics  and  to\r\n\r\nrun for general elections in the years to come. There  is\r\n\r\nthis constant complaint that even the PAP may not be able\r\n\r\nto  find enough candidates of the right number, and  that\r\n\r\ncould  probably  apply  even more so  to  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nparties.   So,  by us encouraging promotion of  citizenry\r\n\r\nparticipation  in   Singapore life,  including  politics,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we could have a better feel of politics  amongst\r\n\r\nour  citizens and, therefore, they will participate  more\r\n\r\nin political life in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah is not present. Dr\r\n\r\nYaacob.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, let me address\r\n\r\nthe  issues on the Feedback Unit and active citizens, and\r\n\r\nthe other points will be taken up by MOS Chan Soo Sen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Feedback Unit solicits feedback from the\r\n\r\npeople through various channels.  It recognises the  need\r\n\r\nto   close   the   feedback  loop   with   its   feedback\r\n\r\ncontributors. It routes the feedback it receives daily to\r\n\r\nthe   Ministries,  which  then  reply  directly  to   the\r\n\r\ncontributors. So those who provide the feedback are  kept\r\n\r\nin the loop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit also publishes the Ministries' replies on\r\n\r\nits  website  and in its newsletter so that  others  with\r\n\r\nsimilar  concerns can benefit from the  sharing  of  such\r\n\r\ninformation.   All  feedback  received  is  collated  and\r\n\r\ncompiled  into  a monthly report which  is  sent  to  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries of all the Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close the loop with the Feedback Groups, the Unit\r\n\r\narranges  for the groups to meet with Ministry  officials\r\n\r\nto  discuss  their  papers  and recommendations.   Papers\r\n\r\npresented by the Feedback Groups at the Annual Conference\r\n\r\nof  Feedback  Groups  are  also routed  to  the  relevant\r\n\r\nMinistries   for   their  responses,   which   are   then\r\n\r\ncommunicated to the groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has introduced many new\r\n\r\ninitiatives  over the years to encourage Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nparticipate actively in shaping the future of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSome  recent new initiatives include the People's  Forum,\r\n\r\ntea  sessions,  web chats, regular straw  polls  and  the\r\n\r\nproduction   of   a   vernacular   language   newsletter.\r\n\r\nSignificantly,  Sir,  there  has  been  more   pre-policy\r\n\r\nconsultation.  To address\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Chandra Mohan's point, despite having chairpersons who\r\n\r\nmay  be  affiliated to political parties,  this  has  not\r\n\r\nprevented people from coming forward in joining  some  of\r\n\r\nthe sessions that the Feedback Unit has started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next month, the Unit will launch a one-stop\r\n\r\nconsultation portal that offers yet another platform  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  contribute their  views  and  ideas  on\r\n\r\nnational policies and issues online.  It will post on its\r\n\r\nwebsite,   consultation  papers   from   Ministries   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies for public comments.  Significantly,\r\n\r\nthe  portal will also provide information  to the  public\r\n\r\nwhat  to  expect  from  the  consultation  process,  what\r\n\r\nconsultation  is,  what it involves  and  how  one  could\r\n\r\ncontribute effectively to the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these initiatives by the Feedback Unit are aimed\r\n\r\nat   giving  Singaporeans,  whether  individuals,  people\r\n\r\nsector  or  private sector organisations, a multitude  of\r\n\r\nchannels  to participate in national life and  contribute\r\n\r\nin  shaping Singapore's future.  So there is no need  for\r\n\r\nus   to   encourage  NGOs  to  participate  in  political\r\n\r\ndiscussions.    We  are more than happy to  accept  their\r\n\r\nfeedback through the various channels that we have set up\r\n\r\nunder the Feedback Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging citizens to contribute their views and\r\n\r\nideas  on  national policies and issues  is  one  way  of\r\n\r\nfostering   active  citizenry  for  the   betterment   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   MCDS  also  promotes  active  citizenry   by\r\n\r\nsupporting  and  tapping  the  passion  and  energies  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  want  to  make  a  difference  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   The National Volunteer Centre, for  example,\r\n\r\nencourages  people from all walks of life to apply  their\r\n\r\nskills   and   interest  in  volunteering.   It   matches\r\n\r\ninterested   individuals   and   groups   to    volunteer\r\n\r\nopportunities.  The Centre also gives  a  grant  to  help\r\n\r\nstart  up  new  and  creative volunteer initiatives.  The\r\n\r\nNational   Volunteerism   Awards  recognise   outstanding\r\n\r\nvoluntary efforts every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I could address some of the concerns raised\r\n\r\nby Mr Chandra Mohan.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned earlier that there is no reason why  even\r\n\r\nmyself,  when I was a chairperson in one of the  Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit   discussion   groups,   should   prevent   ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans from coming forward.  In fact, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  place  on record that when I was there, chairing  the\r\n\r\nsessions, most of our sessions were actively attended  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans from all walks of life.  I do not think  the\r\n\r\npolitical  affiliation of the person  is  necessarily  an\r\n\r\nimpeding factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the basis for its success and whether\r\n\r\nit  is  still viable - we are able to attract a lot  more\r\n\r\nfeedback,  and the People's Forum, for example, attracted\r\n\r\n5,000 Singaporeans to come forward and participate in our\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I do not think we need to encourage\r\n\r\nNGOs  to engage in political discussions because they  do\r\n\r\nnot need any encouragement.  I think they know what their\r\n\r\ninterests  are,  and  where are the  channels  which  are\r\n\r\navailable, be it through the letters to the Forum page or\r\n\r\nthrough  public discussions that they have held in  their\r\n\r\nown  premises to discuss some of these issues.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  this  is  one particular factor that  will  hinder\r\n\r\npeople from entering politics.  People enter politics for\r\n\r\nthe  reason that they want to serve the nation and it has\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with the fact that previously,  they  were\r\n\r\nengaged in any political discussion, whatsoever.  I  will\r\n\r\nnow ask MOS Chan Soo Sen to reply to the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I call Mr Wong first.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I have not intended to answer this question by Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan.  But he seemed to have a consistent  theme\r\n\r\nin several amendments he filed on the various Ministries'\r\n\r\nHeads,  for  example,  getting the people  to  join  this\r\n\r\norganisation,   getting   the   people   to   run    that\r\n\r\norganisation,  getting  people to  take  charge  of  this\r\n\r\norganisation, and even getting the Prime Minister  to  be\r\n\r\nrotated  among  the  Cabinet.  I  thought  that  since  I\r\n\r\nanswered some of these in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   PMO's  Head,  I  should  deal  with  this  question\r\n\r\nconcerning the PA.

That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I feel it is my responsibility to answer this rather\r\n\r\nthan just leaving it to MOS Chan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PA was set up in 1960 under an Act of\r\n\r\nParliament.  It is an Act of Parliament and not a society\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Societies Act.   So  it  stands  by\r\n\r\nitself with statutory authority.  And, in a provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  Act,  it  provides that the Prime  Minister  be  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the People's Association.  Why is the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   the  Chairman  of  the  People's  Association?\r\n\r\nBecause  the  PA  is an institution for promoting  racial\r\n\r\nharmony,  social cohesion and national unity.   The  PA's\r\n\r\noriginal charter was to set up community centres all over\r\n\r\nSingapore  so that residents of all races can intermingle\r\n\r\ntogether   and  build  understanding  and   bonds   among\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, since 1993, when I became Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the PA, I also brought into PA the  various\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations which, at one time, used  to  be\r\n\r\nunder   the  Prime  Minister's  Office  -  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee, the Residents' Committee  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  years, the Civil Defence  Committee,  the\r\n\r\nBoys'  Club, formerly run by the Police, and  the  latest\r\n\r\none is the Constituency Sports Committee.  All these have\r\n\r\nbeen put together under the PA's guidance because we feel\r\n\r\nthat  the people serving in these various committees  are\r\n\r\nvolunteers, and they are the people who spend their  time\r\n\r\norganising  activities and events  and  in  bringing  the\r\n\r\npeople   together  so  that  they  can  have   a   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of one another and to build a social  bond,\r\n\r\nas  provided for in the original PA's charter.   That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Prime  Minister is in charge.  That  is  why  a\r\n\r\nMinister, appointed by the Prime Minister, is the  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman.   Because  it is a community  organisation,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  necessarily mean that it must be  run  by  the\r\n\r\npeople in the way Mr Mohan wants.  It means that they are\r\n\r\nrun  by  the  people who represent the  people.  And,  as\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament are elected by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  voters to represent the people, just as Mr Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  and Mr Chiam are the people's representatives  in\r\n\r\nHougang  and in Potong Pasir, so we represent the people.\r\n\r\nWe  do not flinch from it.  Yes, we are busy, our MPs are\r\n\r\nbusy,  but we will make time for what is necessary to  be\r\n\r\nof service to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA is not an organisation made up of only\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers.   The PA has  about  100  corporate\r\n\r\nmembers,   ranging   from   social,   sports,   cultural,\r\n\r\neducational clubs, cadet groups, and so on.  Four members\r\n\r\nfrom  among  them  are elected onto the  PA  Board  on  a\r\n\r\nregular basis and, therefore, they are represented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA management is like any Government department.\r\n\r\nThey are made up of people who are appointed on their own\r\n\r\nmerit.   We  do  not have specific quotas set  aside  for\r\n\r\npeople  of particular races.  To do so is totally against\r\n\r\nmeritocracy,   the  principle  which   we   practise   in\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But at various levels of PA, we  have  staff\r\n\r\nwho are of different ethnic groups, as you can see in our\r\n\r\ncommunity centres and various other secretariats  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make this point very clear to Mr Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan.   His  idea seems refreshing, but I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat,  at  the end of it, anybody has any idea  who  will\r\n\r\nmake  the organisation work.  So let us be practical,  be\r\n\r\nrealistic,  and  do  what  is  necessary  to   make   the\r\n\r\ninstitution work for the benefit of Singaporeans.  I will\r\n\r\nleave the rest of the answers to Mr Chan Soo Sen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I will address Mr Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan's  point  about multi-racial participation  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association's activities.  In fact, that is what\r\n\r\nPA  is  all  about.   Among PA's  objectives  are  racial\r\n\r\nharmony, social cohesion and, of course, the link between\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  people.  And, therefore,  promoting\r\n\r\nmulti-racial activities has been a very key  priority  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association. Over the years, the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduced many initiatives to draw more people from  all\r\n\r\nethnic groups to join the activities, as well as to serve\r\n\r\nas  grassroots leaders. There are far too  many  of  such\r\n\r\nexamples.  I do not think I want to waste the time of the\r\n\r\nHouse  by  elaborating  them.  I will  probably  send  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan a copy of the PA's Annual Report and, if he\r\n\r\nneeds to, I can go through some of these activities  with\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to highlight just a few. Firstly, the\r\n\r\nInter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs). After the  IRCCs\r\n\r\nhave  been set up, it has so far organised 200 activities\r\n\r\nto  promote inter-racial understanding. There is  also  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  called Ethnic Bonding Homestay Programme.   It\r\n\r\nwas  introduced in school by North East CDC to  celebrate\r\n\r\nRacial  Harmony Day 2001.  Under this programme, families\r\n\r\nadopt  a child of a different race for a weekend, and  we\r\n\r\nhave a plan to expand this programme.  There are also the\r\n\r\nMalay   Activities   Executive   Committee   and   Indian\r\n\r\nActivities   Executive  Committee   in   our   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.    They   promote   the   various   ethnic\r\n\r\nactivities so as to promote better understanding  between\r\n\r\nthese groups as well as other ethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as an added incentive to encourage greater\r\n\r\nminority   participation,  PA  gives  bonus   points   to\r\n\r\ncommunity  clubs, like CCs, as well as  RCs,  which  have\r\n\r\nattained  a  high level of multi-racial participation  in\r\n\r\ntheir programmes and activities.  Every year, we rank our\r\n\r\nCCs  and  RCs,  and the ranking points give weightage  to\r\n\r\nmore multi-racial participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now address Mdm Ho Geok Choo's point\r\n\r\nabout  CDC.   She raised three points.  First,  she  said\r\n\r\nthat  because of the enlarged scope of activities,  which\r\n\r\nare all very labour-intensive, do we have enough staff in\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  to  handle these tasks.  The  answer  is  yes,\r\n\r\nbecause  when a new function is given to the CDC it  must\r\n\r\ncome   with  the  resources  needed  to  implement  these\r\n\r\nfunctions.  This has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen the understanding that the People's Association  has\r\n\r\nwith  the various Ministries.  So, if they hand over  the\r\n\r\njob,  they will have to also hand over the money as  well\r\n\r\nas the head-counts.  From that point of view, whenever we\r\n\r\nundertake a task, we will have the resources to implement\r\n\r\nit.   And,  very importantly, in the CDCs, the volunteers\r\n\r\nplay  a very important role, and they do play a big  role\r\n\r\nin  helping out in implementing these activities.  It  is\r\n\r\nthrough the participation of active citizens that we are,\r\n\r\nto put it this way, never alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo also suggested having annual\r\n\r\nreports  for  the  CDCs because she said  that  not  many\r\n\r\npeople  know  what the Mayors are doing.  I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat form of annual report she is thinking of.  If she is\r\n\r\nthinking about printing a proper annual report, like  the\r\n\r\nTown Council's annual report, it will cost about $20,000-$30,000  to print a few hundred copies.  We feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  not necessary.  But there are a few ways that we  can\r\n\r\ndo  to  highlight more of these activities.  One  way  is\r\n\r\nthat  the various CDCs do have their newsletters.   Maybe\r\n\r\nthey   can   consider,   in  one  of   the   newsletters,\r\n\r\nhighlighting their annual activities.  So it becomes some\r\n\r\nkind  of an annual report.  The other possibility is  for\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association's Annual Report to  give  more\r\n\r\npages  to  CDCs,  so that each CDC will  have  individual\r\n\r\nchapters  and  sections devoted to  them.   The  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation would definitely look into this.  All  of  us\r\n\r\nagree  that we should give CDC activities as well as  the\r\n\r\nMayor's role more publicity, so that our residents  would\r\n\r\nknow what they are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on surpluses and whether the CDCs have been\r\n\r\ngiving financial assistance to the residents, I would say\r\n\r\nthat  the CDCs have actually done much towards this  end.\r\n\r\nSince  2001,  we have taken on more local  and  community\r\n\r\nfunctions from the user Ministries.  That includes Public\r\n\r\nAssistance,  Rent  Utilities  Assistance  Schemes,  Small\r\n\r\nFamily Improvement Scheme, and so on.  In year 2002, CDCs\r\n\r\nhave  disbursed close to $21 million to help 24,000 needy\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  various  categories.   CDCs  are   also\r\n\r\nresponsible for developing and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunding   childcare,  student  care  and  family  service\r\n\r\ncentres.    All   of  these  contribute  towards   social\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and,  in some ways, help  towards  the  more\r\n\r\nneedy  families.  We spent about $8 million  in  2002  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and maintain 74 such community facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But CDCs also operate on the philosophy that we do\r\n\r\nnot  just  give a fish.  We want to teach people  how  to\r\n\r\nfish  and  the  best welfare is to help them  find  work.\r\n\r\nSince  December  2001,  the CDCs  have  worked  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower to provide job matching  services.\r\n\r\nSo   far,   they  have  done  it  for  32,000  retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  We have organised 14 community  job  fairs\r\n\r\nas  well  as arranged 53 local job orientation  workshops\r\n\r\nand  visits  to  various industries, such as  wafer  fab,\r\n\r\nhospitality,   marine   and  transport   industries,   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  retrenched workers to try to  work  in  these\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2002, we had also worked with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Manpower to pilot the Train-and-Place Programme.  This\r\n\r\nprogramme offers training and employment opportunities in\r\n\r\ninformal sectors where there is demand for manpower.  The\r\n\r\nCDCs have started the programme in areas such as domestic\r\n\r\ncleaning, eldercare, childcare, confinement nannies,  spa\r\n\r\nand beauty care, netball coaching, logistics, cooking and\r\n\r\ncatering,  as  well as horticulture and gardening.   This\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  helpful for those older and  lower-skilled\r\n\r\nretrenched Singaporeans.  The CDCs have trained about 600\r\n\r\npersons and about 40% of them have found jobs.  About  $2\r\n\r\nmillion has been spent to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would want to say that the CDCs have been doing\r\n\r\ntheir part in helping the less well-off Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nthe retrenched Singaporeans.  Certainly, we will do more,\r\n\r\nbut  the  CDC is also a people-sector community  oriented\r\n\r\norganisation.   The various Mayors who  are  seated  over\r\n\r\nthere  have, through their channels, reached out  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, assessed their needs and attracted  new  ideas\r\n\r\nand  volunteers  to  get  the  programme  started.   This\r\n\r\nprocess will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want the Minister to\r\n\r\nexplain something about the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPA  which  I do not understand.  The PA's purpose  is  to\r\n\r\npromote racial harmony and social cohesion.  One thing  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand is that Opposition  Members  who  are\r\n\r\nelected by the majority of the constituents are kept  out\r\n\r\nof  organisations or sub-organisations of  the  PA,  like\r\n\r\nCCCs, RCs, CDCs, Boys' Club, including the CC itself.  So\r\n\r\nhow  can  you  promote social cohesion when  the  elected\r\n\r\nMembers are kept out of these organisations?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, I am sorry I cannot allow\r\n\r\nthat  clarification.  Mr Wong, you  want  to  answer  the\r\n\r\nquestion?  All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is important to answer this\r\n\r\nquestion  because we have many new Members in this  House\r\n\r\nand  they are not familiar with the answers which I  have\r\n\r\ngiven   Mr  Chiam  in  the  past.   PA  is  a  Government\r\n\r\norganisation.   It  is  a  statutory  board  to   promote\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies which also include promoting  racial\r\n\r\nharmony, social cohesion, bonding, etc.  Therefore, to do\r\n\r\nthis  particular  job it would have to be representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government benches.  If Mr Chiam  were  to  do\r\n\r\nthat,  we  do not know whether he will be promoting  what\r\n\r\nthe  Government wants to do because, if he does, he would\r\n\r\nnot be in the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have another\r\n\r\nclarification, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me hear first and then I will\r\n\r\ndecide  whether it is a clarification or not.

How does  he  know  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition would not support the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, that would be the first time\r\n\r\nI  hear the Opposition supports the Government.  If  that\r\n\r\nis the case, then we will just look at the voting records\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition.  I am talking about  voting  records\r\n\r\nbecause  we  will see that sometimes they do not  support\r\n\r\nwhat  we do.  But, back to the question  why Mr Chiam  is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  in  the  community centre.   The  community\r\n\r\ncentre  organises  activities  for  the  people.    Their\r\n\r\nadvisers are there to help these grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nto do their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Clarification, Sir.

I do not mean the \"Government\" as  the  PAP.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  we  are always against the  PAP  on  certain\r\n\r\nissues because we do not think that those issues are good\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore.

About half of these slots are allocated to the\r\n\r\nNSAs, such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas the NSA for football and rugby, the S-League clubs and\r\n\r\nthe  Constituency  Sports Club.

Also, two abandoned  babies  were  found\r\n\r\ndead.   If  nothing  is  done, Sir,  many  more  of  such\r\n\r\nunwanted  babies will die.  Sir, the purpose of  my  call\r\n\r\nfor the establishment of baby-drops is to save lives.   I\r\n\r\ndo  think  that  the  Government has a responsibility  to\r\n\r\nbuild  baby-drops for those unwanted and abandoned babies\r\n\r\nborn through no fault of their own.  They deserve to live\r\n\r\nand  the  Government must endeavour  in  its  efforts  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  mindset of the people to  accept  baby-drops\r\n\r\nand, at the same time, continue to teach morality and sex\r\n\r\neducation in schools for the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been told that the Minister has, earlier\r\n\r\non  in  the day, dealt with this issue but, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nalthough he does not agree with the establishment of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficial  baby-drops, I would ask him, for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nsaving  the lives of abandoned babies, whether or not  he\r\n\r\nwill  allow unofficial baby-drops in places like premises\r\n\r\nof charitable organisations, churches and other places of\r\n\r\nworship,  private hospitals and other suitable designated\r\n\r\nplaces,  and these places be made known to the public  so\r\n\r\nthat  mothers with unwanted babies could put their babies\r\n\r\nthere  and,  more importantly, these mothers suffer  from\r\n\r\nshame.  I think they also fear prosecution for abandoning\r\n\r\ntheir  babies.   I  wonder  whether  the  Minister  could\r\n\r\nconsider  a  kind  of compromise and not prosecute  these\r\n\r\nmothers   when   they  leave  their   babies   in   these\r\n\r\ndepositories specially designated for unwanted babies and\r\n\r\ntreat them not as abandoning babies, but babies left  for\r\n\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Yaacob, do you want to give the\r\n\r\nsame answer that you gave this morning?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, let me just\r\n\r\nsummarise  the answer.  We have discussed  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nbaby  drops  earlier, and we know that in  the  countries\r\n\r\nwhere  they have tried, it has not really succeeded.  The\r\n\r\nmore  important point to remember is that if  the  mother\r\n\r\nwere  to  come forward to the various agencies,  we  will\r\n\r\nhelp her.  It is not an offence and we will not prosecute\r\n\r\nher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want to assure the members of the public is\r\n\r\nthat  the  system that we have in place is adequate.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  as mentioned earlier this morning, we are stepping\r\n\r\nup publicity in all the Residents' Committees with fliers\r\n\r\nto  inform  members of the public that they also  have  a\r\n\r\nrole  to  play in helping our women folk who are affected\r\n\r\nby  this  to walk through the process.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\ninform  Mr  Chiam that we are not in favour of having  an\r\n\r\nofficial baby drop.  But if anybody comes forward to  our\r\n\r\nhomes, I would encourage members of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe public to use  the official channels that we  have in\r\n\r\nplace.   Officials  at the homes such as  Pertapis,  Rose\r\n\r\nVilla  and even some of the FSCs, will walk through  with\r\n\r\nour  women folk the options that they have, and  we  will\r\n\r\nensure confidentiality of the information that they would\r\n\r\nwant to volunteer to the social workers.  I would like to\r\n\r\nassure  Mr Chiam that the system is already in  place.  I\r\n\r\ncited  some  numbers earlier.  Last year, well  over  800\r\n\r\ninquiries  were received by all the various  homes  which\r\n\r\nare  designed  to  help such mothers.   The  numbers  are\r\n\r\nencouraging.   The  experiences in other  countries  have\r\n\r\nshown  that  baby-drops, despite being  legal,  have  not\r\n\r\nreally worked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification?\r\n\r\nAlthough  the Minister says that much publicity has  been\r\n\r\ngiven,  I just want to know whether more publicity  could\r\n\r\nbe  given.   Because  we still read in  the  papers  that\r\n\r\nbabies are dying in rubbish dumps.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

In fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave  started  to  do  so,  as I mentioned  earlier  this\r\n\r\nmorning, to put such fliers in the Residents' Committees.\r\n\r\nIf  the Member for Potong Pasir is interested, I can give\r\n\r\nhim  50  or 100 fliers for him to pin up all over  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, do you now want to drop your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nanswer and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Charles Chong.\r\n\r\nYou  have  three  cuts  here.

The  running  costs  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  programme, as listed  on  page  112  of  the\r\n\r\nBudget  book, indicate a large variance  in the estimated\r\n\r\nFY  2002  figure  and the revised FY 2002  figures.   The\r\n\r\nvariance  amounts  to more than $33 million.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  tell  us  what was the reason  for  this  large\r\n\r\nvariance?  And can the People's Association cope  with  a\r\n\r\n$4.82 million reduction in its FY 2003 expenditure?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on page 113 of the Budget book, I notice that a\r\n\r\nsum  of $85,870,000 appears to have been set aside for  a\r\n\r\nnew  building  at the People's Association  headquarters.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister enlighten us on when this new building\r\n\r\nwill  be  constructed?   And  what  will  happen  to  the\r\n\r\nhistorical  Kallang  Airport  building,  that   currently\r\n\r\nhouses the People's Association?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the same page of the Budget book, a sum of\r\n\r\n$10,357,200 has been allocated for the upgrading  of  the\r\n\r\nfacilities   at   the   National   Community   Leadership\r\n\r\nInstitute.   Could the Minister give us details  on  this\r\n\r\nexpenditure, and will the number of training  places  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  at  the Institute be substantially  increased\r\n\r\nand improved as a result of this $10.3 million provision?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on community centres and\r\n\r\ncommunity clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, community centres served as very\r\n\r\nimportant  focal  points  for  community  activities  and\r\n\r\ninteraction, especially in the kampongs and in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.   The kampongs and the rural areas are now  mostly\r\n\r\ngone  as  a result of redevelopment.  However,  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  the  humble community centres have  evolved  into\r\n\r\nvery  impressive  and  also,  sometimes,  very  expensive\r\n\r\ncommunity clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre  community centres and community clubs still relevant\r\n\r\ntoday,  as  they  were  in  the  past,  to  justify   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure on them?  There are already many  clubs  that\r\n\r\ncater  not  only for the rich and famous, but also  clubs\r\n\r\nfor   businessmen,  NSmen,  policemen,  civil   servants,\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders, union members and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on page 113 of the Budget book, under the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association development expenditure, more than a\r\n\r\n$1/4  billion, or precisely $257,720,760, appears to have\r\n\r\nbeen  set aside for community centres and community clubs\r\n\r\nunder  various headings.  The figures on page 115 of  the\r\n\r\nBudget  book indicate that the number of participants  in\r\n\r\nactivities organised by the 106 CCs in 2000 and 2001  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCs  in 2002 is, on average, declining, from $28,000\r\n\r\nper  CC in year 2000 to $26,500 in year 2001, and $25,500\r\n\r\nin year 2002.  Could the Minister tell us whether CCs are\r\n\r\nstill as relevant as they are with the aspirations of our\r\n\r\npopulation today?  And how many more CCs are we  planning\r\n\r\nto  build  in  addition to the 111 that we  already  have\r\n\r\ntoday?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third cut is on grassroots leaders. The\r\n\r\nPeople's Association imposed a 65 years age limit on  key\r\n\r\nappointment  holders  in  grassroots  organisations  last\r\n\r\nyear.   More  recently, the number  of  terms  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  can serve in key positions has been  limited  to\r\n\r\nthree  terms.   Could  the  Minister  tell  us  how  many\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders have been retired from key  positions\r\n\r\ndue  to the age limit, and the number of members who have\r\n\r\nto  relinquish  their posts within  the  next  12  months\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  term  limit?   Have  there  been   any\r\n\r\nexceptions made to this, and what were the reasons  given\r\n\r\nfor   these   exceptions?   Has  there  been   difficulty\r\n\r\nreplacing these leaders with equally competent people who\r\n\r\nhave proven track records  in community service, and  not\r\n\r\njust academic qualifications?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, a pilot scheme allowing residents\r\n\r\nto nominate the RC members was started in some precincts.\r\n\r\nSir,  I am delighted to learn that the scheme has been  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.  However,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  may not go far enough to allow residents  to\r\n\r\nchoose  their representatives.  Would the Minister permit\r\n\r\nthose  precincts that not only want to nominate but  also\r\n\r\nto elect their RC members to do so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, first and foremost, I would\r\n\r\nlike   to  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge   the\r\n\r\ntremendous  contribution of the  grassroots  leaders  and\r\n\r\nother  volunteers.   Many of them are people  movers  and\r\n\r\nshakers who have helped shape and stabilise Singapore and\r\n\r\nare integral to the shape of Singapore to come.  In fact,\r\n\r\nin  the last year or so, as this House has been busy, the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders have been equally  busy.   They  were\r\n\r\nbusy  understanding and disseminating  information  about\r\n\r\nthe  9/11  incident,  the Jemaah Islamiyah  arrests,  the\r\n\r\nwater  issue  and now even more needs to be done  in  the\r\n\r\nweeks  and months to come to ensure that whatever happens\r\n\r\nin the Gulf, whatever happens to the Iraq war, there will\r\n\r\nbe  peace  and harmony, especially religious  and  racial\r\n\r\nharmony, in Singapore.  Most of these grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nare  volunteers  and, through sheer altruism,  contribute\r\n\r\ntheir   time  and  energy  for  the  betterment  of   our\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Many sacrifice time, effort and even  money.\r\n\r\nI  ask  myself what do they reap from it.  Is  it  money?\r\n\r\nThere is none.  Is it power?  Not necessarily so.  Is  it\r\n\r\nprestige?   Well, there are only so many PBMs  and  BBMs.\r\n\r\nSo, what then could be the greatest gift?  I think it  is\r\n\r\npersonal growth.  As they help our society to grow,  what\r\n\r\ncan we do to help them to grow further?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the People's Association is doing a\r\n\r\ntremendous  job in helping to recruit new volunteers  and\r\n\r\ndoing  part  of the training.  It also helps  to  provide\r\n\r\nsome resources to help grassroots organisations like  RCs\r\n\r\nand  the various Cs to start up.  But it can do more  not\r\n\r\nonly to recruit and train new volunteers but also do more\r\n\r\nfor the existing volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider a few\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To extend the range of courses to include\r\n\r\npersonal  development and family management, or even  in-depth  courses like fundamentals of public administration\r\n\r\nand  so  on, because a lot of our new grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nare  people of quite good calibre.  When they  grow,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they  can  manage  their family  and  their  career\r\n\r\nbetter, I think they would become even better volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increase funding resources to make it more\r\n\r\ngenerous,  so that cash strapped grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  hard pressed to choose between  allocating\r\n\r\nresources  for  individual  growth  vis-a-vis   that   of\r\n\r\ncommunity needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Organise more international exchange programmes\r\n\r\nto   encourage  wider  experience.   In  an  increasingly\r\n\r\ncomplex  world, our grassroots leaders need  to  be  well\r\n\r\nplaced,   and  they  can  benefit  from  cross   cultural\r\n\r\nexchanges of views and opinions with other like fashioned\r\n\r\ninternational organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Grassroots Club. I understand that the\r\n\r\nGrassroots  Club  is currently under-utilised.    Perhaps\r\n\r\nmore  could  be  done to turn it into another  venue  for\r\n\r\ncourses.   It can do the part of bringing more people  to\r\n\r\nthe Club.  I think that is good for the Club itself.  And\r\n\r\nif  it can also decentralise some of the training centres\r\n\r\nand  make  it more accessible to the grassroots,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a win-win strategy for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, Mr Charles Chong asked three\r\n\r\nquestions.  Firstly, the basis for reduction of the  cost\r\n\r\nand  whether  after the reduction, there is still  enough\r\n\r\nmoney  to run our programmes.  I would say that the basis\r\n\r\nfor  reduction  of  the  cost takes  a  bit  to  explain.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can talk about it separately, as I do not have\r\n\r\nthe details with me here.  The more important question is\r\n\r\nwhether the reduction would affect our activities.   Part\r\n\r\nof  the  answer  was actually given when  I  answered  an\r\n\r\nearlier  question.  Although we are doing more,  firstly,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  the  only  Government  agency  that  has  a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  expenditure.  The budget  situation  being\r\n\r\nvery tight this year, I think\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  of  us would have to exercise an economy drive.   We\r\n\r\nall  have  to  apply our mind to make the dollar  stretch\r\n\r\nfurther.  So the People's Association will be doing that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we rely on\r\n\r\nvolunteers to carry out a lot of our activities. When  we\r\n\r\nhave  new  functions, they will come  together  with  the\r\n\r\nresources, the manpower, headcount as well as the  money.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a new function that is to be allocated,  we\r\n\r\nwill  go  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  additional\r\n\r\nfunding.   And  when  there is a need,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  is  usually helpful.  I am not saying  that  the\r\n\r\nprocess  is  necessarily easy.  They will scrutinise  our\r\n\r\njustification.   But  if there is a need  to  do  certain\r\n\r\nprojects and there is additional need for money, it  will\r\n\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the new building. The\r\n\r\nbuilding activity in the People's Association is actually\r\n\r\nto  replace  some  of  the  old container-type  temporary\r\n\r\nbuildings  housing many of our subordinate organisations.\r\n\r\nIf  Members come to the People's Association at the  west\r\n\r\nblock, they will find many such temporary buildings  and,\r\n\r\ncurrently, there is building activity to build  something\r\n\r\nmore  permanent. So there is no question of tearing  down\r\n\r\nour  facilities at Kallang and rebuild.  That  particular\r\n\r\nitem is not for that purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the National Community Leadership\r\n\r\nInstitute (NACLI) is concerned, it is actually related to\r\n\r\nMiss  Penny Low's point on whether we are going to  spend\r\n\r\nadditional money on NACLI and whether there has been  any\r\n\r\nincrease in the type of courses.  Perhaps I will  address\r\n\r\nthis point a little later.\r\n\r\nMr Charles Chong also asked whether the community centres\r\n\r\nare  still relevant.  Of course, they are still relevant.\r\n\r\nWe  know that, nowadays, people have more choices.  There\r\n\r\nare other places to go to.  But all our community centres\r\n\r\nand   community  clubs  are  doing  their  bit  to   make\r\n\r\nthemselves relevant and to attract the residents to  come\r\n\r\nto them.  Despite the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslight  decline  in  the  number  of  attendance  at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, they are still relevant.  We will take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the needs when we build the community\r\n\r\nclubs  and community centres.  If we find that  there  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  declining  population or  attendance  at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre, then that community centre or community\r\n\r\nclub  may be closed.  So this particular review is  going\r\n\r\non all the time.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the age limit for the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders, as well as for certain figures.   On\r\n\r\n1st  April 2002, the People's Association introduced  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age  limit  of  65 only  for  key  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders.   These  are for the Chairmen,  Secretaries  and\r\n\r\nTreasurers  of the CCCs and the CCMCs.  On  1st  February\r\n\r\n2003,  we implemented a new guideline limiting the tenure\r\n\r\nof  RC and Neighbourhood Committee Chairman to only three\r\n\r\nconsecutive terms, with a total of six years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of these new guidelines really is to\r\n\r\nencourage leadership renewal within the CCCs, CCMCs,  RCs\r\n\r\nand  MCs,  especially in those key posts  like  Chairman,\r\n\r\nSecretary as well as Treasurer.  For these three  members\r\n\r\nwho  have stepped down, there are other options for them.\r\n\r\nThey can be committee members and continue to serve.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the  Chairman,  for  those  who  are  very\r\n\r\noutstanding, they can become honorary patron or immediate\r\n\r\npast  Chairman  and  can  continue  to  contribute  their\r\n\r\nexperience as well as their knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the implementation has been smooth.\r\n\r\nSince  1st April 2002, 24 key appointment holders in  the\r\n\r\nCCCs and CCMCs have relinquished their posts with the new\r\n\r\nguideline.   Another 16 key CCC and CCMC  office  bearers\r\n\r\nwould  be  due  to  retire  in the  next  12  months,  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the age limit.  Also, a total of  111  RC\r\n\r\nand two NC Chairmen would be due to step down in the next\r\n\r\n12  months when they reach a three-year term.  Some would\r\n\r\nbe appointed, as I have said, as immediate past Chairmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-date,  seven new RCs have new Chairmen as a result  of\r\n\r\nthis rule.  Only two appeals have been received so far to\r\n\r\nextend  the term and these are under consideration.   So,\r\n\r\ngenerally, the implementation has been smooth.  There are\r\n\r\na  small number of cases of advisors coming to appeal  to\r\n\r\nsay that this particular person is still very much needed\r\n\r\nand  we  will consider, but the number is small.  If  the\r\n\r\njustification is there, we would allow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked about the residents'\r\n\r\nnomination  scheme.  This scheme is currently piloted  in\r\n\r\n<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RCs.   Amongst them, 19 have carried out the exercise\r\n\r\nand  the remaining two RCs will complete the exercise  by\r\n\r\nAugust  2003.  To-date, the 19 RCs have received a  total\r\n\r\nof 65 nominations, and amongst them, 32 have already been\r\n\r\nappointed into the RCs.  We have people coming  from  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life and profession.  I think the results  are\r\n\r\nvery,  very encouraging.  The scheme is there to actually\r\n\r\nsupplement  the existing system of appointing  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders.  In other words, it is an additional alternative\r\n\r\nto  try  and  encourage  more people  to  come  in.   The\r\n\r\nresults,  I  must say, have proven that the scheme  is  a\r\n\r\nuseful additional means of recruiting new RC leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PA is prepared to consider extending the scheme to\r\n\r\nthe  other  RCs if advisors recommend so.  If Mr  Charles\r\n\r\nChong is interested, we can talk about it later.  By  the\r\n\r\nway,  this  is  not an election scheme.  It  is  just  an\r\n\r\nadditional system to bring in new grassroots leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low talked about the training for the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders.  Yes, I certainly  agree  with  Miss\r\n\r\nPenny  Low about the contribution given by the grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders.   When the grassroots leaders join us, the  most\r\n\r\nimportant attribute that they must have is the  heart  to\r\n\r\nserve.   If  they  have a heart to serve  and  when  they\r\n\r\nactually  start to serve, they would pick up  the  skills\r\n\r\nalong  the  way.   This has been the  kind  of  so-called\r\n\r\ntraining  that a grassroots leader will receive.   If  we\r\n\r\nask some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our grassroots leaders what they have benefited  from\r\n\r\nbeing a grassroots leader, they would tell you that it is\r\n\r\nthe  exposure, the opportunity to enlarge the  circle  of\r\n\r\none's contacts, as well as to enrich one's life.  So, the\r\n\r\nexperience  of participating in a grassroots organisation\r\n\r\nis already a very good form of training.  But, of course,\r\n\r\nthere  are  other training opportunities available.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  National  Community  Leadership  Institute\r\n\r\n(NACLI), which Mr Charles Chong mentioned by quoting from\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  book, organises a very, very broad  list  of\r\n\r\ncourses.  If he wants, we can provide more details.   But\r\n\r\nI will just read out some of the titles ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chan, we have another amendment to\r\n\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Okay, Sir.

And  I  think\r\n\r\nthat justifies the additional money that we need in order\r\n\r\nto fund NACLI.  The advisors can certainly approach NACLI\r\n\r\nto  tailor  some  courses for the volunteers  to  go  for\r\n\r\nleadership  courses.

Could  the   Minister\r\n\r\ntherefore  tell us how much has been spent, in  terms  of\r\n\r\npublic funds and manpower cost, in the administration  of\r\n\r\nthe scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, when Mr Charles Chong asked\r\n\r\na  question  in the House earlier this month, the  Second\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance told us that the scheme  attracted\r\n\r\nsomething  like  14,000  applications  and,  out  of  the\r\n\r\n14,000,  only two were successful, and they were given  a\r\n\r\nvery princely sum of $177.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know the Second Minister went at great length\r\n\r\nto  explain the rationale behind the scheme and, in fact,\r\n\r\nhe said that it was an opportunity for us to calculate to\r\n\r\nthe  applicants  to  show specifically  that  the  offset\r\n\r\npackage  that they get more than pays for the  additional\r\n\r\nGST  expenditure, and that he thinks that it also  allows\r\n\r\nus  to win the converts to the GST scheme.  Sir, I am not\r\n\r\ntoo  sure  about  this.  All I know is  that  I  had  one\r\n\r\nexperience trying to explain the scheme to an old man and\r\n\r\nto tell him why he could not qualify.  All he did, at the\r\n\r\nend,  was  to  look at me and say, \"Wah boh kow  ree.\"  - money not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so concerned with the dollars and cents of\r\n\r\nimplementing the scheme, but I think the danger  here  is\r\n\r\nthe  political cost to the Government.  We have given  so\r\n\r\nmuch publicity to the scheme.  A lot of people have come.\r\n\r\nYes,  I  know there are some who just come to  try  their\r\n\r\nluck.  But, at the end of the day, I think we have a  lot\r\n\r\nof  people  leaving with a sour taste  in  their  mouths.\r\n\r\nSince  our  experience in 1994, when we  first  had  this\r\n\r\nscheme  -  at that time, we only had 30 applications  and\r\n\r\nthis  time, we just have two - I am wondering why we want\r\n\r\nto have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme.  Since we have the money, ie, $3 million\r\n\r\nallocated, it would be better to have this money given to\r\n\r\nthe welfare fund of all CCCs.  If we divide $3 million by\r\n\r\n84  constituencies, I think each of us would get $35,000.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  that, over the years, MPs and the grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders have got the experience to tell the genuine  ones\r\n\r\nfrom the needy ones.  And I think we could do with a  bit\r\n\r\nmore money to help those who are really deserving in  our\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, to understand the phenomenon,\r\n\r\nwe  have got to see the CCC assistance scheme in context.\r\n\r\nThe  scheme  was there because there was an assurance  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government that, with the introduction  of  the  GST\r\n\r\nplus  all  the rebates and relief, nobody will  lose  out\r\n\r\noverall  in  tax terms in the next five  years.   And  in\r\n\r\norder to put the money where the mouth is, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  set  aside $3 million and anybody who feels that  he\r\n\r\nhas  lost out can come and apply, and the money is  there\r\n\r\nand we will give the rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the scheme was there when GST was first\r\n\r\nintroduced.   Therefore, when we increased the  GST  this\r\n\r\ntime,  there  must  be a scheme there to  give  the  same\r\n\r\nassurance.   There  is, of course, a  difference  in  the\r\n\r\nsituation between 1994 and 2002.  In 1994, we were  doing\r\n\r\nwell economically and there were no such handouts, so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  from the Budget.  There was no EDRS.  There  were\r\n\r\nno  various  types  of  rebate schemes.   Therefore,  the\r\n\r\npeople  would  just  apply when they  thought  they  were\r\n\r\neligible.   But,  now,  after  introducing  the   various\r\n\r\nschemes  to help the people because our economy is  doing\r\n\r\nbadly,  when they hear about this, they feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nsome   kind  of  a  handout.   Therefore,  20,000  people\r\n\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked whether we use additional\r\n\r\nresources.  We did not use additional resources.  Our CCC\r\n\r\nstaff  and grassroots leaders mobilise themselves to  try\r\n\r\nto  explain to the residents who come.  It has  not  been\r\n\r\neasy.  But there is no additional public money involved,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npartly  because we did not expect that type of  response.\r\n\r\nNow,  the  number has indeed dwindled.  In the first  two\r\n\r\nweeks  of  February, it was 3,500; and in  the  last  two\r\n\r\nweeks  of  February it was 1,800.  So I think people  are\r\n\r\nbeginning to understand what the scheme is all about  and\r\n\r\nthey are not coming forward to apply anymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon says that since we do not need the\r\n\r\n$3  million, why not give it to the welfare schemes.  The\r\n\r\ncurrent financial procedure does not allow us to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThe $3 million was set aside for this purpose.  If it  is\r\n\r\nnot  used,  it has got to be returned to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to

This\r\n\r\nincludes  provisions  to  undertake  investigations   and\r\n\r\ninstitute  control measures, including  vaccinations  and\r\n\r\nquarantine, to prevent the spread or the introduction  of\r\n\r\nany infectious disease into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I propose new amendments to the Act to enable\r\n\r\nthe  transfer  of the existing medical related  functions\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the prevention and control  of  infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases  from  the  Ministry of the Environment  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Health,  to  expand  the  definitions   of\r\n\r\ninfectious  disease,  and  to enhance  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth's authority to order mandatory vaccinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now highlight the major\r\n\r\namendments that are being introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, environmental health, quarantine and\r\n\r\nepidemiology,    which   include    infectious    disease\r\n\r\nsurveillance  and  the investigation of  outbreaks,  were\r\n\r\ncarried out by MOH.  When the Ministry was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablished   in  1972,  it  was  made   in   charge   of\r\n\r\nenvironmental public health, which includes the provision\r\n\r\nof  safe water supply, public cleansing, solid waste  and\r\n\r\nsewage  disposal, drainage and control of  food  hygiene.\r\n\r\nAs  the control of many prevalent infectious diseases  in\r\n\r\nthe  1970s  was closely related to environmental  issues,\r\n\r\nthe  environmental  health  quarantine  and  epidemiology\r\n\r\nfunctions of MOH were transferred to ENV in 1972.   These\r\n\r\nfunctions  were  taken  over by the National  Environment\r\n\r\nAgency (NEA) when it was formed on 1st July 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the surveillance and control of\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases  are shared  between  MOH  and  NEA.\r\n\r\nTheir responsibilities are divided according to the  type\r\n\r\nof  disease.  Diseases like typhoid fever and hand,  foot\r\n\r\nand  mouth disease come under NEA.  But tuberculosis  and\r\n\r\nHIV  AIDS  are  under the purview of  MOH.   The  current\r\n\r\nsystem  works  reasonably well for the  surveillance  and\r\n\r\ncontrol of known diseases, for which the division of work\r\n\r\nbetween  MOH  and ENV is well established.   However,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  develop new expertise to deal with new  dangers\r\n\r\nfrom communicable diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, almost similar expertise is being\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and  deployed in the two  Ministries  for  the\r\n\r\nsurveillance   and  control  of  diseases   under   their\r\n\r\nrespective   purview.    This  has   resulted   in   some\r\n\r\nduplication of work and efficiency loss.  Nationally, new\r\n\r\nexpertise has to be developed to tackle emerging diseases\r\n\r\nand  new health threats arising from bio-safety and  bio-terrorism concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of continuing with the current path of\r\n\r\ndeveloping expertise in the two Ministries, it  would  be\r\n\r\nmore   efficient   and  cost  effective  to   concentrate\r\n\r\ncapability  development within one  Ministry.   For  this\r\n\r\nreason,   the   medical   related   functions   for   the\r\n\r\ninvestigation,  prevention  and  control  of   infectious\r\n\r\ndisease outbreaks, which are currently carried out by the\r\n\r\nNational Environment Agency, will be transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith effect from 1st April 2003.  NEA will continue to be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the environmental determinants of health,\r\n\r\nsuch as environmental sanitation, food hygiene and vector\r\n\r\ncontrol.   This  includes  quarantine  and  port  health,\r\n\r\ncleanliness  of  public  areas, inspection  of  premises,\r\n\r\ncontrol of vectors, environmental sampling, and execution\r\n\r\nof   any  environment-related  measures  in  response  to\r\n\r\noutbreaks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the transfer of the medical related functions\r\n\r\nfor   the   investigation,  prevention  and  control   of\r\n\r\ninfectious  disease  outbreaks  to  MOH,  the   following\r\n\r\namendments are necessary in the Infectious Diseases Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the existing Infectious Diseases Act\r\n\r\nempowers the Director-General of Public Health,  NEA,  to\r\n\r\ncarry out infectious disease outbreak investigations  and\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The revised Act will transfer this authority to\r\n\r\nthe Director of Medical Services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the revised Act also provides for the\r\n\r\ntransfer   of  authority  from  the  Minister   for   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment to the Minister for Health to declare an area\r\n\r\nas  an infected area when there is reason to believe that\r\n\r\nan  infectious  disease may be introduced into  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom the infected area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the authority to regulate the importation\r\n\r\nof  disease-causing  organism  will  now  rest  with  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Medical Services, while the Director-General\r\n\r\nof  Public Health, NEA, will retain his current  role  in\r\n\r\nregulating the importation of disease-causing vectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Bill revises the Act to amend the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of health officers to include any person  who\r\n\r\nis  appointed  by the Director-General of Public  Health,\r\n\r\nNEA,  or  the Director of Medical Services.  This  is  to\r\n\r\ncater  to  the  expanded role of MOH  officers  with  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  the medical related functions from  NEA  to\r\n\r\nMOH.   Currently,  NEA officers are empowered  under  the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Public  Health Act,  Environmental  Public\r\n\r\nHealth Regulations, Sale of Food Act, and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nControl  of  Vectors and Pesticides  Act,  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nfunctions  related  to the prevention, investigation  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  infectious  disease  outbreaks.   This  Bill\r\n\r\nrevises  the  Infectious Diseases  Act  so  that  similar\r\n\r\nprovisions  will  be included in the Infectious  Diseases\r\n\r\nAct  to enable MOH to better investigate and prevent  the\r\n\r\nspread of infectious diseases in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised Infectious Diseases Act will empower MOH\r\n\r\nofficers  to  enter premises without a  warrant  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of inspection and search.  They will  be  given\r\n\r\nthe  authority to take samples or confiscate  any  matter\r\n\r\nthat  is implicated in an outbreak.  The person from whom\r\n\r\nthe  matter has been seized will be given the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  lodge  a  complaint  within a stipulated  time  to  a\r\n\r\nmagistrate's  court against the seizure.  The  magistrate\r\n\r\ncan  then confirm or disallow the seizure, or even  order\r\n\r\nthat the owner be compensated for the loss resulting from\r\n\r\nthe seizure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Act will include provisions which\r\n\r\nrequire  persons  to  furnish information  which  may  be\r\n\r\nuseful  in  the investigations and, for persons suspected\r\n\r\nof  being infected with an infectious disease, to  submit\r\n\r\nthemselves for medical examination and undergo treatment,\r\n\r\nwhere necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if investigations indicate that a public place\r\n\r\nis  implicated in an outbreak, the amended Act allows MOH\r\n\r\nto  close  or  cordon off that public  place,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nprevent  further transmission of the infectious  disease.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this power of closure does not apply when  such\r\n\r\npower  has  already  been conferred  by  law  to  another\r\n\r\nGovernment  agency or statutory board.  For instance,  in\r\n\r\nthe  event of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease\r\n\r\namong  young children, it may be necessary to close  down\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres as a measure to control the  outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe  authority  to close down such places would  be  with\r\n\r\nMCDS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if there is an outbreak of a\r\n\r\nhighly  contagious infectious disease within the premises\r\n\r\nwhich are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot licensed by any authority, the provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  give  the authority to MOH to close down or  cordon\r\n\r\noff  the premises to prevent further transmission of  the\r\n\r\ninfectious disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight some of the new provisions\r\n\r\nthat  are  provided for in the Bill.  The  definition  of\r\n\r\ninfectious diseases in the Act will be revised  since the\r\n\r\ncurrent   Infectious  Diseases  Act  defines  \"infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases\"  as  diseases  that are  listed  in  the  First\r\n\r\nSchedule  of the Act.  This means that under the existing\r\n\r\nInfectious Diseases Act, the provisions of the Act cannot\r\n\r\nbe  applied  unless the implicated infectious disease  is\r\n\r\nalready listed under the First Schedule.  This change  is\r\n\r\nparticularly important in the modern age of rapid travel,\r\n\r\nwhere   new   infectious   diseases,   eg,   West    Nile\r\n\r\nEncephalitis,  Avian-Flu,  etc,  can  potentially  spread\r\n\r\nrapidly   to   other   countries.   The   definition   of\r\n\r\n\"infectious  diseases\"  in the Act  will,  therefore,  be\r\n\r\nrevised to encompass all infectious diseases, rather than\r\n\r\nbe limited to those listed in the First Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new provision introduced in the Bill will\r\n\r\nenhance  the  Minister for Health's  authority  to  order\r\n\r\nmandatory vaccination.  The existing Infectious  Diseases\r\n\r\nAct  empowers  the  Minister for Health  to  require  any\r\n\r\nperson,  who  is not protected or vaccinated  against  an\r\n\r\ninfectious  disease, to be vaccinated,  if  there  is  an\r\n\r\noutbreak  of  the disease in Singapore.  If there  is  an\r\n\r\noutbreak overseas, the existing provision will not apply,\r\n\r\neven  though  vaccination  may be  judged  necessary  for\r\n\r\npublic  health  reasons  to prevent  the  spread  of  the\r\n\r\noutbreak  to  Singapore.  The Bill therefore revises  the\r\n\r\nAct  to  allow the Minister for Health to order mandatory\r\n\r\nvaccination, even when there is no outbreak in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen  this  is  necessary to prevent the  spread  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes it an offence for persons with\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases  and who are likely  to  spread  the\r\n\r\ndisease  to  default  on  their medical  examination  and\r\n\r\ntreatment when they are required to do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  by  the Director of Medical Services.  It also  gives\r\n\r\nMOH officers powers to arrest such defaulters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1972, the control and prevention of infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases  in  Singapore has been a shared  responsibility\r\n\r\nbetween  MOH  and ENV/NEA.  Now, with the rationalisation\r\n\r\nof  public  health  functions and  the  transfer  of  all\r\n\r\nmedical-related public health functions from  NEA/ENV  to\r\n\r\nMOH,   MOH   will   take  charge  of  the   surveillance,\r\n\r\nmonitoring,  outbreak investigations and control  of  all\r\n\r\ninfectious diseases.  MOH will assume lead responsibility\r\n\r\nin the event of any infectious disease outbreak.  NEA/ENV\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  be responsible for the  environmental\r\n\r\ndeterminants of health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the\r\n\r\nInfectious  Diseases Act, as outlined in the  Bill,  will\r\n\r\nenable  my  Ministry to effectively carry out the  public\r\n\r\nhealth  functions which are being transferred by  NEA/ENV\r\n\r\nto  MOH.   The  amendments will also help to enhance  our\r\n\r\nresponsiveness  so as to enable effective prevention  and\r\n\r\ntimely  control  of all infectious disease  outbreaks  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand\r\n\r\nto   speak   in   support  of  the  Infectious   Diseases\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in this Bill that enables the for the\r\n\r\nprevention and control of all communicable diseases, such\r\n\r\nas  prevention  and control of outbreaks,  notifications,\r\n\r\nsurveillance   and  investigations,  from  the   National\r\n\r\nEnvironment Agency (NEA) to Ministry of Health  (MOH)  is\r\n\r\nappropriate, and I welcome it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health is most suited to assume\r\n\r\nthis  responsibility of prevention  and  control  of  all\r\n\r\ncommunicable  diseases. The Ministry of Health  is  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter position to understand the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent types of communicable diseases and is  able  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  diseases better because those affected  are\r\n\r\nusually  under  its care.  Furthermore, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  has the support of personnel and laboratories  to\r\n\r\nbetter  investigate any diseases, is in a better position\r\n\r\nto  inform and notify diseases more effectively,  and  is\r\n\r\nable  to  involve  all the doctors in  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nsurveillance of any outbreak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is relevant indeed in view of the new\r\n\r\ninfectious   disease  named  Severe   Acute   Respiratory\r\n\r\nSyndrome  (SARS)  that is threatening us  presently.  The\r\n\r\namendment  in new section 2(c) of this Bill enlarges  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"infectious disease\" to  include  certain\r\n\r\ndiseases not specified in the First Schedule, but if left\r\n\r\nuninvestigated or unchecked, would result in an  epidemic\r\n\r\nof that disease. SARS definitely falls into this ambit as\r\n\r\nit is not listed in the First Schedule, although it is  a\r\n\r\nhighly  contagious and dangerous disease.   Bio-terrorism\r\n\r\nis  also the concern of the day.  A good example would be\r\n\r\nthe recent Anthrax scare. Anthrax is another example of a\r\n\r\nhighly  dangerous infectious disease that is not  in  the\r\n\r\nFirst Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only 10 days ago, on 12th March, the World\r\n\r\nHealth  Organisation  issued a  global  alert  about  the\r\n\r\noutbreak of SARS.  As of today, there are 34 Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith SARS.  Other than the initial three cases, there are\r\n\r\nan  additional  31  patients who  had  been  admitted  to\r\n\r\nhospital. All these have been in close contact  with  the\r\n\r\npatients  of SARS.  My question to the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nis  which  Ministry is taking on the responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nthe  urgent situation of SARS now, since the transfer  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  from  NEA  to  MOH  is  scheduled  to  be\r\n\r\neffective  only  from 1st April.  We  need  to  have  one\r\n\r\nMinistry  taking  the  lead  responsibility  and   seeing\r\n\r\nthrough  the  whole process. Otherwise, this transitional\r\n\r\nstage  will be detrimental to our well-being.  Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State enlighten us on what has been  done  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health and what role had been played  by\r\n\r\nthe  National  Environment Agency (NEA)  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nSARS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 13 amends section 32 to transfer the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for  the  cleansing,  disinfection   and\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  infected  vessels, vehicles  and  personal\r\n\r\neffects to the Director and Health Officers authorised by\r\n\r\nthe  Director.  May I ask the Minister of State  how  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  is  preparing  to  take  over  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility as this will be completely  new  for  MOH?\r\n\r\nAre there personnel that can assume this role in MOH?  Is\r\n\r\nMOH setting up a new department to take over this role?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 20 of this Bill empowers the Minister to\r\n\r\norder  mandatory vaccination of persons in certain cases.\r\n\r\nMay  I seek the assurance from the Minister of State that\r\n\r\nthis  order will not be taken lightly until it is  proven\r\n\r\nto be absolutely necessary?  This is due to the fact that\r\n\r\nvaccines  are  not without side-effects  themselves.   At\r\n\r\ntimes,  they  can do more harm than good in some  people.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  we  may  not be aware of the  long-term  side-effects  of  certain vaccines.  Even  if  this  order  is\r\n\r\nimplemented,  we  have to be mindful that  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nblanket  order without exception, as it may kill  people,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the frail-elderly, the infants and  those  with\r\n\r\nimmune deficiencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 29 of the Infectious Diseases Act seems\r\n\r\nto  empower the Director-General or Port Health Office to\r\n\r\nobtain information to ascertain the health of the persons\r\n\r\non  board.   But  there is no provision  for  the  \"Entry\r\n\r\nDeclaration\" for travellers coming into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was reported in the Straits Times today by\r\n\r\nSalma  Kahlik  that  the  three  Singaporean  women,  who\r\n\r\nbrought  SARS here, had been traced to a Hongkong  hotel.\r\n\r\nThey were all staying on the same floor as the doctor who\r\n\r\nhas  since  died.   In view of this current  outbreak  of\r\n\r\nSARS,  and  the  fact that SARS is highly contagious  and\r\n\r\npotentially deadly, should we not make sure that there is\r\n\r\nprovision  in  this  Bill  to provide  implementation  of\r\n\r\nurgent measure on the containment of this illness?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be prudent that we take steps to ensure\r\n\r\nthat travellers do not enter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  without declaring that they are free  of  such\r\n\r\ndisease  and/or  not  in  contact  with  person  who  had\r\n\r\ncontracted such disease.  May I ask therefore whether  we\r\n\r\ncan   implement  a  clause  of  \"Entry  Declaration\"  for\r\n\r\ntravellers by way of subsidiary legislation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister of State can address\r\n\r\nmy concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, first let me explain a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit about the role of MOH and NEA with regard  to\r\n\r\nmanaging and preventing disease outbreaks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA has capabilities in dealing with the environment\r\n\r\nand  how we can change things in the environment that can\r\n\r\ncause  disease. MOH has the expertise in treating  people\r\n\r\nwho are sick and diagnosing illness in sick people.  Both\r\n\r\nNEA  and  MOH have always worked together and  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work together.  What has happened in the last\r\n\r\n30 years is that our concerns have shifted.  In the past,\r\n\r\nour  concern  was  more  primary focus  on  outbreaks  of\r\n\r\ndiseases like malaria, dengue and food poisoning.  In the\r\n\r\nfuture,  our concerns will be more on infectious diseases\r\n\r\nlike SARS as well as bio-terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these new types of diseases that we are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about will be first handled and  seen  by  MOH\r\n\r\nrather than ENV, the department has been shifted from ENV\r\n\r\nto  MOH.  However, even with the shift, MOH and ENV  will\r\n\r\nhave to work together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current outbreak, there is a task force\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the  management  of  this  outbreak.   It  is\r\n\r\nchaired by DMS, and it includes NEA officers, as well  as\r\n\r\nall  other relevant people involved. They meet every  day\r\n\r\nand  they  make decisions so that there is a  coordinated\r\n\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to her second concern, which is on\r\n\r\nvaccination, it will require some extraordinary events in\r\n\r\ncountries  outside  Singapore  before  we  will  consider\r\n\r\nordering vaccination of Singaporeans to protect ourselves\r\n\r\nfrom such an infection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo wanted to know what measures we have\r\n\r\ntaken  with  regard to SARS and how we  can  prevent  the\r\n\r\ndisease from coming into Singapore.  Let me give a  brief\r\n\r\nhistory of how the disease came to Singapore. Dr  Neo  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  A professor of medicine from Guangzhou fell ill\r\n\r\nwhile  in Hongkong.  He stayed at a hotel in Hongkong  on\r\n\r\n21st  and 22nd February.  He had previously been treating\r\n\r\npneumonia cases in Guangzhou.  He infected seven  persons\r\n\r\nat the hotel, including the three Singaporeans. The three\r\n\r\nSingaporeans returned on 25th February 2003 and they were\r\n\r\nwell  at that time.  Between 1st and 3rd March, they fell\r\n\r\nill  and they were admitted to our hospitals as cases  of\r\n\r\npneumonia.   On  6th  March, WHO  issued  an  alert  that\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers in Hanoi, who had treated an  American\r\n\r\nwho  had come from Hong Kong, were falling ill.  When WHO\r\n\r\nissued  this alert, MOH instructed hospitals  to  isolate\r\n\r\nthe  three  patients and to implement stringent isolation\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 14th March and 21st March, which is today,\r\n\r\n36  patients have been admitted with SARS.  Half of  them\r\n\r\nare healthcare workers, half are family friends and close\r\n\r\ncontacts.   Infections in all the cases have been  traced\r\n\r\nto  contact with the first three cases when they were not\r\n\r\nisolated.   So  far, we have no case of  a  person  being\r\n\r\ninfected after the first three patients were isolated, or\r\n\r\nof  any  infections  coming  from  contact  with  the  36\r\n\r\npatients  who  have now been admitted and isolated.   So,\r\n\r\nhaving legislation to prevent people coming in or through\r\n\r\ndeclarations is not necessarily an effective  measure  to\r\n\r\nprevent the disease from coming into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps taken by MOH to control the infection are\r\n\r\nthe  following:  We want to identify all suspected  cases\r\n\r\nearly.   So MOH has informed the public on what  symptoms\r\n\r\nto  look  out for.  All hospitals and doctors  have  been\r\n\r\nnotified  on  the  evaluation of  these  cases  and  what\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  take.  The disease has  also  been  made  a\r\n\r\nnotifiable disease under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Infectious Diseases Act.  All patients admitted  are\r\n\r\nin  strict  isolation.   There have  also  been  measures\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  emergency rooms so  that  triage  nurses\r\n\r\nwould  know  how  to  deal  with  suspected  cases.   NEA\r\n\r\nofficers have been doing contact tracing.  They call  all\r\n\r\ncontacts  daily  and  check  on  their  status.    Health\r\n\r\nadvisories   have  been  issued  to  airlines   on   what\r\n\r\nprecautions  they  should take  to  prevent  sick  people\r\n\r\nboarding their planes so that these sick people will  not\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore.  Health advisories would also be issued\r\n\r\nto  parents,  schools, pre-schools and childcare  centres\r\n\r\nand, directly, parents will be told to look out for fever\r\n\r\nin  their  children, if they have recently  travelled  to\r\n\r\nareas  where this disease has been known to  occur.   The\r\n\r\ntask  force  looking after the disease  meets  daily  and\r\n\r\nissues  press  alerts  and updates  the  public  on  what\r\n\r\nhappens.  The information is also on the MOH website  and\r\n\r\nthere is a hotline that the public can call.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this outbreak is quite serious. We still have\r\n\r\n37  patients in the hospital, five of whom are critically\r\n\r\nill.   We  are  not  out of the woods, but  the  outbreak\r\n\r\nappears to be under control.  We can be sure only in  one\r\n\r\nor  two weeks' time.  We are working closely with WHO and\r\n\r\nCDC to try to control this outbreak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I just want to seek clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.   Should  we  think that we need to implement  self-declaration by travellers later on, can we implement  the\r\n\r\nclause  of  the  entry declaration by way  of  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation?

The undertakings\r\n\r\ninclude  all  property  used  or  managed  by  the  Trade\r\n\r\nFacilitation Division and the Statistical Audit Unit,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as all assets and obligations of the Board relating\r\n\r\nto these departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the employees will be on terms no\r\n\r\nless  favourable than those enjoyed by them prior to  the\r\n\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends other Acts to effect the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of relevant responsibilities from IE  Singapore\r\n\r\nto Singapore Customs.

Clause 8  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  amends section 22 of the Customs Act to change  the\r\n\r\nbasis of valuation to the Customs Valuation Code, or CVC.\r\n\r\nThe CVC is an internationally adopted basis of valuation,\r\n\r\nincreasingly used by many countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new basis will exclude obligatory expenses such\r\n\r\nas   advertising,  promotion,  warranties,  showroom  and\r\n\r\nwarehousing  costs.  This move will  result  in  a  lower\r\n\r\nvalue for most motor vehicles, and hence lower the excise\r\n\r\nduties  and  Additional Registration  Fees  collected  on\r\n\r\nthese vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Allowing Minister to Grant Remission</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Minister can only grant exemption and\r\n\r\nrefund  of duties, taxes, fees and other charges paid  or\r\n\r\npayable by a person.  Clause 6 of the Bill amends section\r\n\r\n13  to  allow  the Minister to be able to  also  grant  a\r\n\r\nremission  of  duties,  taxes,  fees  or  other   charges\r\n\r\npayable.   A  similar provision is also  found  in  other\r\n\r\npieces  of  tax legislation, for example, the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nAct and the Goods and Services Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Empowerment of Director-General of Customs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the Act to empower the Director-General of Customs in several operational matters so as\r\n\r\nto  give  Singapore Customs more operational flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis will in turn improve administrative efficiency.  For\r\n\r\nexample, clause 5 of the Bill inserts a new section\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11, which allows the Director-General of Customs to waive\r\n\r\nthe  payment, or recovery of payment, of any  duty,  tax,\r\n\r\nfee  or  other charge, where the amount does  not  exceed\r\n\r\n$20.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removal  of Operational/Administrative Requirements  from\r\n\r\nCustoms Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill streamlines the Act by removing provisions\r\n\r\nthat  are operational and administrative in nature. These\r\n\r\nprovisions   will  instead  be  part  of  the  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation  relating  to  the  Customs  Act,   so   that\r\n\r\noperational  and  administrative  rules  can  be  changed\r\n\r\nquickly  in  line with the rapidly changing  environment.\r\n\r\nFor  example, clause 9 of the Bill amends section  34  of\r\n\r\nthe Act, which specifies the types and amount of dutiable\r\n\r\ngoods  that  travellers can bring into Singapore  without\r\n\r\npermits.   By  not specifying such detailed  quantitative\r\n\r\nlimits  in  the Act itself, adjustments can be made  more\r\n\r\nquickly when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Streamlining and Clarification of Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Act will be amended to streamline some\r\n\r\nprovisions and to clarify several other provisions.   For\r\n\r\nexample, clause 16 of the Bill amends section 93  of  the\r\n\r\nAct  to  clearly describe the situations where travellers\r\n\r\nare required to declare the goods at the checkpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removal of Obsolete Sections</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends the Act to remove sections that are\r\n\r\nobsolete  due  to  changes  in policies  and  operational\r\n\r\nprocedures.   One  example  of  an  obsolete  section  is\r\n\r\nsection  35 which requires hard-copy permits not used  to\r\n\r\nbe  returned to CED within 24 hours or as soon  as  CED's\r\n\r\noffice  is  open.   Clause 10 of the  Bill  repeals  this\r\n\r\nsection since hard-copy permits are no longer used today.\r\n\r\nPermits  are declared and approved electronically.   They\r\n\r\nwill be automatically invalidated upon expiry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Formation of Singapore Customs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 24 of the Bill will give legislative\r\n\r\neffect to consequential changes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto sections 3(1), 98 and 138 of the Customs Act needed as\r\n\r\na  result  of the formation of Singapore Customs  on  1st\r\n\r\nApril 2003.  Clause 26 of the Bill amends other pieces of\r\n\r\nlegislation, like the Income Tax Act and the  Immigration\r\n\r\nAct,  which  are needed as a result of the  formation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Customs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, on behalf of Members, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  chairing the Committee of Supply and  also  the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate  during the last 11 days.

Mr  Lim Swee Say even had time  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nconversation with Mr NEWater!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a gruelling session over the past two\r\n\r\nweeks.  Most Members have done well in this debate,  both\r\n\r\nin  content and in the earnestness of their speeches.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  congratulate them.  I  especially  thank\r\n\r\nthose Members who gave their cooperation by keeping their\r\n\r\nspeeches  to  within  a reasonable length.   I  apologise\r\n\r\nprofusely to those Members whose speeches I have  had  to\r\n\r\nguillotine, although my staff tell me that there  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  lower  proportion of such speeches  this  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is of some comfort to me, hon. Members, for  now  I\r\n\r\ncan  go back to being my soft-spoken, gentle and likeable\r\n\r\nself again!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, being an eternal optimist and an incorrigible\r\n\r\nbeliever in  the power of life-long learning, I  hope  to\r\n\r\nhear  fewer long speeches next year or, preferably,  none\r\n\r\nat  all.   I   therefore look forward to an  even  better\r\n\r\nBudget debate in 2004.  If I may borrow a phrase from  Mr\r\n\r\nKhaw Boon Wan, \"For us, good is not good enough.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me end by thanking my Deputy Speakers, the\r\n\r\nLeader of the House and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Whip,  and their deputies, and the Parliament  staff\r\n\r\nfor their assistance and guidance.  Until the next Budget\r\n\r\nsitting, good day and thank you.
