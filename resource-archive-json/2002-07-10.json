Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Question\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the counselling cases reported by\r\n\r\nschools,  about  6%  of students have been  referred  for\r\n\r\ncounselling,  with  secondary school students  accounting\r\n\r\nfor slightly more than half of these 6%.  Of these 6%, 4%\r\n\r\nwere   seen   by  school  personnel,  including   Teacher\r\n\r\nCounsellors,  and  2% were referred to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation's specialists and external professionals.   The\r\n\r\ntwo  main types of problems referred for counselling were\r\n\r\ndiscipline-related problems, eg, truancy and late-coming,\r\n\r\nand  emotion  problems, eg, coping with  grief  and  loss\r\n\r\nissues, boy-girl relationship problems.  These two  types\r\n\r\nof  cases  accounted  for  about  three-quarters  of  the\r\n\r\ncounselling  cases  reported  by  schools.   Other  cases\r\n\r\ninvolved  bullying  and  theft, motivation  and  attitude\r\n\r\nproblems.  The students who were referred for counselling\r\n\r\ncame  from  a cross-section of academic levels,  streams,\r\n\r\ngender and ethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a greater awareness\r\n\r\namong  the  public  on emotional health  issues,  greater\r\n\r\nacceptance of counselling as an option, and easier access\r\n\r\nto  counselling  services in schools and  the  community,\r\n\r\nsuch as the Family Services Centres.

With\r\n\r\nthe  fare  hikes, coming at a time when Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nhit by job losses and pay cuts, the feeling on the ground\r\n\r\nis  that  the  PTC has put the interests  of  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport operators over that of the public.  The PTC has\r\n\r\nlost  sight  of  the  larger  social  mission  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporeans use public transport today because\r\n\r\ncars  are priced out of their reach, with the Certificate\r\n\r\nof  Entitlement  and  the taxes on  road  usage.   Public\r\n\r\ntransport  is the only affordable means to get  to  where\r\n\r\nthey need to go, to work, to the market, to get home.  It\r\n\r\ngives  them access to employment and, hence, income.   As\r\n\r\nan  MP, I sometimes hear jobless residents not wanting to\r\n\r\ntake  jobs  far  away from their homes because  it  means\r\n\r\ntaking  two buses and an MRT ride, which means waking  up\r\n\r\nat  5.30  am  to  get  to  work on  time.   The  cost  of\r\n\r\ntravelling  itself can also be a disincentive, especially\r\n\r\nif the take-home pay of the job offered is already low.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pricing of public transport has a major impact\r\n\r\non  the  lives  of disadvantaged people.   The  household\r\n\r\nexpenditure  surveys  conducted  by  the  Department   of\r\n\r\nStatistics  consistently show that it is the lower-income\r\n\r\ngroup, especially those in 1- to 2-room flats, who  spend\r\n\r\nmost  on  public road transport, compared  to  the  other\r\n\r\ngroups.  Indeed, the latest survey shows that public road\r\n\r\ntransport  takes up 6.8% of the household expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthose living in 1- to 2-room flats.  This is higher  than\r\n\r\nthe  average  4% for all households.  Any  price  changes\r\n\r\nwill  hit  the lower-income most.  And we also know  that\r\n\r\nthis  economic  downturn has hit them the  hardest.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  says  that it helps them  with  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDownturn  Relief  Scheme, the New  Singapore  Shares  and\r\n\r\nother  such financial schemes.  But these are often once-off  affairs, or for the EDRS, up to three  months.   But\r\n\r\nthe  psychological  blow, not to  mention  the  financial\r\n\r\nimpact,  of  a price increase for something as  basic  to\r\n\r\nthem as public transport is felt on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not drive and I do not own a car. I take\r\n\r\npublic  transport everyday.  I know the  service  of  the\r\n\r\npublic transport has improved over the years.  But I also\r\n\r\nknow  how it feels to be squeezed in a bus, with no elbow\r\n\r\nroom, and to have to wait for more than half-an-hour  for\r\n\r\nbuses  that arrive so packed, you have no choice  but  to\r\n\r\nwait for another, which comes another half-an-hour later,\r\n\r\njust  as packed.  The commuting masses, by and large,  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  frills.   They  want  an  affordable  but   an\r\n\r\nefficient and convenient public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Senior Minister of State Khaw Boon Wan\r\n\r\ntalking  about  buses being made more  sophisticated,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can be \"mobile offices\".  Frankly, I dread  the\r\n\r\nday.   I  find  the  TV  mobile  enough  of  a  nuisance.\r\n\r\nCommuters often use the travelling time on buses to rest,\r\n\r\ntake  a nap or just unwind, not as a place to start work.\r\n\r\nI  urge  the  Government and the PTC not  to  forget  the\r\n\r\nsocial  mission of public transport as they  tinker  with\r\n\r\nfancy and costly ideas that the public does not want.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Transport Minister was reported as saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  commuters should expect fares to rise  because\r\n\r\nservice standards and wage expectations keep going up.  I\r\n\r\nquestion  this.   In  times  of recession,  all  workers,\r\n\r\nincluding  bus drivers, have been told to moderate  their\r\n\r\nwage  expectations.  As for service standards, yes, as  I\r\n\r\nhave said, they have increased, but commuters do not want\r\n\r\nto   be   made  to  pay  for  unnecessary  frills.    The\r\n\r\nairconditioned bus interchange is a frill.  Why the  need\r\n\r\nto  aircondition it when the idea of a quality service is\r\n\r\nthat  commuters  do  not have to wait  too  long  at  the\r\n\r\ninterchange  for  their  bus  to  arrive?    True,   this\r\n\r\ninterchange is not factored in the recent fare  increase,\r\n\r\nas  the  bus operators do not have to pay for the capital\r\n\r\ncost  of building the airconditioned interchange.  It  is\r\n\r\npaid for by the Government.  But they have to pay for the\r\n\r\ncost  of  maintaining the interchange.  This will  surely\r\n\r\nadd  to  their  operating cost.  Will this  lead  to  bus\r\n\r\noperators  asking  for  more fare  increases  in  future,\r\n\r\nespecially   as   I   hear   that   more   airconditioned\r\n\r\ninterchanges are on the cards?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Transport Minister has defended the hikes\r\n\r\nby  saying  that transport companies must be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nmake reasonable profits.  It is not clear to us or to the\r\n\r\npublic  what  are the criteria for deciding if  operators\r\n\r\nare  making  reasonable  or  unreasonable  profits.    In\r\n\r\nparticular,  how  does  the Minister  measure  viability,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  current economic conditions  and  the  social\r\n\r\nmission of public transport?  Moreover, the operators are\r\n\r\noperating   in  a  privileged  situation,  with   limited\r\n\r\ncompetition.  The reasons given by the operators for  the\r\n\r\nfare  increases  are not compelling.  SBS  Transit  cited\r\n\r\nincreases in statutory costs, such as ERP, as one  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  fare increase.  I know the Government has  more\r\n\r\nthan compensated SBS for the ERP charges by lowering  the\r\n\r\nroad tax significantly.  But given the social mission  of\r\n\r\npublic transport, there is also a case for the Government\r\n\r\nto  ease  the  cost burden by examining if the  statutory\r\n\r\ncosts,  such  as  the  ERP for buses,  can  be  reviewed.\r\n\r\nPublic  transport should be exempted from the ERP,  which\r\n\r\nis meant to ease congestion and to encourage cars to use\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalternative routes.  Buses have no choice but to ply  the\r\n\r\nroutes that they have to.  Sir, there is a fear that  ERP\r\n\r\nwill  only  continue  to  push  up  the  cost  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport  further,  especially  with  night  ERP   being\r\n\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for SMRT, it cited energy cost as one factor\r\n\r\nleading to rising operating costs.  Energy cost has risen\r\n\r\nas  a result of electricity tariff hikes.  For TIBS,  one\r\n\r\nof  the factors cited, among others, is diesel cost.  But\r\n\r\nwhy  should  these factors be cited as reasons  to  raise\r\n\r\nfares  when  electricity  and  diesel  costs  should   be\r\n\r\naddressed by the Fuel Equalisation Fund (FEF).  This Fund\r\n\r\nwas set up in 1992 to address volatile fuel prices and to\r\n\r\ncurb  fare increases due to fluctuations of fuel  prices.\r\n\r\nThe operators should be allowed to draw from their FEF to\r\n\r\ncushion the impact of increases in electricity and diesel\r\n\r\ncosts,  without a fare increase.  As at 31st March  2001,\r\n\r\nthe  balances in the FEF are $39.8 million for SBS,  $8.7\r\n\r\nmillion  for SMRT, and $8.4 million for TIBS.   They  can\r\n\r\ndraw from this rather than raise the prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also query the argument that restriction in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of operators allows them to achieve economies  of\r\n\r\nscale  and  to  balance the profitable  routes  with  the\r\n\r\nunprofitable  ones.  Some MPs have repeatedly  asked  for\r\n\r\nbus   routes   within  their  estates.   I  myself   have\r\n\r\nrepresented my residents in asking for Bus Service 292 to\r\n\r\nlink two zones tucked in a far corner of my ward directly\r\n\r\nto  the  Changkat Community Centre, but the response  has\r\n\r\nalways  been, \"It is unprofitable.  Hence, we can't  give\r\n\r\nyou that service.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that competitive tendering be extended to\r\n\r\ncertain zones.  There is potential for lowering costs  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  competition  in awarding  contracts  to  run\r\n\r\nzonal  services within a planned and coordinated network,\r\n\r\nas   has   been  adopted  in  other  countries  such   as\r\n\r\nScandinavia.  On this matter, perhaps more weight  should\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  committees, like the  Estate  Coordinating\r\n\r\nCommittee of a GRC.  These committees, which can be found\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTampines   and   Pasir   Ris  GRCs,   coordinate   estate\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  include LTA and SBS representatives  as\r\n\r\nwell   as  grassroots  leaders  and  MPs.   Perhaps  more\r\n\r\nauthority and powers could be given to this Committee  to\r\n\r\npush forward the agenda for competitive tendering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members argued that this House should not\r\n\r\nundermine the credibility and independence of the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council by urging it to review or reverse  its\r\n\r\ndecision on fare increases.  While I agree that we should\r\n\r\nnot  politicise the PTC and its work as far as  possible,\r\n\r\nit  is  important  to assure the public  that  they  have\r\n\r\nrecourse  in  such matters.  This is the  case  with  the\r\n\r\nJudiciary.  Our Judiciary is independent, and  it  guards\r\n\r\nits  integrity jealously and fiercely.  No MP is  allowed\r\n\r\nto ask the Judiciary to reverse its decision.  But it has\r\n\r\nan  internal appeal mechanism which makes sure  that  the\r\n\r\nsystem  works.  If one disagrees with the judgment passed\r\n\r\ndown by the courts, he can appeal to a higher court.  But\r\n\r\nin  the case of public transport, there is no higher body\r\n\r\noutside  of  Parliament.  Moreover, as this  case  shows,\r\n\r\nParliament  may  not  be able to  react  fast  enough  to\r\n\r\nappeals  from  the public.  This sitting is taking  place\r\n\r\nafter  the  fact,  after the fare hike has  already  been\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to establish a public\r\n\r\ntransport  ombudsman as a mediator or  assessor  of  last\r\n\r\nresort  for  users,  and  perhaps  for  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators as well.  There should be a body separate  from\r\n\r\noperators and regulators to act as an appeals  body.   It\r\n\r\nwould help ensure that the system works, that the process\r\n\r\nis  transparent and, at the same time, assure the  public\r\n\r\nthat  they can get a fair hearing before a fare  hike  is\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with all these fears about price increases,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  public transport, I want to  bring  up  a\r\n\r\ncheaper  alternative to public transport and cars  -  and\r\n\r\nthat  is cycling.  Sir, I declare my interest.  I am  the\r\n\r\npatron of the Singapore Amateur Cycling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAssociation.  Cycling is becoming increasingly popular in\r\n\r\nSingapore, both on and off-road.  But our road  transport\r\n\r\nsystem  gives  little  thought  to  their  use.   On-road\r\n\r\ncyclists  find their enjoyment and safety jeopardised  by\r\n\r\nsharing  roads with motor vehicles, and off-road  cycling\r\n\r\nmay  conflict  with  the interests of pedestrians.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  was a time when I cycled to work from Upper Changi\r\n\r\nRoad  to  Times House, then in Kim Seng Road,  and  back.\r\n\r\nBut  I stopped after I was knocked down by a taxi.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are local grassroots and environmental groups,  all\r\n\r\ntrying to promote cycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to consider providing a bicycle\r\n\r\nlane on roads that can be used by two-wheelers, including\r\n\r\nmotorbikes, for safety and as well as an alternative mode\r\n\r\nof  transport.  Such lanes can be found in many developed\r\n\r\ncities,  even  those  which  experience  winter.    These\r\n\r\nbicycle  lanes are not used in winter, but that does  not\r\n\r\nstop the authorities from providing them.  What more  for\r\n\r\na country with tropical weather all year round?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, public transport must be guided\r\n\r\nby its over-riding social mission.  The PTC, in reviewing\r\n\r\nfare  prices, should take into account the state  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,   the   unemployment   rate,   and   also    the\r\n\r\naffordability   of  public  transport  to   the   masses,\r\n\r\nespecially the lower-income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the motion\r\n\r\nbeing  moved in this House is a significant one.   It  is\r\n\r\nboth  timely  and  bold in its call.  It was  unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat a slew of public service charges have increased over\r\n\r\nthe  last few months.  It could be that some have decided\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  politically safe time to  raise  charges\r\n\r\nwithout incurring the public ire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public has spoken. Looking at the quality\r\n\r\nand  the tone of the letters, comments and feedback, both\r\n\r\nin  the  public  and  private  domains,  one  cannot  but\r\n\r\nconclude that there is indeed a sense of frustration  and\r\n\r\ndespair among many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   The  increase in the  garbage  collection\r\n\r\ncharges  was  the  first whip the public tolerated.  Then\r\n\r\ncame  the  carpark  fee charges and the public  transport\r\n\r\nfare increases.  Collectively, they will make a financial\r\n\r\ndent  in  the  lives of Singaporeans.   Many  people  are\r\n\r\nworried how do they cope with these increases when  their\r\n\r\nsalaries are frozen and, in some cases, cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans' feedback was rebutted with the\r\n\r\nusual statistical and textbook answers.  The increase was\r\n\r\na  small  percentage in relation to the overall fare  per\r\n\r\ntrip, that is what some said.  What it fails to highlight\r\n\r\nis  the  percentage  increase, and  the  fact  that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans take public transport many times a day,  and\r\n\r\nnot  once  or twice, as some people have highlighted.   I\r\n\r\nrecall   that,   during  the  last   four   years,   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  had seen many MPs, in the course  of  their\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people  sessions, with  sad  stories  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  not afford to go for job interviews, because  they\r\n\r\ndid not even have money to pay for their fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sympathise with many Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nparticularly  our  low-wage  earners,  for  whom   public\r\n\r\ntransport can come up to 10% of their monthly expenditure\r\n\r\nif  one  includes the total income they spend  on  public\r\n\r\ntransport.  Many have not had pay increases for the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years.  Some have their pay reduced, some have  just\r\n\r\nbeen  re-employed,  and some are still  unemployed.   The\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the public transport fare increases  on  this\r\n\r\ngroup of Singaporeans is tremendous.  They are angry but,\r\n\r\nat the same time, they are helpless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join in the call of the people to demand an\r\n\r\nexplanation as to why public transport fare increase  was\r\n\r\nallowed in these difficult times.  Last year, the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport   Council  took  into  account  the  prevailing\r\n\r\neconomic  situation  and only allowed  the  alignment  of\r\n\r\nadult  feeder fares with the minimum trunk  fares.   Even\r\n\r\nthen  a 10-cent increase, from 50 cents to 60 cents, came\r\n\r\nup  to about 20% increase in the feeder fare increase.  I\r\n\r\nthought   it  was  a  substantial  amount  because   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans use feeder services in the public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.   It was a substantial  jump  for  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans because they use these feeder services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year, despite no substantial improvement in\r\n\r\nthe economic environment, the PTC has approved an across-the-board increase.  I would like to ask the Minister why\r\n\r\nan  increase was allowed when the economy is still in the\r\n\r\nrecovery phase.  I am equally puzzled as to how the  wage\r\n\r\nbill   for   the  public  transport  operators   can   be\r\n\r\nincreasing,  the  CPF  cut is still  in  place  and  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  are minimal.  When some companies are  in  the\r\n\r\nred  and  many  more are without a steady  business,  was\r\n\r\nthere a real need to pamper our bus companies with a fare\r\n\r\nincrease?   For  a monopoly who enjoys a  steady  profit,\r\n\r\neven  in  bad economic times, could they have  sacrificed\r\n\r\nmore and alleviate the financial burden of the public?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the present\r\n\r\npolicy  for allowing route and transport monopoly is  the\r\n\r\nbest  model  to achieve a good, efficient and  reasonably\r\n\r\npriced  public transport system.  I am sure the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  agree  that  the public policy favours  competition\r\n\r\nover  monopoly.  In many countries, public policy  relies\r\n\r\non  the  competitive market to establish  the  price  and\r\n\r\nquality of goods and services.  Yet, in Singapore, in the\r\n\r\npublic transport domain, we have monopolies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to seriously consider\r\n\r\ncalling  for  public  tenders to  run  certain  transport\r\n\r\nroutes,  which was mentioned earlier by my colleague,  Ms\r\n\r\nIrene  Ng.  This would certainly not unsettle the present\r\n\r\noperators, as many of the infrastructure and mass  public\r\n\r\nfacilities, like MRT stations, bus stations, and  depots,\r\n\r\nare  built  by the Government with taxpayers' money.   By\r\n\r\ncalling  for tender, say, once in five years, I think  it\r\n\r\nwill  allow  these  public  transport  operators  to   be\r\n\r\nbenchmarked  against  the market mechanism,  and  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether true efficiency can be delivered by the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present set-up, the only available models to\r\n\r\ncompare cost efficiency are the present two operators and\r\n\r\nthe  two  MRT  operators.   They  enjoy  a  monopoly   in\r\n\r\nperpetuity.   Opening  up  the  market  and  testing  the\r\n\r\nexisting operators against other potential competitors, I\r\n\r\nam  certain the public would benefit.  A good example  is\r\n\r\nthe   case  of  the  garbage  collection  companies.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the Ministry of the Environment  divided\r\n\r\nSingapore  into eight sectors and called for tenders  for\r\n\r\neach  of  these  sectors.  The cheapest was  selected  by\r\n\r\ncompetitive  tendering  and  their  contract  period   is\r\n\r\nlimited to five years, after which a fresh tender will be\r\n\r\ncalled.   I would urge the Minister to consider  such  an\r\n\r\napproach   as  a  way  to  control  costs  and  introduce\r\n\r\ncompetition to the public transport sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight one more sector to show how\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  the  public sector  helps  control  fare\r\n\r\nincreases.   Sir,  when taxi fares were liberalised,  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies did not increase their fares because they\r\n\r\nknew  that  demand  was not inelastic.   They  know  that\r\n\r\ncustomers  have other choices, like bus, MRT,  and  other\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies, to reach their destination.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  public  transport operators, like bus  and  MRT,  the\r\n\r\npublic  has  no  choice.  They are fixed by  the  present\r\n\r\noperators - use them or be doomed.  In the long run, I do\r\n\r\nnot think that this is the model that we want to have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was listening to the debate yesterday, I\r\n\r\nwas impressed by the arguments of the Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  Transport, Mr Khaw Boon Wan.  He  highlighted\r\n\r\nthere   are  many  misunderstandings  among  the  public.\r\n\r\nHowever,   I  felt  that  there  are  still  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings remaining, despite his brave attempt to\r\n\r\nclear  the  misunderstandings.  Misunderstanding  No.  1,\r\n\r\nwhich he highlighted, is that fare increases are not  due\r\n\r\nto frills, and that these are paid for by the Government.\r\n\r\nBut what he fails to state is that the operators have  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  it.  As my colleague earlier highlighted,  more\r\n\r\nairconditioned bus terminals are going to come.  A PUB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficer advises any consumer who goes there and complains\r\n\r\nabout  high PUB bills that airconditioning is the biggest\r\n\r\nculprit.   Here, again, we have to ask ourselves  whether\r\n\r\nthe  operators are going to bear the cost  of  these  new\r\n\r\nfrills.   In his speech yesterday, he did not cover  this\r\n\r\naspect.     The    misunderstanding   continues.     This\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding is legitimate.  Perhaps  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  explain whether it is the Government's agenda,  or\r\n\r\nthe  public bus operators' or MRT operator's request that\r\n\r\nsuch facilities be built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, misunderstanding No. 2 is that he explained\r\n\r\nthat fare increases are not to fatten the profits of  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies.   I  beg to differ because I  cannot  see  any\r\n\r\nother  reasons.   I cannot recollect any  of  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators being in deficit, or  close  to  it.\r\n\r\nThey  have  always  enjoyed good profits  and  they  have\r\n\r\nalways come back to PTC for fat profits, not to pull them\r\n\r\nout of any deficit, or any other serious problem.  In any\r\n\r\nevent,  as listed companies, they can always go  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  equity or loan market to raise funds that  they  may\r\n\r\nneed,  instead of relying on fare increases as  the  sole\r\n\r\nsource  of raising money for their business.  Let us  not\r\n\r\nreward them for their lack of financial creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 3. It was stated that bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  have huge losses in other business,  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  attempted  to cover it by fare increases.   He  has\r\n\r\nexplained this misunderstanding.  I spoke to many  people\r\n\r\nand  they are clear in their mind that there is  no  such\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding, and that this was never an issue in the\r\n\r\ndebate that has taken place over the last few days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 4. He raised the issue whether\r\n\r\nPTC  was  uncaring.  He said that PTC indeed was  caring,\r\n\r\nand  he highlighted some figures.  He mentioned that  the\r\n\r\naverage wage has gone up by 136% over 15 years.  CPI  has\r\n\r\ngone  up  by  29%,  but the transport fares  have  lagged\r\n\r\nbehind.  Unfortunately, no data was provided by how  much\r\n\r\nit has fallen behind the wage group.  A better comparison\r\n\r\nwould be to see how much is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntransport  expenditure  in relation  to  a  Singaporean's\r\n\r\nwage  now,  as compared to 15 years ago.  I do not  think\r\n\r\nthere  would have been a drop.  Indeed, I speculate  that\r\n\r\nthe  portion  of  transport expenditure would  be  higher\r\n\r\nrelative  to  one's  ordinary  income,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nordinary wage earner.  Naturally, it leaves one wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Senior Minister of State has difficulty  in\r\n\r\nproducing  the  relevant  figures.   I  would  urge   the\r\n\r\nMinister to address this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the role of the PTC, I must say that I\r\n\r\nhave  great  sympathy  for  the  PTC,  because  they  are\r\n\r\nhandling a difficult assignment.  How can they be fair to\r\n\r\nboth  the public transport operators and to the commuters\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time?  The parameters  of  their  job  are\r\n\r\ndefined  by  an  Act of Parliament.  My  colleagues  have\r\n\r\nraised  many  issues in relation to the job of  the  PTC,\r\n\r\nquestions  about the conflict of interests,  whether  the\r\n\r\nmembers  are  qualified to be able to be sitting  in  the\r\n\r\ncouncil.  And I would like to add one more issue, whether\r\n\r\nthe   PTC  has,  in  the  course  of  its  deliberations,\r\n\r\nindependent studies put up by think-tanks, or  academics,\r\n\r\nto  advise  the  PTC, or whether they just  rely  on  the\r\n\r\nreports furnished by the bus companies as the sole source\r\n\r\nof   reference   and   decision-making.    Perhaps   some\r\n\r\nclarification  could  be  given,  both  by  PTC  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify to the public on how they arrived  at\r\n\r\nthese figures.  Because being a lawyer, I can always  say\r\n\r\nthat  there are two parts to the argument, and it depends\r\n\r\non  who presents the argument.  If the bus company is the\r\n\r\nonly company that is able to present the argument, I pity\r\n\r\nthe PTC because they need additional support and research\r\n\r\nfrom  other  independent researchers,  or  academics,  to\r\n\r\nsupport the PTC in whatever decision that it is going  to\r\n\r\narrive at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to a wider question, and it is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  type of competition that we are  having  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the public transport market needs to be  re-looked.  I think it is something that the Minister has to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the Ministry's level and see whether  there  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a call which can be justified to re-look  at  the\r\n\r\ntype of public transport\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noperators that we have in Singapore, and not rely on some\r\n\r\nconsultant's  report  which was made  some  decades  ago.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  format  that is being used  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nConsidering  the present public transport usage  and  the\r\n\r\ntype  of market that we have, perhaps it is time  we  re-looked at the whole market itself, and see whether we can\r\n\r\nallow for more competition so that we can achieve greater\r\n\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the second part of the\r\n\r\nMotion  that deals with the call to ensure that essential\r\n\r\npublic  services remain affordable, and  that  any  price\r\n\r\nincreases during this difficult period should be kept  to\r\n\r\nthe absolute minimum.  In my view, this is where the real\r\n\r\ncrux  of the debate lies.  Fare increases are the  chosen\r\n\r\nrhythm  of  the  day.  The others, like carpark  charges,\r\n\r\nutilities,  have been let off lightly.  The wider  debate\r\n\r\nis  how  do  we  scrutinise increases  in  the  price  of\r\n\r\nessential  services.   While we have  some  mechanism  to\r\n\r\nensure  that some public services are subject  to  market\r\n\r\nmechanism  and  competition, not all  are.   Some  public\r\n\r\nservices  are  in  the hands of the Government,  some  in\r\n\r\nautonomous  Government bodies, some in  statutory  boards\r\n\r\nand  some in the public sector.  In the public sector,  I\r\n\r\nagain  applaud  the Ministry of the Environment  for  its\r\n\r\npractice  to  call for fresh tenders at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\ntender period for refuse collection contractors.  In some\r\n\r\ncases,  public bodies, like PTC, or CASE, have a role  to\r\n\r\nplay.   In  the  case  of some essential  services  being\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Government, I would urge the  Government\r\n\r\nto  ensure that cost recovery should be its policy rather\r\n\r\nthan profiteering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the cost structures and profit numbers\r\n\r\nare not found in the annual budget numbers, it becomes an\r\n\r\nimpossible  task  for any researcher  to  identify  these\r\n\r\nculprits.   I  would  urge  the Government  to  give  the\r\n\r\nmandate  to the Auditor-General to look at the Government\r\n\r\nagencies  that  provide essential services and  determine\r\n\r\nwhether  they are operating on a cost recovery or profit-making  basis, and to highlight these cases in its annual\r\n\r\nreport.  This will provide a good example\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  our Government leading by example where its essential\r\n\r\nservices  are  scrutinised by an  independent  authority.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  CASE,  or  a committee made up  of  the  general\r\n\r\npublic, can start a list of such essential services to be\r\n\r\nscrutinised  by the Auditor-General (AG), and  this  list\r\n\r\nshould  be made available to the Government for  scrutiny\r\n\r\nby  the AG.  This will certainly arrest the trend of some\r\n\r\nessential  service providers, including  the  Government,\r\n\r\ncharging unreasonable fees and charges under the  pretext\r\n\r\nthat they are affordable to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever a fare increase comes about, or some\r\n\r\nincrease in fee comes about, the usual words are that  it\r\n\r\nis  \"affordable to the public\".  This argument  is  going\r\n\r\ndown  less  and less with the public, because  affordable\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  it  is  cheap.   It  can  be  cheap  and\r\n\r\naffordable but, in many cases, the yardstick that some of\r\n\r\nthese essential service providers equate is that if it is\r\n\r\naffordable, the public can tolerate.  This should not  be\r\n\r\nthe way in which we price essential services.  The way we\r\n\r\nshould  price  it  is  that we must  make  it  cheap  and\r\n\r\naffordable, not merely affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that we have\r\n\r\na  duty to ensure that essential services are provided at\r\n\r\nreasonable  prices  and  even at  subsidised  rates,  eg,\r\n\r\nhealth, education and sports.  One of the arguments  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  stated in allowing  some  of  these\r\n\r\npublic fare increases, or essential service increases, is\r\n\r\nthat  we  provide  rebates, or we provide  some  form  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  help to the poor by giving them money  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  Singapore bonus shares.  But having  talked  to\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  people in the poor income bracket,  it  is\r\n\r\nbasically a shot of ecstasy for a while.  They  take  the\r\n\r\n$600, or whatever amount that is given, and spend it, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  it.  They come back to normal.  So we  have  to\r\n\r\nthink of a way whereby such amounts are directly going to\r\n\r\nhelp people cope with these increases, if need be, rather\r\n\r\nthan  giving them one shot and then having them spent  by\r\n\r\nthe public in one go.  Somebody said to me\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  it is basically a one shot of ecstasy.  After that,\r\n\r\nthey get high.  Then, the next day, they wake up, and  it\r\n\r\nis back to solving the same problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must remind ourselves, at the end of this\r\n\r\ndebate,  that  the public are like a balloon.   They  can\r\n\r\ntake  a  fair amount of air pressure and expand, but  too\r\n\r\nmuch  pressure and they will burst.  And burst they  will\r\n\r\none  day,  if  we  do not look after their  interest  and\r\n\r\nwelfare.  Let us never take the public for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the Motion put  forth\r\n\r\nby  Members  of the House, and I agree with the  eloquent\r\n\r\nargument put forth by Mr Tan Soon Khoon.  I feel that the\r\n\r\nmove  to raise fare prices in this instance was ill-timed\r\n\r\nand a misjudgment.  The rationale given for the fare hike\r\n\r\nwas  one of recovering costs - incurred in terms of wages\r\n\r\ngiven  to  employees  and  in terms  of  maintenance  for\r\n\r\nservices  - to maintain the respectable profits  for  the\r\n\r\npublic transport companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, profit is not a dirty word, but when the very\r\n\r\nprofitable transport companies seek to recover costs from\r\n\r\na  public  that is generally going through a  bad  patch,\r\n\r\nthat  action, at this point in time, leaves behind a foul\r\n\r\ntaste  in  the  mouth and cannot be very  palatable.   On\r\n\r\ngrounds  of  this  principle, I feel that  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nrightly  placed motivation to push for the hikes  in  bus\r\n\r\nand MRT fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a perverse way, however, we also have to say\r\n\r\nthank you to this fare hike, because it has brought  into\r\n\r\nfocus  the role of the listed public transport companies,\r\n\r\nthe  role of the PTC and the needs and, more importantly,\r\n\r\nthe  expectations of a more sophisticated commuter today.\r\n\r\nThis  incident  highlights, in my point  of  view,  these\r\n\r\nthree main points, and what is also to be appreciated  is\r\n\r\nhow   this  public  outcry  is  also  a  good  sign  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do care for others, for whom the pinch hurts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na   bit  more.   These  are  good  signs  of  a  maturing\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the three points: on the role of a\r\n\r\nlisted   public  transport  company,  I  seek  a  greater\r\n\r\nclarification on what is the role for a public  transport\r\n\r\ncompany.   The  issues  related  to  this  question  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  brought up by the other  speakers:  should\r\n\r\nsuch  companies be just focused on profits?  Should  they\r\n\r\ntake  a  different  model  or be  restructured?   As  has\r\n\r\nalready  been suggested, should their services be  opened\r\n\r\nup  for  tenders?   Hence this means a re-examination  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  role  and  function  of  public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the role of the PTC. At least a third\r\n\r\nof  the members in the 14-member Council are either  from\r\n\r\none  of  the  transport  companies or  the  shareholders.\r\n\r\nWhether  they  like  it or not, the  perception  is  that\r\n\r\nperhaps they could be looking after the interests of  the\r\n\r\norganisations they represent, and it could be most unfair\r\n\r\nto  them.  It is best then to have a range of members  in\r\n\r\nthis  Council.  I would like to suggest that some of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  come from the school bus operators, private  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies,  as well as officers from NParks.  NParks  has\r\n\r\nbeen  trying for some time to bring families to its parks\r\n\r\n-  and we are family oriented - and it is also trying  to\r\n\r\nnurture  a cycling culture within Singapore. It might  be\r\n\r\ntimely to have their input too in the council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, what is going to be the role of the PTC, if\r\n\r\nthere  is perhaps no change in the current model  of  how\r\n\r\npublic  transport companies operate?  How are they  going\r\n\r\nto  walk  this fine line between safeguarding the  public\r\n\r\ninterest  as  well  as  those  of  the  public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies?   And it is at this point that  I  do  despair\r\n\r\nover  the  age-old  debate about providing  services  for\r\n\r\nthose   who  are  disabled,  especially  those  who   are\r\n\r\nwheelchair-bound.  This is an age-old debate, perhaps  as\r\n\r\nold  as the 15-year-old PTC.  How are we going to address\r\n\r\nthis?   We are an aging population.  The North East Line,\r\n\r\nwhen  it  opens, will be ready for those in  wheelchairs,\r\n\r\nand yet how seamless are we in this aspect?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  are already retrofitting works going on for  other\r\n\r\nMRT lines, but where does the bus fit into this scheme of\r\n\r\nseamless  transportation? To outfit buses with  hydraulic\r\n\r\nlifts  for  the  wheelchair, as a previous Straits  Times\r\n\r\nreport shows, can cost about $40 million.  When it  comes\r\n\r\nto  providing for such facilities, what then will be  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the PTC?  If there is any guiding principle  at\r\n\r\nthis  point  in  time on how the PTC operates,  then  its\r\n\r\nrationalisation to raise the fares for the bus companies,\r\n\r\nleaves  me  to fear that bringing in better  systems  for\r\n\r\nthose  in wheelchairs may take another two decades before\r\n\r\nit comes true.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I feel that this current 3- to 5-cent hike - which some cannot understand what the whole fuss is about\r\n\r\n-  is a good point at this time to reflect on how we  can\r\n\r\nimprove  the  role  of  the PTC,  reassess  what  is  the\r\n\r\nstructure  or  model for public transport  companies,  as\r\n\r\nwell as, at the same time, understand the Singaporean  of\r\n\r\ntoday better.  To an unemployed Singaporean, 3 to 5 cents\r\n\r\nwill send shudders.  To the average Singaporean, it means\r\n\r\nabsorbing  more and more costs.  Here, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nrelate a case that happened just last year.  A woman  and\r\n\r\nher  daughter walked all the way from Bedok to a hospital\r\n\r\nin  the central part of Singapore, because they could not\r\n\r\nafford  the  bus  fares.   Thankfully,  the  mother   and\r\n\r\ndaughter  have been helped since, through the  very  same\r\n\r\nschemes  that Minister Mah Bow Tan brought up  yesterday.\r\n\r\nEven  as we help those who cannot afford to pay for their\r\n\r\ntransport,  let us not forget that the money  comes  from\r\n\r\ndonations   from   the  public,  and   from   MCDS-funded\r\n\r\nprogrammes, which again comes from the taxpayer.  So,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  so  easy to dismiss this concern for  those  who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to  pay for public  transport  by  citing\r\n\r\navailable financial assistance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above three main reasons, I think the Motion\r\n\r\nis a good one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the speakers before me have already\r\n\r\nexpressed the unhappiness\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  public transport users and their  plight.   They\r\n\r\nhave  also  pointed  out correctly that  many  are  upset\r\n\r\nbecause of a slew of increases that will take place  over\r\n\r\nthe next six months.  This unhappiness is exacerbated  by\r\n\r\nthe  uncertainties that workers face as retrenchments  by\r\n\r\ncompanies will surely continue for the rest of  the  year\r\n\r\nand even up to early next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government warns us that more jobs will be\r\n\r\nlost - and the 5% unemployment rate is hanging over us  - a  call  to be austere by the Government further  ignites\r\n\r\nthe  anger  of our people as a slew of charges  comes  on\r\n\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PTC is entrusted with the\r\n\r\nimportant  and,  as  we have seen, a  difficult  task  of\r\n\r\nstriking  a balance between safeguarding public  interest\r\n\r\nand ensuring the financial viability of operators, and we\r\n\r\nhave  heard the comment on viability by our hon.  Member,\r\n\r\nMr  Tan Soo Khoon, yesterday.  I join in the call  by  my\r\n\r\nhon.  colleagues who spoke before me to urge the  PTC  to\r\n\r\nconsider  in its fare increases to tip the scale  towards\r\n\r\nsafeguarding the public interest to achieve  the  balance\r\n\r\nit  first  set  out to do.  Whether in  reality  or  not,\r\n\r\npeople  are  not  convinced that the PTC has  represented\r\n\r\ntheir  interest.  Together with the stream  of  increases\r\n\r\nfrom other bodies, the unhappiness is understandable.  We\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  PTC will communicate the plight  of  the\r\n\r\ncommuters to the transport companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague, Mr Ravindran, pointed out just\r\n\r\nnow  that affordability may not be cheap.  If we look  at\r\n\r\naffordability  - this is my perspective - at  any  single\r\n\r\nincrease,  we  can say whether it is affordable  or  not.\r\n\r\nBut  when  we put a slew of increases, affordability  for\r\n\r\neach  in totality means I cannot afford for most of these\r\n\r\nessential services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the points raised that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is uncaring and not listening to the people, I\r\n\r\ndo not think so.  What I think the Government did not do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell  enough  is  perhaps that it might  have  painted  a\r\n\r\nclearer  enough picture of why the increases have  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  now.  If this had been done, there might  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  so  much nitpicking, irritation and anger over  the\r\n\r\nincreases.   Yes, I do feel that some of these increases,\r\n\r\nespecially the bus fare increase, are ill timed.  With  a\r\n\r\nlittle  less  profit, I am sure the company can  make  it\r\n\r\nthrough another year or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport companies have to realise that revenue\r\n\r\ngains  will  probably  not increase  at  the  rates  like\r\n\r\nbefore.   Commuters  will have to  realise  that  capital\r\n\r\nequipment,  such  as  buses  and  systems,  needs  to  be\r\n\r\nreplaced, and these investments cost money.  Without such\r\n\r\nreplacements  and upgrades, the benchmark service  levels\r\n\r\nthat   Singaporeans  think  nothing  of,  will   not   be\r\n\r\nmaintained, let alone improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this unhappiness? I think the PTC, the\r\n\r\ntransport companies and the Government bodies did a  poor\r\n\r\njob  in  enlisting  our  people in seeing  the  rationale\r\n\r\nbehind the slew of increases and the timing of it.   Only\r\n\r\nwhen  an  uproar occurred did \"justifications\" come  out.\r\n\r\nYes, let me tell you that a Member doing explanations  of\r\n\r\njustifications at block visits and grassroots  events  is\r\n\r\nquite  a sight.  How else could we have explained to  the\r\n\r\ncommuters?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat here looking at these wonderful plasma\r\n\r\nscreens, probably the first in the world, I remember  the\r\n\r\ntimes going to a movie at Lido Cinema where a seat  at  a\r\n\r\nstall cost us $2.50, and a circle seat $4.  When the  new\r\n\r\ngeneration  cinemas began operating, the price  of  movie\r\n\r\ntickets  was  double  what people were  used  to  paying.\r\n\r\nCinema-goers were crying foul.  Double the price?  I will\r\n\r\nstay  home  and watch the videos.  Today, with  DVDs  and\r\n\r\nVCDs in most homes, going to the movies is still a treat.\r\n\r\nPeople  have  come  to  enjoy the state-of-the-art  sound\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  comfortable  seats,  the  screens  and  the\r\n\r\npicture  quality  that the extra  $4  get  them.   Making\r\n\r\nmovies today is also much more expensive.  I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  people will go to the cinema for $4 now for a  movie\r\n\r\nin  the  old cinemas, even if one can be found today.   A\r\n\r\ntrip to a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmovie  now  will  cost  us $8, and that  is  without  the\r\n\r\npopcorn and soft drinks.  Let us learn to explain  things\r\n\r\nso that people can make sense of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus companies have set a benchmark that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have become used to.  Service standards  can\r\n\r\nand should get better.  It does not make sense to say now\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  wait  and we do not mind  waiting  for  30\r\n\r\nminutes instead of 15 minutes, like we used to, because I\r\n\r\ncannot take the 3-cent increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Parliament opened with a\r\n\r\ncautionary  Address  from the President  and,  since  the\r\n\r\nBudget, Singaporeans have been advised to be austere with\r\n\r\nan  uncertain economic backdrop.  As the economy seems to\r\n\r\nbe headed for some recovery, the longer term outlook will\r\n\r\nstill see companies making less revenues and not at rates\r\n\r\nof  increases as before.  This is a global phenomenon for\r\n\r\nmost  companies,  whether or not it  is  in  a  regulated\r\n\r\ntransport environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are seeing many companies buttoning down\r\n\r\ntheir  hatches and booking their profits early, employing\r\n\r\ntheir  profits  to secure cheaper capital,  restructuring\r\n\r\ntheir  balance  sheets, and making  changes  to  position\r\n\r\nthemselves,  so that they can operate profitably  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  lower  revenues down the  road.   I  think  the\r\n\r\ntransport companies are no different here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government's idea of seamless transportation\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond what the transport companies tell us, and  I\r\n\r\nhave some additional comments to add to the point made by\r\n\r\nMs  Braema.   What  do I mean?  Let  me  relate  this  to\r\n\r\nMembers.  When I was going to school in a university town\r\n\r\nat  Eugene, Oregon, I signed out a wheelchair for half  a\r\n\r\nday.   With a clipboard in hand, I went to various  parts\r\n\r\nof  the  university and to the town, and one of them  was\r\n\r\nthe   local  library.   Although  the  objective  of  the\r\n\r\nexercise was to understand how a wheelchair-bound  person\r\n\r\nwould  feel accessing buildings, I was amazed by the  bus\r\n\r\nride  that I took.  The bus platform lowered for  me  for\r\n\r\nthe wheelchair to be on, a single bus driver\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nde-bused,  helped me strap in and went on its  way.   So,\r\n\r\ngoing  down the road, this seamless transport would  come\r\n\r\ninto play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government has led the HDB upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme  and, as we can see, there is a ramping  up  of\r\n\r\nthe  construction of access ramps from bus stops  to  HDB\r\n\r\nprecincts,  and from carparks to linkways to HDB  blocks.\r\n\r\nThe  objective  of  Barrier Free  Access  (BFA)  for  HDB\r\n\r\ndwellers  is a long-range idea.  It is a long-range  plan\r\n\r\nto  give  our  aging population BFA all the  way  to  the\r\n\r\nbuses.   This is the PAP Government's idea of  long-range\r\n\r\nplanning of caring.  Not caring for the people?  I do not\r\n\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, in the future, I am sure that the reasons\r\n\r\nfor increases in the bus fares, as Ms Braema pointed out,\r\n\r\nwould  even include the cost of providing buses that  can\r\n\r\naccommodate the increasing number of people going  around\r\n\r\nin  wheelchairs.  The Government is not caring?   Clearly\r\n\r\nnot!   Perhaps  a poor way of showing it  -  that  it  is\r\n\r\nlistening.  But not caring and not listening?  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PAP Government had garnered\r\n\r\nsupport  from  our  people, and we  have  together  built\r\n\r\nSingapore to what it is today.  Our people face difficult\r\n\r\ntimes, and the decisions made by the Government then  had\r\n\r\ngreat implications on whether we survived as a nation  or\r\n\r\nnot.  This will not change.  The PAP Government had never\r\n\r\nsuccumbed to pressures and never went the way of populist\r\n\r\npolicies,  however  difficult politically  it  was.   The\r\n\r\nresolve  to  carry the nation and to implement  unpopular\r\n\r\npolicies  in  order  that we make it,  despite  political\r\n\r\ncosts,   shows   what   kind  of  Government   this   is.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation  has  set in motion a  shake-out  not  only\r\n\r\nglobal  businesses have to deal with, but governments  of\r\n\r\nthe  day  would have to address.  What we do during  this\r\n\r\nshake-out, and the kind of resolve we have to change  and\r\n\r\nput  on  new  armour for a different kind of  fight,  has\r\n\r\nbearings for our social and economic structures down  the\r\n\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am comforted by Minister Mah's and Minister Khaw's\r\n\r\nacknowledgement that the Government needs to  respond  to\r\n\r\nthe  calls by the people and to see their plight. I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will do a better job of showing that\r\n\r\nit has listened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope not just the PTC but the\r\n\r\nrespective Government bodies responsible for the slew  of\r\n\r\ncharges in fee increases will explain the rationale in  a\r\n\r\nway  that  people  can understand and, most  importantly,\r\n\r\nexplain  the timing for such increases, and consider  the\r\n\r\neconomic  plight of its users.  I hope that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan unite during these difficult times and to move on and\r\n\r\nbrace  themselves  for  the  greater  challenges  on  the\r\n\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\ndeclare   my   interest  as  a  Director  of   the   SMRT\r\n\r\nCorporation.  I also add that I no longer own any  shares\r\n\r\nin any of the public transport companies since the merger\r\n\r\nof MRT and TIBS in December 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I join this debate not to defend the public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators, but with a hope to give a different\r\n\r\nperspective to the issue, so that a more balanced view on\r\n\r\nboth sides of the coin would be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I empathise with the commuting\r\n\r\npublic,  who  are affected by the recent  round  of  fare\r\n\r\nincreases.  Fare adjustment not merely has its  financial\r\n\r\nimplications,  but it is also an emotive  issue.   In  an\r\n\r\narticle  in  Shin Min Daily, a writer angrily  complained\r\n\r\nthat his \"chwee kueh\" has increased from $1 to $1.20. And\r\n\r\nthe owner told this writer that the increase was a result\r\n\r\nof  the  recent fare increase.  So we can see how emotive\r\n\r\nthings can get.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, I also empathise with the\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council which, as some Members have also\r\n\r\npointed  out,  has the unenviable task of  balancing  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the commuting public with the need  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport operators to remain financially  viable\r\n\r\nin order to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide the required standard of service.  The nature  of\r\n\r\npublic transport service is such that it is characterised\r\n\r\nby   huge   capital   investments,  high   manpower   and\r\n\r\nsubstantial  energy or fuel cost.  For  example,  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  SMRT,  it  has fixed assets of  $1.38  billion,\r\n\r\nincluding   those   of  TIBS.   On  high   manpower   and\r\n\r\nsubstantial  energy  or  fuel  costs,  in  the  case   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  wage bill for bus operators is about  50%  of\r\n\r\ntotal  operating  cost,  and  40%  for  train  operators.\r\n\r\nTransport  workers, who provide 365 days of service,  and\r\n\r\nalmost round-the-clock service on a daily basis, have  to\r\n\r\nbe  appropriately remunerated and motivated in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  good  service  to commuters.   They  too  expect\r\n\r\nyearly  adjustment and incentives, so that they  will  be\r\n\r\nwithin  range of their fellow workers.  Some have  argued\r\n\r\nthat, in difficult times such as this, probably transport\r\n\r\nworkers  should  also moderate their  expectations.   But\r\n\r\nthis  is  very much more of the condition in  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket.    Not  many  realise,  for  example,  that   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  face perennial difficulties in recruiting  and\r\n\r\nretaining  bus  crews.  Singaporeans shun  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nwork, finding it tough and the working hours unearthly  - waking  up at 4 o'clock to do the first shift, and  going\r\n\r\nhome  at  3  o'clock in the morning when they finish  the\r\n\r\nlast  shift.  They find the pay not attractive, as it  is\r\n\r\nnot  commensurate with the type of hardship they have  to\r\n\r\nendure.  Their work is seldom appreciated by others,  and\r\n\r\nthey have to face complaints of commuters who have higher\r\n\r\ndemands,  and higher and higher expectations. Whether  in\r\n\r\ngood  times  or bad, bus companies have to pay attractive\r\n\r\nsalaries to attract and retain workers, so that they  can\r\n\r\ncontinue with their operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council, the body responsible\r\n\r\nfor regulating public transport service and approving bus\r\n\r\nfares,  has  a thankless job to do.  It has to  face  the\r\n\r\nwrath  of  public  opinion  whenever  there  is  a   fare\r\n\r\nadjustment, and also the unhappiness of public  transport\r\n\r\noperators, who usually do not find the approved increases\r\n\r\nmeet  the needs of what they have justified.  Whether  in\r\n\r\ngood  times or bad, there are always complaints  on  fare\r\n\r\nadjustments.  And we can all understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat it is more so during difficult times, such as now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to add that the record does show,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  that during the last 10-year  period  from\r\n\r\n1992-2001,  PTC approved a total of 11.7% for train  fare\r\n\r\nincrease  and 13.7% for bus fare increase.  The  consumer\r\n\r\nprice  index went up 13.3%, while real wage increased  by\r\n\r\n53%  and nominal wage increased by 68% over the same  10-year period. The fare increase approved by PTC could  not\r\n\r\ncover wage and other operating cost increases.  Operators\r\n\r\nhad  to  find  other  means  to increase  revenue,  adopt\r\n\r\nvigorous productivity improvements to make ends meet, and\r\n\r\nto   have   reasonable  profits  to   keep   shareholders\r\n\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think there was very much argument on\r\n\r\nreasonable  returns  to  transport  operators  and  their\r\n\r\nshareholders. The nature of these companies is also  such\r\n\r\nthat  investors  find  that they are  really  similar  to\r\n\r\nutilities  stock.   In  the case of  SMRT,  they  gave  a\r\n\r\ndividend  yield of 4.12%, and for SBS, 4.24%,  which  are\r\n\r\nvery  much in line with market expectations.  So, we  can\r\n\r\nsee from the last round of fare increases that there were\r\n\r\nno big movements in their share prices, a reflection that\r\n\r\nit  is  very  much  in  line  with  market  expectations.\r\n\r\nShareholders who invest in these companies  also  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect  exciting share price movements like those in  the\r\n\r\ntechnology industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only fair to say that PTC has done a good job\r\n\r\nin keeping public transport fares within the range of the\r\n\r\nCPI, and substantially below that of real wage increases,\r\n\r\nmaking it affordable to commuters.  At the same time,  it\r\n\r\ndid  not allow automatic fare increases and ensured  that\r\n\r\noperators  earned their keep through better productivity.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  believe  that  the work of  the  PTC  should  be\r\n\r\nrecognised by this House and that they should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto continue with their work without interference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some have suggested that having representatives\r\n\r\nof  public transport operators on the Council  is  not  a\r\n\r\ngood\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidea,  as  it  may give a wrong perception,  even  though\r\n\r\nthese   representatives  do  not   take   part   in   the\r\n\r\ndeliberations on fare increases and they have  absolutely\r\n\r\nno say in approving fare increases.  On the other hand, I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure whether it is a good idea to exclude  them,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Public  Transport Council  does  more  than\r\n\r\napproving  fare  increases.  I do not know  whether  this\r\n\r\nCouncil should become an authority, or whether it  should\r\n\r\nbe  a  partnership  between the Council  and  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators,  so that it  could  look  into  the\r\n\r\nvarious aspects of public transport, so that services can\r\n\r\nbe improved and costs can be contained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really a thankless job to do. There are\r\n\r\nsuggestions  to include other representatives,  and  even\r\n\r\nMembers of this House.  I am not sure whether there would\r\n\r\nbe many volunteers rushing for this job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Public Transport Council\r\n\r\nmust  continue  to  be stringent when dealing  with  fare\r\n\r\nadjustments.  Public transport operators must continue to\r\n\r\nimprove productivity and contain costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How best do we then deal with fare adjustments when\r\n\r\nthey become necessary?  Sir, there were suggestions that,\r\n\r\nif public transport service is not provided by commercial\r\n\r\nenterprise,  then perhaps there could be  lower  cost  to\r\n\r\nthem.   But, Sir, if the cost of capital is not  provided\r\n\r\nby shareholders and, therefore, the required profit and a\r\n\r\nreasonable return, then it has to be provided  by  loans,\r\n\r\nwhich also have interest cost.  So, either way, the  cost\r\n\r\nfactor would always be there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not a practical solution to allow only\r\n\r\nfare  increases when the economy is doing  well,  as  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  adjust fares may not coincide with the economic\r\n\r\ncycle.   Looking for such windows could lead to irregular\r\n\r\nand  hefty fare increases that are more painful.  Second-guessing the economic cycle could also catch PTC  on  the\r\n\r\nwrong  foot  and  force  PTC to approve  hefty  increases\r\n\r\nduring  a downturn, which is hardly acceptable.  It  also\r\n\r\nmeans   that   the  profitability  of  public   transport\r\n\r\noperators\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould deteriorate over time and surge or spike when there\r\n\r\nis  a fare increase, a situation that is not satisfactory\r\n\r\nto  their shareholders, and transport operators will find\r\n\r\nit   difficult  to  do  good  financial  management   and\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, the recommendation of the Cost Review\r\n\r\nCommittee in 1997 for a small increase on a regular basis\r\n\r\nis  a  better solution.  The advantage is that it is less\r\n\r\npainful  and disruptive to the commuters.  Using the  10-year  period of 1992-2001 again as an illustration, train\r\n\r\nfares  went  up 11.7% before fare adjustment during  this\r\n\r\nperiod, ranging from 0.22% to 6.42%; 2.19% in 1994; 6.42%\r\n\r\nin 1995; 0.22% in 1997 and 2.23% in the year 2000.  If we\r\n\r\ndo  regular small increases on a yearly basis, it amounts\r\n\r\nto  a  small fare adjustment of 1.17%, which, I  believe,\r\n\r\nwould  be  more acceptable, and it avoids  the  need  for\r\n\r\ndeferring  fare adjustments until such time that  it  may\r\n\r\nnot be acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For public transport operators, it means more\r\n\r\ncertainty  in financial planning, the ability  to  better\r\n\r\nplan  for  capital expenditure and investment.  It  would\r\n\r\nalso  smoothen the earnings of public transport operators\r\n\r\nand  avoid  spikes  in  earnings,  which,  if  taken   in\r\n\r\nisolation,  may be misinterpreted as obscene  profits  or\r\n\r\nunacceptable windfalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is never easy to find simple solutions to\r\n\r\ncomplex public transport issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about 4 million passenger trips are made on\r\n\r\nbuses  and  trains each day.  The commuters using  public\r\n\r\ntransport   range  from  workers  to  senior  executives,\r\n\r\nstudents,   housewives,   to  senior   citizens.    Their\r\n\r\npreference   and  requirements  range  from  very   basic\r\n\r\ntransport  service, and some would say they do  not  want\r\n\r\nairconditioning in buses, to the high end  business-class\r\n\r\ntype  of  service.  Their tolerance to fares also differs\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  To make each and every commuter satisfied\r\n\r\nis  really a daunting task.  It is unlike airlines  where\r\n\r\nthey  can  have  differentiation in type  of  services  - having first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclass,  business  class, economy class  -  and  therefore\r\n\r\ncharging  different  fares  for  them.   In  our   public\r\n\r\ntransport service, we can only have one class  fare.   So\r\n\r\nwhatever changes will affect everyone, across the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members spoke about no-frill service. Over the\r\n\r\nyears,  in  tandem with the progress of our economy,  and\r\n\r\nwith  a  higher  standard of living, expectations  for  a\r\n\r\nbetter  public transport service have also become higher.\r\n\r\nFor   better   comfort  of  passengers,   we   introduced\r\n\r\nairconditioned  service.  For safety and  convenience  of\r\n\r\ncommuters, we introduced low floorboard buses.  For clean\r\n\r\nenvironment,  we  introduced Euro  1,  and  now  Euro  2,\r\n\r\nengines.   These add up to cost.  For those who will  not\r\n\r\nwant  to wait longer for bus services, they demand higher\r\n\r\nfrequency.   For  those  who  wish  to  have  convenience\r\n\r\nservice,   they  ask  for  more  services,  more   direct\r\n\r\nservices, and higher frequencies.  And some of these  new\r\n\r\nservices  may not be economical to run.  And if they  are\r\n\r\nnot happy with it, they go to the MPs, and MPs will write\r\n\r\nto  the  public  transport operators.   If  MPs  are  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied, they will complain to the Minister.  So,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthese  uneconomical services and higher frequencies  that\r\n\r\npeople  expect  also add to cost.  Can we  not  say  that\r\n\r\nthese are frills?  Would people accept non-airconditioned\r\n\r\nservice?  Would we want to go back to the days where - we\r\n\r\nwould  not  talk about rickety buses - buses with  higher\r\n\r\nsteps  so  that it is a bit more dangerous to our  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens and ladies going to work in high heels  find  it\r\n\r\nvery inconvenient?  I do not think that that is accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd,  even  if we want to do it now, the cost  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport  service  cannot be  changed  overnight.   From\r\n\r\n1980,  when  the  cost of the bus ranged around  $70,000-$80,000,  it  is now $270,000.  So, even if  we  want  to\r\n\r\nchange these buses, it cannot be done overnight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that for issues like this, we should\r\n\r\nreally  be  looking at it on a more balanced  basis,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  seek  a  long-term  view.   Close  collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween  LTA,  PTC  and  public  transport  operators  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  required  to contain cost.   I  believe  that\r\n\r\ncommuters must also be brought into this and make them a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npartner  of  this  scheme, to decide on the  standard  of\r\n\r\nservice required and therefore the related cost, so  that\r\n\r\nwhen   adjustments  are  to  be  made,  they  can  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  why these changes are needed  and  why  these\r\n\r\nadjustments  are  made.  In difficult  times  like  this,\r\n\r\nsometimes it is really difficult to explain to those  who\r\n\r\nare  affected financially.  But I think it is  gratifying\r\n\r\nto learn in this House that Government has made sure that\r\n\r\nthose  who are badly hit are being provided for.   So,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is now up to us really to have a good reasoning\r\n\r\non this round of fare increases and try to explain to our\r\n\r\nconstituents  so  that they can also understand,  perhaps\r\n\r\nnot fully accept, why it has to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch upon one other issue,\r\n\r\nthat of cycling, as brought up by Ms Irene Ng.  I declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest as Chairman of the Singapore Sports Council.\r\n\r\nSir, I think it is a good idea, and I think cycling is  a\r\n\r\ngood  sport  that  we  should promote.   But  creating  a\r\n\r\ncycling  lane  is not a good solution, as it  would  also\r\n\r\ntake up road space.  One example is China.  China has 700\r\n\r\nmillion  cyclists and now the authorities  are  having  a\r\n\r\nhard time trying to do away with cycling lanes, and I  do\r\n\r\nnot think we should really be going in that direction.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that more park connectors be built so  that\r\n\r\ncycling can be promoted as a healthy exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I oppose the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to  join  in this debate.   We  are  amidst\r\n\r\ndifficult  times.   And, like my fellow  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  I understand and feel the distress of the  people\r\n\r\nover price increases that raise the cost of living.  I am\r\n\r\nglad for this Motion, for it provides an opportunity  for\r\n\r\nmany  of  us to reflect the concerns of our constituents.\r\n\r\nAs  we saw yesterday, and no doubt, we will see today  as\r\n\r\nwell,  my colleagues do quickly seize the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress their views and to reflect the sentiments on  the\r\n\r\nground.   My  residents have also expressed to  me  their\r\n\r\nconcerns and unhappiness over various increases,  and  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  recent transport  fare  increase.   The\r\n\r\nsentiment of the people is clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I appreciate the Motion before the House for\r\n\r\nproviding  the opportunity to discuss the  issue  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent  transport fare increases, I do not agree with  it\r\n\r\nin  its entirety.  First, the Motion reflected the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's appreciation of 17th June that this is not the\r\n\r\nbest time to increase fares.  However, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nat  the  same  occasion also said that the  principle  of\r\n\r\nsmall increases is right.  This was left out.  This is an\r\n\r\nimportant  omission and I felt ought to be corrected,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the first statement by the Prime Minister is placed\r\n\r\nin its proper and complete context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as noted by several colleagues who spoke\r\n\r\nearlier,  the  PTC  is  a  body  set  up  by  Parliament,\r\n\r\nspecifically   to   make   decisions   regarding   public\r\n\r\ntransport.   It has performed its duties, and  unless  we\r\n\r\nare  convinced  that it is derelict in carrying  out  its\r\n\r\nduties,  I wonder if it is wise for the House to  require\r\n\r\nit  to review a specific decision that it made, with  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  getting  it  to  change  its  mind  on  this\r\n\r\ndecision.   Sir,  with  this in  mind,  I  am  moving  an\r\n\r\namendment  to the Motion before the House.  I have  taken\r\n\r\nthe liberty to ask the Clerk of Parliament to make copies\r\n\r\nof  this  amendment,  which I  would  like  to  ask  your\r\n\r\npermission to be distributed to the Members of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

Members.]   Could  you  move  your\r\n\r\namendment, Dr Tan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I beg to move the amendment\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In line 3, to leave out the word \"and\";\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In line 5, after the word \"fares\", to insert\r\n\r\nthe  words, \"and noting his support for the principle  of\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council granting small increases\"; and\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In lines 5 and 6, to leave out the words, \"to\r\n\r\nreview  its decision on the increase in public  transport\r\n\r\nfares\",  and  there to insert the words, \"when  reviewing\r\n\r\nrequests  for  fare increases, to take into consideration\r\n\r\nrelevant  factors  such  as  the  affordability  of   the\r\n\r\ncommuters  and  the  viability of  the  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is really no good time to increase fares.\r\n\r\nNobody likes to pay more,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  if  one  can  afford it.  It is in  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthings.   However, I agree with PM and my fellow Members,\r\n\r\nwho  have spoken earlier, that this is not the best  time\r\n\r\nto  increase fares.  The economy is down, many are out of\r\n\r\njob  and  the  future is still uncertain,  though  it  is\r\n\r\nbeginning to brighten up.  If my income were reduced  and\r\n\r\nuncertain, I would certainly wish that the cost of living\r\n\r\nwould  not rise, and even hope that it would be  reduced.\r\n\r\nHence,  where  expenditure can be deferred to  keep  cost\r\n\r\nand,  hence, fares down, it should be done.   But,  alas,\r\n\r\nlife  does not stop just because the economy is bad.   It\r\n\r\ncontinues.   So some costs continue to rise - maintenance\r\n\r\nmust  be  carried out, old equipment need to be replaced,\r\n\r\nand  new  equipment need to be purchased, if we  want  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to have a good public transport system.   Fares\r\n\r\nmay  thus need to rise for all these necessary activities\r\n\r\nto  be carried out.  So, even in difficult times, as now,\r\n\r\nwe  have  also to think of the future.  For  what  we  do\r\n\r\ntoday  affect  the lives of our children  tomorrow.   The\r\n\r\ndecisions  that  bus  companies make  to-day  affect  the\r\n\r\nservices  they can deliver tomorrow.  What  sort  of  bus\r\n\r\nservices  do our children deserve?  And what do we  leave\r\n\r\nthem with?  So, while the Prime Minister agreed that this\r\n\r\nis   not  the  best  time  to  increase  fares,  he  also\r\n\r\nrecognised the need to increase fares to enable  critical\r\n\r\nactivities that must be carried out if we are to maintain\r\n\r\nthe  viability of the public transport system.   He  thus\r\n\r\nsupports increases in small steps that are affordable and\r\n\r\nless painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall past instances, other than transport fares,\r\n\r\nwhen  delay and reluctance deferred price increases until\r\n\r\nthe  inevitable.   When the prices  were  increased,  the\r\n\r\nincreases were large, and were very painful.  There  were\r\n\r\nthen  calls  for increases in small steps, to occur  more\r\n\r\nfrequently, so as to spread out the pain.  This  is  what\r\n\r\nis  being  done  now - a small increase in  fares.   But,\r\n\r\nalas, our memory is short.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of fare increase is inherently a\r\n\r\nsituation  of  conflict.  The public  dislikes  fares  to\r\n\r\nincrease, but public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntransport   operators   need   it   to   remain   viable.\r\n\r\nParliament,  in its wisdom has delegated this  unenviable\r\n\r\ntask  of approving fare increases to the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil.   In  the debate on the PTC Bill  in  1987,  the\r\n\r\nHouse  made  it clear to the PTC that they must  consider\r\n\r\nboth  the welfare of the people and the viability of  the\r\n\r\nbus  companies,  to  ensure the availability  of  a  good\r\n\r\npublic transport system in the long term interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   As I said earlier, this situation is inherently\r\n\r\nconflicting.  To carry out the difficult task of the PTC,\r\n\r\nable,  capable,  fair-minded and honourable  people  were\r\n\r\nappointed  to  the  Council.   Hence,  since  1987,  fare\r\n\r\nincreases have come before the PTC.  But, today, there is\r\n\r\na  Motion before this House asking the PTC to review  its\r\n\r\ndecision  on the recent fare increases.  We are  treading\r\n\r\non  uncomfortable, if not dangerous, water.  We formed  a\r\n\r\nbody and delegated to it responsibilities.  The body  has\r\n\r\ndischarged  its responsibilities, and we are  questioning\r\n\r\nits decision in public, with the intention of getting  it\r\n\r\nto  change its mind.  The public and the world will  look\r\n\r\nat this House and wonder if we made good, well-considered\r\n\r\ndecisions,  and  abide by them.  The  question  would  be\r\n\r\nasked, is this House to be trusted?  People who are asked\r\n\r\nto  assume  positions in our institutions will wonder  if\r\n\r\ntheir decisions would be appreciated and supported.  They\r\n\r\nwill  ask whether they will be abandoned when the  goings\r\n\r\nget  tough.   We  must  be  very wary  of  demeaning  our\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  We must not sacrifice our institutions for\r\n\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should carefully study the explanation given\r\n\r\nby  the  PTC  for  approving the fare  increase.   If  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that they had done the work fairly and properly,\r\n\r\nwe  should courageously support its decision and take  on\r\n\r\nthe  more difficult and unpleasant task of explaining and\r\n\r\nconvincing our people of the correctness of the decision.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to support popular decisions than to support\r\n\r\ndecisions that are right, but painful.  But for the long-term  interest of the country and people, we must do what\r\n\r\nis right and good.  I personally believe that with regard\r\n\r\nto  the  fare increases, including the current one,  that\r\n\r\nhave come before the PTC, it has dutifully performed  the\r\n\r\ntask delegated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  it by Parliament, within the framework and guidelines\r\n\r\nestablished.   I would like to quote what Mr  Eric  Gwee,\r\n\r\nChairman  of  PTC,  said in regard  to  the  decision  to\r\n\r\napprove the recent fare increases:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In reviewing the application by SBS, TIBS and SMRT,\r\n\r\nPTC  tried to balance the need of public interest  to  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded and for public transport operators to  remain\r\n\r\nfinancially viable.  This year, the PTC has improved  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  scrutinising the bus  and  train  operators'\r\n\r\naccounts  and  financial performance.  PTC  is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the operators have been prudent in containing costs\r\n\r\nand  that they have not been profiteering at the  expense\r\n\r\nof our commuters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the sentiment of the other Boon Wan in the\r\n\r\nHouse,  when  he said yesterday that, \"There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong in criticising the decision of the PTC.  They  have\r\n\r\na  difficult job of balancing the long-term interests  of\r\n\r\ncommuters   and   the   short-term   effects   on   them.\r\n\r\nInevitably,  judgment has to be made.  We  can  certainly\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  PTC's judgment, as honest  people  would.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot fault them for not being diligent.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the PTC to always remember that its role\r\n\r\nis  both  important and sensitive and that it must  carry\r\n\r\nout    its    duties   conscientiously,   properly    and\r\n\r\nprofessionally, within the terms and reference that  have\r\n\r\nbeen set for it, so that the public will continue to have\r\n\r\nconfidence in its decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I also urge the Government to take\r\n\r\nheed  of  the feedback provided by Members of this  House\r\n\r\nduring this debate and from the people.  Please listen to\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek the support of the House on the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has moved an amendment\r\n\r\ncomprising three parts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In line 3, to leave out the word \"and\";\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In line 5, after the word \"fares\", to insert\r\n\r\nthe  words, \"and noting his support for the principle  of\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council granting small increases\"; and\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In lines 5 and 6, to leave out the words, \"to\r\n\r\nreview  its decision on the increase in public  transport\r\n\r\nfares\",  and  there to insert the words, \"when  reviewing\r\n\r\nrequests for fare increases, to take into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsideration relevant factors such as the  viability  of\r\n\r\nthe  public transport operators and affordability of  the\r\n\r\ncommuters\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is now the amendment moved by Dr Tan\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind hon.

Mr Iswaran.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the motion that has just been moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Dr Tan Boon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It injects a note of balance, a note of\r\n\r\ncircumspection, to this debate which is warranted,  given\r\n\r\nthe  heat  that has been generated in this House  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the last day-and-a-half of debates.  Allow  me\r\n\r\nto elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I was moved significantly by Mr Tan and\r\n\r\nDr  Tan's impassioned plea on behalf of Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ncommuters  on  why  these fare increases  are  ill-timed,\r\n\r\nunwelcome  and inconvenient.  But, having  said  that,  I\r\n\r\nalso  want  to say that my personal experience with  this\r\n\r\nhas  been  the same.  I have received a lot  of  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom constituents and others on this increase and why  it\r\n\r\nis  not  welcomed.   The  timing is  part  of  an  unholy\r\n\r\nconfluence   of   factors   -   economic   downturn   and\r\n\r\nretrenchments.  At this time, a fare increase for  buses,\r\n\r\nno matter how small, is, in a sense, the proverbial straw\r\n\r\nthat breaks the camel's back.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, even as this House has the responsibility\r\n\r\nto  voice the concerns of Singaporeans and address  those\r\n\r\nissues  in  a  comprehensive way,  we  equally  have  the\r\n\r\nobligation  to  ensure  that the debate  encompasses  the\r\n\r\ntotal  perspective  of the issue.  I think  the  wave  of\r\n\r\npublic   opinion   is   great  in  this   debate.    Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are agitated about this.  But it would be  a\r\n\r\ndisservice  to  the quality of the debate and  the  final\r\n\r\npolicy or conclusion we draw if we were to only focus  on\r\n\r\nthat aspect of this issue.  In the course of this debate,\r\n\r\nthe  terms  \"fair  and reasonable\" have cropped  up  many\r\n\r\ntimes.  And, indeed, I think all of us would like  to  be\r\n\r\nfair   and  reasonable  and  be  seen  to  be  fair   and\r\n\r\nreasonable.  But the question, I suppose, is \"fair\"  from\r\n\r\nwhose   point   of  view  and  \"reasonable\"   from   what\r\n\r\nperspective?   Let  me try to broaden the  perspective  a\r\n\r\nlittle to show what I mean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking at it from the perspective of the\r\n\r\ncompany, and here I would like to make a declaration.   I\r\n\r\nam  an  employee of Temasek Holdings, which  is  a  major\r\n\r\nshareholder of SMRT, but I have no direct interest in any\r\n\r\nof  the  public  transport operators.   Is  SMRT  such  a\r\n\r\nlaggard in comparison to similar companies, ie, transport\r\n\r\noperators, in other parts of the world?  Yesterday, there\r\n\r\nwas  a very sharp contrast drawn between SMRT and MTR  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon gave us many examples of why\r\n\r\nMTR  in  Hong  Kong  was  such  an  innovative  transport\r\n\r\noperator, introducing many interesting dimensions to  its\r\n\r\nservice.   If I recall correctly, some examples were:  if\r\n\r\none  takes 10 rides, then he gets a free lunch or a  free\r\n\r\ndinner.  And, also, when a new line was introduced, there\r\n\r\nwas  no  fare increase.  In fact, it was a fare decrease.\r\n\r\nSo  why  can  the SMRT not be like that?  Indeed,  I  was\r\n\r\nquite  troubled and puzzled by that, and I  thought  this\r\n\r\nwarrants a little bit more investigation.  So, I dug up a\r\n\r\nlittle more data on this.  It is interesting.  As always,\r\n\r\nthere  is no such thing as a free lunch, and let me  tell\r\n\r\nMembers why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTR is actually better described as a property\r\n\r\ncompany than a transport\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompany.  It owns the land above its stations and  around\r\n\r\nits  stations.   70-80% of MTR's profits  come  from  its\r\n\r\nproperty  business,  not related to  its  rail  business.\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean?  MTR has to promote ridership on its\r\n\r\nlines.   Why?   Because that is what  will  increase  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  its  main  business,  which  is  the  property\r\n\r\nbusiness.   And  MTR will therefore cross-subsidise  from\r\n\r\nits  property business to the rail business.  Indeed,  we\r\n\r\ncould infer that this is what is happening here.  Is that\r\n\r\na  right business strategy?  Probably from MTR's point of\r\n\r\nview,  yes,  because, overall, it is able to continue  to\r\n\r\nimprove  its  profitability.  But the analogy  with  SMRT\r\n\r\nthen is perhaps unfair, because SMRT, by comparison, is a\r\n\r\npure  transport  operator.  90% of SMRT's  revenue  comes\r\n\r\nfrom the train, bus and taxi type services, and 70-80% of\r\n\r\nits  profits comes from the same business.  So the  exact\r\n\r\nreverse,  if  you like, of what MTR has.  SMRT  has  very\r\n\r\nlittle  scope  to cross-subsidise.  There is  nothing  to\r\n\r\ncross-subsidise  from.  Really, at the end  of  day,  the\r\n\r\nonly  return it gets is from its fares, and  just  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplete,  with  a little bit of rental  and  advertising\r\n\r\nincome of about 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question, from a broader perspective,\r\n\r\nis:  Is  SMRT profiteering?  It is a listed company.   Is\r\n\r\nthe  company rewarding its shareholders unfairly?  Again,\r\n\r\nI  think  it  was the Non-Constituency Member,  Mr  Steve\r\n\r\nChia,  who  raised this question rather rhetorically,  if\r\n\r\nnot  theatrically: \"Isn't making more  than  $50  million\r\n\r\nprofit enough?\"  That is a good question.  Let us look at\r\n\r\nthe issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of investment product or share is SMRT\r\n\r\nshare?   Think  about it.  The growth prospects  of  this\r\n\r\ncompany   are  very  constrained.   Ridership  and   fare\r\n\r\nincreases are the only real factors that would drive  its\r\n\r\ntop  line growth.  I do not want to talk like an analyst,\r\n\r\nbut  since  we  have  totted up  a  lot  of  figures  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  data,  I think we need to  look  at  these  in\r\n\r\ntotality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best proxy for growth in this company is really\r\n\r\npopulation growth, which means, at best, it is going to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nachieve  2-3%.   In  fact, last year,  SMRT  achieved,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  0.6% growth, in fact, lower than you would  think\r\n\r\nto be the average.  So this is not a company whose stocks\r\n\r\nyou  buy  because you expect this wild run in  its  share\r\n\r\nprice,  because it is going to become very  valuable  and\r\n\r\nyou get capital appreciation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another dimension to this. SMRT is like\r\n\r\nany transport company whose fare structures are regulated\r\n\r\nand  have  a regulatory risk because, at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  the  revenue  is affected fundamentally  by  policy\r\n\r\ndecisions.  I do not think I need to belabour  the  point\r\n\r\nabout  the  regulatory risk because the  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse on the fare increase is ample evidence of what that\r\n\r\nrisk is all about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why invest in SMRT shares? What is the benefit?\r\n\r\nIf you ask fund managers or financial analysts, they will\r\n\r\ntell  you  that  it  is what you call a  counter-cyclical\r\n\r\ndefensive stock.  What does it mean?  Basically, it is  a\r\n\r\nnice  stock to have in your portfolio, so that when  your\r\n\r\ntech  stocks  are  bombing out,  all  those  high  growth\r\n\r\nstories are now fizzling out, you still have some  stocks\r\n\r\nin  your  portfolio that continue to offer you a low  but\r\n\r\nsteady  growth  rate and a decent rate of return,  either\r\n\r\nthrough  dividend  pay-outs or from  very  small  capital\r\n\r\nappreciation.   It  is  a kind of stock  where  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy goes up, it will not go up as fast.  But when the\r\n\r\neconomy  goes  down, it will not go down as fast  either.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the value of stocks like this, low beta stocks.\r\n\r\nSo, it is not a stock you hold for capital appreciation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to look at SMRT shares, in July 2000\r\n\r\nwhen it was listed, its price was 61 cents, and yesterday\r\n\r\nwhen I checked, it was about 68-68.5 cents.  It is not  a\r\n\r\nfantastic growth.  At the end of day, it is the  dividend\r\n\r\nyield  that  it will pay.  So, are they profiteering  and\r\n\r\nrewarding  the  shareholders  unfairly?   What   is   the\r\n\r\ndividend  yield of SMRT?  The current dividend  yield  is\r\n\r\n4.1%, and this 4.1% is gross of tax.  It is gross, before\r\n\r\nyou take into account tax.  So, if you are on the top tax\r\n\r\nbracket,  you  have to knock off another  20-odd  percent\r\n\r\nafter  tax  under the new tax regime, or  lower  for  the\r\n\r\nlower tiers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare that 4.1% dividend yield with some\r\n\r\nless  risky products.  For 10-year Government bonds,  the\r\n\r\nyield  is 3.5%.  If you look at the LTA bonds, the  yield\r\n\r\nis 3.7%.  So, when you compare that with what SMRT shares\r\n\r\ngive as a dividend yield, is it that unreasonable for the\r\n\r\nrisk  that  the shareholders have to bear?  We  can  also\r\n\r\ncompare  this  dividend  yield with  utilities  companies\r\n\r\naround  the world - US, Japan, UK, etc.  Because, let  us\r\n\r\nface  it, it is an international market, you do  not  put\r\n\r\nmoney  in SMRT, you can put it in the same kind of  stock\r\n\r\nelsewhere in the world.  The interesting result  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  range for dividend yields for utilities counters  is\r\n\r\nbetween 3.5-6.5%.  That means SMRT's dividend yield  rate\r\n\r\nis  not  exorbitant.  It is within the  industry's  norms\r\n\r\nand, if anything, at the lower end of the industry range.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were a lot of other points that can be\r\n\r\nraised on the financial front.  I do not want to go  into\r\n\r\nthat  and  a  lot of details now.  But why  go  into  all\r\n\r\nthese?   Why  this  financial  comparison?   What  is  so\r\n\r\nimportant  about it?  SMRT is a listed company.   We  can\r\n\r\ndebate  the  merits of whether it is good to have  public\r\n\r\ntransport operators as listed companies or not, but  that\r\n\r\nis  a  separate  issue.  We should not  vilify  a  listed\r\n\r\ncompany  which is basically competing in the  market  not\r\n\r\njust  with  other  operators and  so  on,  but  also  for\r\n\r\ninvestor  funds.  If you want to continue  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nimprovements  to  rolling stock  and  other  innovations,\r\n\r\nthere  are only two sources of funding, either the profit\r\n\r\nyou  make in your internal financing, or you get it  from\r\n\r\noutside,  equity or debt.  And if they do not  achieve  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  rate of return and offer a reasonable  yield,\r\n\r\nwho  is  going to put money in SMRT?  Mr Ravindran  says,\r\n\r\n\"Well, if they do not get it, they can go and raise money\r\n\r\noutside  by  issuing shares.\"  But the question  is,  who\r\n\r\nwill  subscribe to those shares?  Because, at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day, the comparison will be made on an international\r\n\r\nbasis.  So, we have to be realistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not defending the fare increase per se. But in\r\n\r\nthe heat of the discussion and argument, let us not throw\r\n\r\nthe baby out with the bath-water and start vilifying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstitutions and companies unfairly.  I was reflecting on\r\n\r\nthis last night.  If SMRT's profitability goes down, then\r\n\r\nwe  will  have another debate in this House saying,  \"You\r\n\r\nsee,  this is the GLC that is under performing.\"   And  I\r\n\r\nknow many Members of this House would champion that line.\r\n\r\nIf  SMRT's  profitability goes up, there will be  another\r\n\r\nline, precisely along what we are talking about, that  it\r\n\r\nis making money at the expense of Singaporeans.  So it is\r\n\r\na no-win situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, if we pursue this kind of logic, it\r\n\r\nis  not  going  to be helpful for Singapore, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nor,  for  that  matter, our transport companies  and  our\r\n\r\ntransport system.  So, I was trying to inject that  sense\r\n\r\nof  reality,  just to create a balance in  the  thinking.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not get carried away without some reflection  on\r\n\r\nthe broader issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that the amendment to the Motion\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  moved is a fair one.   It  balances  the\r\n\r\nissues, and the Member has pointed out clearly why he  is\r\n\r\ndoing  so.  I have been thinking about whether we  should\r\n\r\nreally be asking PTC to review its decision.  Let me tell\r\n\r\nMembers that the best thing that can happen now is,  yes,\r\n\r\nfor  the fares to be reduced, or restored to the original\r\n\r\nposition.   I  think all of us would be very happy  about\r\n\r\nthat.  It is an easy decision.  The question is: is  that\r\n\r\nthe  right  decision?  Dr Tan Boon Wan has elaborated  on\r\n\r\nthe  point, and I would just reinforce it.  The first  is\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  the integrity of the  PTC.   We  need  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between the process and the outcome.  We  may\r\n\r\nnot like the outcome, fine.  But you do not undermine the\r\n\r\nprocess  unnecessarily.   Let us  go  back,  revisit  the\r\n\r\nprocess  that led to this outcome and see how it  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved.  But once we start tinkering with everything at\r\n\r\nthe same time, we create uncertainty in people's minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would any self-respecting individual want to\r\n\r\nserve  on  the PTC, if the concerted view of the  PTC  is\r\n\r\nsubject to parliamentary review, Executive review,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic  opinion  review, and so on,  and  then  they  are\r\n\r\nforced to recant?  Where is the credibility when the next\r\n\r\ntime  they  make an announcement, whether it  is  a  fare\r\n\r\nreduction or fare increase?  How would they defend  their\r\n\r\nposition?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part is the message we would send if we do\r\n\r\ncompel  this fare reduction after it has been  announced.\r\n\r\nIt  goes  to  the heart of the issue of how we  would  be\r\n\r\nperceived as a country, and a system within which  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness.   If we have capricious changes in  policy,  or\r\n\r\nspecific policy decision, because of this sort of  public\r\n\r\nopinion, then I think the regulatory risk premium, that I\r\n\r\ntalked  about  earlier,  would  go  up  significantly  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But does that mean we do nothing?  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying that.  And I do not want to be misinterpreted.   I\r\n\r\nthink  there is a lot we can do.  But the amendment  that\r\n\r\nhas  been moved by the Member which says, first, it drops\r\n\r\nthe   need   for   the   PTC  to  review   its   specific\r\n\r\nrecommendation, and instead focuses on the process where,\r\n\r\nin making its decision, it takes into account all factors\r\n\r\nand,  in  particular, viability of the operators and  the\r\n\r\naffordability  of  the  commuters.   That   is   a   more\r\n\r\nproductive, long-term solution that this House should  be\r\n\r\nendorsing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that score, in terms of the process, a lot has\r\n\r\nbeen said about what we can do to improve and change, and\r\n\r\nI  offer  a  few suggestions.  On the composition,  I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  PTC's composition  can  be  improved.\r\n\r\nWhilst  having public transport operators as  members  of\r\n\r\nthe PTC may not necessarily, in any way, have a conflict,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  excuse themselves from  critical  decision\r\n\r\npoints.  There is still the issue of perception.  And for\r\n\r\nthat reason alone, we should leave them out of it and let\r\n\r\nthem  come in as experts, or as presenters of their point\r\n\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been another suggestion in some quarters,\r\n\r\nwhere  maybe  we bring in commuters themselves  into  the\r\n\r\nPTC.   I  have  trouble with that, as  it  is  the  exact\r\n\r\nanalogue  of the public transport operators, but  on  the\r\n\r\nother side.  If we cannot have a transport operator who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstands  to  benefit from a fare increase on the  Council,\r\n\r\nthen can we justify having commuters who stand to benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  a  fare reduction on the Council as well?  I  think\r\n\r\nthere is a contradiction here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we ought to have is a Public Transport Council\r\n\r\nmade  up of experts from different areas, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nfinancial  experts, transport industry experts and  maybe\r\n\r\nthose with prior experience in the industry, so that when\r\n\r\nthe   deliberations  occur,  it  is  a  considered  final\r\n\r\nopinion,  drawing  on a wide range of  expertise.   I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve   the  PTC's  deliberations  can  also  be   more\r\n\r\ntransparent.  Because, at the end of the day,  people  do\r\n\r\nwant  to know why and, by this, I mean both commuters  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  transport operators, how they arrive  at  their\r\n\r\ndecision,  and  that  will  help  raise  the   level   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding and debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of formula, CPI + X, I would like to\r\n\r\nknow  how productivity factors are encapsulated  in  this\r\n\r\nformula.  The Senior Minister of State yesterday  alluded\r\n\r\nto this, but some clarification is necessary.  Because on\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  it,  it looks like you have  got  a  total\r\n\r\ninsulation  from  cost increases and you  get  the  clear\r\n\r\nincrease  in  nominal prices without any  adjustment,  or\r\n\r\nrequirement  to improve your productivity.  And,  yet,  I\r\n\r\nthink this is not the case.  This needs to be brought out\r\n\r\nin  the open so that people understand this clearly  that\r\n\r\nthere is already, if there is not then there should be, a\r\n\r\nproductivity discount to this formula.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, Sir, we can talk about all this\r\n\r\ntinkering with the process.  I feel the best solution  is\r\n\r\nstill  to  introduce greater competition  in  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system, particularly perhaps in the bus  area,\r\n\r\nif we cannot do it in the train system.  Because then, we\r\n\r\nwill  avoid issues of how do you fix the price,  are  you\r\n\r\nprofiteering, and so on.  Because the market will lead to\r\n\r\nstraight  competition, and there should be an element  of\r\n\r\ninternal correction within the market.  Many Members have\r\n\r\ndrawn the analogy with the telecommunications sector  and\r\n\r\nothers.    I   know   there   are   differences   between\r\n\r\ntransportation and telecommunications, and so on.  But at\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nend  of  the  day,  we  do not realise  the  benefits  of\r\n\r\ncompetition until we have it.  And then, it becomes  very\r\n\r\nobvious.   Why did we not do this before?    I  think  we\r\n\r\nought  to  try  it, if not in a total way, then  in  some\r\n\r\nmeasured manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the issue of broader Government\r\n\r\ncharges, the Government should make an effort not to over\r\n\r\nburden Singaporeans at this time.  I fully endorse  that.\r\n\r\nThere  is  an element of cynicism out there.  They  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  charges  go  through  a  kind   of\r\n\r\npolitical   Circadian  rhythm.   You  start   after   the\r\n\r\nelections and rates go up, and then around the middle  of\r\n\r\nthe period, it stays steady, and then towards the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  five-year  term,  there is an  inverse  performance,\r\n\r\neither rates go down, or they may not go down, but  other\r\n\r\nforms of compensation kick in.  This might be because  we\r\n\r\nhave a range of various Government bodies who are all run\r\n\r\nby  people  who are thinking ahead and trying  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the Ministers do not have a tough time.  But perhaps\r\n\r\nwe ought to take a \"more hands\" approach on this and say,\r\n\r\n\"Let's  look  at how we can actually space this  out  and\r\n\r\nmanage this as a total impact.\"  Because that is the crux\r\n\r\nof  the  issue  here  today.  The public  transport  fare\r\n\r\nincreases and the Public Transport Council, as Mr Tan put\r\n\r\nit  yesterday, have become lightning rods, but  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  the  problem.  The issue is broader and it has  just\r\n\r\nbecome  a  convenient point of reference, or  scapegoats.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think we should ensure that we do not  fall  into\r\n\r\nthat trap again by addressing this issue comprehensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest one other point that we could\r\n\r\nconsider  - whether some of the schemes which we  already\r\n\r\nhave,  like the Economic Downturn Relief Scheme and there\r\n\r\nis  a  scheme through the CCCs for those who are affected\r\n\r\nby  the  GST, perhaps we should give more flexibility  to\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots organisations on the ground, so that  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  unduly affected by these transport  fare\r\n\r\nincreases, they too should be eligible for some  form  of\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the amendment moved by\r\n\r\nthe Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  support  the hon. Member,  Dr  Tan  Boon  Wan's\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  and his call  for  the  PTC  to  be\r\n\r\ntransparent  in  its review for fare  increases,  and  to\r\n\r\nspecifically take into consideration the affordability of\r\n\r\nthe  commuters  for  the review of the  affordable  fare,\r\n\r\nwhich is one of the PTC's objectives of safeguarding  our\r\n\r\npublic  interest.   Such  an amendment  would  serve  the\r\n\r\npublic interest better, a concrete step towards a longer-term  view,  as it takes a harder look at the fundamental\r\n\r\nconsiderations of the measurement of the affordable fare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the affordable fare is indirectly\r\n\r\nmeasured using a formula that was recommended seven years\r\n\r\nago,  consisting of cost data, ie, the CPI  +  X  factor.\r\n\r\nBoth  are cost factors of the transport network operators\r\n\r\nfrom  which  the fare is computed and levied  on  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public.  Quoting Senior Minister  of  State,  Mr\r\n\r\nKhaw Boon Wan's explanation, within this framework of the\r\n\r\nformula,  the  PTC decides what is a reasonable  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease  which  is  commensurate with the  affordability\r\n\r\nlevel of the population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affordability is a relative term. The cost increase\r\n\r\nshould  be  measured  in relation  to  the  income.   The\r\n\r\npresent  formula  does not consider  the  income  of  the\r\n\r\ncommuters  directly,  especially  during  this   economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  period.   When the economy is reasonably  good,\r\n\r\none  can  argue that the annual increase in income  would\r\n\r\nhave  been taken into account relative to the  CPI.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the public service sector has always taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  CPI  to  consider  their  salary  increases\r\n\r\nyearly.  When the increases in income are higher than the\r\n\r\ncost, it would probably have taken into account that  the\r\n\r\ncommuters are able to afford the additional cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC has argued that this increase is only a very\r\n\r\nsmall  increase, and has then allowed it.  But it is  the\r\n\r\nrelative increase in cost and income that should  be  the\r\n\r\nissue.   The  lowering of the income bar and the  overall\r\n\r\nincrease  to  the  cost of transportation  result  in  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the cost to income ratio of the  commuters.\r\n\r\nBut in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npresent state of the economy, most commuters have  either\r\n\r\nno  increase in the income for the past years or suffered\r\n\r\na  pay cut, or are even out of job.  Some are even living\r\n\r\nday  by  day in fear of losing their job because  of  the\r\n\r\nclosing  down  of  the companies.  These small  increases\r\n\r\nwould have reached the threshold of pain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand the commuters' threshold of pain is to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  composition of cost in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nincome.   Although, again, Senior Minister of  State,  Mr\r\n\r\nKhaw  Boon  Wan,  has  stated that transport  fares  have\r\n\r\nlagged  behind wage growth by a big margin over a  period\r\n\r\nof  15  years, we are looking at the present scenario  in\r\n\r\nthis economic downturn where income has been lowered, the\r\n\r\ntransport  fare relative to the income would indeed  have\r\n\r\nbeen increased even with a small increase in the fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the hon. Member Mr Ravindran's call\r\n\r\nfor  the amount of transport expenses in relation to  the\r\n\r\naverage  income of the commuters to be made  known.   The\r\n\r\nthreshold  of pain of the commuters is further compounded\r\n\r\nby  the string of increases of the other economic factors\r\n\r\nadding to the cost of the commuters, ie, the increase  in\r\n\r\nrefuse  collection fees in May, the simultaneous increase\r\n\r\nin   utilities  rates  and  transport  fare,  the  coming\r\n\r\nSeptember  increases  in  carpark  charges  and   factors\r\n\r\naffecting  the  income of the commuters, eg,  the  coming\r\n\r\nreview  of  the  CPF  rates.  In addition,  the  Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring  Shares, which are to help  our  people  in\r\n\r\novercoming  the poor economic situation,  have  not  been\r\n\r\nreceived yet, as they are only scheduled for next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for the PTC to be transparent with the\r\n\r\npublic  on  the factors that are used as their  bases  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  this  affordable  fare.   Listening   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister's   reply,   none   had   explained   how    the\r\n\r\naffordability  fare was determined and the  list  of  the\r\n\r\nfactors  that  were taken into consideration.   Dr  Tan's\r\n\r\ntimely amendment has highlighted the need for the PTC  to\r\n\r\nbe transparent in the evaluation of this affordable fare,\r\n\r\nin view of the transport companies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeing  in  a  privileged position - a ready pool  of  no-choice  commuters,  free  infrastructure  costs,  minimum\r\n\r\ncompetition and good surpluses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I would like to urge the PTC to readily\r\n\r\ntake  into consideration the call of the Members in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  the  amended Motion to take into  account  the\r\n\r\naffordability  of  the  commuters  and  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation  in relation to the current economic  situation\r\n\r\nin  reviewing  the  affordable  fare.   In  view  of  the\r\n\r\ntransport   companies'   privileged   position   of    no\r\n\r\ncompetition and the no-choice situation of the commuters,\r\n\r\nwe  would  like  to  urge the PTC to make  known  and  be\r\n\r\ntransparent on the factors considered when evaluating the\r\n\r\naffordable fare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments to the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir,  thank you for allowing me to take part  in\r\n\r\nthis  debate.   I  must declare that I am  the  Executive\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Singapore Transport Workers' Union.   We\r\n\r\nhave some 12,000 workers working in the transport sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we have heard from the PAP and Opposition\r\n\r\nMPs  the sentiments and feelings of the middle and  lower\r\n\r\nincome group people in Singapore.  If we go to the market-place and coffee shops, we will find that what these  MPs\r\n\r\nsaid  in this House is true and correct.  What amazes  me\r\n\r\nis  that  our  PAP Members seem to be more energetic  and\r\n\r\nincisive than the Opposition members when they made these\r\n\r\npoints.  If we send people like Mr Tan Soo Khoon  and  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Cheng Bock to contest in the opposition wards in the\r\n\r\nnext  General  Election, I am afraid the incumbents  will\r\n\r\nnot  find  their  way back to this Chamber  at  the  next\r\n\r\nParliament.  Our PAP Members are more mature.  They  will\r\n\r\nbe able to contest and win all the single-member wards in\r\n\r\nfuture elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that price increases are never welcomed by\r\n\r\nthe  people.   As I live in a HDB flat,  I  have  a  deep\r\n\r\nunderstanding of how the people there are feeling about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  daily  matters.  As I am living among them,  I  meet\r\n\r\nthem  when  I go to work and come back from work.   These\r\n\r\nlower    income   people   are   unhappy,    and    their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction is not just confined to this round of bus\r\n\r\nfare   increase.   In  the  coffee  shops,  many   people\r\n\r\ncommented,  \"The Government allows the officials  to  set\r\n\r\nfire, but ordinary citizens are not even allowed to light\r\n\r\na lantern.\"  Increase in refuse collection fees, increase\r\n\r\nin car park charges, increase in GST, and what else do we\r\n\r\nhave?   Yet,  when  the hawkers were  to  increase  their\r\n\r\nprices,  the Government sends the Chan Soo Sen  Committee\r\n\r\nto go after their blood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look at the Singapore political situation in\r\n\r\na calm and objective manner.  We must apply our political\r\n\r\nEQ  or  emotional  quotient.  Our PAP leadership  is  not\r\n\r\nstupid.   They are aware of the feelings of  the  people.\r\n\r\nMany of our grassroots leaders are well educated.  In the\r\n\r\nwards  of  the  Ministers, many  grassroots  leaders  are\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  They  understand  what  is  going  on  at\r\n\r\ngrassroots  level.   But, we know  that  in  many  Latin-American  countries,  during the election  campaign,  the\r\n\r\npoliticians would make a lot of promises to their  people\r\n\r\nto  win  votes.  Then, after the election,  if  they  are\r\n\r\nfortunate  enough to be returned to power,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nkeep  faith with the people and to fulfil their promises,\r\n\r\nthey would hand out all sorts of goodies. In the process,\r\n\r\nthey  clear  out the nation's coffers.  When  their  term\r\n\r\nexpires, the country is bankrupt and heavily in debt.  Is\r\n\r\nthis the kind of country we want?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that every five years, the PAP must face the\r\n\r\npeople  in  a  General Election and seek a fresh  mandate\r\n\r\nfrom them.  \"Who would do things so that the people would\r\n\r\nnot  elect them in the next five years' time?\"  I  talked\r\n\r\nto the people in the coffee shops.  A lot of them are not\r\n\r\nhappy  with the Government's decision to allow  the  fare\r\n\r\nhike.  I asked them if we were to hold a General Election\r\n\r\nnow  would  the PAP win. They replied, \"Oh, the PAP  will\r\n\r\nstill  win  the elections.\"  Why?  This is  because  they\r\n\r\nknow  that the PAP Government is the only one that  ticks\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, people are not happy.

When I was young, I had to take\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Traction Company (STC) buses  to  school.\r\n\r\nThis  was  a bus company operated by the Government.   In\r\n\r\nthe  end,  the company went bust and had to  close  down.\r\n\r\nWhy should the Government run a losing business and waste\r\n\r\nour  surpluses and reserves?  We should leave it  to  the\r\n\r\nexperts  and  professionals to run it  at  a  profit  and\r\n\r\nbenefit the people - and the Government.  As such, I feel\r\n\r\nthat we should adopt a calm and balanced attitude on this\r\n\r\nissue of public transport fare increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our population is small, and the\r\n\r\nmarket  for  public  transport  is  very  limited.    Two\r\n\r\ntransport operators are facing the possibility of losses.\r\n\r\nIf we allow five or six companies to compete, can we make\r\n\r\nsure  that they will reduce fares?  Our commuter base  is\r\n\r\nsmall.  We have to maintain our buses.  If we allow  more\r\n\r\ncompanies to operate, can the companies have the  economy\r\n\r\nof  scale  to operate at a profit and remain  viable?   I\r\n\r\nhave  read in the papers that in Ang Mo Kio, Mr Wee  Siew\r\n\r\nKim  provided  buses for his constituents to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  Every week, he incurs a cost of $500.  I applaud\r\n\r\nhis  effort  and hope that he can sustain till  the  next\r\n\r\nelection in 2007.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus workers are like you and me. They would also\r\n\r\nwant to enjoy pay increases.  They are lowly educated and\r\n\r\nelderly.   They  have to support their families.   Should\r\n\r\nthey  not also enjoy bonuses and pay increases so  as  to\r\n\r\ncover  their family expenses?  Every day, they  work  for\r\n\r\nmore than 12 hours and every now and then\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  have  to face complaints from the commuters.   They\r\n\r\nhave  to  learn new skills, especially those drivers  who\r\n\r\nare  50  and  60, they have to continue to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills as public transport system goes IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to avoid fare increases? Yes, we can do that.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  average waiting period for a  bus  is  three\r\n\r\nminutes during peak hours.  In order to meet this target,\r\n\r\nwe  have to operate 20 buses on one route during the peak\r\n\r\nperiod.  If the commuters are willing to wait six minutes\r\n\r\ninstead  of  three,  we can reduce the  number  of  buses\r\n\r\noperating on the route from 20 to 10. This will translate\r\n\r\ninto  savings  in capital investment and  the  subsequent\r\n\r\ndepreciation  charges  on  10 buses.   With  two  drivers\r\n\r\ntaking  turns  to operate each bus, this will  also  mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  will reduce the cost of employing  20  drivers.\r\n\r\nThe  question is, \"Are the commuters prepared to wait for\r\n\r\n6  minutes  for  a bus during the peak periods?\"   It  is\r\n\r\nalready the case that sometimes when the buses are caught\r\n\r\nin  traffic jam and arrive one or two minutes  late,  the\r\n\r\ncommuters  would complain and even abuse  the  driver  by\r\n\r\nasking, \"Why so late!\"  And you want them to wait for six\r\n\r\nminutes instead of three?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the statutory life-span of a bus is 15\r\n\r\nyears.  Why do we not extend it to 20 years?  If we allow\r\n\r\na  bus  to operate for 20 years, then bus companies  will\r\n\r\nsave  on  depreciation, and asset replacement  cost.   If\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  feel  that we want to enjoy  a  world-class\r\n\r\ntransport system, they must be prepared to pay.   In  the\r\n\r\n60s and 70s, it was not uncommon to wait for half an hour\r\n\r\nfor  a  bus.  I had to get up before dawn to make sure  I\r\n\r\ncatch  a  bus before 6.30 am in order to reach school  on\r\n\r\ntime.  The bus stop was just a post with a plate attached\r\n\r\ndisplaying the bus number.  There is no shelter or seats.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  while I was standing at the bus stop  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the bus to arrive, it suddenly rained. I had to  run\r\n\r\nback  home to change my drenched school uniform and  come\r\n\r\nout  again  with a rain-coat or an umbrella.   The  buses\r\n\r\nwere  usually packed.  If you board the bus just a couple\r\n\r\nof stops from the depot, you would be lucky to be able to\r\n\r\nboard the bus, let alone getting a seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIf  Singaporeans are prepared to go back to the standards\r\n\r\nand conditions of public buses in the 1960s and 70s, then\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is possible for us to wait for another  3-4\r\n\r\nyears before it would be necessary to raise the bus fares\r\n\r\nagain.   We  know what Singaporeans want.   Any  fare  or\r\n\r\nprice increase is surely not welcomed.  But we have to be\r\n\r\nrealistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One constituent of mine thought he struck a bargain\r\n\r\nwhen  he bought three pairs of socks for only $1  at  the\r\n\r\npasar  malam organised by the Residents' Committee.   But\r\n\r\nthese  socks  shrank and tore when they were  washed  two\r\n\r\ndays later. He came to me and complained, \"Why you people\r\n\r\nsell  this  type  of lousy things at your  pasar  malam?\"\r\n\r\nYes,  they were cheap and affordable.  But are  they  the\r\n\r\nsort of things you want?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government says the bus can be used for 20\r\n\r\nyears  and  that  people are prepared to wait  for  10-20\r\n\r\nminutes,  as  the  Executive Secretary of  the  Transport\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union, I can assure you that in the next  three\r\n\r\nor  four  years,  there would not be any  need  for  fare\r\n\r\nincrease.   However,  there will be complaints  from  the\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituency is near to the Yishun Interchange.\r\n\r\nOne   night,   at   the  meet-the-people   session,   one\r\n\r\nconstituent told me there was a thunderstorm a  few  days\r\n\r\nago.   His  son  was drenched by the heavy downpour.   He\r\n\r\nremarked, \"How could you say that our transport system is\r\n\r\nworld-class  when  our  bus  interchange  is   so   badly\r\n\r\ndesigned?  Why can we not offer better shelter  from  the\r\n\r\nweather at the bus interchange?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the issue on the airconditioned buses or non-airconditioned buses, it is a matter of choice and\r\n\r\nopinion.   Today, there are many people who would  prefer\r\n\r\nand  do  not  mind  paying a bit more to  travel  in  the\r\n\r\ncomfort of an airconditioned bus.  They absolutely detest\r\n\r\ntravelling  in  a  non-airconditioned bus.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nexercise our political wisdom when dealing with the issue\r\n\r\non fare increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, the issue on fare increase has been\r\n\r\nbrought  up  and  debated vigorously in  Parliament.   If\r\n\r\nParliament  has  to  convene  for  every  proposed  price\r\n\r\nincrease, then our MPs will have to become full-time  MPs\r\n\r\nand  come  to  Parliament  every  day  to  discuss  these\r\n\r\nmatters, just like those in Taiwan.  I know that all  our\r\n\r\nMembers  are either professionals or successful  business\r\n\r\npeople.  It is not easy to get 84 people to become  part-time  parliamentarians.   If  we  are  going  to  get  84\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and successful entrepreneurs  to  give  up\r\n\r\ntheir  career and business to serve as full-time MPs,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  almost  impossible.  Then, are we  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept lesser people to come in here?  I do not think so.\r\n\r\nI hope that everyone of us would look at this matter in a\r\n\r\ncalm  manner.  Much as we want to please the  people,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  please  all the people all the time.   There  are\r\n\r\nbound  to  be some policies which are unpopular with  the\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, when I was talking to my residents at\r\n\r\nthe  coffee  shop,  I told them that we  should  be  more\r\n\r\nconcerned with Malaysia's intention to increase the price\r\n\r\nof water they supply to us rather than the fare increase.\r\n\r\nThey all agreed. They said, \"Yes, this is more important.\r\n\r\nParliament  should use their time to discuss how  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to fight the Malaysians.\"  However, today, we  are\r\n\r\nspending a long time talking about the three-cent to ten-cent fare hike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Ng Ser Miang, our NMP, explained the\r\n\r\nproblems  faced  by  the  bus operators.   Mr  Ng  is  an\r\n\r\nhonourable man.  I respect him, although sometimes, I had\r\n\r\nheated  arguments with him because I represent the  union\r\n\r\nand  he  was on the management side.  Under the  law,  so\r\n\r\nlong as we have enough votes, we can stage a strike.  So,\r\n\r\nI  used  to  tell him that if the management persists  in\r\n\r\ntreating  us  badly,  and  our  workers  cannot  live   a\r\n\r\ncomfortable  life, we would go on a strike.   But  do  we\r\n\r\nwant   to   see  such  a  situation  in  Singapore?    My\r\n\r\ncounterparts in Taiwan told me that even the taxi drivers\r\n\r\ncan  go  on  strike.  Every time they go on strike,  they\r\n\r\nwant  us  to  give  them  some moral  support  for  their\r\n\r\nindustrial action.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our workers cannot earn a decent living, then\r\n\r\nnobody   would  want  to  be  bus  drivers.    Currently,\r\n\r\napproximately   30%   of  our   bus   drivers   are   not\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   In  total, the  two  bus  companies  have\r\n\r\nvacancies  for at least 200 drivers.  Despite  the  grave\r\n\r\nunemployment situation in Singapore, there are  some  200\r\n\r\nvacancies for bus drivers that remain unfilled.   I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  telling people, \"If you are unemployed and want  to\r\n\r\nbecome a bus driver, just come to me. I will get you  the\r\n\r\njob.   No  need  to  write  letters.   No  need  to   get\r\n\r\nreferrals.\"  It is a big difference from the situation 10-20  years  ago.  Nowadays, nobody wants to become  a  bus\r\n\r\ndriver  because the pay is not attractive. We have  about\r\n\r\n30% non-Singaporeans driving our buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look into this matter squarely. Now, if all\r\n\r\nour people do not want to drive buses, if we have 80% bus\r\n\r\ndrivers  who  are foreigners and if they do not  maintain\r\n\r\nthe  bus properly, if the tyres are not properly secured,\r\n\r\nthe  lives  of 50-odd passengers on the bus would  be  in\r\n\r\njeopardy.  If they are not Singaporeans, why should  they\r\n\r\nwork  so hard to maintain the buses for you?  Why  should\r\n\r\nthey  be  concerned  with the lives  and  safety  of  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean commuters?  By then, you would have to  start\r\n\r\nworrying.   Who  would not want to feel secure  and  safe\r\n\r\nwhile  travelling on public transportation?  Our accident\r\n\r\nrate  is  the  lowest in the whole of Asia.   During  the\r\n\r\nseventh  month, the month of the hungry ghosts,  our  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers  would pray very hard at every bus  depot  hoping\r\n\r\nthat  there  would not be any accident.  They  work  very\r\n\r\nhard.   If we want them to have a decent living, we  have\r\n\r\nto give them decent wages.  I think that is only fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this small increase in bus fares can contribute\r\n\r\nto better standard of living for our bus drivers, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  worth  it because we want to have  a  world-class\r\n\r\ntransport  system in Singapore.  So, I  hope  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  could clearly understand the situation.   No\r\n\r\ngovernment  would like to go against the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Every government would wish to help its people,\r\n\r\nif not at least the people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  next  generation.  Of course,  the  bus  drivers\r\n\r\nnowadays  do  not  want  their  children  to  become  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers.   Our  Government has been forward-looking.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  make sure that Singaporeans have a good  future\r\n\r\nahead.   We  cannot  be so calculative and  feel  unhappy\r\n\r\nbecause of a slight fare increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the media, we can see and read about the\r\n\r\ndiscontent of our people.  Some people have written  very\r\n\r\nsincerely and earnestly in the newspapers on the issue of\r\n\r\nfare   increase.     Like   many  older   generation   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  said:  \"Although  life  is  difficult\r\n\r\nevery  day, we nevertheless manage to get by.\"  The basic\r\n\r\nproblem  is that increase in bus fares, for that  matter,\r\n\r\nany price increase, is always painful and unbearable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, we must have enough water supply\r\n\r\nto  stay  alive.  We  want  our Government  to  pool  its\r\n\r\nresources to make sure we have the water supply we  need.\r\n\r\nThis  is much more important and crucial than the  debate\r\n\r\non the 3-cent fare hike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this amended motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to speak on the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of unhappiness and unease among the\r\n\r\npopulace  on  the bus fare increase.  But,  surprisingly,\r\n\r\nwhile many may think that the grouse is about the quantum\r\n\r\nof  increase, this is not merely the case.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nDr  Wang when he said that the majority of the people are\r\n\r\nnot as upset about the 3-cent unit fare increase.  To the\r\n\r\nembattled members of the PTC, within the constraints that\r\n\r\nthey  work under, this speaks well of the diligence  that\r\n\r\nthe PTC members had put into the exercise.  I believe  we\r\n\r\nshould applaud their resolution in maintaining the  long-term view through the principle of small step increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite what the hon. Member, Mr Ong Ah\r\n\r\nHeng, said about not raising small issues in this Chamber\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  it is dirty toilets or bus services  -  we  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  must address and bring up the unease.   Let  me\r\n\r\njust categorise the unease into two key areas, which  are\r\n\r\nthat of timing and process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of timing, there are two aspects. One is\r\n\r\nthat  of  the macro, which is injecting an increase  when\r\n\r\nmost  in the economic milieu are still smarting from  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of the downturn, and have yet to taste the fruits\r\n\r\nof  any  improvements.  Yes, as all may say, this is  not\r\n\r\nthe  first  time that there has been an increase  in  bus\r\n\r\nfares.  And, yes, we would all agree that this would  not\r\n\r\nbe  the last time either.  But everyone knows the cry is,\r\n\r\nwhy do it now?  Can it not wait another half a year?  The\r\n\r\ngeneral perception is that the rush in the increase seems\r\n\r\nto  smell  of  more to come in other areas.  Hence,  more\r\n\r\nworrying is, what else is next?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second part of the timing\r\n\r\nissue, ie, that this issue comes on the heels of all  the\r\n\r\nother  announcements of escalations.   As  such,  we  are\r\n\r\noften  confronted with the question - one come, all come,\r\n\r\nhow come?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the process. There is a perceived\r\n\r\ninsensitivity  on the part of the regulators,  manifested\r\n\r\nin  the  outcry  at the lack of time for feedback  to  be\r\n\r\nproperly   obtained.   Secondly,  there  is  a  perceived\r\n\r\nopaqueness under which the decisions were arrived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all said and done, we must however realise that\r\n\r\nwe  do  have an approach that worked before. The PTC  and\r\n\r\nits  independence must be preserved.  While we look  into\r\n\r\nthe  timing and the process, let us not destroy the  very\r\n\r\nfoundation that gives us the public transportation system\r\n\r\nthat we have today, which we are extremely proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, to be constructive, rather than a review, I\r\n\r\nsupport Dr Tan's amendments which highlighted key factors\r\n\r\nthat  have to be taken into consideration.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto take this opportunity to make several suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the deliberations of the PTC should be on\r\n\r\npublic record.  In this way,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  who are interested can satisfy themselves of  the\r\n\r\nsubstance  of  the deliberations as well as  the  thought\r\n\r\nprocess.   They  are  not uncaring.  In  this  particular\r\n\r\ninstance, what appears to be hiding behind the  CPI  +  X\r\n\r\nformula  for substantiating increases just would not  do,\r\n\r\nespecially  where  for  most of  the  seven  out  of  ten\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that are affected, they do not see  any  CPI\r\n\r\nincrease  in  their incomes and their  X  could  well  be\r\n\r\nnegative.  While one can understand fully Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof State, Khaw Boon Wan's explanation, that the CPI +X is\r\n\r\na   strong   motivator  to  the  operator  to  push   for\r\n\r\nproductivity  in the face of such an escalation  ceiling,\r\n\r\nit  would  not be entirely out of place if we exact  some\r\n\r\nconcessions  this  time  round.   So,  can  we  push  the\r\n\r\nboundary?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of service quality and the attendant cost\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  based on what the bus commuting  public\r\n\r\nwant.   Whether  it  is frills or no frills,  let  it  be\r\n\r\ndetermined  empirically.  I know we have a  system  where\r\n\r\npeople  go  to bus interchanges and from there,  they  go\r\n\r\noutwards.  And my point about the Sengkang bus service is\r\n\r\nwhy  stick to that?  Why not offer point to point,  which\r\n\r\npeople  want.  Even in the airline industry, there  is  a\r\n\r\nstruggle between hub and spoke, and point to point.   You\r\n\r\nneed  not  do point to point all day round.   As  for  my\r\n\r\nmarket,  I do not have a market, offer point to point  at\r\n\r\nthe  time when people want to go to the market.  So,  you\r\n\r\ndo not run it all day round.  So, ask the commuters.  Let\r\n\r\nit  be determined empirically.  It would seem that in the\r\n\r\npresent  economic  context, the commuters  may  want  our\r\n\r\npublic   transportation  system  just  to  be   reliable.\r\n\r\nRegular  intervals, good coverage and be safe.   TVs  and\r\n\r\nairconditioning on buses and interchanges,  whoever  pays\r\n\r\nfor  it,  just would not get the thumbs up.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nhard  to accept that with airconditioning, operating cost\r\n\r\nwould  not go up.  Just compare food court versus natural\r\n\r\nair kopi tiam prices, this would show up.  Why not have a\r\n\r\nforum  where the needs can be determined.  While  it  may\r\n\r\nnot  satisfy every one all the time, at least there is  a\r\n\r\ngauge  of  what the consumers want as determined  by  the\r\n\r\ntravelling public for themselves,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  it is 8 minutes interval or 12 minutes interval.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not sweep all these under the banner of  \"rising\r\n\r\nexpectations\", because these can be managed.   I  believe\r\n\r\npeople  can accept that shorter intervals will mean  more\r\n\r\nbuses, more drivers and hence higher costs, especially in\r\n\r\ninstances  when  increased frequency does  not  stimulate\r\n\r\nhigher ridership.  Just go to Shenton Way and ask some of\r\n\r\nthe  people in the high-rise buildings during lunch-time.\r\n\r\nThey  probably wait 8-10 minutes for the lift to get from\r\n\r\nthe  top floor to the bottom floor, and to get on a lift.\r\n\r\nIs that high expectation?  Do we put in more elevators?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I re-read the public statements put up by the PTC\r\n\r\nlast  year  when there was no direct price increase.   At\r\n\r\nthat time, it too had the dilemma of balancing operators'\r\n\r\nviability  and  commuters' interest.   The  increase  was\r\n\r\nturned down.  Yet, the operators made money.  I think the\r\n\r\nargument  is not whether the operators should be  viable.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  disagreement here.  They must  be  viable.\r\n\r\nRather,  the question is whether enough has been done  to\r\n\r\neliminate  wastage  and drive productivity  in  order  to\r\n\r\nreduce  cost.  And it will go a long way if Dr Amy Khor's\r\n\r\nrequest  to see the compelling evidence of imminent  non-viability is produced.  That would silence many critics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be some means of injecting competition,\r\n\r\nthereby  subjecting the operators to  even  sharper  cost\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  And to echo Mr Ravindran's point, there must\r\n\r\nbe   in   place   alternative  means  of  assurance   and\r\n\r\nindependent verification, if market forces are not  fully\r\n\r\nin play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the call is for more transparency in the\r\n\r\nprocess  and better communications.  In addition, service\r\n\r\nlevels  should  be  based on some  market-based  consumer\r\n\r\nderived  benchmarks, and let them decide for  themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd  further, for more competition that would  blunt  the\r\n\r\ninexorable  increase in cost.  We need  to  tackle  these\r\n\r\nissues  as enhancement but, in the meantime, we  must  be\r\n\r\nreminded that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  have a world-class public transportation system  that\r\n\r\nwe  all  ought to be proud of.  Let us work  together  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  pillars and the foundations on  which  they\r\n\r\nhang  on,  rather than undermine the very basis  for  the\r\n\r\nPTC's authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments to the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the amendments proposed by  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Dr Tan Boon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that after yesterday's animated\r\n\r\ndebate  that we saw in the House, it is not going  to  be\r\n\r\neasy  to up the tempo but, nevertheless, Dr Tan Boon  Wan\r\n\r\nhas risen to give a reasonable and realistic touch to the\r\n\r\noriginal  Motion.  I would like to give my  take  on  the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  and overall  issue  of  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport fare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the proposed amendments, he has rightly\r\n\r\ntaken  into  consideration  PM  Goh's  support  for   the\r\n\r\nprinciple of PTC granting small increases.  Similarly, he\r\n\r\nhas  put into context the concerns of the people  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  environment of uncertainty and economic slowdown\r\n\r\nby urging the Government to ensure public services remain\r\n\r\naffordable.  These amendments are laudable and I think it\r\n\r\nshould be supported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard over and over again\r\n\r\nin   this   House  about  the  difficulties  facing   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at this moment.  The depth of the impact  of\r\n\r\neconomic  recession  on  the lives  of  our  citizens  is\r\n\r\nfurther emphasised by the recent announcement of more job\r\n\r\nlosses   and  increases  in  the  request  for  financial\r\n\r\nassistance.   Sir,  we  cannot, and  should  not,  under-estimate the effect of the slowdown in the global economy\r\n\r\non  their livelihood.  Many of my constituents that I met\r\n\r\nduring  grassroots functions and block  visits  expressed\r\n\r\nthe  concerns  and  worry.  With the perceived  spate  of\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the charges for basic services,  they  are\r\n\r\njust waiting for the last straw that would break\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  camel's  back.   They are  at  a  loss  of  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening.   They  view the recent increase  in  the  bus\r\n\r\nfares  as  contradictory to the overall effort  to  lower\r\n\r\ncost and tighten their belts during these hard times.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  many Members have already  expressed  this\r\n\r\neloquently,  and  I  am  just  echoing  their  sentiments\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, we also have to admit that\r\n\r\nthe job of the PTC is not an easy one.  They have to find\r\n\r\na balance between the public interest without undermining\r\n\r\nthe  viability of the transport provider.  The  framework\r\n\r\nof  regulations that we have in place has worked well for\r\n\r\nus.  But in our usual continuous quest to improve and  to\r\n\r\ndo   things   better,  I  think  we  should   widen   the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  in the PTC to include members  from  the\r\n\r\nunions, political leaders, grassroots leaders, and dare I\r\n\r\nsuggest,  student leaders too.  Let us be fair  and  give\r\n\r\ncredit  where it is due.  Several Members openly admitted\r\n\r\nthat the PTC has done reasonably well.  We all understood\r\n\r\nthat  PTC  has  been  given the  responsibility  and  the\r\n\r\nunenviable  task to do, we should have the confidence  on\r\n\r\nthe  members and not undermine their role and  integrity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we  should  not  judge  them  on  a  single\r\n\r\nunpopular decision, but rather look at their track record\r\n\r\nover  the period of their existence.  Let us improve  the\r\n\r\nprocesses  and make it more transparent, but not  destroy\r\n\r\nPTC's position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me tell you an experience that\r\n\r\nmarked me for a long time.  This happened in 1986 when  I\r\n\r\nwas  studying  in Paris, France.  It was my first  winter\r\n\r\nand  it was very, very cold.  I was taking my usual train\r\n\r\nride  back  to my hostel.  I was about 3 kilometres  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  destination  when the  train  stopped  at  the\r\n\r\nstation.   I  noticed that it was longer than usual,  but\r\n\r\nthought  nothing of it.  To my surprise and shock,  after\r\n\r\nabout  ten  minutes, there was an announcement that  said\r\n\r\nthat  the train was not going to move because the  driver\r\n\r\nhad  gone on an abrupt strike.  Little did I realise that\r\n\r\nI  was  given  a shock introduction to a common  thing  - things that happen in Paris, ie, public transport strike.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I had to walk back to my hostel.  Let us\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  things  for granted.  We do have a  good  transport\r\n\r\nsystem.   It  may not be the best, but it  works,  albeit\r\n\r\nwith some minor hiccups now and then.  But it works.   It\r\n\r\nis  the envy of many people around the world.  Does  this\r\n\r\nhappen  by  chance?   No.  Apart from the  infrastructure\r\n\r\nthat  we  have,  there are thousands of public  transport\r\n\r\nworkers  that  run  it  and make it  all  happen  for  us\r\n\r\neveryday.  Like Mdm Halimah, I would also like  to  thank\r\n\r\nthem  for  their effort and good work.  Let me also  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity, Sir, to remind the transport providers\r\n\r\nthat  they  have to continue to improve and not  let  the\r\n\r\ncommuters down.  This fare increase, though small it  may\r\n\r\nbe,  is  done  during difficult times.   Thus,  transport\r\n\r\nproviders  must, in good faith, provide  their  best  and\r\n\r\nreward  their  loyal commuters by some  other  innovative\r\n\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, let me reiterate my support to the\r\n\r\namendments to the Motion proposed by Dr Tan Boon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to join in the debate.  Today,\r\n\r\nI am going to tell a story about a song I heard in my car\r\n\r\na  few nights ago.  In fact, this is a song, not a story.\r\n\r\nA  lady  had  made a request for an old song entitled  \"A\r\n\r\nCouple's  Duet\" to be broadcast over the radio programme.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty old song, one that was recorded some 50-60  years  ago.  The song started with the wife  singing,\r\n\r\n\"Prices going up day by day, trouble and worries  for  us\r\n\r\nwho have to pay and pay.\"  She then went on to lament  on\r\n\r\nhow  the  prices  of everything had been  going  up,  how\r\n\r\ndifficult  it  was  for her to run  the  household.   She\r\n\r\ncomplained  that her husband was useless  and  unable  to\r\n\r\nearn  enough  money to support her and the  family.   The\r\n\r\nhusband then replied that he had his grievances too.   He\r\n\r\nsaid the market was bad, his job was insecure and he  had\r\n\r\nto  bear with the whims and fancies of his employer.   No\r\n\r\npay rise, and his job could be lost anytime!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very old song, some 50\r\n\r\nyears  old,  and  it was about the chaotic  situation  in\r\n\r\nChina at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  really do not know whether this lady had requested for\r\n\r\nthis  song  that night by coincidence or by  design.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Singapore's  economy  is  in  a  recession   and\r\n\r\nunemployment rate is rising.  But it is still not as  bad\r\n\r\nas  it was in China during those chaotic days.  Yet,  the\r\n\r\nlyrics  of this song seem to reflect some of the  worries\r\n\r\nof our people today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard speeches by many of our Members in the\r\n\r\nlast   two  days.   They  are  actually  reflecting   the\r\n\r\nsentiments of the people and this is something  that  we,\r\n\r\nas Members of Parliament, ought to do.  Some Members have\r\n\r\nraised  some  suggestions.  Here, I would thank  Minister\r\n\r\nMah  and  SMS Khaw for their clarifications.   They  have\r\n\r\nclarified some of the misunderstandings of our people and\r\n\r\nto  let  the people realise that the Government  actually\r\n\r\ncares  for  them.  And these policies are farsighted  and\r\n\r\nthe  intention  is good.  Mr Ong Ah Heng  has  also  very\r\n\r\neloquently and emotionally analysed the various  acts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government which were done with the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople  at  heart.   But why is it that  this  issue  has\r\n\r\naroused such a vigorous reaction by the people?  I  think\r\n\r\nit   is   because  we  have  not  done  enough   in   our\r\n\r\ncommunication  with  our people, and  we  have  not  been\r\n\r\nthorough  enough  in explaining to our people.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Arthur Fong had mentioned just now.  In order  to\r\n\r\nimprove communication with our people, I think we have to\r\n\r\nlook  into  various  matters.  Let  me  give  Members  an\r\n\r\nanalysis in my capacity as a psychiatrist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually if we want to treat our patient\r\n\r\neffectively, there are three steps to follow.  First,  we\r\n\r\nmust   build   up  a  good  doctor-patient  relationship.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  we have to understand his problems by  talking\r\n\r\nto  him  and listening to him. Thirdly, we must  set  the\r\n\r\ntreatment  target  and then give specific,  feasible  and\r\n\r\nwell-paced treatment to the patient.  How do we build  up\r\n\r\nthe  relationship  between the doctor  and  the  patient?\r\n\r\nThere  are  three important elements.  First, the  doctor\r\n\r\nmust  accept  the patient.  Second, he must  support  the\r\n\r\npatient  and, thirdly, the doctor must assure the patient\r\n\r\nand build up his faith\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  doctor.  For example, many of my patients suffer\r\n\r\nfrom  anxiety disorder.  They have a lot of  worries  and\r\n\r\nbodily  symptoms.  They say, \"Oh, I am going  to  have  a\r\n\r\nheart  attack  now.\"  \"I have breathing  difficulties,  I\r\n\r\ncannot breathe,\" etc.  More often than not, I would  find\r\n\r\nnothing physiologically wrong with them. I know it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  psychology. In fact, there is  nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith them.   They just worry themselves sick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, these patients are somewhat like the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore nowadays.   They all understand  the\r\n\r\nreason for this round of fare hike.  To the people,  this\r\n\r\n3-cent or 5-cent increase is a potential worry.  This  is\r\n\r\na  signal  of  something more serious to come.   We  must\r\n\r\nlearn  to  accept their concerns, give them the necessary\r\n\r\nsupport  and  reassurance, and then  gradually  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir confidence.  Only then can we change their mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to listen to their problems and\r\n\r\nunderstand  their concerns, just like a  doctor  who  has\r\n\r\nfirst to understand the problems of his patient before he\r\n\r\nwould make a diagnosis.  So, similarly, in this issue, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  understand what are the things that the  people\r\n\r\nare most concerned with.  Their concern is not just the 3\r\n\r\ncents or 5 cents.  I disagree with Mr Ong Ah Heng when he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  this  was a small matter. This  is  not  just\r\n\r\ntrivial  as  they may appear to be. In the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, there is this anxiety that an avalanche of  price\r\n\r\nincreases is forthcoming. On the one hand, the Government\r\n\r\nis  asking them to exercise wage restraint; yet,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, there is a whole series of price  increases.\r\n\r\nThey  feel  that  the burden is getting very  heavy,  too\r\n\r\nheavy for them to bear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must set up our treatment plan. This\r\n\r\nplan must be specific and feasible, and it must be a long-term plan to treat the disease. While we are dealing with\r\n\r\nthis  issue of fare adjustment, we want to see an all-win\r\n\r\nsituation  - a situation where everyone is a winner.   We\r\n\r\nhave to consider the interest of the people, the interest\r\n\r\nof the companies and the interest of the Government.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople's  interest is that as mentioned  by  many  of  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleagues who spoke before  me,   quality\r\n\r\nservice  at  reasonable prices.  I shall not repeat  this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the companies' interests. Of course, the\r\n\r\ncompanies  want  to make profits.  We cannot  deny  that.\r\n\r\nThey   must  make  profits,  failing  which  they  cannot\r\n\r\nsurvive.  The  only thing is that they  must  make  their\r\n\r\nprofits in a reasonable manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government's interest. That is our\r\n\r\nlong-term  target.   We  want to  set  up  a  world-class\r\n\r\ntransport system.  This is a long-term plan which must be\r\n\r\na  major premise in our consideration.  At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe    should   also   maintain   the   independence   and\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of the PTC, so that this element of check\r\n\r\nand  balance  in  the operation of our  public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem will not be eroded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree with the amended\r\n\r\nmotion  by  Dr Tan Boon Wan requesting that  PTC  take  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive,  overall  view of the  situation  whenever\r\n\r\nthey  consider  any application for fare increase.   Now,\r\n\r\nwhat  the people want to know is whether or not  the  PTC\r\n\r\nhas   considered  the  present  economic   downturn   and\r\n\r\nunemployment  situation in Singapore. They want  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  PTC has thoroughly examined the operation of the\r\n\r\ntwo  companies, and whether they have made every  attempt\r\n\r\nto improve productivity rather than pushing the burden to\r\n\r\nthe commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, this round of fare increase, they\r\n\r\nhave given labour cost as a factor for the increase.  The\r\n\r\npublic is not yet convinced of this.  My colleagues  have\r\n\r\nalready  spoken on this.  I am not going  to  repeat  it.\r\n\r\nOver  the last 10 years or so, the PTC has done very much\r\n\r\nand,  I  am  sure, they must have given this matter  very\r\n\r\nfull deliberation before they made this decision.  Why is\r\n\r\nit  that  people  still have so much  worries  about  its\r\n\r\ndecision?   I  feel that on this occasion,  when  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  this  issue, perhaps the PTC has not perfected  its\r\n\r\ncommunication skills with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  people.  I think if there is more consultation  with\r\n\r\nthe interested parties and with more thorough studies and\r\n\r\nbetter communication, I am sure we will not hear so  much\r\n\r\nvoices of discontent among the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Ministry of Transport consider\r\n\r\nimproving  the way in which PTC operates and the  way  it\r\n\r\ncommunicates  with the people, so that  people  can  see,\r\n\r\nhear  and  feel  that  the PTC is also  protecting  their\r\n\r\ninterests.  In addition, I also suggest that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Transport  consider  appointing  some  bus  or   MRT\r\n\r\ncommuters  to  the  PTC  to  enhance  the  scope  of  its\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  This will increase  the  voices  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in PTC.  At the same time, whenever they make  any\r\n\r\nmajor   policy  decision,  they  should  adopt   a   more\r\n\r\nconsultative  approach  to  collect  feedback  from   the\r\n\r\npeople, so that they can increase its transparency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spoken on the communication part of PTC, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  talk  about the competitiveness  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport  market.   In  our  process  to  remake\r\n\r\nSingapore, we keep hearing this expression of \"leaving no\r\n\r\nstone  unturned\".   So  in our public  transport  system,\r\n\r\nshould  we also take this opportunity to turn the stones?\r\n\r\nThe  present  method  of operation  of  public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem has been used in Singapore for many years.  It has\r\n\r\nraised  the  standard  of  our  public  transport  to  an\r\n\r\nenviable  situation.   We  have a  world-class  transport\r\n\r\nsystem  now.  But now these two companies are each having\r\n\r\na  comfortable share of the pie.  There is no competition\r\n\r\nbetween  them.   How  are  we  going  to  improve   their\r\n\r\nproductivity?   I, therefore, suggest that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Transport should give consideration to open up  this\r\n\r\nmarket  so  as  to  improve the  competitiveness  of  the\r\n\r\noperators.   I hope that the Minister will not  give  the\r\n\r\nusual routine answer to this question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the methods proposed in the past are not\r\n\r\nfeasible,  it does not mean that there is no solution  to\r\n\r\nit.   I  think if there is a will, there is  a  way.   We\r\n\r\nshould jump out of the old framework and think out of the\r\n\r\nbox, and be more creative in the way we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noperate  our public transport.  There are so many talents\r\n\r\nin the Ministry of Transport.  If we add this up with the\r\n\r\nfeedback from the people, I am sure we could come up with\r\n\r\na  solution to effectively open up this market.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is very relevant to our situation, particularly  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  embraces a free  market  economy.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the opening up of the communications market  has\r\n\r\nled  to  a greater variety of services being provided  by\r\n\r\nthe operators and a higher quality of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is worried that by opening up the\r\n\r\npublic  transport market, we will revert to  the  chaotic\r\n\r\nsituation some 30 years ago, I do not think this would be\r\n\r\nthe  case.   The environment nowadays is quite different.\r\n\r\nThe  quality  and expectations of the people  are  higher\r\n\r\nnow.  I am sure that the Ministry of Transport is able to\r\n\r\nproperly  plan and arrange in such a way that the  market\r\n\r\ncan  be  opened up smoothly and successfully.  I am  sure\r\n\r\nthere  will be more pros than cons in the opening  up  of\r\n\r\nthe  public transport market.  This will generate a check\r\n\r\nand balance over the operational cost of the players.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  it will also cause the companies  to  be  more\r\n\r\nsensitive towards the feelings of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I started my speech with the lyrics of a song,\r\n\r\nI  would also end with the ending line of this song.   It\r\n\r\nsays, \"With the cold winter coming to an end, there  will\r\n\r\ncome  a gorgeous spring.\"  So long as the people and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  willing to put  in  a  concerted  effort\r\n\r\ntogether,  I  am  sure we will have  a  better  and  more\r\n\r\nbeautiful spring ahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amended motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

What was  found\r\n\r\nmost  unpalatable  was  the  manner  in  which  the  fare\r\n\r\nadjustment was decided upon and its timing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Public Transport Council (PTC) rejected\r\n\r\nthe  applications  for  an across-the-board  increase  in\r\n\r\nfares  last  year,  it  has approved  some  of  the  fare\r\n\r\nadjustments proposed by the operators this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare increases of between three cents and 10 cents\r\n\r\nwould  bring the operators extra revenue of 2.2% to 2.5%.\r\n\r\nThis figure is lower than what the PTC formula would have\r\n\r\nallowed  for.  Annual fare revisions are subjected  to  a\r\n\r\ncap  based on the formula of change in the Consumer Price\r\n\r\nIndex  (CPI)  + X.  The X has been set at 1.5%  for  five\r\n\r\nyears  from 2001 to 2005.  If fares had been raised every\r\n\r\nyear,  based on the formula, the quantum of fare  revenue\r\n\r\nincrease would be approximately 13%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC has exercised its role well in the past and\r\n\r\nmust  be  complimented for that.  These fare adjustments,\r\n\r\nimplemented recently, will help to defray what  operators\r\n\r\nsaid were higher running costs, including manpower costs.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, there will be costs involved in providing\r\n\r\nand  maintaining an efficient transport  system  and  fee\r\n\r\nadjustments may be inevitable, as so humorously explained\r\n\r\nand   illustrated  by  my  colleague,  Mr  Ong  Ah  Heng.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  may  be  time for us to  re-evaluate  PTC's\r\n\r\nformula  for  approving fare hikes, as  proposed  in  the\r\n\r\namendment to consider factors like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nviability of public transport operators and affordability\r\n\r\nof commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to analysts' estimates, the increased fare\r\n\r\nrevenue  for  the operators could add up to $11  million.\r\n\r\nEven  without  the  fare hike, the  companies  are  still\r\n\r\nmaking  profits.  Last year, the SMRT made  a  profit  of\r\n\r\n$56.8 million and, this year, the company is expected  to\r\n\r\nring in higher profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A profit is still a profit, regardless of the\r\n\r\nmargin.   Operators may not enjoy healthier  bottom  line\r\n\r\nwithout   the  hike,  but  under  the  current   economic\r\n\r\nconditions,  companies  who manage  to  turn  in  profits\r\n\r\nshould  count  themselves  very  fortunate  indeed.   The\r\n\r\ncriterion for fare adjustment is too narrowly focused  on\r\n\r\nthe  bottom  line of operators; other pertinent  factors,\r\n\r\nlike  prevailing  economic conditions  and  unemployment,\r\n\r\nshould be given more weight in this equation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, PTC is better advised to put in place\r\n\r\nmechanisms  for  soliciting  public  views  and  feedback\r\n\r\nbefore  implementing any fare adjustments in the  future.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  being forced to make frequent clarifications\r\n\r\nand  justifications after the fact, they could  introduce\r\n\r\nthe  public  earlier  into  the decision-making  process.\r\n\r\nThis  would  also  give commuters  ample  notice  of  the\r\n\r\nimpending change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of the fare adjustments raises some\r\n\r\nconcerns  as  well.   In the face of  unemployment,  high\r\n\r\nretrenchment  rate and a slow economy, the  timing  could\r\n\r\nnot  be  more ill planned.  Lower-income households  have\r\n\r\nseen  their disposable income shrinking on the one  hand,\r\n\r\nand the cost of living increasing on the other.  A double\r\n\r\n\"whammy\"  you could say.  The hike is coming  six  months\r\n\r\nbefore  the  GST increase by 2-percentage point,  another\r\n\r\nburden  for  the lower income.  The quick  succession  of\r\n\r\ncost  increments  is  overwhelming for  the  lower-income\r\n\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pockets of the poor, especially the retrenched,\r\n\r\nwill  be  hit  hard by these incremental  increases.   To\r\n\r\nsome, these amounts are trivial; to many others, they add\r\n\r\nup.  Nonetheless, the full impact\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not  be blamed on the transport hike alone.   The\r\n\r\ntiming of the hike reinforces the public perception  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is upping cost of basic items now, before\r\n\r\nthe new GST is due.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some believe that PTC should only decide on fare\r\n\r\nchanges after the ez-link card system completely replaces\r\n\r\nthe  magnetic fare card.  By then, it would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nascertain if the new and fairer system, where cheating is\r\n\r\neliminated,  has any real impact on the  bottom  line  of\r\n\r\noperators.   The fare hike would be an easier sell to the\r\n\r\ncommuting  public then.  After all, they are  the  paying\r\n\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these comments carry the sentiments from the\r\n\r\nground.   The ordinary folks whose means of commuting  is\r\n\r\nby public transportation will face the brunt of the hike.\r\n\r\nAs  Advisers  to  the  GROs and  MPs  of  our  respective\r\n\r\ncommunities, we will explain the rationale for the  hike,\r\n\r\nbut  we  must also be able to represent the views of  the\r\n\r\nordinary folks on policies impacting their finances  with\r\n\r\na  view  to  influence  and shape improvement  in  future\r\n\r\npolicy making.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilemma that this House is faced with today on\r\n\r\nthe   transportation  hike,  provides  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nunavoidable lessons of having to deal with disapproval of\r\n\r\nothers  and,  in this instance, whether  we  are  for  or\r\n\r\nagainst the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That praise and blame are all the same; it reminds\r\n\r\nus of an old cliche, that we will never be able to please\r\n\r\nall  the  people  all  the time.   Even  in  a  landslide\r\n\r\nelection  victory in which a candidate wins  70%  of  the\r\n\r\nvote,  he or she is left with 30% of the population  that\r\n\r\nwishes  someone else were the winner.  Indeed a  humbling\r\n\r\ntruth!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth shows up all the warts and wrinkles on our\r\n\r\nface.  How do we respond?  Pretend we do not see them, or\r\n\r\naccept  them,  and still stand head and  shoulders  above\r\n\r\nothers.  Sir, the truth is that everyone has his own  set\r\n\r\nof  ideas  with  which to evaluate a situation,  and  our\r\n\r\nideas  do  not  always match those of others.   For  some\r\n\r\nreason, most of us struggle against this inevitable fact.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nget  angry,  hurt, or otherwise frustrated,  when  people\r\n\r\nreject  our ideas, tell us no or give us other  forms  of\r\n\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I find myself yo-yo-ing between praise\r\n\r\nand  blame.  One of my children is happy with my  action,\r\n\r\nthe other struggles against it.  Someone says I am a nice\r\n\r\nMP   because   I   understand  business   and   strategic\r\n\r\nconsiderations in this fare hike incident.  Someone  else\r\n\r\nthinks  I  am  not, because I have not been effective  in\r\n\r\nreversing  the hike.  This back and forth,  approval  and\r\n\r\ndisapproval,  happens all the time.  In truth,  we  would\r\n\r\nalways  prefer  approval over disapproval because  it  is\r\n\r\neasier to deal with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here as responsible Members of\r\n\r\nParliament?   How  do we deal with the challenge  of  the\r\n\r\nunhappy  lot?   We have to find a balanced  approach  and\r\n\r\ntake  a  longer  term  perspective  towards  resolving  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue  that understandably  embraces  a  bigger\r\n\r\nagenda.   Sounds  like  a  pie in  the  sky  because,  in\r\n\r\nreality, we have to face the daily grumblings and woes of\r\n\r\nthose  affected who will unceasingly question the  timing\r\n\r\nof  such  an action and the high handed approach  of  the\r\n\r\nPTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said, I am encouraged by the amended Motion that\r\n\r\nwill,  at  least, demonstrate to the ordinary folks  that\r\n\r\nParliament is a responsible and caring one, and will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to temper pains with necessary actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Motion will signify to the public that,\r\n\r\nindeed,  Parliament is not hearing impaired.   That  much\r\n\r\nmore  credibility this amended Motion would give  to  the\r\n\r\nMPs  in  the  eyes  of the ordinary  folks.   Instead  of\r\n\r\nwalking  out  of this House with drooping  shoulders  and\r\n\r\nhanging down heads after two days of intense debate,  the\r\n\r\nMPs  would  be able to walk out of this House with  their\r\n\r\nshoulders  thrown  backwards  and  heads  held  high  and\r\n\r\nstraight.   I  would urge that the PTC take heed  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment for a more relevant set of criteria to\r\n\r\nbe  put  in  place.  The MPs and the Government,  on  our\r\n\r\npart, will take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  role  of clarifying and explaining to the ground  to\r\n\r\nget their buy-in through better communication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the amendments to the\r\n\r\nMotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on\r\n\r\nthe transport fare revision.  Many Members have spoken on\r\n\r\nthe  original  Motion and the amendment  as  well.   They\r\n\r\nspoke  with  deep  feelings, reflecting  the  unhappiness\r\n\r\namongst  many Singaporeans over the recent fare revision.\r\n\r\nI  fully  understand  and empathise with  the  sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  the Members and by the general  public  as\r\n\r\nwell.   Like  the other Members here, I too had  to  face\r\n\r\nunhappy constituents and community leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good to have the chance to thoroughly\r\n\r\ndiscuss  this  issue in the House.  For  Members  to  not\r\n\r\nvoice  the sentiments of the ground, especially when  the\r\n\r\nunhappiness appears to be so widespread, would  undermine\r\n\r\nour  credibility as representatives of the  people.   The\r\n\r\nMembers have raised many valid points and questions.  But\r\n\r\nthere  were also many misconceptions.  Some MPs, like  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Ah  Heng and Mr Iswaran, have eloquently  helped  to\r\n\r\nenlighten the House, and I commend them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to present some of the\r\n\r\npertinent  facts and further clarify the various  issues.\r\n\r\nBy having the full facts and picture, we can then discuss\r\n\r\nthe  public transport policies in a rational and  logical\r\n\r\nmanner and arrive at the right conclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I got the Motion, I thought I had better\r\n\r\nprepare myself and asked PTC for the full details on  how\r\n\r\nthey  came  to  the  decision.  I shall  start  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion  on  the  need  for the fare  revision.   Is  it\r\n\r\njustified, and why now, and not six months' time, or even\r\n\r\na year later, as some MPs have suggested?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first inform Members that what I have\r\n\r\nascertained  is  that  PTC does  closely  scrutinise  the\r\n\r\nfinancial performance and the increase in operating costs\r\n\r\nof  the public transport operators in the preceding year,\r\n\r\nwhen considering the fare increases for the current year.\r\n\r\nThey  also  do take into consideration the state  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  how  is it impacting on the people,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  commuters  who form the lower level  of  the  social\r\n\r\neconomic  group,  and  they try to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of both are safeguarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By looking at the actual facts, the PTC is then able\r\n\r\nto  make  a  decision  based on the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  year,  and not on projections for  the  current\r\n\r\nyear.  Because, if the PTC were to base the fare increase\r\n\r\nfor this year on what the public transport operators have\r\n\r\nprojected  as the increase in cost for this  year,  their\r\n\r\nfigures  will be very hard to answer for or justify.   So\r\n\r\nPTC has taken the right approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us scrutinise the cost increase of the previous\r\n\r\nyear  in  order to consider whether or not  to  allow  an\r\n\r\nincrease  this year.  Sir, the PTC found that,  in  2001,\r\n\r\nthe  operating  costs of the operators had  increased  by\r\n\r\n6.9%  on  average.  The recent fare revision, as  Members\r\n\r\nknow, will increase the revenues of the bus companies  by\r\n\r\n2.3%.   The  revision  will,  therefore,  only  partially\r\n\r\noffset the increase in operating costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also inform Members that costs had also gone\r\n\r\nup  significantly in year 2000 by 8.5%.  But  because  we\r\n\r\nwere in recession last year, PTC decided not to allow  an\r\n\r\nacross-the-board  increase  to  cater  for   that   large\r\n\r\nincrease  in costs.  It only allowed feeder bus  services\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  feeder fares by 10  cents.   And  this\r\n\r\nresulted  in  a  general  increase  of  1%  in  the   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies' revenues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this means that over the past two years,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  economic downturn, costs for the  transport\r\n\r\noperators had gone up by over 15%.  But with this  year's\r\n\r\nincrease  of 2.3%, total fares for the two years together\r\n\r\nwould  have gone up a total of only 3.3%.  The  PTC  has,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  looked after the interests of  the  commuters\r\n\r\nvery well by not allowing the PTOs to pass through to the\r\n\r\ncommuters much of the impact of the cost increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wage Costs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have asked - surely wage costs would\r\n\r\nhave gone down?  Based on the figures I have quoted, what\r\n\r\nhas  led  to  the  increase in the costs?   The  PTC  has\r\n\r\nexplained  that the main cost factors were, indeed,  wage\r\n\r\ncosts and service improvements.  Public transport is very\r\n\r\nlabour  intensive, with manpower costs  making  up  about\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the PTOs' total operating costs.  In  the  year\r\n\r\n2000, average wage costs for transport workers went up by\r\n\r\n8.3%,  partly because of the 2% CPF restoration.  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nSoo  Khoon  had  asked  whether the PTOs  exercised  wage\r\n\r\nrestraint last year, just like SIA.  I am very  happy  to\r\n\r\ninform   the   House  that,  last  year,  the   transport\r\n\r\ncompanies,  workers  and executives did  indeed  exercise\r\n\r\nwage restraint. As a result, wages last year went down by\r\n\r\n3.4%.    But   because   of  the  4%   CPF   contribution\r\n\r\nrestoration, this pushed the wage costs up  by  0.6%  for\r\n\r\nthe  bus  companies.  That meant that over  the  two-year\r\n\r\nperiod,  wage costs for the PTOs went up about 9%.   This\r\n\r\nis despite the downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members may be surprised by this. Let me\r\n\r\nnow  quote  to Members the figures from the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower.   MOM's  data  shows  that  wage  increases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  averaged  6.6% in 2000, and  1.1%  last  year.\r\n\r\nTotal  increase for the two years was 7.7%.   And  if  we\r\n\r\ninclude  the  6%  CPF restoration, total  wages  for  the\r\n\r\nemployers  would have gone up by about 13.7%.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  PTOs, transport workers and executives have actually\r\n\r\nexercised wage restraint by holding the increase in  wage\r\n\r\ncosts to only 9%, well below the national average.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard from Mr Ong Ah Heng. We have\r\n\r\nalso  heard from Mr Ng Ser Miang.  But I think Mr Ong  Ah\r\n\r\nHeng's  views  should  be well listened  to,  because  he\r\n\r\nrepresents the workers and he knows what life is like for\r\n\r\nthem.   We  must be fair to the transport workers.   They\r\n\r\nhave  taken  a  wage restraint last year, but  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  deprive  them of  what  other  workers  are\r\n\r\nenjoying.  Otherwise, good workers will not want to  work\r\n\r\nfor  the  transport companies and, in the end,  commuters\r\n\r\nwill be worse off.  And, as we have heard from Mr Ong  Ah\r\n\r\nHeng  and Mr Ng Ser Miang, the bus companies already have\r\n\r\nhuge difficulties recruiting bus drivers.  Today, even in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of the recovery, when we hear many people  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for jobs, there are still 200 bus driver's  jobs\r\n\r\ngoing a-begging.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Service Improvements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another key component of the cost increase is\r\n\r\nservice  improvements.  The key service improvements  are\r\n\r\nthose  that are made to meet requests from commuters  for\r\n\r\nmore frequent services, and new bus services to serve new\r\n\r\nHDB  towns.  Unfortunately, service improvements  do  not\r\n\r\ncome cheap.  As a guide, it costs the operators $500  per\r\n\r\nday  to  run  an  additional bus,  and  this  amounts  to\r\n\r\n$200,000  a year.  So, each time we ask for the frequency\r\n\r\nto be increased, to add in more buses, each bus will cost\r\n\r\nthe  company  $200,000 a year.  If  that  additional  bus\r\n\r\nleads  to  a  higher ridership, that is all right.   But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it is usually the same pool of people  who\r\n\r\ntake that service.  So, the additional frequency may  not\r\n\r\nlead to a comparable increase in revenue.  What about the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a new bus service?  Sir, the PTC tells me\r\n\r\nthat  it  costs $3.5 million a year for the bus companies\r\n\r\nto introduce a new service.  Over the last two years, the\r\n\r\nPTOs had a net increase of seven new services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Productivity Improvements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members have also pointed out that the\r\n\r\nPTOs should try to improve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproductivity  rather than rely on fare revisions.   After\r\n\r\nall,  that  is the common thing that every company  does.\r\n\r\nWhen it is faced with a downturn, it will look for better\r\n\r\nways  to  improve productivity.  As Minister Mah and  SMS\r\n\r\nKhaw  had explained, we do expect the PTOs to do more  to\r\n\r\nimprove productivity, but we must also be realistic.  The\r\n\r\neasy  improvements have all been made: one-man  operation\r\n\r\nin  the earlier years; next, the bus companies went on to\r\n\r\nlarger  capacity  buses.   That  helped  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the bus drivers.  But there is a limit to\r\n\r\nhow  much  bigger the buses can go.  We have got  double-decker; we cannot go triple-decker.  So, there is a limit\r\n\r\nnow  to the easy increases in productivity.  And the  bus\r\n\r\nhas  only  one  driver.  We cannot cut it down  to  half.\r\n\r\nMaybe  one of these days, in the far future, we may  have\r\n\r\ndriverless  buses,  just like we have driverless  trains.\r\n\r\nBut that day is going to be very far in the future for us\r\n\r\nto  even think about.  So productivity is going to  be  a\r\n\r\ndifficult challenge, but we will nonetheless push the bus\r\n\r\ncompanies to strive for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Profitability</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another hot topic inside and outside the House,\r\n\r\nin  fact, a very hot topic, is the profitability  of  the\r\n\r\noperators.  Mr Iswaran had given us a good lecture, and I\r\n\r\nhope  Members have heard clearly what he had said.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthe  operators  are  profitable.  Yes,  they  are  making\r\n\r\nmillions  of dollars.  Should the simple conclusion  then\r\n\r\nbe  that  since  they are making plenty  of  money,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  be allowed to increase fares?  Some  Members\r\n\r\neven go further, and argue that the PTOs are providing  a\r\n\r\npublic service and, therefore, they should not be profit-making.   The  question  we  need  to  ask  is:  are  the\r\n\r\ncompanies indeed profiteering?  Are the profits excessive\r\n\r\nor are they reasonable?  And should we squeeze them until\r\n\r\nthey  are  losing  money and are on the  verge  of  being\r\n\r\ncommercially not viable before we allow them an increase?\r\n\r\nHow  would  this  enable them to provide  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nlevel  of service to the commuters?  How would this serve\r\n\r\nthe long-term interests of the commuters?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me again give Members some facts. Members\r\n\r\nwill recall that the operating costs of the PTOs went  up\r\n\r\nby  6.9%  in  2001, while fares only went up by  1%  last\r\n\r\nyear.   Consequently, the profit margins of the operators\r\n\r\ndropped  significantly last year.  The after tax  profits\r\n\r\nof  SBS Transit dropped from $51 million in 2000, to  $40\r\n\r\nmillion  in 2001.  TIBS fared badly, dropping  from  $8.4\r\n\r\nmillion  in  2000,  to  only  $2.7  million  last   year.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, SMRT, which did not enjoy a fare increase last\r\n\r\nyear,  saw  its  profits drop by almost half,  from  $111\r\n\r\nmillion  to $67 million last year.  Yes, they  are  still\r\n\r\nprofitable and are still making millions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>ROTA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But profits must be measured relative to the level\r\n\r\nof the investments needed. The figures are huge.  SBS has\r\n\r\ntotal  assets  of over $500 million; TIBS has  over  $270\r\n\r\nmillion; and SMRT, $1.4 billion, ie, $1,400 million worth\r\n\r\nof assets.  Yesterday, we had a long lecture also from Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Soo Khoon on the return on equity (ROE) of SBS.  ROE\r\n\r\nis really not a good measure of how effectively a company\r\n\r\nis  using its assets.  The better measurement is ROTA, or\r\n\r\nReturn  on Total Assets.  ROTA is calculated by  dividing\r\n\r\nthe  earnings  before interest payments  by  their  total\r\n\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three operators, SBS had the best ROTA, of\r\n\r\n8.6  % last year.  In comparison, TIBS had 2.9% ROTA, and\r\n\r\nSMRT, 4.8%.  I think the financial analysts will tell  us\r\n\r\nthat  the  rate  of  return for SBS  in  2001  is  fairly\r\n\r\nhealthy,   but  the  rate  of  return  for  the  combined\r\n\r\nSMRT/TIBS  is  on  the low to very low side.   In  actual\r\n\r\nfact, the performance of the two bus companies would have\r\n\r\nbeen  even lower, if not for two Government measures that\r\n\r\nwe  implemented  in  1998.  Let  me  go  into  these  two\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Road Tax Reduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the vehicle tax rationalisation\r\n\r\nexercise.  This was part of the Government's cost-cutting\r\n\r\nexercise.   But it was also to offset the impact  of  the\r\n\r\nERP on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic  buses.  The road tax for buses was  reduced  from\r\n\r\n$5,500  to  $1,600 for the single-decked  buses,  and  to\r\n\r\n$2,000  for the double-decker buses.  Arising from  this,\r\n\r\nthe  two bus companies enjoyed a combined savings of some\r\n\r\n$13  million a year.  SBS alone accounted for  about  $10\r\n\r\nmillion of the savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of Bus Lifespan</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second important measure was the extension\r\n\r\nof  the  statutory lifespan of buses from 12 to 15 years.\r\n\r\nThis  was  again done in mid-1998.  This means  that  for\r\n\r\nthree years, from 1998 to mid-2001, the bus companies had\r\n\r\na double benefit.  First, they could continue using buses\r\n\r\nwhich  would  otherwise have to be  disposed  of.   These\r\n\r\nbuses  are  fully depreciated, ie, they could use  assets\r\n\r\nwhich,  in effect, were already free.  Second, they  were\r\n\r\nable to save the money which they would otherwise have to\r\n\r\nuse  to  buy the new replacement buses.  This means  that\r\n\r\nthey  saved on the depreciation, plus they were  able  to\r\n\r\nearn  interest on the money which they did  not  have  to\r\n\r\nspend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show Members the large amount of money involved,\r\n\r\nSBS  spends about $80 million a year to replace its fleet\r\n\r\nof  buses.  In terms of savings on depreciation, and  the\r\n\r\ninterest earned on the money which they did not  have  to\r\n\r\nspend, it comes up to $10 million or thereabouts a  year.\r\n\r\nAnd  because  this  is additive, ie, every  year  another\r\n\r\nbatch is saved, and they have the additional benefit from\r\n\r\nthat  batch saved.  The savings alone for the third year,\r\n\r\nie, in 2001, is about $25 million.  So, just for the year\r\n\r\n2001, they could save $25 million just on this measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two policy changes have helped enhance\r\n\r\nthe  profitability of the bus companies, not  because  of\r\n\r\nfare  increases or productivity improvements.  These  two\r\n\r\nmeasures alone would have saved them a lot of money.   In\r\n\r\nfact, one only has to look at their financial performance\r\n\r\nin 1997 to get a sense of how well the bus companies were\r\n\r\ndoing  without this assistance.  In 1997, SBS only earned\r\n\r\n$21 million and had a ROTA of only 4.4%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWithout the Government coming in, they were earning  only\r\n\r\n4.4% ROTA in 1997.  TIBS made only $1.7 million, and  had\r\n\r\na  ROTA of 2.3%.  And that was after they had a big  fare\r\n\r\nincrease of 8.5% that year.  If we look at those figures,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think, fundamentally, that the companies  are\r\n\r\nreally doing that well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is more important for the public is that\r\n\r\nbecause  of these two Government measures, we had  helped\r\n\r\nto  prevent  a price hike in 1998. And in 1999,  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies were even able to pass to commuters the savings\r\n\r\nfrom  the 10% CPF cut, which they did through a  5%  fare\r\n\r\nrebate.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Dr Tan Cheng Bock had asked\r\n\r\nabout this. Yes, they did do their part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, the impact of the lifespan extension\r\n\r\nbegan  to  diminish from mid-2001. That means, from  then\r\n\r\non,  they  would  have  to start replacing  their  buses,\r\n\r\nbecause the extended buses would have reached 15 years of\r\n\r\nage  already.   This means that this year, which  is  the\r\n\r\nfull  first  year  of  impact,  cost  must  go  up  quite\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   As I mentioned just now, the  impact  of\r\n\r\nthe lifespan extension is $10 million a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the more fundamental question would be whether\r\n\r\nthe  transport  operators, who  are  providing  a  public\r\n\r\nservice,  should even be making money.  Sir, it is  wrong\r\n\r\nto  think  that just because they are providing a  public\r\n\r\nservice,  they  should  not  be profit-oriented,  because\r\n\r\nprofit-oriented  is not profiteering-oriented.   We  must\r\n\r\nremember  that any operating entity, whether  it  is  for\r\n\r\nprofit  or not-for-profit, must earn a reasonable  return\r\n\r\nif  it  is  to  provide  a satisfactory  service  to  its\r\n\r\ncustomers.   This  is  even more  so  for  the  transport\r\n\r\nindustry,  which  is  a very asset and  capital-intensive\r\n\r\nindustry.   It  needs to have enough  revenues  to  cover\r\n\r\noperating costs, and to generate enough reserves to renew\r\n\r\nits  operating  assets.  Luckily, the  present  PTOs  are\r\n\r\nprofit-making, so they have reserves.  If they  are  not-for-profit  operations today, the full  impact  of  their\r\n\r\ncost increases over the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlast two years would have to be passed through in full to\r\n\r\nour commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members questioned why the PTC has to\r\n\r\nensure  the  financial viability of the PTOs. After  all,\r\n\r\nother  companies are not guaranteed of viability.  As  Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai  Yuen has rightly pointed out, this is  because\r\n\r\nthe public transport sector is a regulated sector, and we\r\n\r\nhave to regulate it because there are only two operators.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, have to regulate them to prevent them from\r\n\r\nmaking  excessive profits.  Sir, these two are definitely\r\n\r\nnot  normal  companies, in the sense of what Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh  had talked about yesterday.  Normal companies  are\r\n\r\nable to set their own rates based on what the market  can\r\n\r\nbear.   When  times are good, they can up  their  product\r\n\r\nprice  by 10%, 15% or 20%, whatever the market can  bear.\r\n\r\nI am sure that if the PTOs have this freedom, fares today\r\n\r\nwould  be much higher, at least 50%, if not double.   But\r\n\r\nbecause  we regulate them from having excessive  profits,\r\n\r\nthe regulator also has the obligation to look after their\r\n\r\ncommercial  viability.   Otherwise,  who  would  want  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  such  a sector, or even lend money  to  them?\r\n\r\nParliament recognised this in 1987, and that  is  why  we\r\n\r\ncharged  the  PTC with the responsibility to also  ensure\r\n\r\nthe viability of the operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there seems to be some misunderstanding about\r\n\r\nthe  CPI  +  X  formula  which is used  to  regulate  the\r\n\r\noperators.   Some Members seem to be under the impression\r\n\r\nthat   because  we  have  the  formula,  the  fares   are\r\n\r\nautomatically   given.  The  fare   increases   are   not\r\n\r\nautomatically  given, and the PTC has been  very  careful\r\n\r\nabout  that.   This  is  the formula  that  PTC  uses  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  what is the maximum that they can approve  for\r\n\r\nthe  fare  revision, should the PTC decide  that  a  fare\r\n\r\nrevision is warranted.  Some Members have asked  what  is\r\n\r\n\"X\". It seems to be a magic figure. Why is it 1.5%?  Sir,\r\n\r\n\"X\"  takes into consideration the manpower cost increases\r\n\r\nand  productivity  improvements.  In  deriving  the  wage\r\n\r\nincreases,  PTC took a look at the historical levels  and\r\n\r\ntried  to  project  forward  in  terms  of  what  is  the\r\n\r\nexpectation   for  the  future.  PTC   also   took   into\r\n\r\nconsideration the point that the bus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies must achieve productivity improvements.  So PTC\r\n\r\ndiscounted the amount of the salary increase factor  that\r\n\r\nshould be provided in the \"X\".  That is how it arrived at\r\n\r\na  level of 1.5%.  If you look at it, other than the last\r\n\r\ntwo  years  where,  because of the  recession,  the  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  have gone down, I think 1.5% is,  in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nvery  conservative estimate of the impact of labour  cost\r\n\r\nincreases,   taking   into   consideration   productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is whether the operators should\r\n\r\neven  be  profit-driven, ie, make profits but do  not  be\r\n\r\nprofit-driven.  Sir, as SMS Khaw Boon Wan had pointed out\r\n\r\nyesterday,  it  is  good that the operators  are  profit-driven.  This motivates them to innovate and to look  for\r\n\r\nways  to improve productivity and, hopefully, that  would\r\n\r\nflow down to the profits.  Otherwise, if they are paid on\r\n\r\na  cost-recovery basis, there is really no need for  them\r\n\r\nto  crack their heads and do better.  But while their job\r\n\r\nis  to  be  profit-driven,  the  key  that  Members  must\r\n\r\nremember  is  that  we still have the  PTC  guarding  the\r\n\r\ngoalpost on behalf of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Timing of Fare Increase</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the issue of timing.\r\n\r\nQuestions have been asked why now, why not later?   After\r\n\r\nall,  we are just recovering from the recession.  Members\r\n\r\nhave admitted that there is never really a good time  for\r\n\r\na  fare increase, let alone finding the best time.   Even\r\n\r\nwhen  the  economic  growth  is  strong,  fare  increases\r\n\r\ninvariably  attract tremendous amount of criticisms.   We\r\n\r\nhave  established  the  PTC, and we  have  given  it  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   to  safeguard  the  interests   of   the\r\n\r\ncommuters.   In  this,  it has  done  very  well.   As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned,  it  also  has to be  fair  to  the  transport\r\n\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have a situation of \"heads I win, tails\r\n\r\nyou lose\".  The key is to ensure that the PTC is able  to\r\n\r\nstudy  what  has led to the cost increases faced  by  the\r\n\r\noperators,  and  whether these are valid  factors.   Have\r\n\r\nthey  made  good  efforts to improve  productivity?   And\r\n\r\nafter satisfying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nitself that an increase is warranted, to proceed to allow\r\n\r\nan  appropriate  fare revision.  And if  the  economy  is\r\n\r\nweak,  as the PTC has realised, to keep the fare increase\r\n\r\nto  the  bare minimum - again, in this case, it has  done\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of Mr Tan Soo Khoon's arguments against an\r\n\r\nincrease now was that our economic recovery is still very\r\n\r\nshaky, and may not even hold.  I think the economic  data\r\n\r\nreleased  by  MTI this morning does give us something  to\r\n\r\ncheer  about -- not very much, but it is still  something\r\n\r\nto cheer about.  Our real GDP grew by 10.3% in the second\r\n\r\nquarter,  and this compares very well against  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  growth  of  8.4%. So 8.4% growth  in  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter,  10.3%  in the second quarter.   Of  course,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  guarantee that the rest of the year will be  even\r\n\r\nbetter  but, at least, at the present moment,  the  trend\r\n\r\nline is certainly looking good.  And even if it holds  at\r\n\r\nthis level, we would have done well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some have argued that the timing is bad because\r\n\r\nof  the  high unemployment.  I agree with that  argument.\r\n\r\nYes,  many Singaporeans are unemployed and many have been\r\n\r\nretrenched, and others are fearing for their jobs  today.\r\n\r\nLike  all  Members, I am concerned.  But  whilst  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  should look to see how  we  can  actually\r\n\r\nfocus  our  help  towards those  who  really  need  help.\r\n\r\nTrying to help them with a blunt instrument, like holding\r\n\r\nthe  fare increase, is not going to help them very  much.\r\n\r\nLet us look for real ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, indeed, is what the Government has been doing,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the unions and the employers.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  schemes  available  at  the  various  levels.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the unions have been playing a very  big  part.\r\n\r\nThey  have been actively helping their retrenched workers\r\n\r\nto  go for retraining and skills upgrading, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  get  a new job. Hopefully with higher level  skills,\r\n\r\nthey can even get better paying jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are having financial difficulties, the\r\n\r\nunions  have  also chipped in to provide  some  financial\r\n\r\nassistance.   At  the  Government and  community  levels,\r\n\r\nthere are also multiple schemes available.  Some examples\r\n\r\nare  the  recently  introduced Economic  Downturn  Relief\r\n\r\nScheme  (EDRS)  and some old schemes like  the  Rent  and\r\n\r\nUtilities  Assistance Scheme (RUAS) and, of  course,  the\r\n\r\ngood  old  Public  Assistance  (PA)  for  those  who  are\r\n\r\ngenuinely unable to work.  At the community level,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  network  of \"Many Helping Hands\".  Many  CCCs  are\r\n\r\nproviding financial help through their welfare funds.   I\r\n\r\nknow,  because I monitor what we do in our  GRC  and  the\r\n\r\nfive  MPs in our GRC do give up quite a fair bit  of  aid\r\n\r\nthrough our welfare fund.  Even our PCF kindergartens are\r\n\r\nchipping  in  to  waive,  either in  full  or  partially,\r\n\r\nkindergarten  fees.  And starting from 1st  January  next\r\n\r\nyear, those facing financial hardship can also tap on the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Restructuring Shares  (ERS).   I  think  for  a\r\n\r\nfamily of four, it would provide quite substantial  help.\r\n\r\nSo,  it is better that we look at ways to help those  who\r\n\r\nare  directly  in  need, and do it in  a  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nsubstantial way, so that they do not have to worry  about\r\n\r\nthe  one  or two cents that they have to pay for the  bus\r\n\r\nfare increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we have a lot of schemes to help the\r\n\r\nunemployed, how would this affect those who are employed?\r\n\r\nWould  it  be a big impact on them?  Sir, to do that,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to look in terms of how the fares have gone up  for\r\n\r\nthe  last few years.  As I mentioned just now, the  fares\r\n\r\nhave actually lagged behind salary increases.  But if  we\r\n\r\nlook over the past 15 years, the increase in the cost  of\r\n\r\ntravel  has lagged even further behind the national  wage\r\n\r\ngrowth.   Just now, Mr Ravindran asked for actual figures\r\n\r\non how much the fares have actually gone up by.  Salaries\r\n\r\nhave  gone  up by 136% over the last 15 years.   But  how\r\n\r\nmuch  have  the fares actually gone up by?  Sir,  I  will\r\n\r\nquote him the average bus ride of 8 kilometres.  In 1987,\r\n\r\nan  8-kilometre bus ride cost 90 cents.  Today, that same\r\n\r\nride,  with  the  recent increase, would cost  $1.03,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n14%  over  the  past 15 years.  If we look at  the  train\r\n\r\nride,  the  train ride has gone up a little bit  further,\r\n\r\nbecause 1987 was the start of the MRT system.  The  train\r\n\r\nride  has  gone up 30%, from 80 cents to $1.04 today.   I\r\n\r\nthink  Members  would agree that these figures  are  very\r\n\r\nreasonable and well below the salary increases enjoyed by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which Mr Iswaran brought up is that\r\n\r\naffordability  is  not  just about percentage  increases.\r\n\r\nAffordability is how much the families are paying as part\r\n\r\nof their family expenditure. And has it gone up today, or\r\n\r\nhas  it gone down?  Sir, I have only two sets of figures,\r\n\r\n1998 and 1988.  In 1988, public transport formed 5.1%  of\r\n\r\nhousehold expenditures.  In 1998, ten years later, it has\r\n\r\nnot  gone  up.   It  has gone down  to  4%  of  household\r\n\r\nexpenditures.  So the impact of public transport  on  the\r\n\r\nfamily  pocket has actually diminished over the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Amy Khor stated that there is now a\r\n\r\nperception that the PTC has tilted fully in favour of the\r\n\r\ntransport operators.  Sir, she is totally wrong, and  the\r\n\r\nground  perception is also totally wrong.  The  data  has\r\n\r\nshown otherwise.  On the contrary, Members and the public\r\n\r\nshould  be  thanking  the PTC for  having  protected  the\r\n\r\ncommuters so well.  And I think we also should thank  the\r\n\r\ntransport  operators for being productive  and  efficient\r\n\r\nand  making the low fares possible.  But some Members may\r\n\r\nask,  \"How can we be sure that the fares are reasonable?\"\r\n\r\nThey  may  be  affordable, but are they high compared  to\r\n\r\nelsewhere?   Are  they reasonable?  Sir, we  can  compare\r\n\r\nagainst, say, Hong Kong, which has a similar standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  The population is similar, except that they  are\r\n\r\ndouble  ours,  and  we all know in the  public  transport\r\n\r\nsector, economy of scale is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Tan Soo Khoon also brought up the\r\n\r\nexample  of  the  Kowloon Motor Bus  Company  (KMB).   He\r\n\r\nquoted some figures and all that.  Sir, let me go  on  to\r\n\r\nthe  Kowloon Motor Bus Company.  KMB is bigger than  SBS.\r\n\r\nKMB has a total of 3,700 buses compared to about 2,800-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n2,900  in  SBS.  But, despite the advantages of a  bigger\r\n\r\npopulation, a bigger bus fleet, I am glad to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse that our bus fares are still cheaper.  Let me  give\r\n\r\nMembers some comparison.  The fare for a 3 kilometre ride\r\n\r\nfor  KMB is 80 cents.  This is in Singapore dollars,  not\r\n\r\nHong  Kong dollars.  This is almost 30% higher  than  our\r\n\r\nnew  starting  fare of 63 cents.  And this  is  the  good\r\n\r\npart.  For a 35 kilometre trip, which is our maximum, KMB\r\n\r\ncharges S$3.05 cents per ride.  Those of you who ride the\r\n\r\nbus  will know that in Singapore, for that distance,  our\r\n\r\ncommuters only pay $1.53 cents, half the price of KMB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan also touted the competitiveness of the\r\n\r\nPTOs  in  Hong  Kong.  He  said that  when  the  new  MTR\r\n\r\nextension was opened, the MTR reduced prices to  undercut\r\n\r\nthe  bus  fares.  And then KMB countered attack  by  also\r\n\r\nreducing  prices,  and  offering free  meals.   I  cannot\r\n\r\nremember.  Is it KMB or is it MTR?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> MTR.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> MTR. And he said that our PTOs\r\n\r\nshould  therefore not hide behind the skirts of the  PTC,\r\n\r\nand  only  know how to increase fares.  Sir, if only  SBS\r\n\r\nand  TIBS were able to charge the same high fares as Hong\r\n\r\nKong, I am sure that when they heard that yesterday, they\r\n\r\nmust have been groaning away about how lucky they are  in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong.  I am sure that if they can charge  the  same\r\n\r\nfares  as  in  Hong Kong, they will also have  plenty  of\r\n\r\nscope  to  offer special discounts too.  If I am charging\r\n\r\n50%  more,  I will be very happy to offer a 20% discount,\r\n\r\nand end up looking good all the way to the bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan also mentioned that in Hong Kong, the\r\n\r\nbus  operators give value for money.  If charging  up  to\r\n\r\ndouble  what the Singapore bus companies are charging  is\r\n\r\ngiving  value  for  money, then I think Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  in trouble.  The fact is that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare already getting the best value for money from our bus\r\n\r\noperators.  First, minimal price increases over the  last\r\n\r\n15  years.   I  quoted 14% increase for the  average  bus\r\n\r\nride.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen  I think of my hawker food prices, the bus companies\r\n\r\nhave  been even more competitive than my hawker  who  has\r\n\r\ncharged me a lot more over the last 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, second, we have a quality of service that other\r\n\r\nbus  companies envy.  Comfortable air-conditioned  buses,\r\n\r\nwith  few breakdowns.  Yes, there are breakdowns,  but  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure you, in Singapore, the breakdowns are far and\r\n\r\nfew  in between.  Of course, the commuters would like the\r\n\r\nbus  companies  to  do  better.   And  I  think  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  should continually endeavour to  do  so.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is always the cost implication.  And I would  urge\r\n\r\ncommuters to exercise caution and prudence.  The more you\r\n\r\nwant, unfortunately, must end up in you paying more.  So,\r\n\r\nlet  us  have  a  better  balance between  wanting  more,\r\n\r\nwanting better services, and being prepared to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion on Fare Increases</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now sum up on why it was necessary to\r\n\r\nincrease the transport fares.  First, costs have gone  up\r\n\r\nby  15%  over  the  last two years, and  because  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession last year, PTC rejected the request of the PTOs\r\n\r\nfor a general fare increase, and only increased fares  to\r\n\r\nallow  a  1% increase in revenue.  This year,  PTC  again\r\n\r\nmoderated the increase to 2.3%.  And while the  PTOs  are\r\n\r\nstill profitable, the rate of return is only moderate, to\r\n\r\nvery  low.  But the indicators are that this increase  of\r\n\r\n2.3% will only allow them to partially cover the expected\r\n\r\ncost  increases this year.  It is therefore unlikely that\r\n\r\nthe   bus   companies  would  be  able  to  achieve   the\r\n\r\nspectacular  results of the last three  years.   Sir,  as\r\n\r\nsuch, the PTC has decided to increase the fares by 3 to 5\r\n\r\ncents  per ride for those who are using ez-link  card  or\r\n\r\nthe  magnetic card, and 10 cents for cash.  The  PTC  has\r\n\r\nmade  the  decision.  The Ministry agrees  with  the  PTC\r\n\r\nbecause we also feel that, whilst the timing may  not  be\r\n\r\nthe best, the increase is certainly not excessive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PTC has also adopted the principle of granting\r\n\r\nsmall fare increases rather\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  having a big and very painful increase  once  every\r\n\r\nfew  years.  All price increases inflict some  pain.   We\r\n\r\nall know that.  The PTC's approach is a less painful one.\r\n\r\nI  would  therefore  urge Members to  support  the  PTC's\r\n\r\nprinciple of small fare increases on a regular basis  and\r\n\r\navoid  having to impose a larger one later on.   The  PTC\r\n\r\nhas  taken its decision after taking in all the  relevant\r\n\r\nfactors.  The Government accepts the PTC's decision,  and\r\n\r\nI hope Members will also give their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>ERP Exemption for Buses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to some of the other points\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by Members.  ERP exemption for buses.   Some\r\n\r\nMembers have asked that we exempt the buses from the  ERP\r\n\r\nsystem to encourage more people to switch from private to\r\n\r\npublic transport.  The objective of the ERP system is  to\r\n\r\nmanage  congestion  through road  pricing.   Buses,  like\r\n\r\nother vehicles, also contribute to our congestion.   They\r\n\r\ntherefore must be subject to the ERP charges.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nto  exempt  them  will  only help to  distort  the  usage\r\n\r\npattern.  Let me give Members an example.  When going  to\r\n\r\nOrchard Road, one can either use the train or he can take\r\n\r\na  bus.   The train does not cause any traffic  jam.   It\r\n\r\njust   goes  underground.   But  buses  do.   We   should\r\n\r\nencourage  more people to ride trains instead  of  buses,\r\n\r\nand  encourage  the operators to run more  trains  rather\r\n\r\nthan more buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERP which buses pay, and which trains do\r\n\r\nnot,  is  the  way to do that - through the price  signal\r\n\r\nthat it sends.  In any case, the ERP charge per passenger\r\n\r\nis  very  small,  compared to  the  ERP  charge  per  car\r\n\r\npassenger.  So, imposing the ERP on the public  buses,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  will  not discourage people from  switching  from\r\n\r\ntheir own cars to public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Cheng Bock had also mentioned that the\r\n\r\nERP  charges  would not result in higher  cost.   He  had\r\n\r\nasked me whether it is true.  Sir, he is correct.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrue.  As I mentioned just now, we have reduced the  road\r\n\r\ntax  significantly to more than cover the cost of the ERP\r\n\r\ncharges.   The  bus operators would only incur  about  $4\r\n\r\nmillion  a year in ERP charges.  We had reduced the  road\r\n\r\ntaxes by $13 million a year.  So it more than covers  the\r\n\r\nERP,  and  the bus companies have no grounds  at  all  to\r\n\r\ncomplain about having to pay for the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Competition</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to another hot topic, which is\r\n\r\ncompetition.   Many people, both outside and  inside  the\r\n\r\nHouse, take the view that public transport costs are high\r\n\r\ntoday  due to the lack of competition.  Minister Mah  had\r\n\r\nalready  explained  yesterday  why  competition  in   the\r\n\r\ntransport  sector  would  not work,  and  so  had  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister of State Khaw Boon Wan who also compared the bus\r\n\r\nindustry to the telecoms industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need not go any further than to look at SBS\r\n\r\nand  TIBS.  Yes, they are not directly competing with one\r\n\r\nanother,  but  they  are running a  similar  system  with\r\n\r\nsimilar cost structure.  SBS enjoys greater economies  of\r\n\r\nscale.  SBS fleet is about 2,800.  I think the TIBS fleet\r\n\r\nis about 800.  So, SBS is about slightly over three times\r\n\r\nthe  size  of TIBS.  And because SBS enjoys economies  of\r\n\r\nscale, they have lower operating costs.  As a result, SBS\r\n\r\nmade  after tax profits of $39 million in 2001,  compared\r\n\r\nto   TIBS'  profits  of  $2.7  million  the  same   year.\r\n\r\nTherefore if we introduce full competition, yes,  it  may\r\n\r\nlook exciting, but what would be the actual impact?   You\r\n\r\nare  going  to get fragmentation, you are going  to  have\r\n\r\nsmall companies - companies that may be even smaller than\r\n\r\nTIBS.   Are  they  going  to have lower  cost  than  SBS,\r\n\r\nespecially with SBS' sunk cost?  A lot of the assets they\r\n\r\noccupy  are assets which they bought many years ago  when\r\n\r\nprices  were  much lower.  I think not.   I  think  those\r\n\r\nsmall  operators are going to end up with operating costs\r\n\r\neven  higher  than TIBS.  And if we have competition,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not regulate the way we are doing today.   We  must\r\n\r\nregulate with a very light touch and allow flexibility in\r\n\r\npricing.  If we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  that,  I  think the smaller operators must eventually\r\n\r\nend  up  charging  more because their costs  are  higher.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  do  not  think  that  this  will  end   up\r\n\r\nbenefiting the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, and although our current bus\r\n\r\nindustry  framework  has served  us  well,  Members  will\r\n\r\nremember  that in the last Budget debate, I informed  the\r\n\r\nHouse   that  my  Ministry  is  open  to  the   idea   of\r\n\r\ncompetition.   We  are, for a start,  prepared  to  allow\r\n\r\nadditional players to operate feeder services in the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  and  we  will do that on a  pilot  basis.   Why\r\n\r\nfeeder  services?  It is because the area is defined.  It\r\n\r\nis  easier  to  monitor. It is easier for  the  users  to\r\n\r\nactually  compare between the two.  Sir, any new operator\r\n\r\nwho wants to do so will have the chance to compete on  an\r\n\r\nequal  footing  with the incumbent,  and  they  need  not\r\n\r\nimplement  the new ez-link system in order  to  interface\r\n\r\nwith  the system.  They can save the expenses of the  ez-link  system if they wish to do so.  But as  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of uncertainty in the outcome of the pilot,  any\r\n\r\nnew  operator  who wishes to participate in  this  scheme\r\n\r\nmust first seek the support of the community in which  it\r\n\r\nis  to operate in.  And I think the community must be led\r\n\r\nby  the  MPs.  So if the MPs agree, they can talk to  the\r\n\r\noperators  and they can then come to the PTC and  present\r\n\r\ntheir  proposal to the PTC.  And I am sure the PTC  would\r\n\r\nbe very happy to give due consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Role of PTC</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the big topic of the role and\r\n\r\nthe  composition of the PTC.  As Dr Wang Kai Yuen and  Dr\r\n\r\nAmy  Khor  have noted, the PTC has to operate within  the\r\n\r\nparameters  set by the House.  One of the key  duties  of\r\n\r\nthe PTC is to review applications for fare revisions.  In\r\n\r\ncarrying out this role, it must safeguard the interest of\r\n\r\ncommuters.   But it also has to ensure the  viability  of\r\n\r\nthe  PTOs.   Because  fare revisions are  always  unhappy\r\n\r\nevents,  Parliament  set up the  PTC  as  an  independent\r\n\r\nregulator.   This  way, the Council  is  not  subject  to\r\n\r\nlobbying or pressure from either the public, the PTOs, or\r\n\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is what the PTC has done every year,\r\n\r\nsince it was formed 15 years ago.  It has taken its  role\r\n\r\nvery seriously.  The Council subjected every request  for\r\n\r\nfare  revision  to  rigorous and thorough  analysis.   Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran  asked  whether they have think-tanks  and  all\r\n\r\nthat.   Sir, PTC has people from industry with  expertise\r\n\r\nto  analyse  company reports and company operations,  who\r\n\r\nare  able to sift through a whole ream of details to  get\r\n\r\nto  the  real picture.  And after having done  all  these\r\n\r\nanalyses,  its decisions have always been more than  fair\r\n\r\nto commuters.  I have mentioned all the figures just now,\r\n\r\nso I shall not repeat them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure Members that the PTC's job is a\r\n\r\nvery difficult one.  I know, because each time I meet the\r\n\r\nChairman, after PTC has finalised its decision, I can see\r\n\r\nthe  worry  lines  on his forehead.   He  and  the  other\r\n\r\nCouncil   members   certainly  do  agonise   over   their\r\n\r\ndeliberations  and  final  decisions.   They  take  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities seriously, as they should.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PTC is an important institution, one that\r\n\r\nhas served the people very well.  We should take care not\r\n\r\nto  undermine  it,  as this would be tantamount  to  also\r\n\r\nundermining the interest of the general public.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I  support the amendment by Dr Tan Boon Wan.  Having\r\n\r\nsaid that, I must say I also agree with the views of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  here  that PTC's communication  process  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved  upon.  I will certainly ask my  staff  to  work\r\n\r\nwith PTC on how to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Composition of PTC</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members also spoke about the composition of the\r\n\r\nPTC.   Some  asked  if  the Council members  took  public\r\n\r\ntransport.  Membership in the Council cannot be based  on\r\n\r\nwhether  one  uses public transport.  Having  said  that,\r\n\r\nagain,  I understand that several of the members  do  use\r\n\r\npublic  transport regularly.  In fact, one of  them  does\r\n\r\nnot  even  own  a  car.   Because the  PTC  has  a  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  we  have always chosen  Council  members\r\n\r\nvery  carefully.  They are usually people of high  repute\r\n\r\nin the different sectors and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent   professions,  and  include  senior  managers,\r\n\r\naccountants, professionals, social workers  and  a  union\r\n\r\nrepresentative.   They  bring to  the  Council  expertise\r\n\r\nneeded   for   the  deliberations  to  be   carried   out\r\n\r\nprofessionally and properly.  These are people  who  have\r\n\r\nbusy  schedules.  And I can assure you this is not a very\r\n\r\npopular  job.   I cannot remember who mentioned  it  just\r\n\r\nnow.   But we do have a tough time looking for the  right\r\n\r\npeople to serve on the Council.  Yet, they have agreed to\r\n\r\ntake the time and effort to serve on the Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noted the suggestions of Members to\r\n\r\nreview  the  Council's membership and to see  if  we  can\r\n\r\nstrengthen   it   further,  eg,  with  additional   union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and grassroots leaders.   We  will  also\r\n\r\nlook into whether we should continue having the transport\r\n\r\noperators  as Council members.  I will ask  my  staff  to\r\n\r\nlook into the various suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo, you have just about 5 minutes\r\n\r\nbefore your hour is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I am finishing, Sir. Just a few\r\n\r\nmore minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have spoken about the unhappiness\r\n\r\nof  the public over what they perceive as price increases\r\n\r\nfor  a whole slew of public services.  The Government  is\r\n\r\nindeed   aware  of  the  need  to  keep  public  services\r\n\r\naffordable, and not to increase prices unless  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary.   Some  of the items mentioned,  like  utility\r\n\r\nprices,  are really out of our control.  Oil is the  main\r\n\r\ndeterminant  of the cost of generating electricity.   So,\r\n\r\nwhen  oil prices go up, the price of power goes up.   But\r\n\r\nwhen oil prices go down, I am sure Members have also seen\r\n\r\nthat power prices do go down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may like to know that despite all these\r\n\r\nincreases  that we have talked about, MTI estimates  that\r\n\r\ninflation  rate  this year will still be  close  to  \"0\".\r\n\r\nAlthough the items may be many, in actual fact the impact\r\n\r\nper  item  is  not  very  large.  Whilst  this  hike  may\r\n\r\nincrease it a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlittle   bit,   there  will  be  other  cost   reductions\r\n\r\nelsewhere, and we will end up with about \"0\" inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Suspension of Standing Orders)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.37 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, point of order.

I have replied\r\n\r\nto  most  of  his points.  He has also talked  about  the\r\n\r\nwillingness of the school bus operators to forgo  a  fare\r\n\r\nincrease   now,  despite  the  increases   in   insurance\r\n\r\npremiums,  and that they will only look into  it  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   I checked into the fares charged by the  school\r\n\r\nbuses.   They range from about $30 to $120, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  distance travelled.  These are much higher than what\r\n\r\nthe public bus services charge.  For example,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na primary school student can enjoy unlimited rides on our\r\n\r\npublic  buses any time of the day for a cost  of  $22.50.\r\n\r\nAs  such, if I were a private bus operator, I would  also\r\n\r\nbe   very  worried  if  I  have  to  increase  my  fares,\r\n\r\nespecially  if the fare increase is likely to  be  large.\r\n\r\nThe  speculation  in  the newspapers  is  that  the  fare\r\n\r\nincrease is likely to be between $10 and $40.  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nis  not a 2.3% increase.  The fare increase is likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  region  of 30%.  If I  am  the  private  bus\r\n\r\noperator,  I  will  also shelve the 30%  increase  today,\r\n\r\nespecially  after  all  the  complaints  about  the  2.3%\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has also given some\r\n\r\nsuggestions  for the public transport operators  to  look\r\n\r\ninto.   And so has Mr Zainudin. They have asked the  PTOs\r\n\r\nto  look  for  innovative ways to reward the  loyalty  of\r\n\r\ncommuters.   Sir, the PTOs are all here upstairs.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  they have heard and taken note of Mr Tan's  and  Mr\r\n\r\nZainudin's suggestions, and I will leave it to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong gave some feedback about the ez-link card. He said that the feedback given to him is\r\n\r\nthat the card is giving a lot of trouble, and there is  a\r\n\r\n20%  failure  rate.   Sir, with  20%  failure  rate,  the\r\n\r\ntransport system will break down!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> From one particular complainant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> May be one particular\r\n\r\ncomplainant.   Sir,  the fact is that  the  failure  rate\r\n\r\ntoday  is about 1.5%.  But 1.5% is still high.  I am  not\r\n\r\nhappy, and I have asked TransitLink and the operators  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  it as quickly as they can, and to  bring  the\r\n\r\nfigure  down  rapidly.  But when I look at  the  magnetic\r\n\r\ncard  when  it was first introduced in 1990, I  was  told\r\n\r\nthen  that the failure rate, when it was introduced,  was\r\n\r\none  in ten or 10%, even higher.  In comparison, the  ez-link card is not doing badly, but there is plenty of room\r\n\r\nfor  improvement.  So we will pressure them to bring  the\r\n\r\nquality of the system up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang suggested that we nationalise and\r\n\r\nsubsidise public transport.  A lot of Members have joined\r\n\r\nin to disagree with him.  I shall not belabour the point.\r\n\r\nSir,  to nationalise the two operators - SMRT and  SBS  - today  would  be  sending a very, very  wrong  signal  to\r\n\r\ninvestors all over the world.  We will be one of the  few\r\n\r\ncountries in this day and age to go out to nationalise  a\r\n\r\ncompany.   And  we  should  also  not  subsidise   public\r\n\r\ntransport  operations,  because public  transport  has  a\r\n\r\nconsumption factor in it.  If we subsidise, we are  going\r\n\r\nto distort usage, and we are going to encourage even more\r\n\r\nusage.  With our roads already being clogged up, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should  do  our  best to minimise usage  rather  than\r\n\r\nencourage usage by distorting the usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob urged that we treat feeder\r\n\r\nservices differently from the trunk services because many\r\n\r\npeople  in  the heartland use it.  Sir, yes, I sympathise\r\n\r\nwith them.  But we have to look in terms of what are  the\r\n\r\nresources needed to provide the feeder service.   Is  the\r\n\r\nfeeder   service  requiring  resources  which  are   very\r\n\r\ndifferent from the trunk services?  The answer is no.  In\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  the feeder services are still  charging  a\r\n\r\nflat  rate  of  63  cents today, despite  the  length  of\r\n\r\ntravel.   In that sense, the feeder bus riders are  being\r\n\r\ntreated specially compared to those who are on the  trunk\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang. He\r\n\r\nurged  the  LTA to allow the bus operators to keep  their\r\n\r\nrental  income  to  offset the cost  of  maintaining  the\r\n\r\ninterchange,  ie,  to  give the bus  companies  the  same\r\n\r\ntreatment as SMRT.  The two sets of assets - the land and\r\n\r\nthe investment - come under two different treatments. And\r\n\r\nthat  is  why  for SMRT, we are able to give  the  entire\r\n\r\npremises to SMRT and let them operate it as if they  have\r\n\r\nleased  the  entire asset.  Unfortunately,  for  the  bus\r\n\r\noperators,  we are not able to, but we are  looking  into\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay said that the 3 cents increase\r\n\r\nfor a rider who pays 60 cents is not a small increase, it\r\n\r\nis a 5% increase.  Sir, I agree with him, but we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to do it as an across-the-board  increase,\r\n\r\nwith equal pain for everybody, ie, no matter how far  you\r\n\r\nride,  the same increase applies.  We could do  it  on  a\r\n\r\npercentage basis, but I think that would be a little  bit\r\n\r\nmessier.  In any case, for those who are taking the trunk\r\n\r\nrides for 60 cents, I would like to inform the House that\r\n\r\nthe  60  cents charge for air-con services has  not  been\r\n\r\nchanged  since 1984.  So, those people who have  had  the\r\n\r\nprivilege of riding short distances have enjoyed the same\r\n\r\nfare  for  over 17 years.  The 3 cents increase  in  this\r\n\r\npresent fare revision is a very fair one for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng mentioned about the Fuel Equalisation\r\n\r\nFund.  Sir, the Fuel Equalisation Fund was set up to help\r\n\r\nthe   operators  in  times  of  violent  and   short-term\r\n\r\nfluctuations of the fuel price.  So, in this way,  if  it\r\n\r\ngoes   up   very  quickly  and  it  impinges   on   their\r\n\r\nprofitability,  they  can tap  into  the  Fund  for  some\r\n\r\nrelief.  This is because we do not want the bus companies\r\n\r\nto  be  changing their bus fares every few  months,  just\r\n\r\nlike we do for the utilities.  It will be very confusing.\r\n\r\nSo,  this  is  meant to be a stabilisation fund,  and  it\r\n\r\nshould  not  be used to subsidise the fuel cost,  because\r\n\r\nthe  fuel  prices are going to remain high, I think,  for\r\n\r\nquite some time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng also tried to promote cycling as a cheaper\r\n\r\nalternative.   Sir, I also like to cycle  as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nexercise, but only when I want to have a good sweat  out.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore, there are two reasons why cycling  is  not\r\n\r\nreally  feasible as a normal means of transport.   First,\r\n\r\nour  weather  is  very, very punishing.   Even  with  the\r\n\r\nbreeze  blowing in your face, by the time you  arrive  in\r\n\r\nthe   office,  you  are  already  all  hot  and   sweaty.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  to  promote  safe cycling,  we  need  to  have\r\n\r\ncycling  lanes, specifically set aside for the  cyclists,\r\n\r\nwhich is what Ms Irene Ng had also mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, in Singapore, we are already\r\n\r\nscrambling to look for space for an additional car  lane,\r\n\r\nlet alone an additional cycling lane.  So this is an idea\r\n\r\nthat is not really feasible in the context\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  our  local  environment.  But as a weekend  activity,\r\n\r\nyes,  and I would urge MND to provide more riding  lanes,\r\n\r\nto  link up the different parks so that those people  who\r\n\r\ndo  it  as a recreational activity, like me on a weekend,\r\n\r\ncan  cycle from one park to another.  I think this  is  a\r\n\r\nvery good idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have asked why do we not defer\r\n\r\nthe  fare  revision  until the ez-link  system  has  been\r\n\r\nimplemented because of the speculation that it  is  going\r\n\r\nto  cut  down  on people cheating the bus companies,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  is  going to lead to an increase in  revenues.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, it would impact on this year's operating\r\n\r\ncost,  and  that  would be good news for  commuters  next\r\n\r\nyear.   So, let us implement the ez-link system  and  see\r\n\r\nwhether  there are actual savings coming from the system.\r\n\r\nIf so, next year's fares may not have to increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go on to some other points. Ms Braema\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Arthur  Fong asked that we look  into  providing\r\n\r\nbuses that are friendly to the disabled, buses that  will\r\n\r\nkneel  down in order for those who are in wheelchairs  to\r\n\r\nboard  the  buses. This is a concept which is  applicable\r\n\r\nonly  if  that  bus service is not meant  to  be  a  high\r\n\r\ncapacity  service.  In Singapore, we  need  to  move  the\r\n\r\nbuses  along as rapidly as we can. In fact, the  PTC  and\r\n\r\nthe  bus companies are always looking for ways to see how\r\n\r\nwe  can  speed up the time taken for people to board  the\r\n\r\nbus  and to come down from the bus.  That is why we  have\r\n\r\nthe ez-link card, and why we have the bigger doors in the\r\n\r\npublic buses.  I think this system will not be applicable\r\n\r\nfor Singapore, as it stands today, because for the bus to\r\n\r\ntilt and for the bus driver to come down and all that, it\r\n\r\nwill lead to tremendous delays.  I think it is better for\r\n\r\nNCSS  to  work  with MCDS to come up with an  appropriate\r\n\r\nsystem  for transporting the disabled.  But, nonetheless,\r\n\r\nI  will  request  the bus operators to  continue  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether they have another solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have finished with the replies. Let\r\n\r\nme now conclude.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nheard  from  many MPs reflecting the unhappiness  at  the\r\n\r\nground  level.  The accusations are very wide  ranging  - from  the  Government not listening  to  the  people,  an\r\n\r\nuncaring  PTC,  an  uncaring  Government,  as   well   as\r\n\r\nprofiteering by the bus companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure Singaporeans that the Government\r\n\r\ndoes  listen carefully.  The Government also  has  a  big\r\n\r\ncaring heart about the welfare of Singaporeans.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  when  the  Asian economic crisis hit  in  1997,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  quickly moved to put together  a  package  of\r\n\r\nmeasures to help relieve the pain.  It also put in  place\r\n\r\na  wide-ranging package of measures to help  upgrade  the\r\n\r\nskills  of  workers  and help them  remain  relevant  and\r\n\r\nemployable in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when it comes to public transport, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has also devoted a lot of resources and energy\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that we have an excellent land and  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system.  Those who have travelled abroad  will\r\n\r\nknow  that  our public transport is one that is  hard  to\r\n\r\nfind  elsewhere, in terms of quality and price.  We  have\r\n\r\nheard  the  unhappiness, and we can  certainly  empathise\r\n\r\nwith  the  sentiments.   But it is important  for  public\r\n\r\npolicy to be made on the proper basis, based on the long-term interests of the people and the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must state the facts clearly and accurately. And\r\n\r\nwhere  the perceptions are wrong, we must be prepared  to\r\n\r\nexplain  and clarify.  This debate has certainly provided\r\n\r\nplenty of opportunities for all of us to do so.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  the first time that a fare revision has taken place,\r\n\r\nand  it will definitely not be the last.  The PTC and the\r\n\r\nbus  companies  must therefore improve the  communication\r\n\r\nprocess  so  that the rationale for the fare revision  is\r\n\r\nclearly  understood, and the people know, in no uncertain\r\n\r\nterms,  that  the  PTC has once again  safeguarded  their\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a good regulatory and physical public\r\n\r\ntransport  system in place.  It may not be the  best,  as\r\n\r\nsome Members\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave pointed out, and therefore there is always room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.   This  we shall do.  But  we  must  proceed\r\n\r\ncarefully, as our public transport system would not  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped so well, in terms of both quality and  pricing,\r\n\r\nif the fundamentals were wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan's amendment will reassure the\r\n\r\npublic  about  the role of the PTC, while preserving  the\r\n\r\nCouncil's  independence.   I  am  happy  to  support  his\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  speak  on  Dr Tan Boon Wan's  amendment.   When\r\n\r\nspeaking  on  this  motion, I asked myself  whether  this\r\n\r\ndebate  moved  by  Mr  Tan  Soo Khoon  has  achieved  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  that he and a group of us have set  out.   We\r\n\r\nhave  listened to the Minister.  He has given  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nexplanations.  It is not only by him, but by  the  former\r\n\r\nMinister  for Communications and the Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  Transport on the need for the price increase.\r\n\r\nA lot of explanations have been given and we do hope that\r\n\r\nthe public will receive these explanations well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not so sure whether people understand\r\n\r\nthe  CPI + X factor.  I know the Senior Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  Transport has said that if we really understand  the\r\n\r\nformula,  all things will be solved.  I think there  will\r\n\r\nbe another session for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set out three objectives. The first\r\n\r\nobjective  is to let the Government know of the sentiment\r\n\r\nand  the  feel of the ground.  We have achieved  this  in\r\n\r\nthis debate.  I guess we have done very well hearing from\r\n\r\nall my parliamentary colleagues.  We could feel that they\r\n\r\nhave  expressed the true feelings of the ground  and,  to\r\n\r\nsum  it  up,  do  not  take them for  granted.   And  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  already given us his assurance  that  they\r\n\r\nwill listen, and we do hope that the message has been put\r\n\r\nacross to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have another objective, which is to let the\r\n\r\ntransport   operators  show  to  the  ground   that   the\r\n\r\nefficiency is not at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpense of the general commuter.  Again, judging from the\r\n\r\nnumerous  suggestions and requests  made  by  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  in this House, I think the message  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  put  across to them.  We also want to let PTC  know\r\n\r\nthat we want more transparency.  And, again, judging from\r\n\r\nall  the  various  suggestions, I think the  message  has\r\n\r\nalready  been given to them. They will know that this  is\r\n\r\nan important request, coupled with a better communication\r\n\r\nprocess,  as suggested by the Minister, would put  things\r\n\r\nright in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two limbs to this original motion and Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Boon  Wan amended the first limb.  He also included,\r\n\r\nin  his  amendment,  PM's call for his  support  for  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of PTC granting small increases.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave no objection to that.  As for his other amendment in\r\n\r\nlines 5 and 6, we also have no objection, except that  we\r\n\r\nwould  like to see the order of the two factors  that  he\r\n\r\nput  to  this House reversed. Can I refer Members to  his\r\n\r\namendment?   Item 3, the third and the fourth  lines,  it\r\n\r\nsays,  \"to take into consideration relevant factors  such\r\n\r\nas  the  viability of the public transport operators  and\r\n\r\naffordability of the commuters.\"  I think the reverse  is\r\n\r\nmore  correct.   Because  if  we  were  to  look  at  his\r\n\r\namendment,  it  would  seem that  we  are  favouring  the\r\n\r\ntransport operators.  For us, our concern, as Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House, is that the commuters should come first.   So\r\n\r\nwe  will  reverse  the  order  -  \"affordability  of  the\r\n\r\ncommuters\"  should come first, followed by \"viability  of\r\n\r\nthe public transport operators.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, however, fails to address two\r\n\r\nimportant issues which have been dealt with at length  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House.  One is the state of the economy.\r\n\r\nI  do  not want to discuss this at length because so much\r\n\r\nhas been spoken and so many figures have been given.   We\r\n\r\nall  know the state of the economy.  The other one is the\r\n\r\nunemployment situation.  Figures have been thrown  out  - 88,000  from  the  Deputy Prime Minister  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate, and my colleague,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  gave a figure of 100,000.   So,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  situation is an important consideration  in\r\n\r\nany future fare increase by the bus operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make an amendment to Dr Tan\r\n\r\nBoon Wan's amendment, to take into consideration all  the\r\n\r\nthree points that I have brought up.  Can I refer Members\r\n\r\nto  lines 5 and 6 again?  With my amendment, item (3)  of\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan's amendment would read as follows:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In lines 5 and 6, to leave out the words, \"to\r\n\r\nreview  its decision on the increase in public  transport\r\n\r\nfares\",  and  there to insert the words, \"when  reviewing\r\n\r\nrequests  for  fare increases, to take into consideration\r\n\r\nrelevant  factors such as the state of the  economy,  the\r\n\r\nemployment situation, the affordability of the  commuters\r\n\r\nand the viability of the public transport operators;\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, before you proceed, can I ask\r\n\r\nDr  Tan  Boon Wan whether he accepts the reversal of  the\r\n\r\nwords \"affordability\" and \"viability\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you now move your amendment, Dr\r\n\r\nTan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I beg to move an amendment\r\n\r\nto item (3) of the amendment moved by Dr Tan Boon Wan, as\r\n\r\nfollows:   In Item (3), line 3, after the word  \"as\",  to\r\n\r\ninsert  the  words,  \"the  state  of  the  economy,   the\r\n\r\nemployment situation,\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Members will support this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed by Dr Tan Cheng\r\n\r\nBock,  as an amendment to the original amendments,  after\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"as\", to insert the words, \"the state  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy, the employment situation,\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the debate on the original amendments\r\n\r\nand the amendment to the original amendments be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  simultaneously.

I promise  Members  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  take too long, but I think Dr Tan Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\ncould  not  have put forward the reasons for  moving  his\r\n\r\namendment more eloquently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not repeat what he has said, but I would like\r\n\r\nto say, after listening to the Members who have spoken on\r\n\r\nDr  Tan Boon Wan's amendment, that it is important for us\r\n\r\nto  focus  on the process of decision making by the  PTC.\r\n\r\nAfter  listening to the response of Mr Yeo Cheow Tong,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  concern has been addressed,  especially\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to the question of timing.  The  sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  in this House in the last two days  have  been\r\n\r\nthat the timing was perhaps a bit off.  And when we spoke\r\n\r\nof  timing,  we  were  referring to  the  very  difficult\r\n\r\neconomic  situation that confronts the  country  and  our\r\n\r\npeople.   We were also very concerned with the fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  were so many people who were out of job.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  addition  of the words put in by Dr Tan  Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\ndoes address the concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, therefore, go along with the amendment moved\r\n\r\nby  Dr Tan.  I hope the House will agree, and we can then\r\n\r\nproceed with the debate on the amended Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  speak on the amended Motion.  Sir,  I  rise  to\r\n\r\noppose both amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, when I spoke on the Motion in the House,\r\n\r\nI pointed out that the crux of the issue on the increases\r\n\r\nin  public transport fares and other increases in  public\r\n\r\nservices is the result of the attitude and policy of  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government  in providing public services.   Although\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Transport has explained the rationale, I\r\n\r\nam still not convinced that this is the best model.  With\r\n\r\na   nationalised  organisation  to  run   the   transport\r\n\r\nservices,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI believe that it may be more efficient with economies of\r\n\r\nscale, and we remove the profit factor, which I think  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why a lot of people feel uncomfortable  that\r\n\r\nthe  operators of public transportation should be  making\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the Public Transport Council has\r\n\r\nbecome a lightning rod in this debate.  Although I do not\r\n\r\nentirely agree with the original Motion moved by  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nSoo  Khoon,  I am prepared to be counted to  support  the\r\n\r\nMotion in its original form, to urge the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  review its decision on the increases.   With\r\n\r\nthe  PAP Backbenchers moving the Motion, helping to  play\r\n\r\nthe  role of the Opposition, I suppose they are qualified\r\n\r\nto  join  the  Opposition, as the  Member  for  Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nCentral  said.  I hope that it would help to provide  the\r\n\r\nMotion,   with  more  muscle  and  bite,  to  force   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do something, and to lower  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving for Singaporeans at this difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now it seems that my expectation is a bit too\r\n\r\nhigh.   Dr  Tan  Boon  Wan's proposed  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\noriginal  Motion  not  only  watered  down  the  original\r\n\r\namendment,  but  has the effect of asking  the  House  to\r\n\r\nsupport the current increases of public transport  fares,\r\n\r\nby  noting the Prime Minister's support for the principle\r\n\r\nof the Public Transport Council granting small increases.\r\n\r\nSo he has, in fact, changed the intention of the original\r\n\r\nMotion.   Although  Dr Tan Cheng Bock has  moved  another\r\n\r\namendment   to   the   amended  Motion   to   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration the economic and employment situation,  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains that the amended Motion would  endorse  the\r\n\r\nPTC's approval for the increases.  This would endorse the\r\n\r\nincreases in public transportation fares, which  was  not\r\n\r\nthe original intention of the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not support the amended Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when I saw the glass of water appearing\r\n\r\non  the table for the Minister, I realised that he  would\r\n\r\nhave a lot to speak.  So, after he had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspoken, I thought many people would leave the Chamber and\r\n\r\ngo  to the toilet, but my guess was wrong.  Minister  Yeo\r\n\r\nhas  given us a lot of explanations and figures, and  has\r\n\r\nalso   solved   many  of  our  puzzles.   Actually,   the\r\n\r\natmosphere is now more relaxed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak immediately after the Minister has spoken\r\n\r\nis  a  real  challenge.  I have thrown away  my  original\r\n\r\nscript.   Honestly speaking, I do not know what to  speak\r\n\r\nabout now.  So, I will take this opportunity to convey  a\r\n\r\nmessage to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the people's perception of the Government\r\n\r\nis  very  important.  The people should not misunderstand\r\n\r\nthe  concept  and intent of Government's policy.   As  we\r\n\r\nknow, the generation gap between parents and children  is\r\n\r\na  result  of  misconception and, recently, there  was  a\r\n\r\ndocumentary  on  the  famous  celebrity  Disc  Jockey  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan,  Billy.   His father was a military  officer  and\r\n\r\nfrom young, he was frequently punished by his parents. As\r\n\r\na  form  of  protest, he did a lot of mischievous  things\r\n\r\nagainst  the  family.  The gap was very wide between  him\r\n\r\nand  his parents.  It was only when he was suddenly taken\r\n\r\nill  and  his parents took great pains to look after  him\r\n\r\nthat he realised how much his parents had loved and cared\r\n\r\nfor  him.  He began to realise that his perceived feeling\r\n\r\nthat his parents did not love him was wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we should not allow such misconception between\r\n\r\nthe people and the Government to exist.  I do not wish to\r\n\r\nsee our people do something just to spite the Government.\r\n\r\nLike  what Minister Yeo and the Senior Minister of  State\r\n\r\nMr  Khaw Boon Wan have said, in this round of fare hikes,\r\n\r\nthere  is a lot of misconception among the people.   Have\r\n\r\nthere been some shortcomings in the form of communication\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government and the people?  Just  now,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said that the PTC needs to do something  to\r\n\r\nimprove its communications with the people, and he  urged\r\n\r\nthe  Council to work harder.  I am very glad by  what  he\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government's rule of Singapore has brought\r\n\r\nprosperity   to   Singapore.   Its   farsightedness   and\r\n\r\nefficiency  are  well  known  to  everybody.    But   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's style of \"more work, less talk\", \"more deed,\r\n\r\nless speech\" has created some misunderstanding among  the\r\n\r\npeople, and people have some grouses against it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend Minister Yeo and SMS Khaw for\r\n\r\ntaking  great pains to explain the policies.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  very good.  I suggest that all the public departments\r\n\r\nand  institutions should increase their transparency, and\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  also  review   its   style   of\r\n\r\ncommunication and connection with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I wanted to reflect the sentiments of the\r\n\r\npeople  but,  at  this point of time, I think  it  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger necessary, and I do not want to waste the time  of\r\n\r\neverybody here in this House.  But allow me to raise just\r\n\r\ntwo points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Member of the Tanjong Pagar GRC. As we know,\r\n\r\nthere are quite a lot of senior citizens in Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nGRC.   In my recent visits to the residents, many of them\r\n\r\ncomplained  to  me that the bus and MRT fare  hikes  were\r\n\r\nmaking  life difficult for them. Why do we not give  some\r\n\r\nspecial  consideration  to these  people,  some  form  of\r\n\r\nconcessions   for  these  senior  citizens?    They   had\r\n\r\ncontributed much to our nation  in their younger days.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Government  should  let  all  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore know that in making improvements to our  public\r\n\r\ntransport system, we should also look into the welfare of\r\n\r\nour  people.   In  this  way,  we  can  make  the  people\r\n\r\nappreciate  that the Government and the people are on the\r\n\r\nsame side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that, in future, the Government will\r\n\r\nmake  more efforts to explain its policies to the people,\r\n\r\nto  show  its  care and concern for the people.   A  good\r\n\r\ngovernment  would not only lead our country to  a  higher\r\n\r\nlevel  in  its economic development, it should also  have\r\n\r\ngreater care and concern for the people.  I think this is\r\n\r\nwhat Singapore would want in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Hon. Minister for Transport's  speech\r\n\r\nand  the facts and figures stated therein are appreciated\r\n\r\nand   noted.    I   can  only  hope  that,   in   future,\r\n\r\nparliamentarians will have all or most of these facts and\r\n\r\nfigures  in  advance.   Perhaps, the relevant  Ministries\r\n\r\ncould  give parliamentarians summaries of what are  given\r\n\r\nto  Ministers  or  Ministers  of  State  for  better  and\r\n\r\ninformed  debates in Parliament, and for parliamentarians\r\n\r\nto  reflect  on  what  is given  to  them,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding  within Parliament would  be  of  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard, and misunderstanding or misinformation would be\r\n\r\nminimal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, what is the issue before this House?\r\n\r\nFor  that, I would like to state that the primary purpose\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  providing public transportation  for\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  people residing in Singapore  is  for  the\r\n\r\ncommuters  to  have easy access from one  destination  to\r\n\r\nanother, with speed and as cheaply as possible. All other\r\n\r\nperks are not mandatory, and are discretionary in nature.\r\n\r\nTo  make  this  possible, ie, relatively  an  inexpensive\r\n\r\nmeans  of  transport, there must be emphasis on avoidance\r\n\r\nof  luxuries,  and to provide just the basic necessities.\r\n\r\nIn  adopting  this  method,  there  will  be  a  relative\r\n\r\nreduction of the cost of running buses and the MRT.   The\r\n\r\nissue  is not whether bus and MRT fares should or  should\r\n\r\nnot  be increased.  As costs increase, bus and MRT  fares\r\n\r\nwould  inevitably increase.  The issue in this  House  is\r\n\r\nwhether  fares  should  be increased  now,  in  times  of\r\n\r\nhardship and recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, as a point of order,\r\n\r\nI  hope your speech is leading to the amendments that  we\r\n\r\nare dealing with now, and not a general speech about fare\r\n\r\nincreases,  because we are dealing with  amendments  now.\r\n\r\nCould you confine your speech to the amendments, or  your\r\n\r\nspeech leading to the amendments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> I would support the\r\n\r\namendments, but with these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nobservations in mind.  Can these transportation companies\r\n\r\nand  entities  hold on until next year  when,  hopefully,\r\n\r\nthere  will be better times?  If my speech would lead  to\r\n\r\nsomething that is not relevant to the amended motion,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  will stop here.  But  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\namendments are concerned, I would support what  has  been\r\n\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we read in the newspapers how  our  people\r\n\r\nhave been queuing up for the National Day Parade tickets.\r\n\r\nThis  is a sign of patriotism.  We read also about people\r\n\r\nqueuing  up  for an HDB flat, and this is  to  get  their\r\n\r\nmoney's worth. Now, we have Members of Parliament queuing\r\n\r\nup  to  speak  on this motion concerning fare  increases.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to reflect the feelings and sentiments  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I believe, on this occasion, we have the highest\r\n\r\nnumber of MPs speaking in this House on one single issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock that this round of\r\n\r\nfare  increase  has  a  great impact  on  the  unemployed\r\n\r\npeople.  Many  MPs have elaborated on why fare  increases\r\n\r\nshould  not be implemented now. The Minister's  reply  is\r\n\r\nthat if we want to have a better public transport system,\r\n\r\nwe  must  be  prepared  to pay more.  We  know  that  the\r\n\r\nrationale for the fare increase, but there are more  than\r\n\r\n5.5%  of the workforce or 120,000 people who are  out  of\r\n\r\njob  now. Taking four persons to a family, we are looking\r\n\r\nat  500,000 people who are not having any income and  are\r\n\r\nprobably  making  every effort to  look  for  jobs.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  walk  all  the way, and surely cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\ntravel  by  taxi.  So,  the  most  appropriate  mode   of\r\n\r\ntransport would be by bus or MRT.  Although the  increase\r\n\r\nis  only 3 to 10 cents per trip, it adds up when you have\r\n\r\nmade several trips in a day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether we like it or not, the price hike\r\n\r\nis   already   implemented.  It  is  a   fait   accompli.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I hope that the relevant authority would do\r\n\r\nsomething  for these people who are affected.  Could  PTC\r\n\r\nimplement some sort of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrebates  to  these people? The bus operators  can  surely\r\n\r\nafford  them as they are making huge profits. The  launch\r\n\r\nof  the ez-link card system has enabled the bus companies\r\n\r\nto  collect  huge  sums of money as pre-payment  for  the\r\n\r\nfares, and these would generate huge cash flows for  them\r\n\r\nto  run  their  business. They would not need  to  borrow\r\n\r\nmoney from the banks. Furthermore, with the reduction  in\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax rate, they should pass on this benefit  to\r\n\r\nthe commuters.  Perhaps, the bus companies would consider\r\n\r\ngiving a rebate of, say, 3% for those who purchase an ez-link card worth $50, and 5% for a $100 card.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that in this round of fare increase,\r\n\r\nthose  who  are paying by cash have to face  higher  fare\r\n\r\nincrease. This is not fair. The poorer senior citizens do\r\n\r\nnot  buy the ez-link cards simply because they could  not\r\n\r\nafford to make the up-front payment.  Some do not use  it\r\n\r\nbecause they are old and do not know how to use  it.   We\r\n\r\nshould educate them and help them to get used to it. They\r\n\r\nshould not be penalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amended motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for giving\r\n\r\nme  this  opportunity  to speak on the  amendment  to  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock's amendment. I think\r\n\r\nit  strengthens  my  amendment with  the  additional  two\r\n\r\nfactors.   I  would also like to reply  to  Mr  Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang's  observation  that I have diluted  the  original\r\n\r\nMotion.   The  purpose  is  not to  dilute  the  original\r\n\r\nMotion.   I  see  the  purpose  of  this  Motion  as   an\r\n\r\nopportunity for MPs to reflect the feedback they get from\r\n\r\nthe  ground, their concern about the increase  in  fares,\r\n\r\nthe economy, and so forth. In the discussion that we have\r\n\r\nheard  these  two days, this purpose has  been  achieved.\r\n\r\nMPs  have  very  frankly expressed the concern  of  their\r\n\r\nresidents  and  how they feel. Therefore, my  purpose  of\r\n\r\nmoving the amendment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  to  protect  our  institutions because  we  must  not\r\n\r\ninadvertently,  in  asking for  a  review,  question  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of the PTC, and inadvertently also dilute  all\r\n\r\nother  institutions that Parliament has set up.  And,  in\r\n\r\nthe   process,   it  also  questions  the  integrity   of\r\n\r\nParliament.   As  Mr  Iswaran  has  said,  if  we   start\r\n\r\nquestioning our ability to make good decisions and  start\r\n\r\nreversing   the  decisions  that  we  make,  what   would\r\n\r\ninternational investors, who come to Singapore think, ie,\r\n\r\nthe decisions we make in Parliament will not stand up  to\r\n\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I just want to seek a point\r\n\r\nof   clarification  from  the  Minister.
