It always saddens me  to\r\n\r\ngo past a school specifically run for a particular\r\n\r\nethnic  group.  What better way can  one  have  of\r\n\r\nisolating  one  race  from  another  than  by  the\r\n\r\npresence  of such schools? Is it not more  logical\r\n\r\nin  terms of nation-building to have every  school\r\n\r\nopen  its  door  to  our children  of  all  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups? Then these young citizens will grow up  to\r\n\r\nknow,  respect and assimilate each other's way  of\r\n\r\nlife and thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please do not think that my\r\n\r\nsuggestion means that the abolition of any one  of\r\n\r\nour  four languages will be in sight. In fact,  my\r\n\r\nown feeling is that all our children can still  be\r\n\r\nsbrought  up  to become at least bilingual  school-leavers  as  they  can  still  study  mathematics,\r\n\r\nscience  and technology in the medium  of  English\r\n\r\nand  the  humanities  through  one  of  the  other\r\n\r\nlanguages.  I  realise that this  integration  may\r\n\r\ntake a bug time to implement, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknowing the efficiency and dedication of the staff\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Education -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> - any such difficulty\r\n\r\nencountered will be overcome. I would,  therefore,\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest to the Minister for Education  to\r\n\r\ngive  my  idea some consideration and to adopt  it\r\n\r\nfor all ethnic schools in the course of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having dealt with children in\r\n\r\nethnic  schools, I would like to say that I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the proposal that greater emphasis on sports\r\n\r\nshould be given by the Ministry of Social Affairs.\r\n\r\nHowever, I note with some disturbance the  neglect\r\n\r\nof one of the most popular forms of sports in this\r\n\r\ncountry, namely, badminton. Not so many years ago,\r\n\r\nwe in Singapore could boast of a number of leading\r\n\r\nworld badminton players, but today we cannot  even\r\n\r\nfind  a  youngster in our midst who can be  ranked\r\n\r\namong  the first ten leading badminton players  in\r\n\r\nthe world. We have ample talents in Singapore, but\r\n\r\nwe  do not provide suitable facilities for them to\r\n\r\ndevelop and grow. The few indoor badminton  courts\r\n\r\navailable  are so humid and torrid that no  amount\r\n\r\nof  practice  among the players can improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard,  as they are exhausted long before  they\r\n\r\ncan  bring  out  their  very  best  in  the  game.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I do hope that the organisers  of  and\r\n\r\nplanners  for the National Sports Stadium  Complex\r\n\r\nwill  bear  in mind that badminton is one  of  the\r\n\r\nvery  few  sports that can produce  for  us  world\r\n\r\nchampions.  It  is  obvious to  me  that  an  air-conditioned badminton stadium must be included  in\r\n\r\nthis  sports complex. I will not accept the excuse\r\n\r\nthat  such a stadium will cost too much money.  If\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to  spend $50  million,  an  extra\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  another  million  dollars  or  so\r\n\r\nshould  not prevent the building of such  an  air-conditioned badminton stadium. I would  also  like\r\n\r\nto  point out that such a stadium can earn  money,\r\n\r\nbecause  when  it  is  used as  a  venue  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining of players and for international\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbadminton tournaments, money can be collected  for\r\n\r\nthe use of such a stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to make a few\r\n\r\ncomments  on  the  widening of the  main  arterial\r\n\r\nroads and the development of dual carriageways.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  the  House will agree with me  that  the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department has done an excellent  job\r\n\r\non these roads and everyone who uses them can have\r\n\r\nnothing  but  a  lot  of  praise  for  the  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not too happy to see these beautiful\r\n\r\nhighways   cluttered  up  with  rows   of   parked\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Such  a  display  of  lack   of   civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness can easily be seen in Queenstown  or\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  surely  it  is  time  that  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nMinister  should  see to it that  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nwidening our main arterial roads is not to provide\r\n\r\nparking bays for cars and lorries for some of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, but for the smoother and safer  flow  of\r\n\r\nthe ever-increasing traffic on our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to make\r\n\r\nsome remarks on off-shore fishing. I feel that the\r\n\r\nencouragement   of  off-shore  fishing   is   very\r\n\r\ncommendable,  but  I  wish that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development will  see  to  it  that  the\r\n\r\nowners  of  abandoned  kelongs  be  legislated  to\r\n\r\nremove   stakes  and  dismantle  structures   from\r\n\r\ndiscarded   kelongs.  We  want  to  beautify   our\r\n\r\nislands,  but  the presence of such unsightly  and\r\n\r\ndangerous   stakes  surely  spoils  the  off-shore\r\n\r\nsilhouette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech  has  ushered  in   the   most\r\n\r\ndifficult  period in the history of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nthe years ahead, much has to be done to offset the\r\n\r\nside effects of the complete withdrawal of British\r\n\r\nforces   from  this  region.  Never   before   has\r\n\r\nSingapore  been  in this kind of  situation  where\r\n\r\neverything is left to herself. One would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimagine  that the three years and eight months  of\r\n\r\nJapanese  occupation  would  have  been  the  most\r\n\r\nbitter times for Singapore, but, if Singapore  had\r\n\r\nnever  been recovered from the Japanese, we  would\r\n\r\nnot have lost anything, for Singapore was then not\r\n\r\nours and defence then was not our business at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 20 years ago, when the question was asked,\r\n\r\n\"Which  country  in  South-east  Asia  will   turn\r\n\r\nCommunist  first?\", the answer  was,  \"Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty  years  later, the same question  is  asked\r\n\r\nagain, \"Which country will go Communist?\", and the\r\n\r\nanswer is still, \"Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this must be the case with all the years of\r\n\r\nhard  work put in by our people. We cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto lose Singapore, for this is our country and our\r\n\r\nstake  is  in it. Few countries in Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\ncan claim a higher living standard than Singapore.\r\n\r\nOur social and medical services and public housing\r\n\r\nare  second  to  none. Our progress  can  also  be\r\n\r\nachieved by other neighbouring countries. What  we\r\n\r\nlack is land, but, on the other hand, the kind  of\r\n\r\nleadership  which is the propelling force  of  our\r\n\r\nadvance  and progress cannot be readily  found  in\r\n\r\nother  countries. As I have said earlier, what  we\r\n\r\nhave  achieved  here  can  be  achieved  by  other\r\n\r\ncountries  if  only  they can produce  from  among\r\n\r\ntheir   millions  of  people,  a  hard   core   of\r\n\r\ndedicated,   clear-thinking,   incorruptible   and\r\n\r\ndynamic  individuals  whom  we  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ncompelled to choose from only two million  people,\r\n\r\nyoung and old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many advantages here: a good harbour, a\r\n\r\ngood geographical position, a practical population\r\n\r\nand  an experienced business community. All  these\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding,   Singapore  must   survive   and\r\n\r\nprosper along with other countries in this region.\r\n\r\nTo  believe that Singapore can survive on its own,\r\n\r\ntotally  disregarding others  in  the  region,  is\r\n\r\nnaive.  For  the  survival and prosperity  of  the\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian countries, regionalism appears  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  only solution. We believe that nobody  is\r\n\r\ndependent on himself alone but everybody is inter-dependent on one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my conviction that whatever\r\n\r\narrangement  Singapore enters  into  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture, whether an economic alliance or a regional\r\n\r\ndefence  system, we must present  ourselves  as  a\r\n\r\ncredible and contributing partner. We have come  a\r\n\r\nlong  way  from the Colombo Plan, from a recipient\r\n\r\nnation to a donor nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President, at the outset of\r\n\r\nhis  speech,  has  pointed  out  that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nproblems  in  the next 10 years would be  external\r\n\r\nrather  than internal. I hope that by the  end  of\r\n\r\n1971,   a   credible  defence  arrangement   could\r\n\r\nmaterialise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has made history not only in the field\r\n\r\nof  human  endeavour, but also in the  history  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic    constitutional   government.    This\r\n\r\nParliament  will experience very difficult  times.\r\n\r\nWe  are in a unique position where, in spite of so\r\n\r\nmany  formidable  problems  facing  us,  effective\r\n\r\nsolutions  to them will not be found wanting.  The\r\n\r\npeople do not seem to show any lack of confidence.\r\n\r\nThe  result  of this is an all-P.A.P.  Parliament.\r\n\r\nYet  we  should  have no cause for complacency.  I\r\n\r\nwish to point out that the absence of an effective\r\n\r\nOpposition  in  this Chamber does not  necessarily\r\n\r\nmean  that  we have one hundred per cent  support.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, as the Prime Minister put it  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech upon your election as Speaker, if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis had decided to participate in the\r\n\r\nlast  General  Election, they would  have  secured\r\n\r\nabout six to eight seats in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the folly of the Opposition that led\r\n\r\nto  the  present situation of the  absence  of  an\r\n\r\nOpposition. But the mere wanting of an  Opposition\r\n\r\nin  order  to  fulfil the ideals of  a  democratic\r\n\r\ninstitution  is  not necessarily relevant  in  all\r\n\r\ncases.  There  is nothing wrong in having  an  all\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government if the people decide that  such\r\n\r\nan  arrangement  is to their best advantage.  This\r\n\r\nwill, of course, make our job as Backbenchers more\r\n\r\ndifficult. Not only have we to take on the  duties\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition, but we have also, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, to explain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  people that for the next half decade,  if\r\n\r\nSingapore is to continue to survive and prosper as\r\n\r\na  separate entity in this region, much  sacrifice\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be made. There should be  tolerance\r\n\r\nand    restraint    in   all   quarters,    higher\r\n\r\nproductivity,  and  a more careful  and  practical\r\n\r\nhandling of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that there is no substitute for sheer\r\n\r\nhard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I join my colleagues in\r\n\r\nsupporting the motion standing in the name of  the\r\n\r\nHon.

This important historical document\r\n\r\nwill  serve as a guide to us in sailing along  the\r\n\r\ntroubled waters at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President outlined three objectives in his\r\n\r\nspeech:  namely  the  optimum  use  of  the   time\r\n\r\navailable   to  build  up  an  effective   defence\r\n\r\ncapability;    greater   economic   growth;    and\r\n\r\nenhancement  of  national  consciousness  of   our\r\n\r\nproblems. These three objectives have relation  to\r\n\r\nthe world situation, particularly to the situation\r\n\r\nin   Southeast  Asia  consequent  on  the  earlier\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of the British troops. Of these  three\r\n\r\nobjectives,  the  establishment  of  our   defence\r\n\r\ncapability   is   of   the  first   and   foremost\r\n\r\nimportance.  Of  course, this  will  increase  the\r\n\r\nburden  on our people. Being a very small country,\r\n\r\nSingapore   would  have  to  meet   and   overcome\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  order to  set  up  an  effective\r\n\r\ndefence  capability. Fortunately,  ever  since  we\r\n\r\nleft   Malaysia,  we  have  already   started   to\r\n\r\nencourage our people to undergo military training,\r\n\r\nand  also in his policy speech, the President  has\r\n\r\nclearly  pointed  out that  we  must  set  up  our\r\n\r\ndefence capability at the minimum cost so that our\r\n\r\nfinancial resources will mostly be diverted to our\r\n\r\neconomic  development and industrial growth.  From\r\n\r\nthe   economic  point  of  view,  the  expenditure\r\n\r\ninvolved in setting up a defence capability should\r\n\r\nnever  be  allowed to interfere with our  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  the  process of nation-building.  Both\r\n\r\neconomic  growth and economic development  have  a\r\n\r\ndecisive bearing on our national defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us take the advanced countries\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Germany,  Japan  and  Russia.  They  are\r\n\r\nadvanced countries because of their high degree of\r\n\r\ndevelopment and the economic growth that they have\r\n\r\nhad  as  a  result  of their educational  reforms,\r\n\r\nscientific progress and industrial development. It\r\n\r\nwould be better, of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  to  build  up a national  defence  force,\r\n\r\nafter   having   achieved  social   and   economic\r\n\r\nstability. But judging from the time that we  have\r\n\r\nin  hand and the situation that we are facing,  we\r\n\r\nare  not  so lucky as to be able to enjoy economic\r\n\r\ngrowth   first  before  building  up  our  defence\r\n\r\ncapability. So we must tackle both problems at the\r\n\r\nsame time. We must divert the greater part of  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources into economic development  in\r\n\r\norder to maintain our economic growth at eight per\r\n\r\ncent  or even to raise our economic growth to more\r\n\r\nthan eight per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the three objectives\r\n\r\noutlined  by our President are all geared  towards\r\n\r\nthe  strengthening of our economic growth. We  all\r\n\r\nknow that the economic growth of a country can  be\r\n\r\ndivided  into  two stages. The first  one  is  the\r\n\r\nstage of germination and the second is the process\r\n\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in our country we are happy that we\r\n\r\nhave  reached  the second stage. We  have  already\r\n\r\ncompleted  the  first  stage of  germination.  The\r\n\r\ngeneral   technical   preliminaries   have    been\r\n\r\ncompleted   and  we  already  have  a  substantial\r\n\r\neconomic   and   financial  capability   and   the\r\n\r\ntechnical  know-how.  So in this  respect  we  are\r\n\r\nahead  of  the backward countries and  some  other\r\n\r\ndeveloping   countries.   In   addition   to   the\r\n\r\nquantitative  progress that we have already  made,\r\n\r\nwe must also have qualitative advancement in order\r\n\r\nto  speed up our economic growth and build up  our\r\n\r\nnational  strength,  because  we  all  know   that\r\n\r\neconomic  growth consists of quantitative progress\r\n\r\nas well as qualitative advancement. Both these two\r\n\r\nchanges  will cause a chain reaction in the  whole\r\n\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic growth is not so simple to achieve\r\n\r\nas  one  would imagine, because it does  not  only\r\n\r\ninvolve capital or technical know-how. The fact is\r\n\r\nthat other factors also have a bearing on speeding\r\n\r\nup  our  economic  growth. These  factors  include\r\n\r\nreligion,   culture,   education,   customs    and\r\n\r\ntraditions, etc.. In this respect, I  am  glad  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  a. Cabinet Committee has already  been\r\n\r\nset up with the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas Chairman, the Minister for Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology, the Minister for Finance and the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour as members in order to carry\r\n\r\nout the reorganisation in our educational system\r\n\r\nso that we will be able to train the technical\r\n\r\npersonnel that we require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, human resources are very important in\r\n\r\npromoting  economic  growth and industrialisation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the re-organisation in  the  secondary\r\n\r\neducation   system  will,  in   the   history   of\r\n\r\neducation,  become a turning point  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I believe you will agree with me that\r\n\r\nour  country lacks natural resources to assist  us\r\n\r\nin   our   economic  development.  But   we   have\r\n\r\ninexhaustible  human resources.  These  resources,\r\n\r\nwith  hard  work  and diligence,  can  earn  extra\r\n\r\nincome  for our country. So the question  is,  how\r\n\r\nare  we  to make full use of these valuable  human\r\n\r\nresources and to ensure that there is no  wastage?\r\n\r\nThe  answer  lies  in  the reorganisation  of  our\r\n\r\nsecondary education system. We want to ensure that\r\n\r\nevery secondary school-leaver will be able to make\r\n\r\nuse of what he has learnt to contribute to nation-building and that all young graduates of secondary\r\n\r\nschools  will  have  had some form  of  vocational\r\n\r\ntraining  when  they leave school.  In  the  past,\r\n\r\npeople  said  that graduation meant  unemployment.\r\n\r\nNow with the completion of the re-organisation  of\r\n\r\nour  secondary education system, we can  say  that\r\n\r\ngraduation can mean employment. This will  be  the\r\n\r\nultimate  objective of the reorganisation  of  our\r\n\r\nsecondary education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other aspect of the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of our secondary education  system\r\n\r\nis   that   we   can   increase   the   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities of our young school-beavers  because\r\n\r\nthey  will  have had some vocational and technical\r\n\r\ntraining when they leave school. When they take up\r\n\r\ntheir jobs, they will be able to make use of  what\r\n\r\nthey  have  learnt  and  carry  out  their  duties\r\n\r\neffectively.  At  least, after the reorganisation,\r\n\r\nschool-leavers  will be able to  leave  school  as\r\n\r\njunior  technicians  and  directly  take  part  in\r\n\r\nproductive   activities.  This   would   be   more\r\n\r\npractical  as  compared  to  the  present   system\r\n\r\nwhereby they receive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical training only after they have taken up a\r\n\r\njob.  Therefore, reorganisation in  our  secondary\r\n\r\neducation  system,  economically  speaking,   will\r\n\r\nproduce  these results: firstly, to  increase  the\r\n\r\nemployment    opportunities   of   school-beavers;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  to  ensure that all our nationals  will\r\n\r\nhave  some  form of skill to enable them  to  take\r\n\r\npart in productive activities; thirdly, to cut out\r\n\r\nthe  gap between productivity and the commencement\r\n\r\nof  employment; fourthly, to ensure that there  is\r\n\r\nno  wastage  in our human resources;  fifthly,  to\r\n\r\nturn   our  school-leavers  from  consumers   into\r\n\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Singapore is situated in a\r\n\r\nturbulent  area of Southeast Asia. Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nhas  all along been the centre of attention of the\r\n\r\nworld.  This is not because this area is rich  and\r\n\r\nstrong,  but  because it has been  recognised  and\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  one of the weakest  areas  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It has been looked upon as a region  which\r\n\r\nis not able to mobilise its political and economic\r\n\r\nresources to bargain with the super powers  on  an\r\n\r\nequal footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country with a reputation of having a high\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living and with a harmonious  multi-racial  society and a non-aligned foreign  policy,\r\n\r\nwe,  in  Singapore, have the duty  to  help  other\r\n\r\ncountries  in  Southeast Asia to  transform  their\r\n\r\npresent  pitiful state into modern  societies.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  we  can  also  exercise  a  very\r\n\r\ndecisive  influence  in  stabilising  the  present\r\n\r\nturbulent situation in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future of Southeast Asia in the next\r\n\r\nfew  years? Will it be able to gain a greater  say\r\n\r\nin   international  affairs  and  take  a   strong\r\n\r\nposition in their relationship vis-a-vis the super\r\n\r\npowers? So, if we are to restore the stability and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of this region, it is vitally  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  countries  in  Southeast Asia  to  put  their\r\n\r\nhouses  in  order and to be self-reliant.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Foreign Affairs has said, there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  approaches to the solution of  this  problem.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  must  secure  greater  regional  co-operation.  Secondly, every  nation  in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia must make greater efforts in modernising  its\r\n\r\nsociety and its infrastructure. As to the first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach, we have set an example by achieving  co-operation in the economic field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his recent broadcast\r\n\r\nmentioned  the promotion of the tourist trade  and\r\n\r\nour  co-operation with Indonesia to  develop  Bali\r\n\r\nIsland  as  a tourist spot so as to derive  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit for Singapore and Indonesia. We have  even\r\n\r\nsent a mission to Indonesia to go into the details\r\n\r\nof  this  scheme, namely, to investigate potential\r\n\r\nin  Bali  Island in order to promote  the  tourist\r\n\r\ntrade in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, we can also carry out\r\n\r\nregional co-operation in industry, agriculture and\r\n\r\nother fields through A.S.E.A.N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to modernisation, the Government has\r\n\r\nachieved  significant progress. In the President's\r\n\r\nSpeech,  it  is revealed that the Ministries  will\r\n\r\nmake  an  overall greater effort to modernise  our\r\n\r\nRepublic. This shows that we are adopting  a  very\r\n\r\npositive  approach to modernise our society.  This\r\n\r\nis highly commendable and deserves our applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of our unrelenting\r\n\r\nefforts in the past five years to promote economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  Singapore  has  been  able,  among  other\r\n\r\nthings,  to achieve a good reputation as an  ideal\r\n\r\nplace for foreign investment. Let me quote from an\r\n\r\nofficial  study entitled \"Comparative  Grading  on\r\n\r\nthe Selection of Eight Asian Cities for Setting Up\r\n\r\nRegional   Centres.\"  This  document  shows   that\r\n\r\nSingapore   has  been  selected  by  international\r\n\r\nenterprises and entrepreneurs as a good  place  to\r\n\r\nset  up their trading and industrial centres.  The\r\n\r\neight Asian cities are Bangkok, Hong Kong, Manila,\r\n\r\nSydney,   Naha,   Taipei,  Tokyo  and   Singapore.\r\n\r\nCompared  with these cities, Singapore  is  second\r\n\r\nonly  to Hong Kong in the advantages provided  for\r\n\r\nforeign investors. In the selection of cities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  investment, economic conditions, geographic\r\n\r\nposition, communications, transportation, currency\r\n\r\nstability,  banking  services, education,  health,\r\n\r\nstandard of living and political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstability,  etc, come  into  consideration.   And\r\n\r\nSingapore has fully met their demands. The scoring\r\n\r\nfor  every  condition ranges  from  zero  to  five\r\n\r\npoints  and  Singapore has been able to  score  94\r\n\r\npoints,  which is second only to Hong  Kong  which\r\n\r\nscores  97  points.  Thus, we  are  positive  that\r\n\r\ninternational  traders have  every  confidence  in\r\n\r\nselecting  Singapore  for  their  commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprises. If we can  modernise  and\r\n\r\nprovide better facilities and services, it will be\r\n\r\na  question  of  time before we become  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to increase\r\n\r\nproductivity, promote industrial growth and  speed\r\n\r\nup  our economic growth, it is necessary to review\r\n\r\nand amend the existing Labour Ordinance, 1955, the\r\n\r\nShop Assistants Employment Ordinance, 1957 and the\r\n\r\nClerks Employment Ordinance, 1957. The purpose  is\r\n\r\nto keep abreast with new changing situations. This\r\n\r\nreview  will  create more employment opportunities\r\n\r\nand  will  solve,  to  some  extent,  our  present\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. From the economic  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  developing  countries are  generally  faced\r\n\r\nwith  the problem of unemployment and the  raising\r\n\r\nof  the standard of living of their people. If  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  raise  the standard  of  living  of  our\r\n\r\npeople, we must, first of all, resolve the problem\r\n\r\nof    unemployment.   Therefore,   I    think    a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  labour  law  introduced   at   this\r\n\r\njuncture  is  in  keeping with  the  need  of  the\r\n\r\npresent development of our country. All economists\r\n\r\nknow  that  if  many  people are  unemployed,  the\r\n\r\npurchasing power of the average national  of  that\r\n\r\nsociety    will    be   lowered   correspondingly.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the main solution to the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem  is  to raise the living standard  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   and  set  up  a  more  balanced  national\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  diversification  of  our   economy\r\n\r\ncarried  out at present is the most effective  way\r\n\r\nof  increasing  employment opportunities  and  the\r\n\r\nnational  income. As the Member for  Nee  Soon,  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the introduction of comprehensive  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation proposed in the President's Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our country is small, but our\r\n\r\ncitizens realise their duties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially when they are faced with decisive years\r\n\r\nahead. Two-thirds of our population are youths. If\r\n\r\nwe  can  provide  them  with effective  and  well-planned  training, they will be  able  to  make  a\r\n\r\nuseful  contribution to our country. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nstress  the importance of reforming our  secondary\r\n\r\neducation  system. At the same time, I express  my\r\n\r\nfull  support  for  the suggested  reform  of  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  education system, as contained  in  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech, which will enable our  school-beavers  to  become  producers  instead  of   mere\r\n\r\nconsumers.  This  point is very important,  as  it\r\n\r\nwill  have a decisive effect on the future of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me sum up what I have said\r\n\r\nin  this  House.  For the sake  of  the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the Republic of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  our  younger generations  to  come,  I\r\n\r\nwelcome and support the policy speech delivered by\r\n\r\nthe President. At the same time, I will do my best\r\n\r\nduring  my  term of office to help in  the  smooth\r\n\r\nimplementation of the Government's policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I express my support for the motion\r\n\r\nmoved by the Prime Minister thanking the President\r\n\r\nfor his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P, won a complete victory at the\r\n\r\nrecent   general  elections  because  the   people\r\n\r\nsupported us. Thus we shall once more do our  best\r\n\r\nto  serve the country. Although there is only  one\r\n\r\nparty  in  this Parliament, we are not  dictators.\r\n\r\nApart   from   the  Ministers  and   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries, there are other Members in this House\r\n\r\nwhose  duty  it is to make constructive criticisms\r\n\r\nof Government's measures and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think some regulations relating\r\n\r\nto  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development should be changed\r\n\r\nbecause  of  certain incidents  which  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace. Recently, in the Tiong Bahru area, a coffee-shop  owner committed suicide by jumping down from\r\n\r\nhis flat because he had allowed his premises to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  used  as  a  gambling  place.  I  suppose  the\r\n\r\nregulations  of the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nhave    been    inherited   from   the    previous\r\n\r\nadministration, and not drafted by the P.A.P., and\r\n\r\nthey  have caused difficulties. I hope that  these\r\n\r\nregulations will be amended to avoid difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the present Government is going\r\n\r\nto  introduce  pools gambling in addition  to  the\r\n\r\npresent   Singapore  Sweepstake,   and   yet   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not allow ordinary  citizens  to\r\n\r\ngamble in a small way in coffee-shops! Is this not\r\n\r\na  contradiction? On the one hand, the  Government\r\n\r\nallows big sweeps to be run in Singapore and wants\r\n\r\nto introduce a new form of pools gambling, but, on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, it prohibits the small  man  from\r\n\r\ngambling  in  a  small way. I hope the  Government\r\n\r\nwill change these regulations and stop this unfair\r\n\r\ntreatment.  The regulations should be  revised  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  way that first offenders would be  warned\r\n\r\nand  second offenders would be fined without being\r\n\r\nevicted from Board premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the sale of flats. Those unable\r\n\r\nto  buy flats under the home ownership scheme will\r\n\r\nbe  asked  to  move to Toa Payoh,  and  this  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  cause hardship to them. Of course,  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  behind  this scheme  is  good,  but  if\r\n\r\npeople have no money to buy their own flats, it is\r\n\r\nnot  proper  to  evict  them.  The  Minister  must\r\n\r\ninvestigate  such cases and find out whether  this\r\n\r\npolicy of evicting tenants because they cannot buy\r\n\r\nthe  flats  they  live in is in keeping  with  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialist  principles.  We  must  look\r\n\r\nafter the interest of the poor people. We must not\r\n\r\nthink too much of those people who have money.  We\r\n\r\nmust equally pay attention to those people without\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards transportation, all the bus companies\r\n\r\nshould  be  nationalised. Then there  will  be  an\r\n\r\noverall  improvement in our public transportation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Minister for Communications  is\r\n\r\nnot here. Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see today that\r\n\r\npeople  are suffering great inconvenience  because\r\n\r\nof the poor transport system. Every morning when I\r\n\r\ngo to office, I see a lot of civil servants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  buses.  This is  a  pathetic  sight,\r\n\r\nbecause  they have to waste a lot of time  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  buses to take them to work. They are like  so\r\n\r\nmany  ants, and like ants trapped in a frying pan,\r\n\r\nthey  suffer greatly. So because they cannot board\r\n\r\nthe buses in time for work, they have to travel in\r\n\r\npirate   taxis.  Before  the  bus  companies   are\r\n\r\nnationalised,  we must allow the pirate  taxis  to\r\n\r\nOperate  as  express taxis. We must  not  consider\r\n\r\npirate  taxis as illegal and confiscate them.  The\r\n\r\noperators  of these vehicles have no  money.  They\r\n\r\nhave  to borrow it from finance companies  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  the vehicles. So how can you confiscate their\r\n\r\nvehicles  when they have not fully paid for  them?\r\n\r\nFor  the  time  being, we must allow these  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis to continue to operate as express taxis,  so\r\n\r\nthat  although  they are not allowed  to  pick  up\r\n\r\npassengers  at the bus stops they are  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndischarge passengers at such places. In this  way,\r\n\r\npirate  taxi  operators  will  have  a  means   of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  Instead  of  Government  confiscating\r\n\r\ntheir   vehicles  if  they  have   committed   any\r\n\r\noffences, they should be fined. The point is  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  self-employed  people.  They  are  also\r\n\r\npeople with self-respect. Although they are  poor,\r\n\r\nthey  do  not go to the Social Welfare  Department\r\n\r\nfor  assistance.  They make their  own  living  by\r\n\r\noperating a pirate taxi. So the Government  should\r\n\r\nnot  confiscate  their vehicles  which  are  their\r\n\r\nmeans  of employment. Mr Speaker, in my view,  if\r\n\r\nthe  pirate  taxi  operators  are  arrested,  they\r\n\r\nshould  be fined instead of having their  vehicles\r\n\r\nconfiscated, because they have to borrow money  to\r\n\r\npay for these vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of education, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education will pay attention to what I have to\r\n\r\nsay.  All  the  primary school-leavers  should  be\r\n\r\nposted  to  the  secondary  schools  nearer  their\r\n\r\nhomes.  If the students live to the north  of  the\r\n\r\nbridge in Chinatown, they should be posted to  the\r\n\r\nschools  in  that area instead of  to  schools  in\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu, or Jalan Sungei or some other places.\r\n\r\nIf  a  student in Chinatown is told to go to Jalan\r\n\r\nHwi Yoh, then his posting is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblind posting. He should not be posted to a school\r\n\r\nso  far away from his home. Many students in Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  have  complained to me  about  their  wrong\r\n\r\nposting.  I have written on their behalf  for  re-posting to schools in the Chinatown or Tiong Bahru\r\n\r\narea.  All  students should be posted  to  schools\r\n\r\nnearer  their homes. This is the policy we  should\r\n\r\nbe  implementing. There should be no mistake about\r\n\r\nthis.  But there have been so many wrong postings.\r\n\r\nThis   is   very  exasperating  to   the   parents\r\n\r\nconcerned. I wonder if the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nis  aware of all this. If the principle of posting\r\n\r\nstudents  nearer to their homes is  adopted,  then\r\n\r\nthe parents will not be exasperated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards secondary school-leavers, there are\r\n\r\nmany of them who are unable to find places in  the\r\n\r\nupper  secondary classes. They and  their  parents\r\n\r\nare  very  worried. They are so worried that  they\r\n\r\ncry  because  their parents had  hoped  that  they\r\n\r\nwould   be   able  to  further  their  education.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  points  they  got  in  the   School\r\n\r\nCertificate  Examination  exceeded  21,  there  is\r\n\r\nlatent  talent  in  them. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  some\r\n\r\nchildren  develop their latent talent at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage.  I  shall deal with the question  of  money\r\n\r\nlater on. We must think of these students who have\r\n\r\nfailed  to  gain  places in  the  upper  secondary\r\n\r\nclasses  as  well  as  their  parents.  If   these\r\n\r\nstudents have to leave school half-way, it will be\r\n\r\na   very  sad  thing.  I  hope  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  will have more classes set  up  at  the\r\n\r\nupper secondary level. If he has no more money, he\r\n\r\ncan  come  to this House and try to get some  more\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards health, I believe we should set up\r\n\r\nmore  markets in Singapore. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   for  Health   is   around   here.\r\n\r\n[Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will Members please listen to the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan with the same courtesy  with\r\n\r\nwhich he listens to other Members?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We should set up\r\n\r\nmore markets to accommodate more hawkers. If we do\r\n\r\nnot have enough money to set up more markets, then\r\n\r\nwe can get the people to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvest in the building of markets. I believe there\r\n\r\nare  many  rich  people in our  country  and  they\r\n\r\nshould be invited to invest in the construction of\r\n\r\nmarkets.  They  can  set up limited  companies.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve we require at least 200 markets. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  many  markets we have. Can  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary? We have  less  than  .20\r\n\r\nmarkets now, I understand. We must have at  least.\r\n\r\n200  markets. This is very important. If we do not\r\n\r\nhave  enough markets, then we have to worry  about\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers'  problem. I am the  adviser  to  the\r\n\r\nHawkers'  Association and I am  in  close  contact\r\n\r\nwith them. I am fully aware of their problems.  We\r\n\r\nwant  our State to, be clean, but without  an  ade\r\n\r\nquate  number  of  markets we are  bound  to  have\r\n\r\nhawkers  in the streets. Because of these hawkers,\r\n\r\nwe  will not be able to keep the streets clean. So\r\n\r\nthe  authorities will arrest them and cancel their\r\n\r\nlicences. So we must provide an outlet for hawkers\r\n\r\nto  operate. Give them the markets and  they  will\r\n\r\nnot  come  to the streets. If we try to keep  them\r\n\r\nout   of   the  streets  and  do  not  give   them\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation, it is not fair.  If  we\r\n\r\nbuild  more  markets  to  accommodate  them,   our\r\n\r\nstreets  will be clean. There will be less traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion.  It  is a pity that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On national service, Mr Speaker, the graduates\r\n\r\nof  the universities and the colleges should  have\r\n\r\ntheir  period of national service reduced  by  one\r\n\r\nyear, so that they will be able to contribute more\r\n\r\nto  our nation-building after their graduation. We\r\n\r\nshould  not keep them in the army too long at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  their  parents. I  think  two  years'\r\n\r\nnational  service is too long. It  should  be  cut\r\n\r\ndown  to one year so that these graduates can come\r\n\r\nout into society and do more work for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we must also pay attention to the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a marine college or institute.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has already said that we are going\r\n\r\nto  embark  upon  deep-sea  fishing.  But  without\r\n\r\ntrained  marine personnel we will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nimplement  our scheme in deep-sea fishing.  If  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  marine  institute, we cannot  only  train\r\n\r\nenough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonnel for our own use but we may also be  able\r\n\r\nto  train some of them as captains and masters  to\r\n\r\nserve on foreign ships as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrialisation, do we have a big\r\n\r\nsteel  mill?  We must set up one. We must  welcome\r\n\r\ninvestments in this mill, something like $200,000.\r\n\r\nWe  must  also  have  proper planning  to  run  it\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we should also try to improve our\r\n\r\nforeign  trade  so  that we can  sell  our  local,\r\n\r\nproducts.  We  should  hold trade  expositions  at\r\n\r\nleast  twice  a  year. We must seek  international\r\n\r\nmarkets  for our products, otherwise our factories\r\n\r\nwill  close down. I urge the Minister to note what\r\n\r\nI have said on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the President in his speech to the House  on\r\n\r\nthe  evening  of  6th May, 1968,  expressed  three\r\n\r\nobjectives which the Government seeks to  achieve.\r\n\r\nThe objectives principally are, (1) to build up  a\r\n\r\ndefence  capability  to ensure continued  national\r\n\r\nsecurity;   (2)   to  eradicate   bad   industrial\r\n\r\npractices and to increase productivity in order to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  good climate for increased  investments\r\n\r\nand,  in conjunction with this objective, to build\r\n\r\na  sound  relationship between labour,  management\r\n\r\nand  Government;  (3) to enhance solidly  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness to tackle the impending problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to record my support for these three\r\n\r\nobjectives, without necessarily agreeing with  the\r\n\r\ndiagnosis of the problems and their solutions. Any\r\n\r\nsane  and thinking person will have realised  that\r\n\r\nthe next few years are crucial and vital years for\r\n\r\nthe  Republic  and  its  people,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of the British Armed Forces, which will\r\n\r\naffect  our national security and income  and  the\r\n\r\npolitical situation in the whole of this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do believe that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  the  ingenuity,  discipline   and\r\n\r\nspirit to face the challenges that are to come, as\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  in the years gone by. The workers, of whom  I\r\n\r\nam  one,  do recognise that when there is mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment,  economic and  industrial  expansion\r\n\r\nfor  the Republic is ever more imperative for  our\r\n\r\nown  job security and more for our own well-being.\r\n\r\nI am sure they will support any reasonable measure\r\n\r\nto  solve the grave unemployment situation in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  However, Mr Speaker, it is regrettable\r\n\r\nto note that Ministerial speeches tend to give the\r\n\r\nimpression  that the workers have all  along  been\r\n\r\nmainly   responsible  for  malpractices  and   bad\r\n\r\nproductivity, and the only way to cure it  all  is\r\n\r\nto  introduce  some labour taming or maybe  labour\r\n\r\nkilling  measures.  Is  the  labour  movement   so\r\n\r\nirresponsible?  Statistics show  that  there  were\r\n\r\nfewer  and  fewer strikes, and records  also  show\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  there  were  disputes,  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  would use the good offices of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour  or  would  use the  machinery  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court  to  settle   their\r\n\r\ndisputes.  I  believe that at this point  of  time\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are entering into a crucial  phase,  co-operation  between the workers and the  Government\r\n\r\nis  important  and  necessary.  I  would  strongly\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Government not to make the workers\r\n\r\ntheir   natural   whipping-boys.  The   Government\r\n\r\nshould,  I  think,  desist from making  hysterical\r\n\r\nallegations    of   malpractices   and    publicly\r\n\r\ncastigating the workers. Such an attitude  is  not\r\n\r\nconducive  to  bringing  about  good  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween the Government and the workers. Sir,  this\r\n\r\nis  not going to create a good image but will have\r\n\r\nthe  opposite  effect of creating an  untrue  ugly\r\n\r\nimage.  If  it  is  the  Government's  policy   to\r\n\r\nestablish   sensible  relations  between   labour,\r\n\r\nmanagement  and Government, the Government  itself\r\n\r\nmust  show the way. The only way to get  real  co-operation  is to have consultations on matters  of\r\n\r\nmutual interest. And where matters concern labour,\r\n\r\nconsultations  must be held with  the  appropriate\r\n\r\ntrade  union  organisations. To  illustrate,  when\r\n\r\nthere  are  legislative or other kinds of  changes\r\n\r\naffecting  labour,  consultations  must  be   held\r\n\r\npreferably ending\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  agreement  rather than that the  changes  be\r\n\r\nrammed down the throat of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, there must be genuine\r\n\r\nconsultations between the Government and the trade\r\n\r\nunion movement on the proposed Employment Bill. If\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  this Bill is to  create  greater\r\n\r\nemployment, it is worthy of support. But it  might\r\n\r\nas  well be said now that with the repeal  of  the\r\n\r\nClerks   Employment  Ordinance,  1957,   and   the\r\n\r\nstandardising of working hours for  clerks  at  44\r\n\r\nhours   per   week,  theoretically  speaking,   an\r\n\r\nemployer  requires  five'  clerks  less  for   the\r\n\r\nfunctions  that were formerly carried  out  by  44\r\n\r\nclerks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aim of the proposed Bill is also to reduce\r\n\r\ncertain  fringe benefits like leave,  the  overall\r\n\r\neffect  will be worse. In such a situation,  there\r\n\r\nwill be greater unemployment through retrenchment,\r\n\r\nwhich  gives a result contrary to the aim  of  the\r\n\r\nBill. One of the aims of the Bill is to check  the\r\n\r\nabuse  of fringe benefits. May I say, without  any\r\n\r\nreservation, that the fringe benefits provided  in\r\n\r\nthe Labour Ordinance, 1955, or the Shop Assistants\r\n\r\nEmployment   Ordinance,  1957,   or   the   Clerks\r\n\r\nEmployment  Ordinance, 1957, are not all  of  them\r\n\r\nadequate? In fact, more have been obtained by  way\r\n\r\nof  free union / management negotiations or awards\r\n\r\nof the Industrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that if there is abuse of fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits  by  individuals, the  cure  is  for  the\r\n\r\nemployer - this includes the Government -  to  put\r\n\r\nit  under  control. To reduce or to  limit  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits because of the misdemeanours of a few  is\r\n\r\nan  admission of poor management, which is not  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the Government's declared  policy.\r\n\r\nIt  would  be  pertinent to ask the  question:  in\r\n\r\nwhich  sector is abuse of fringe benefits rampant?\r\n\r\nIs  the bad area in the private sector? I am  sure\r\n\r\nthis is not found in the private sector. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink any hard-headed private employer would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntolerate  for a day, or an instant, the  abuse  of\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders  or  the terms  of  a  collective\r\n\r\nagreement.  May I remind the Government,  lest  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  forgotten, that it was only  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears  that trade unions have managed  -  and  not\r\n\r\nwithout   struggle  and  sacrifice  -  to   secure\r\n\r\nreasonable wages, fringe benefits and job security\r\n\r\nfor   its   members.   Therefore,   very   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to the  question  of\r\n\r\ndepriving  the workers of the benefits which  they\r\n\r\ncare most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have said earlier that the workers can\r\n\r\nmake  sacrifices for the nation, and the sacrifice\r\n\r\nof  certain fringe benefits can be made if  it  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely going to create more jobs in  the  firm\r\n\r\nor  in industry. But it is most unlikely that  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  can  give up the  basic  rights  to\r\n\r\norganise, to protect its members and to have  free\r\n\r\nnegotiations without objection and dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my earnest hope that in the end the\r\n\r\nproposed  Employment  Bill does  not  degrade  the\r\n\r\ndignity  of  labour, does not cause job insecurity\r\n\r\nand   demoralisation.  I  hope  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour,  who  is  concurrently  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs, will not have the task of selling\r\n\r\nSingapore in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the programme of the Ministry of Labour,\r\n\r\nI wish to commend the Minister for his proposal to\r\n\r\nallow  the Central Provident Fund balances  to  be\r\n\r\nused  to  pay for the first instalment of  Housing\r\n\r\nand   Development  Board  flats   and   that   the\r\n\r\nadditional  contributions made by the  member  and\r\n\r\nhis  employer  can  be used  to  pay  off  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments of both Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats and privately-built houses. I have commended\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  not  so  much because  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund balances can be used but that  home\r\n\r\nownership  fulfils the desire of every  person  to\r\n\r\nown a home. And also because the scheme itself  is\r\n\r\nin accordance with socialist principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would venture to suggest to the Minister to\r\n\r\nallow  current Central Provident Fund balances  to\r\n\r\nbe  used  to pay off loans from building societies\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinance  societies  for the  purchase  of  houses,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the high rate of interest charged  by\r\n\r\nthese financial companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the programme of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour,  I wish to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse to the fact that no provisions are made  for\r\n\r\nunemployment  insurance. With the high  degree  of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  surely this must  be  an  important\r\n\r\nmatter.  Can the Minister elucidate what  happened\r\n\r\nto  the  payroll tax collected which was meant  to\r\n\r\nstart an unemployment fund? What are the prospects\r\n\r\nof   a  person  who  is  to  be  made  jobless  by\r\n\r\ntermination of service? Outside the provisions  of\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements  generally,  there  is   no\r\n\r\nprovision  in  any of the three labour  Ordinances\r\n\r\nfor  payment  of  service  gratuity.  The  jobless\r\n\r\nperson  gets  $21 as public assistance,  which  is\r\n\r\nhardly  enough  to meet the daily necessities  for\r\n\r\nsurvival,  let  alone pay for Housing  Board  flat\r\n\r\nrent.  It  is  now  proposed by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth   that   such  a  person  be  charged   for\r\n\r\nhospitalisation. Would such a person,  if  he  was\r\n\r\ninjured  doing work for his employer, be asked  to\r\n\r\npay  for  his  recovery? I  think  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould not be too smug about what welfare benefits\r\n\r\nthey provide to the unemployed or sick people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the Government's objectives is to\r\n\r\nawaken and to infuse national consciousness in the\r\n\r\npopulation  to  meet the national problems  coming\r\n\r\nahead. I do suggest to the Government to use fully\r\n\r\nthe   mass  media  of  radio  and  television   to\r\n\r\npublicise  the  patriotism of our  loyal  citizens\r\n\r\nInstead of almost subserviently depending  on  one\r\n\r\nlocal  newspaper to announce contributions to  the\r\n\r\nNational  Defence Fund. This particular newspaper,\r\n\r\nI  learn  from one well-known employee,  responded\r\n\r\nquickly to an appeal of another country; but not a\r\n\r\nstir of response to just as urgent a need for  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Even their own employees recently  gave\r\n\r\nsomething, but not them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members must feel heartened that the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore have demonstrated their  love\r\n\r\nand  loyalty to the country. This is surely a good\r\n\r\nsign.  The ordinary people - the workers,  trishaw\r\n\r\nriders,  taxi-drivers, hawkers, farmers and  their\r\n\r\nchildren   -to  the  greatest  degree,   must   be\r\n\r\ncommended   for  sacrificing  their   savings   or\r\n\r\nearnings  for  the  national  need.  Some   worked\r\n\r\novertime  and  gave  their  overtime  pay  to  the\r\n\r\nnation,  while  others  gave  their  whole   day's\r\n\r\nearnings. But there are executives who shudder  to\r\n\r\ngive  up  their one day's entertainment money  for\r\n\r\nthe  National Defence Fund. This latter  group  is\r\n\r\napt  to put the blame on the ordinary workers  for\r\n\r\nanything that goes wrong in industry. This  brings\r\n\r\nup  the  question  as to how much the  executives,\r\n\r\nincluding those in Government service, who are not\r\n\r\ncovered  by the employment law should be  made  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice.  It  is  common  knowledge  that  these\r\n\r\nexecutives   enjoy  fringe  benefits,   especially\r\n\r\nannual  vacation,  far  in  excess  of  what   the\r\n\r\nordinary worker gets. They are the ones who  judge\r\n\r\nwhether a day's work put in by the ordinary worker\r\n\r\nis  worth  a  day's  wages. But under  our  social\r\n\r\nsystem who is to judge whether the executives  are\r\n\r\nworth  their  salary? I purposely  use  the  terms\r\n\r\n\"wages\"  and  \"salary\", because in the President's\r\n\r\nSpeech  the  Government has used the word  \"wages\"\r\n\r\nwhich  usually refers to earnings of the  ordinary\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary workers would like to ask whether\r\n\r\nthe   fruits  of  their  sacrifices  go   to   the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and executives and are remitted out of\r\n\r\nthe  country. What measures are there to see  that\r\n\r\nmore  people  are  employed by  business  concerns\r\n\r\nafter the proposed legislative measures have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced?

The matter is the question of the handling\r\n\r\nof  rubbish by these Ministries. I hope they  will\r\n\r\ndecide  among themselves as to which  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  this  before  the  question   of\r\n\r\ncleanliness becomes unmanageable. The question  is\r\n\r\nthat   the  Public  Utilities  Board,  under   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law, wants to impose a trade  refuse\r\n\r\nfee  of  $4 for work not done by them in  Petaling\r\n\r\nRoad  Market in Kallang Constituency. The  problem\r\n\r\nis  that  the  Housing  and Development  Board  is\r\n\r\nalready charging $35 and $30 for cooked foodstalls\r\n\r\nand  wet  foodstalls  respectively  inclusive   of\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy charges. The worst  of  it\r\n\r\nall  is  that  the Public Utilities  Board,  after\r\n\r\ninitiating  the  move, passed the problem  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Health  for   a   decision.   Such\r\n\r\nbureaucratic    wrangling   and   tug-of-war    is\r\n\r\ndefinitely not conducive to good administration of\r\n\r\nthe public service. I support legislative measures\r\n\r\nto   punish   litter  bugs,  but  the   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments responsible for clearing rubbish  must\r\n\r\nalso  do the jobs they are paid for. In connection\r\n\r\nwith  this  matter, I wish to make an  observation\r\n\r\nthat  some Housing and Development Board  Estates,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Kallang  Basin  Estate,  have   an\r\n\r\nunsightly appearance caused by rubbish whether  at\r\n\r\nnine  in the morning, or at noon or three  in  the\r\n\r\nevening, which are within working hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To round off my speech, I wish to say that only\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party has  manifestly  shown\r\n\r\nitself  to  be the only party that has  shown  its\r\n\r\nconcern  and  welfare  for the  Republic  and  the\r\n\r\npeople. Only the People's Action Party has been  a\r\n\r\ntrue  and  genuine Opposition Party and  governing\r\n\r\nParty.  Only  the People's Action Party  has  been\r\n\r\nthrough  thick  and  thin under all  circumstances\r\n\r\nwith  the people. In spite of all the tasks ahead,\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party is willing to undertake\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of looking after the  country.\r\n\r\nThe  people have clearly shown their faith in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  Government cannot  jettison  the\r\n\r\ntrust and faith of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition group and\r\n\r\nparties    outside   Parliament    have    behaved\r\n\r\noutrageously  by  not offering  themselves  as  an\r\n\r\nalternative  government, and it  can  be  expected\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be  more  irresponsible  as   an\r\n\r\nOpposition   in   Parliament   and   still    more\r\n\r\nirresponsible  as a Government.

These measures,\r\n\r\nbold  and  imaginative,  will  require  more  than\r\n\r\naverage effort on the part of everyone to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our record for the past 2- years of independence\r\n\r\nshould   not  leave  any  doubt  that   both   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the people have the will  and  the\r\n\r\ncapacity,  the  courage and determination  to  see\r\n\r\nthrough  these  challenging years  and  to  return\r\n\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour will have on its hands\r\n\r\nproblems  of such a nature that what have hitherto\r\n\r\nbeen  regarded as unpopular measures  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  aim  at changing the workers'  and  the\r\n\r\nunionists' attitude towards society at  large.  To\r\n\r\ncope  with  the  acute  unemployment  problem,  to\r\n\r\nstreamline the conditions of service, to  regulate\r\n\r\novertime  to  enable a wider spread of employment,\r\n\r\nto  leave out certain fringe benefits, to increase\r\n\r\nproductivity and to promote industrial  growth,  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Employment Bill will be  introduced.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  a  bold and farsighted  move.  Our\r\n\r\npotential  investors must be adequately  convinced\r\n\r\nthat here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  we have a disciplined labour  force\r\n\r\nand a sound and healthy industrial climate so that\r\n\r\nthey may, after weighing the pros and cons, decide\r\n\r\nto  stake their money with us. I am glad  that  in\r\n\r\nthis respect, the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, who is\r\n\r\nalso the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C., has in\r\n\r\nno  uncertain terms declared his support  for  the\r\n\r\nproposal  for  and  on behalf of  the  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This in itself is a clear indication of\r\n\r\nthe workers' understanding of the problem. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave not the slightest doubt that the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour,  when  considering  these  measures,  will\r\n\r\nalways  bear in mind the fact that the P.A.P, has\r\n\r\nall  along  been returned on a socialist  platform\r\n\r\nset  up to eradicate any form of exploitation  and\r\n\r\nthat it will not be tripped over by the apparently\r\n\r\nover-whelming  temptation posed  by  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  employment  opportunities  and   to\r\n\r\npromote  industrial growth in  the  coming  years.\r\n\r\nNeither do I doubt the wisdom of the unionists who\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  reminded that  the  surest  way  of\r\n\r\ndestroying  any  organised trade  unionism  is  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  country's economy to  fall  apart  and\r\n\r\nunemployment    to    assume    proportions     of\r\n\r\nuncontrollable magnitude. May I, however, add that\r\n\r\noutdated  Ordinances, which this  Employment  Bill\r\n\r\nwill seek to repeal, such as the Clerks Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   1957,   were  designed   to   provide\r\n\r\nadvantages  to the white-collar workers  over  the\r\n\r\nblue-collar  ones who will in the  years  to  come\r\n\r\nensure   the   success  of  our  industrialisation\r\n\r\neffort.  It will, therefore, not only be necessary\r\n\r\nat  this  stage  to standardise the conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  but  also  to provide incentives  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming   Bills  to  the  blue-collar  workers   by\r\n\r\npossibly  enhancing  their  social  position   and\r\n\r\ngiving them advantages over their counterparts  in\r\n\r\nwhite-collar  employment,  for  after  all,  rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is the order of the day.  May  I\r\n\r\nalso add, Sir, that when introducing the Bill, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should always bear  in  mind  that  it\r\n\r\nshould encourage its own employees to be exemplary\r\n\r\nin  their attitudes. Hon. Members will agree  with\r\n\r\nme that in the years gone by, employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  various statutory boards were found  most\r\n\r\nlikely  to abuse any fringe benefits. Let us  also\r\n\r\nhope that this Bill will bring with it a change of\r\n\r\nheart among these workers for, being on the public\r\n\r\npayroll,  they have to be more than just  ordinary\r\n\r\nemployees. May I also call upon the Government, as\r\n\r\nan  employer, not to abuse any restrictions on the\r\n\r\nworkers  that  may be introduced in  the  proposed\r\n\r\nBill, lest others will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  House  to  the section on urban  renewal  and\r\n\r\nredevelopment  in the Addendum to the  President's\r\n\r\nSpeech.  I come from a constituency which will  in\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  years  be completely  changed  and\r\n\r\naltered  by these schemes. I will not be so  naive\r\n\r\nas  to dispute the necessity of urban renewal  and\r\n\r\nredevelopment. Indeed, I welcome the  Government's\r\n\r\nmeasures   taken   to   encourage   and    promote\r\n\r\nsubstantial participation from the private  sector\r\n\r\nin this respect by making necessary administrative\r\n\r\nchanges  and providing incentives, so  that  these\r\n\r\nschemes may be more rapidly and efficiently pushed\r\n\r\nforward.   However,  may  I  remind  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned  to treat assurances given,  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  adequate compensation and that  affected\r\n\r\ntenants  will  have adequate time to  move  on  to\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation, with more effectiveness\r\n\r\nand  seriousness, especially in its administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery?    Officers    charged     with     the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of resettling affected tenants must\r\n\r\ndemonstrate a clear understanding of the  problems\r\n\r\ninvolved.  These officers must, in  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nstresses  and strains that go with the  job,  stay\r\n\r\ncomposed  and in their treatment of this sensitive\r\n\r\nproblem  must  at  all times be beyond  doubt  and\r\n\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote a recent case of resettlement\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency to support what I  have  just\r\n\r\nsaid.  At least four engineering works were  asked\r\n\r\nto   move   out   without  their   being   offered\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation. The officer  in  charge\r\n\r\nmade  an offer by asking them to move out as  soon\r\n\r\nas possible and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossibly  to  move  back at  a  later  stage  when\r\n\r\ncircumstances permitted. Sir, if only this officer\r\n\r\nwould  understand better the cost and  the  labour\r\n\r\ninvolved  in moving out and moving back  foundries\r\n\r\nand  machinery,  I think possibly this  might  not\r\n\r\nhave  happened.  It is hoped that steps  could  be\r\n\r\ntaken  early  enough  to prevent  my  constituents\r\n\r\nhaving  to  operate their foundries  and  to  park\r\n\r\ntheir machinery along the roadside. May I suggest,\r\n\r\nSir,   that  local  organisations,  such  as   the\r\n\r\nConsultative    Committees,   be   requested    to\r\n\r\nparticipate   and  help  in  solving  resettlement\r\n\r\nproblems  so that with an understanding  of  local\r\n\r\nconditions, resettlement will not only be  carried\r\n\r\nout fairly and efficiently but will also appear to\r\n\r\nhave been so done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me hope that in the very near future\r\n\r\nslums  will be replaced by high quality  buildings\r\n\r\nand that people who are resettled in the course of\r\n\r\ndoing   so   will  feel  happy  that  the   little\r\n\r\nsacrifices  they may be asked to make are  not  in\r\n\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I think it is appropriate for me\r\n\r\nto  congratulate the Ministry of Law and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and the Public Works Department on the\r\n\r\ngrand  work  they  have put in to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nphenomenal  increase  in  power,  water  and   gas\r\n\r\nconsumption over the last few years.  But  I  must\r\n\r\nconfess  that  I  am alarmed by the  feeling  that\r\n\r\noverhead charges added to the production  cost  of\r\n\r\nthese  amenities might have increased too  rapidly\r\n\r\nfor  anyone to be comfortable. I hope it  will  be\r\n\r\nchecked and brought to order. I also feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  my  duty to caution the Public Utilities Board\r\n\r\nagainst  allowing itself, on account of trying  to\r\n\r\ncope  with  the  increase in demand  for  electric\r\n\r\npower,  to  be  intimidated  into  expanding   its\r\n\r\ngenerating  network at such a rate  as  to  affect\r\n\r\nsound  planning, or to retain or employ expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers,  who do not have our interest at  heart,\r\n\r\nto  manage  and  superintend over these  extension\r\n\r\nstations,   especially  if   such   officers   are\r\n\r\ninefficient  and  proved to be  irresponsible.  We\r\n\r\nmust  and  have to allow our own local bright  and\r\n\r\nenergetic   engineers  to  participate   in   such\r\n\r\nmanagement,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause ultimately it is they who cannot afford to\r\n\r\nsee  their own country's progress affected by  any\r\n\r\ndisruption  in the power generating industry,  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  which will be too horrifying  even  to\r\n\r\nimagine.  In  this context, I must hasten  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  mere sending away of officers on  short\r\n\r\ntraining  courses and conferences is  not  enough.\r\n\r\nLocal bright engineers must be given the trust and\r\n\r\nencouragement to manage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a further\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to  the Ministry of  Law  and  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board, and that is to look  into\r\n\r\nthe   possibility   of   making   some   kind   of\r\n\r\narrangement,  say in the form of a  grid  network,\r\n\r\nwith  our  neighbour  in  the  north  in  ensuring\r\n\r\nsecurity  in loading capacity. Such an arrangement\r\n\r\nwill  not only help establish good neighbourliness\r\n\r\nbut  it  will  also help to cut down expenses  and\r\n\r\ninefficient   standby  plants.  Of  course,   even\r\n\r\ncountries which are technically more advanced than\r\n\r\nwe  are  are co-operating or seeking to co-operate\r\n\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Ministry of Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology, I must first of all welcome the timely\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of this Ministry. I read  with  great\r\n\r\ninterest  the speech of the Minister  for  Science\r\n\r\nand Technology on science education and industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  In his speech he has shown  a  clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the  need  to  streamline   our\r\n\r\ntechnical   education  system   to   satisfy   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  arising  from our  industrialisation\r\n\r\neffort.  True  enough, our engineers,  technicians\r\n\r\nand   their  supporting  artisans  are  not  being\r\n\r\nproduced in the right proportions. But if it is  a\r\n\r\nset-up  of  a  quasi-Government to have  a  set-up\r\n\r\nwhereby  10  engineers with four  technicians  are\r\n\r\nsupervising  and  being  supported  by,  say,  ten\r\n\r\nartisans,  and  if  such a  set-up  is  not  being\r\n\r\nchecked,  I  would  contend that  any  attempt  to\r\n\r\nstreamline  and  produce  manpower  in  the  right\r\n\r\nproportions would become meaningless.  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\noptimistic that the high-powered Cabinet Committee\r\n\r\nestablished to tackle this problem will soon  come\r\n\r\nout with a solution. And one day - we hope it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  soon - we will see our education  system\r\n\r\nharmonising  with  our  social  and  environmental\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember also there was talk of\r\n\r\ncentralising our apprenticeship training. In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, I hasten to request the Government  to\r\n\r\ninstitute  a centralised apprenticeship management\r\n\r\nwithout  further  delay, and  no  effort  must  be\r\n\r\nspared  to  ensure its success. Private  employers\r\n\r\nmust   be   urged  to  institute  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\napprenticeship scheme with active assistance  from\r\n\r\nthis  management. In so doing, it will be able  to\r\n\r\nprovide a well-trained technical base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Sir, the Ministry of Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology  must  take  on  rapidly  the  task  of\r\n\r\nproviding enough people with the know-how  at  the\r\n\r\nright   place  to  ensure  the  success   of   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation effort. Talking about  technical\r\n\r\nknow-how,  I  would request the  Finance  Ministry\r\n\r\nseriously to consider instituting stricter control\r\n\r\nover  the  quality of products that bear the  mark\r\n\r\n\"Product  of  Singapore\". It is no  use  producing\r\n\r\nsynthetic leather bags at a cost higher than  what\r\n\r\nis imported from outside if these locally produced\r\n\r\nbags  are  not going to be any good in quality  at\r\n\r\nall. It is no use protecting these products if  we\r\n\r\nare  producing them at such low quality that  they\r\n\r\nwill never be able to have a chance to go into any\r\n\r\ninternational market. Sir, if we are to compete in\r\n\r\nthe  highly competitive international market,  let\r\n\r\nus ensure that our products are up to the mark and\r\n\r\nthat the quality is up to specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude by saying that come what may in\r\n\r\nthe years ahead, we have no choice but to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe  result of failure is too much even to ponder.\r\n\r\nI  am  confident, as I said earlier, that we  will\r\n\r\nmake it. I quote the Prime Minister in saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The response of our population to these\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that  we are  faced  over  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade  has been a constant source of inspiration,\r\n\r\nthe ability to adjust, to adapt and to change.  It\r\n\r\nis  this collective sense of endeavour which  will\r\n\r\ncarry us through.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I say triumph we will.

We can make use of our available  human\r\n\r\nand  other  resources, not to expand  rapidly  our\r\n\r\nmilitary  establishment, but  to  recruit  only  a\r\n\r\nlimited  number of regular national servicemen  to\r\n\r\nbe in the reserves. They will be receiving regular\r\n\r\ntraining  so  that our resources may be  used  for\r\n\r\nnation-building  and for constructive  production.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  our  population  may  take  part  in\r\n\r\nproduction while they are always ready for combat.\r\n\r\nThis is a very wise policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that not very long ago Israeli troops\r\n\r\ndefeated  their  enemies who were ten  times  more\r\n\r\npowerful than they were in just a matter of a  few\r\n\r\ndays.  What  does  this mean? It  means  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of a country should place the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe country above individual interest. At the same\r\n\r\ntime, the people should have very high morale. Our\r\n\r\nGovernment  realises that we are a  small  country\r\n\r\nwith  a  small  population. We have been  able  to\r\n\r\nlearn  a lesson from the historical incident which\r\n\r\nI have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust  mentioned and we shall implement our  policy\r\n\r\naccordingly. This is laudable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there was not enough emphasis on\r\n\r\na  programme  for public construction  and  social\r\n\r\nwelfare   in  the  President's  speech.   Such   a\r\n\r\nprogramme  will  improve  the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Also,  there  is a lack  of  planning  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the difference between the living standard\r\n\r\nof  the rural people and that of the urban people.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nwas elected to power for the third time because it\r\n\r\nhas  shown  a high degree of efficiency, integrity\r\n\r\nand  incorruptibility. But more important is  that\r\n\r\nit  has  made significant achievements in  raising\r\n\r\nthe  standard of living of the people.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P, would  have  already  followed   the\r\n\r\nfootsteps  of  some  Afro-Asian  countries   whose\r\n\r\ngovernments do not have a firm foundation. In some\r\n\r\nof   the  Afro-Asian  countries,  no  matter  what\r\n\r\npolitical pattern or political party is in  power,\r\n\r\nit  is  only a matter of eight to ten years before\r\n\r\nmilitary men take over the government. There is no\r\n\r\ndemocratic  election.  Following  this,  there  is\r\n\r\nviolent  revolution and the Communists take  over.\r\n\r\nThen  there  is a one-party dictatorship  and  the\r\n\r\nyoung  shoot  of democracy is uprooted.  Why?  The\r\n\r\ncause  for this kind of situation mainly  lies  in\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the people in power are interested\r\n\r\nonly  in making money and they have forgotten  the\r\n\r\nwell-being  of the people and the duty  to  be  of\r\n\r\nservice to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that in the 1970s we have to\r\n\r\nspend  large sums of money on defence and military\r\n\r\nestablishments.  But  it  cannot  be  denied  that\r\n\r\npublic  construction in the rural areas  is  still\r\n\r\nlagging far behind that in the urban areas. So  we\r\n\r\nmust  redouble our efforts in public  construction\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas. Otherwise, what happened  in\r\n\r\n1963  in the rural areas would be repeated,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  would be manipulated  by  anti-national elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me talk about education. We all know\r\n\r\nthat   in   a   newly  independent  country   like\r\n\r\nSingapore, the long-term\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy and objectives of the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nhave  a telling effect on the future of the people\r\n\r\nand  on the policy of democratic socialism amongst\r\n\r\nthe  new  generation. The long-term objectives  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P, will play a very important role in this\r\n\r\naspect.  One  of the means to achieve these  long-term objectives is education. Ever since we in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P, came to power, we have been allotting large\r\n\r\nsums  of  money  on education. The purpose  is  to\r\n\r\neducate  and  bring up our younger  generation  so\r\n\r\nthat in future they may make a better contribution\r\n\r\nand  render more service to our country. It cannot\r\n\r\nbe  denied that the achievements of our country in\r\n\r\neducation have been meritorious. But now,  because\r\n\r\nof  the  rapid  changes in our  situation,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to make our education pattern  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of a new environment. We have to review  and\r\n\r\nreform our existing education policy. In the past,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  quantitative bias in our  education\r\n\r\npolicy  because  we  had to  eradicate  illiteracy\r\n\r\nquickly. This objective has now been achieved. The\r\n\r\nteachers  played  an important role  in  achieving\r\n\r\nthis  objective. But today, the quantitative  bias\r\n\r\nin  our education policy is outdated. What we  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for  today  is  a  qualitative  education\r\n\r\npolicy  because, in such a country as  ours  where\r\n\r\nthere are no natural resources, the youths are the\r\n\r\nprecious wealth we have. If we do not educate them\r\n\r\nwell  and  turn  them out into rugged,  brave  and\r\n\r\nintelligent  people  endowed with  scientific  and\r\n\r\ntechnological  knowledge, the perpetual  existence\r\n\r\nof Singapore will be at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July last year, I saw the Youth Festival\r\n\r\norganised  by the Ministry of Education.  We  have\r\n\r\nwitnessed  the sudden re-awakening of the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  who have changed their past attitudes.\r\n\r\nThey   have  responded  keenly  to  cadetship   in\r\n\r\nschools,  the Police, the Army, the Air Force  and\r\n\r\nthe Navy. This is proof that they are awakening to\r\n\r\nnew  challenges and demonstrating the spirit of  a\r\n\r\nnew  generation. If the Ministry of Education  can\r\n\r\nmake  military  training  one  of  the  compulsory\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  the middle school curriculum,  these\r\n\r\nyouths will be like hedge-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhogs which cannot be swallowed easily. The task of\r\n\r\ncultivating   group  interest  to   serve   as   a\r\n\r\ngenerating  force  for  our  progress  cannot   be\r\n\r\nundertaken  by the administrators in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education   alone.  Therefore,   all   school\r\n\r\nadministrators and teachers must do their  bit  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in this task. So the re-training of teachers\r\n\r\nand  administrative  personnel  is  necessary.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  can  be  undertaken  during   their\r\n\r\nvacation or holidays. The main purpose is to  give\r\n\r\nthem  a  clearer understanding of the Government's\r\n\r\neducation policy, to make them aware of the  trust\r\n\r\nthat the country and the people have in them,  and\r\n\r\nto  inculcate in them a love for their country. At\r\n\r\nthe same time, our society and new country need  a\r\n\r\ngroup   of   dedicated  intellectuals   to   help.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Ministry of Education must adopt  a\r\n\r\nnew  criterion  for  the  promotion  of  teachers,\r\n\r\nnamely,   their  contribution  and   services   as\r\n\r\nteachers   to   society:   for   instance,   their\r\n\r\nactivities    in   the   Citizens'    Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees, community centres, voluntary and other\r\n\r\norganisations,  and services rendered  to  society\r\n\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that when inspectors of schools\r\n\r\nfind teachers making mistakes, they should try  to\r\n\r\nmake  the teachers correct their mistakes  on  the\r\n\r\nspot  and not lord it over them and make a  record\r\n\r\nof  the mistakes in their files for the purpose of\r\n\r\nrecord and not for the purpose of improvement.  It\r\n\r\nis  important  that inspectors of  schools  should\r\n\r\nimpart to the teachers a spirit of patriotism  and\r\n\r\ninform  them of the nature of our education policy\r\n\r\nin  order  to help them carry out more effectively\r\n\r\ntheir duties as teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me supplement what the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens said yesterday on  the  present\r\n\r\nexamination  system. First of all, I  support  his\r\n\r\nviews  on  the  abolition of  the  Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving Examination. We all know that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education calls it the Primary School  Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination.   But,   in  fact,   this   sort   of\r\n\r\nexamination is a judgment on the future of  a  13-year old child, because his fate is sealed by  the\r\n\r\nresult of the examination. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  put  him  either  in  an  academic\r\n\r\nsecondary school, or a secondary technical  school\r\n\r\nor a secondary vocational school, depending on his\r\n\r\nresult.   Sir,   a  13-year  old  child   has   no\r\n\r\nfundamental  understanding of or any  concern  for\r\n\r\nhis  fate. Ninety per cent of the questions in the\r\n\r\npresent  Primary  School Leaving  Examination  are\r\n\r\nobjective tests and there is an element of chance.\r\n\r\nThis  kind  of examination cannot truly  determine\r\n\r\nthe intelligence of a student. It is rather unfair\r\n\r\nto  seal his fate in this manner and many  a  fine\r\n\r\nboy's  future  may  be  destroyed.  Attention  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  paid  to  this  point  in  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries like England. I hope we can take a  step\r\n\r\nforward  and  abolish the Primary  School  Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination  and  replace  it  by  a   Middle   II\r\n\r\nSelective Examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of our discussion about building up a\r\n\r\nbrave  and rugged generation, I am surprised  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  physical education subject  in  the\r\n\r\nMiddle  IV,  Secondary  IV  and  Higher  Secondary\r\n\r\nExamination.   Sir,  although  our   schools   are\r\n\r\nexpanding  to saturation point, we are very  short\r\n\r\nof  art  and craft teachers. Even the inter-school\r\n\r\nsport  meetings  organised by  Government  schools\r\n\r\nhave  been  largely stopped, because many  schools\r\n\r\ncannot   get   physical  education  teachers   and\r\n\r\ncoaches. To ask a trainee teacher who has not much\r\n\r\nknowledge of physical education and who  has  been\r\n\r\ntrained two hours a week in the Teachers' Training\r\n\r\nCollege to take up the onerous and important  task\r\n\r\nof  becoming  a teacher of physical  education  is\r\n\r\nlike  looking for a fish in the woods.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nit is necessary for us to set up an institution of\r\n\r\nphysical  education in order to train teachers  of\r\n\r\nphysical  education so that they can  bring  up  a\r\n\r\nrugged,  brave, strong, determined, energetic  and\r\n\r\nenduring new generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to science and technical\r\n\r\neducation.  It  cannot  be denied  that  our  past\r\n\r\nprosperity   has  all  along  been  dependent   on\r\n\r\ncommerce and entrepot trade. But now that  we  are\r\n\r\nindependent, we have to provide our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown  defence. The British military forces will  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  from Singapore. On top of  this,  our\r\n\r\npopulation  is  increasing and a large  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  are unemployed. Hereafter, we may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  depend solely on commerce  and  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  to maintain our economy. The Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  all  out  to  promote industrialisation  in\r\n\r\norder to bolster up our economy, establish our own\r\n\r\ndefence, resolve the unemployment problem  because\r\n\r\nof  the  British  withdrawal from  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\ncreate more employment opportunities for thousands\r\n\r\nof  school-leavers every year. It  is  encouraging\r\n\r\nlocal  merchants and even entrepreneurs to  invest\r\n\r\nlarge  sums  in factories in order to create  more\r\n\r\nemployment    opportunities.   To    succeed    in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  investments  and  markets  are\r\n\r\nnatural problems. But it is even more important to\r\n\r\nreduce production cost, increase productivity  and\r\n\r\nraise  the  quality of our manufactured goods.  In\r\n\r\norder to achieve this, our education system should\r\n\r\nnaturally  stress the importance  of  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  education. This  is  the  only  way  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in industrialisation and achieve economic\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have not only a sound education system\r\n\r\ntaking in science and technical subjects, but also\r\n\r\nwell-equipped laboratories and workshops.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  it  is also necessary  to  have  more\r\n\r\nqualified science and technical teachers who  will\r\n\r\nbe  responsible  for the teaching of  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnical subjects. Further, full use must be made\r\n\r\nof  the  facilities to teach the students so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  understand thoroughly  the  theory  of\r\n\r\nscience   and  its  actual  application.   Science\r\n\r\neducation  should also emphasise applied  science.\r\n\r\nPure  science  has the objective  of  seeking  the\r\n\r\ntruth about science and ascertaining the facts  of\r\n\r\nphenomena.  It  is  not  of  much  value  to   the\r\n\r\npractical  application of science.  Usually  large\r\n\r\nsums  of  money and much energy are spent on  pure\r\n\r\nscience  and, as a result, it does not  contribute\r\n\r\nmuch  to our industrialisation programme. It  does\r\n\r\nnot  promote the well-being of our people.  If  we\r\n\r\nwant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  succeed in our industrialisation programme, we\r\n\r\nmust   encourage  applied  science  and  technical\r\n\r\neducation. In order to industrialise, we need  not\r\n\r\nonly   ordinary  manual  workers  but  also  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of technical specialists and engineers. In\r\n\r\naddition  to having a sound mind in a sound  body,\r\n\r\nthese people should also have knowledge of applied\r\n\r\nscience.  They should also undergo a  considerable\r\n\r\nperiod  of  strict technical training before  they\r\n\r\ncan become qualified industrial personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, from now on the secondary school\r\n\r\ncurriculum   should  stress  the   importance   of\r\n\r\nteaching Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. These\r\n\r\nthree  subjects are the basis and the  gateway  to\r\n\r\nmore advanced scientific knowledge. There are  two\r\n\r\npoints  I  wish  to  emphasise.  One  is  on   the\r\n\r\ntheoretical aspect of science. The other is on its\r\n\r\npractical application. The subjects taught  should\r\n\r\ninclude  not  only the ordinary  basic  theory  of\r\n\r\nscience  but  they should also be related  to  the\r\n\r\nactual  application of the theory and  the  actual\r\n\r\napplication of the techniques. The first  type  of\r\n\r\nscience  education is more suited to students  who\r\n\r\nare interested in pure science. The second type is\r\n\r\nmore suited to students who are interested in  the\r\n\r\nactual   application  of  science   in   industry.\r\n\r\nComparatively  speaking, applied science  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  and  there should be more  teaching  of\r\n\r\nthis  subject than pure science. Thus we may teach\r\n\r\nthe   students   according  to  their   individual\r\n\r\ninclinations,  so  that  we  may  train  them   as\r\n\r\nscientists  or  technologists or  experts  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  fields.  In this way,  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nbright future for our industrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I fully express my support for the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's motion thanking the President for\r\n\r\nhis speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, may I have the privilege of joining our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in expressing my vote of thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident who has graciously delivered his  Speech\r\n\r\nto   the  Second  Parliament  so  soon  after  his\r\n\r\nrecovery from his recent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nillness.  The measures as outlined in the Addendum\r\n\r\nto  the  President's Speech have my full  support.\r\n\r\nWithout  such  measures to meet the challenges  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  face  during the next  four  years,  our\r\n\r\nchances   of   survival  as  an  independent   and\r\n\r\nsovereign people are less hopeful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish now to touch upon the\r\n\r\nsubjects under the headings \"Comprehensive  Labour\r\n\r\nLegislation\"  and  the  \"Central  Provident  Fund\"\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  memorandum  presented  as   an\r\n\r\nAddendum to the President's Speech. The industrial\r\n\r\nclimate  in  the Republic of Singapore  to  induce\r\n\r\nforeign  investors has been attractive during  the\r\n\r\nlast two years and has improved considerably since\r\n\r\nthen. But investors have not come forward in large\r\n\r\nnumbers  as  had  been  expected.  Investors  from\r\n\r\ncountries  like Japan, Taiwan and  Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\ncountries  in Western Europe are still wary  about\r\n\r\nlabour  conditions in the Republic. The number  of\r\n\r\ninvestors is not up to our expectations because of\r\n\r\nthe   prevailing  conditions  of  uncertainty  and\r\n\r\ninstability  in  the surrounding regions  of  this\r\n\r\npart of the world, except our island Republic.  We\r\n\r\ncan  take  pride  in our country as  an  oasis  of\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic  stability.  We  have   a\r\n\r\ncurrency  which is one of the strongest  in  Asia,\r\n\r\nand  labour  with a high standard of  literacy,  a\r\n\r\nhigh  degree of skill and endowed with  a  natural\r\n\r\naptitude for taking up new skills with comparative\r\n\r\nease. We have excellent harbour facilities and our\r\n\r\nfinancial, insurance and banking services  are  of\r\n\r\nthe  highest  order  and efficiency  in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.  Despite all these advantages,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nattracting  enough  industries  with  both  labour\r\n\r\nintensive and export-oriented types. What are  the\r\n\r\nunderlying reasons for this lack of enthusiasm and\r\n\r\nresponse? Since the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government came to power in 1959,  nothing\r\n\r\nhas  been  done  in regard to our existing  labour\r\n\r\nlaws which require long overdue reforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bugbears which deter foreign companies\r\n\r\nfrom  investing in our Republic is our labour laws\r\n\r\nwhich require tidying up and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrationalisation.  Clerical  staff  in   industrial\r\n\r\noffices  work 44 hours per week, whereas the  same\r\n\r\nkind of clerical staff performing the same kind of\r\n\r\nwork  in commercial houses work only 39 hours  per\r\n\r\nweek.  To  give you another example, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  clerks  in industrial plants  have  11  paid\r\n\r\nholidays  per  year, whereas clerks in  commercial\r\n\r\nfirms   and  in  the  administrative  offices   of\r\n\r\nindustrial establishments have 16 paid holidays  a\r\n\r\nyear. There is no difference in the nature of  the\r\n\r\nwork  and  the conditions governing  the  work  of\r\n\r\nclerks,  whether they work in commercial firms  or\r\n\r\nindustrial firms. The human element of frustration\r\n\r\nand  dissatisfaction  is accentuated  by  creating\r\n\r\ndifferent benefits due to the shortcomings in  our\r\n\r\nexisting  labour laws. A new situation has  arisen\r\n\r\nbecause  our Government is now concentrating  more\r\n\r\neffort    on    the   intensification    of    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.    As    a     result,     both\r\n\r\nadministrative and production work will be carried\r\n\r\nout  within  the  same compound and  in  the  same\r\n\r\noffice.  These new conditions and situations  will\r\n\r\nbe  found in the new industrial estates. In  other\r\n\r\nwords, clerks will be performing the same kind  of\r\n\r\nwork  and amidst the same environment. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe existing labour laws, the industrial clerk  is\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against by having a lesser number of\r\n\r\npublic  holidays. If we want to  get  rid  of  the\r\n\r\nhuman  frustration and dissatisfaction and  if  we\r\n\r\nbelieve in the equality of all citizens, then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to rationalise our existing  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past I have pointed out to Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  dealing with labour that  some  radical\r\n\r\nchanges have to be made to standardise the working\r\n\r\nhours  and other conditions of employment and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, to rationalise the fringe benefits\r\n\r\nso  as to reduce abuses to the minimum. Even  with\r\n\r\nrationalisation,  our labour conditions  are  much\r\n\r\nbetter off than those obtaining in other parts  of\r\n\r\nAsia.  Our  wage rates are still much higher  than\r\n\r\nthose  of  any other countries in Southeast  Asia,\r\n\r\nand  our per capita income is the highest in  Asia\r\n\r\nnext to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan.  Without  the  accelerated  withdrawal   of\r\n\r\nBritish  troops  from  Singapore,  I  believe   no\r\n\r\nattempt would have been made to bring about  these\r\n\r\nchanges in the proposed Employment Bill. Something\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  done by way of legislation  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  more  equitable and satisfactory conditions\r\n\r\nof  employment for all workers irrespective of the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  work  they are  doing.  This  new\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill will create a better impression on\r\n\r\nwould-be foreign investors and much publicity must\r\n\r\nbe given to it abroad by our Government. I commend\r\n\r\nthe  Government  for  having taken  the  bold  and\r\n\r\nforward-looking  policy of  taking  the  necessary\r\n\r\nsteps to repeal the three Ordinances now existing,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  Labour  Ordinance,  1955,  the  Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants  Employment Ordinance,  1957,  and  the\r\n\r\nClerks    Employment   Ordinance,   1957.    These\r\n\r\nOrdinances should have been repealed long  ago  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  out-dated and do not fit  in  with  our\r\n\r\ntimes and the policy of our Government. These  are\r\n\r\nrelics  of the past when divide and rule  was  the\r\n\r\nbest  policy to govern a people. These  laws  have\r\n\r\ngiven  rise to misgivings and much ground for  bad\r\n\r\nindustrial relationship during the years from 1955\r\n\r\nto  1963.  They  have caused many  heartaches  and\r\n\r\nheadaches  to  management  on  the  one  hand  and\r\n\r\nfrustration  and dissatisfaction  to  trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders on the other. They were enacted to enhance\r\n\r\nthe  status of white-collar workers and  to  treat\r\n\r\nwith  contempt  those who earn their  living  with\r\n\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of Singapore today we can ill\r\n\r\nafford this situation. Government has taken a wise\r\n\r\nstep   to  introduce  the  proposed  comprehensive\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill.  In view of the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  pro-labour in its  policy,  it  is\r\n\r\ncourageous to repeal the existing labour  laws  by\r\n\r\nsubstituting one comprehensive Bill to standardise\r\n\r\nand   regulate   the  terms  and   conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment.  This  will be  progressive  and  far-sighted  legislation and will go  a  long  way  to\r\n\r\nerase many areas of discontentment and grounds for\r\n\r\ndispute   between   employer  and   employee.   It\r\n\r\ndemonstrates our Government's concept of an equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  democratic society in which all  wage-earners\r\n\r\nwill  be  governed  by  the  same  conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment and enjoy the same fringe benefits.  It\r\n\r\nis  gross injustice and, to say the least, creates\r\n\r\nareas  for discontentment if two workers  work  in\r\n\r\none  place and within one compound and do the same\r\n\r\nkind  of  work but observe a different  number  of\r\n\r\nweekly  working hours. If we are to  hold  to  our\r\n\r\nbelief and concept of equal opportunities for all,\r\n\r\nthen  all workers should be treated alike. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  new  Bill will apply equally to all employees\r\n\r\nin  the  Government  sector  and  other  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch on the aspect of industrial relations,\r\n\r\nthe proposed new legislation will erase many areas\r\n\r\nof   friction   and  pave  the  way   for   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding and co-operation between labour  and\r\n\r\nmanagement, which is very essential for industrial\r\n\r\npeace. But if we are to take full advantage of the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  this new Bill  which  is  to  be\r\n\r\nlegislated   by  this  House,  then   labour   and\r\n\r\nmanagement   will   have  to  see   that   greater\r\n\r\nproductivity  relative  to  cost  and  output   is\r\n\r\nachieved through these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to allay the fear\r\n\r\nexpressed  by the hon. Member for Bukit  Ho  Swee,\r\n\r\nthat  maximum co-operation may not be  forthcoming\r\n\r\nfrom employers if this new Bill is passed. Here  I\r\n\r\nmust  sound a note of warning to all employers  in\r\n\r\nthe  industrial  and commercial  sectors  to  take\r\n\r\ncognisance of the personal sacrifice every  worker\r\n\r\nwill have to make in the long-term interest of the\r\n\r\nnation  in the industrial front when this Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed. It is only fair and reasonable that  they,\r\n\r\nas  employers, have to make up something in return\r\n\r\nto compensate for their losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as employers, we should not take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the new changes in the labour  policy\r\n\r\nand  make  more  profit  at  the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  There should be no exploitation  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  by  employers if the proposed  Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed. Economic and political considerations have\r\n\r\nbrought about the introduction of this Bill  which\r\n\r\nis aimed at ensuring the survival of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both labour and management should co-operate and\r\n\r\nwork  towards the common goal of building a stable\r\n\r\nand viable Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second Central Provident Fund, which will be\r\n\r\nset  up,  should therefore compensate for the  new\r\n\r\nconditions of employment resulting in the loss  of\r\n\r\ncertain  fringe  benefits. This second  fund  will\r\n\r\nalso  assist  in  further economic development  by\r\n\r\nproviding  capital  for more  investments  in  new\r\n\r\nindustries and, at the same time, will provide  to\r\n\r\nthe   workers   a  secure  source   of   financial\r\n\r\nassistance  in  the  form  of  savings  when  they\r\n\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new changes come into force, trade union\r\n\r\nleaders  should educate their members to see  that\r\n\r\nproductivity  and efficiency, the main  objectives\r\n\r\nof  this new Bill, are achieved. This will put the\r\n\r\nRepublic on a more competitive basis compared with\r\n\r\nJapan or Western European countries in many of our\r\n\r\nindustries;  but still less so than  countries  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan. We have\r\n\r\na small domestic market for our manufactured goods\r\n\r\nand  we  have  to  export by  producing  goods  at\r\n\r\ncompetitive cost and quality. The output  of  each\r\n\r\nfactory  is  in  excess of local  consumption.  To\r\n\r\ncapture  the  domestic market, every encouragement\r\n\r\nshould  be  directed towards our  people  by  mass\r\n\r\nmedia of communication to buy locally-manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods  even at a slightly higher price. Government\r\n\r\nand  statutory bodies which spend a great deal  of\r\n\r\nmoney  on foreign imported materials should insist\r\n\r\non local manufactures even though the price may be\r\n\r\n10  per cent more than the imported items. In this\r\n\r\nway, we will also prevent import leakages and save\r\n\r\nour  foreign exchange reserves. The more we import\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad to meet our local needs, the more  we\r\n\r\nhave to dip into our reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion, Sir, that when the proposed\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill  is  passed  by  this  House  and\r\n\r\nbecomes law, there will be weeping and gnashing of\r\n\r\nteeth among the workers. The clerical staff of the\r\n\r\ncommercial sector will be the most affected. Among\r\n\r\nemployers, there may be a few who will try to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  undue  advantage  of the  changed  situation\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by this new legislation.  To  this\r\n\r\nclass  of employers, I would strongly advise  them\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  not  get  the  support  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  and they will be looking  for  trouble\r\n\r\nfor  themselves. I hope the Employers' Federation,\r\n\r\nthe Chambers of Commerce, and trade unionists will\r\n\r\nmeet  often  round  the table to  iron  out  their\r\n\r\ndifferences and problems to minimise the areas  of\r\n\r\ndispute to prevent incidents of industrial strife.\r\n\r\nBoth management and labour must strive hard not to\r\n\r\noffer  opportunities to the  enemy  camp  to  find\r\n\r\nexcuses   to   generate  industrial   instability,\r\n\r\nthereby scaring potential investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the accelerated withdrawal of the British\r\n\r\nMilitary  Forces, it is the bounden duty  of  both\r\n\r\nemployers  and  workers to  project  an  image  of\r\n\r\nconfidence,  good government, political  stability\r\n\r\nand  responsible labour to make our  Republic  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  centre of this region. In this  sacred\r\n\r\ntask of meeting the challenge and the problems  we\r\n\r\nhave to face in the crucial years ahead, everyone,\r\n\r\nas  long  as he is a citizen of Singapore,  has  a\r\n\r\nvital role to play. Workers and employers in  this\r\n\r\nrespect   have  to  think  more  of  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest than personal or sectional interest. Each\r\n\r\nis  dependent  upon  the other  and  only  through\r\n\r\npartnership in the common endeavour will  win  the\r\n\r\nday.  We sink or swim together.

Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  yesterday the Member for Katong  and  a  few\r\n\r\nother   Members  had  occasion  to  discuss   some\r\n\r\nproblems  that face the evolution of a progressive\r\n\r\nand enlightened educational policy in Singapore. I\r\n\r\ngot  the  impression that in the  course  of  this\r\n\r\ndiscussion, there is one aspect relevant at least,\r\n\r\nif not important, which was not adequately can-vassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  I would like to say a few  words  on\r\n\r\nthis   for  the  purpose  of  setting  a  rational\r\n\r\nframework for any future discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that we have come to the end of one\r\n\r\nphase  in our evolution of our educational  system\r\n\r\nand  we are about to embark upon another. We have,\r\n\r\nto a large extent, solved the problem of providing\r\n\r\nequal opportunities in education in a quantitative\r\n\r\nsense. I am not so sure that qualitatively we have\r\n\r\ndone the same thing. And it is no secret, and  is,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  known  to everyone in  Singapore,  that\r\n\r\nevery  time the year ends and the new term starts,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a scramble among parents to  get  their\r\n\r\nchildren   into   the   best   possible   schools,\r\n\r\nespecially  on the secondary level. It  is  either\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution  or Anglo-Chinese  School.  I\r\n\r\nhave  become interested in this problem  for  some\r\n\r\nwhile  now  to  find out what the  cause  of  this\r\n\r\nattitude  really  was.  It  became  apparent  that\r\n\r\nchildren  naturally wanted to go to schools  which\r\n\r\nhad firm established traditions of teaching, where\r\n\r\nstandards were certain, and they got the  best  by\r\n\r\nway  of teaching from the teachers. This, I think,\r\n\r\nis  connected also with the way in which transfers\r\n\r\nof   teachers   and  principals  take   place   in\r\n\r\nGovernment schools. I can see there was a  certain\r\n\r\nlogic in the past for having done this. Because of\r\n\r\nthe  expansion of the educational programme, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  shortage  of teachers for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nservicing  all the schools and it became necessary\r\n\r\nto  follow this kind of practice. I hope that this\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs has come to an  end  with  more\r\n\r\nteachers  coming  out to perform their  respective\r\n\r\nduties  and  that  it  will be  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Department to allow teachers to  remain\r\n\r\nin  a  school for 10, 15 or more years until  they\r\n\r\nretire   and   thereby  develop   a   personality.\r\n\r\nTeachers, like children, have got a way of growing\r\n\r\nup with their respective schools and institutions.\r\n\r\nThis  is something that we must foster and we must\r\n\r\nalso  allow individuality on the part of  teachers\r\n\r\nand   principals  in  the  performance  of   their\r\n\r\nteaching  duties  within  the  framework  of   the\r\n\r\nnational policy laid down by the Government. This,\r\n\r\nI think,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  very  vital  if we are to build  up  the  firm\r\n\r\neducational  traditions that we have been  talking\r\n\r\nabout  in  our schools, whether it be intellectual\r\n\r\ntraditions   or  whether  it  be  extra-curricular\r\n\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to refer to the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministerial  statements  that  have  been\r\n\r\nbroadcast  and  also  the  Speech  made   by   the\r\n\r\nPresident.  It is quite clear that the  Government\r\n\r\nis  setting us firmly on the course of building up\r\n\r\na modern society. And at the end of five years, it\r\n\r\nmay  be a fair assessment to say that the internal\r\n\r\nconsolidation of the State of Singapore would have\r\n\r\nmatured.  If this be true, we would have succeeded\r\n\r\nin  creating a national ethos at the end  of  five\r\n\r\nyears  which would make it more and more difficult\r\n\r\nfor  extreme political parties, efferent political\r\n\r\nparties  like  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  to  create\r\n\r\ntrouble in Singapore. If our internal difficulties\r\n\r\nare  solved  and rationalised, it is fair  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  most of our difficulties in political  terms\r\n\r\nmust  come  from  the  outside.  So  long  as  the\r\n\r\ndifference remains between us in Singapore and our\r\n\r\nimmediate  neighbours  in the  conception  of  the\r\n\r\nnature of a State or politics and the exercise  of\r\n\r\npower,   there  is  bound  to  be  this  political\r\n\r\nfriction. And this is something we must  learn  to\r\n\r\nlive with. This we can do provided, of course,  we\r\n\r\nstrengthen  ourselves militarily and otherwise.  I\r\n\r\nwas  wondering whether through diplomacy and other\r\n\r\nmeans  we could, instead of concentrating on these\r\n\r\npolitical  differences, strike out  boldly  as  we\r\n\r\nhave   done  in  internal  matters  and  establish\r\n\r\nrelations  in  educational,  cultural,  trade  and\r\n\r\neconomic matters with our neighbours, and  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  help  in  muting the  frictions  and  the\r\n\r\ndifferences that crop up from time to time between\r\n\r\nus.  I know it is a difficult proposition, because\r\n\r\nwe   come   face  to  face  with  all   kinds   of\r\n\r\nirrationalities  at  different  times.   This   is\r\n\r\nsomething, I think, we have got to keep hitting at\r\n\r\nand  perhaps with the evolution of the  respective\r\n\r\nsocieties,  we  will  find a way  to  come  closer\r\n\r\ntogether in economic matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  President in his speech  outlining  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government said that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nParliament  which is faced with problems  of  more\r\n\r\nthan  usual  magnitude. Is  it  because  of  these\r\n\r\nproblems  which we are facing that the  Opposition\r\n\r\nhave chosen not to contest the elections? This  is\r\n\r\nthe Second Parliament in which the P.A.P, has been\r\n\r\ngiven  a clear mandate to govern the country.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore can be assured that  we,  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  in government for the last nine  years\r\n\r\nand  with  the  experience of  our  leaders,  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  resolve the problems facing us  and  we\r\n\r\nwill do the best we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's Speech and also the statements\r\n\r\nby   various  Ministers,  emphasis  is  placed  on\r\n\r\nsacrifice and greater effort by our people and  by\r\n\r\nour  workers. I think we should restate  our  aims\r\n\r\nand  objectives. What are we making sacrifices for\r\n\r\nand  why  are we asking our workers to make  great\r\n\r\nsacrifices?  I  think we have to ensure  that  our\r\n\r\neconomy is good, because we all know that we  need\r\n\r\nto  expand our industry and create more  jobs  for\r\n\r\nour young population and those who will lose their\r\n\r\njobs  as  a result of the run-down of the  British\r\n\r\nForces  in  Singapore.  But  I  think  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  just  to  ask  the  workers  to   make\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  The Government must ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  which the workers make will eventually\r\n\r\nbenefit the country and not a few firms or  a  few\r\n\r\nindividuals who want to make money as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible  and  call it off. If the Government  can\r\n\r\nensure  that  there  is  a reasonable  balance  of\r\n\r\ninterests between workers, management and capital,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure that at the end of our five-year  term\r\n\r\nthe  workers will find that their sacrifices  will\r\n\r\nnot have been in vain, otherwise I am sure that we\r\n\r\nwill be in for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great emphasis is placed on productivity. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  help by ensuring that  incentives\r\n\r\nare  given  to  those workers  who  contribute  to\r\n\r\nproductivity. There must be a basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange  of  thinking on rewards. For instance,  in\r\n\r\nthe  past under the colonial system, rewards  were\r\n\r\nmeasured in terms of seniority of service. A clerk\r\n\r\nwho starts with $150 a month need not put in great\r\n\r\neffort, because he knows that at the end of  every\r\n\r\nyear he will get $15 a month increment. But if  he\r\n\r\nreaches the $500 a month grade, why should he  put\r\n\r\nin  extra effort to produce more work? So if  this\r\n\r\nkind  of  thinking  is  not changed,  it  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  induce  our  citizens  to  be  more\r\n\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to touch on two points\r\n\r\nwhich  are  most  disturbing to a section  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore and of which most Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament in this House are fully aware. They are\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and  work  permits  which  are   tied\r\n\r\ntogether.  Some time ago when citizenship  was  of\r\n\r\nless  value, it took an applicant about six months\r\n\r\nfor  his citizenship to be considered, and  if  he\r\n\r\nqualified  for citizenship it normally took  about\r\n\r\nsix   months   to   get  his  citizenship   paper.\r\n\r\nCitizenship   then   became  more   valuable.   An\r\n\r\napplication for citizenship took about a  year  to\r\n\r\nbe  considered and approved. At present, I believe\r\n\r\nthere are about 40,000 applicants for citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt  takes  about  a year for applicants  who  have\r\n\r\nfiled  in  citizenship papers to  be  interviewed.\r\n\r\nSome   of   them   are  wondering  whether   their\r\n\r\napplications will be successful. Many of them  are\r\n\r\nstill  waiting  for an answer even after  a  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is a very unhealthy situation. Although  one\r\n\r\nmay  ask,  \"Why should you worry about them?  They\r\n\r\nare  not  citizens. They cannot vote for you?\",  I\r\n\r\nthink we have to be humane about this. There  must\r\n\r\nbe  a  certain time limit for applications  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered,  and  the applicants  should  be  told\r\n\r\nwhether they qualify for citizenship or not. It is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  in the past many chose to sit  on  the\r\n\r\nfence  and they have only themselves to blame  for\r\n\r\nthe  situation they are in today. I am not so much\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  those  fence-sitters   who   are\r\n\r\nfinding it difficult to get citizenship, but I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  for  quite a number of people  who  are\r\n\r\nneither\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  India nor citizens of Malaysia,  who\r\n\r\nare  stateless through no fault of their own,  who\r\n\r\nhave   lived   here  and  who  have  applied   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  If  they so qualify,  I  think  they\r\n\r\nshould  be dealt with more expeditiously,  because\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is  now  tied up with  work  permits.\r\n\r\nThere  are quite a number of stateless persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and if they are permitted to live  here,\r\n\r\nsurely they should not be denied the right to work\r\n\r\nhere. Yesterday, the Prime Minister stated in this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  it is not our intention  to  withdraw\r\n\r\nwork  permits, but because of the situation  where\r\n\r\nwe have large numbers of less educated citizens we\r\n\r\nshould accommodate them and make jobs available to\r\n\r\nthem.  He  also  said that he did not  mind  other\r\n\r\npersons doing \"tough\" jobs. If that is the case, I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that when a work permit is withdrawn\r\n\r\nfrom  a  person doing a \"soft\" job, he  should  be\r\n\r\noffered a \"tough\" job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  broadcast on tourism by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance.  I  am glad that at  long  last  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance is on the right track  about\r\n\r\ntourism  when  he said that a lot of nonsense  was\r\n\r\nbeing said about how to attract tourists. He  then\r\n\r\nwent  on  to  give the correct view of  the  basic\r\n\r\ntrends  of  tourism.  I  would  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial statement on tourism should  be  given\r\n\r\nwide  publicity  to correct the  thinking  of  all\r\n\r\nthose  persons  associated with the  promotion  of\r\n\r\ntourism.  Mr Speaker, Sir, Bali for a tourist  is\r\n\r\nnot  new. Before confrontation, Bali was a selling\r\n\r\npoint  for  American  tourists.  But  because   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation  and  the  difficult  conditions  in\r\n\r\nDjakarta,  American  tourists  stopped  proceeding\r\n\r\nsouth  of  Singapore  to  Djakarta  or  Bali  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, Singapore was affected. Now that we are\r\n\r\nback  to more normal conditions, it is correct  to\r\n\r\nsay that we could benefit if Bali could be further\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and  we may not be at the  tail-end  of\r\n\r\nthis enormous Pacific tourist traffic. In fact,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  make another  suggestion  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance,  that  if  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Governments of  Australia  and\r\n\r\nAmerica  can  be persuaded to get the airlines  to\r\n\r\nlower\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfares  from America to the South Seas via  Tahiti,\r\n\r\nAustralia, Bali up to Singapore, we certainly will\r\n\r\nnot  be  at  the tail-end, but we will be  on  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  circuit of a booming tourist  traffic  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  American tourists can come either  via\r\n\r\nTokyo, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, down to Bali,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and back to the United States  or  vice\r\n\r\nversa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MrSpeaker, Sir, after a history of 150 years\r\n\r\nSingapore is now marching forward steadily into  a\r\n\r\nnew  stage. It can be expected that this new stage\r\n\r\nwill  not be smooth going all the way. It will  be\r\n\r\nbeset with difficulties and obstacles. Never  have\r\n\r\nthere been so many problems and difficulties which\r\n\r\nneed  us to rack our brains for their solution  as\r\n\r\nit  is now. But the people of Singapore have never\r\n\r\nbeen  daunted by any difficulty. We have  creative\r\n\r\nability and the capacity to accomplish tasks which\r\n\r\nothers  think  cannot be completed.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve with our group intelligence and under  the\r\n\r\ndynamic  leadership of our Government, we can  all\r\n\r\nattain a bright future if our people can be united\r\n\r\nfor one purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Addendum to the President's Speech,\r\n\r\nyou can see that we may face many difficulties. We\r\n\r\nare   not  adopting  a  negative  policy.  We  are\r\n\r\nadopting   a  positive  policy  to  increase   our\r\n\r\neconomic growth. This is the best way to enable us\r\n\r\nto  march forward. It is true to say that  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming years our social structure will not be  the\r\n\r\nsame as it is at present. We hate violence because\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that social reforms can  be  achieved\r\n\r\nthrough  peaceful means. On the other hand,  there\r\n\r\nis  the  human  desire for peaceful living.  As  a\r\n\r\nrule, people are not willing to go through violent\r\n\r\nand  bloody revolution. Ideologically,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a great change in our people ever since  our\r\n\r\nindependence. The past colonial thinking  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  replaced  by  new  ideas.  There  is  a  new\r\n\r\nattitude of self-reliance and nationalism. In  the\r\n\r\ncoming  crucial  years there will  still  be  some\r\n\r\nremnants of the old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthinking which should be eradicated. Perhaps  this\r\n\r\nis  a painful process but it is necessary. In  the\r\n\r\nnew  era  group interest should be above  personal\r\n\r\ninterest and personal enjoyment. For the  sake  of\r\n\r\nnational  interest individuals will have at  times\r\n\r\nto make some sacrifice. We must always be prepared\r\n\r\nto face any challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me talk about education. From the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  policy statement which was  broadcast\r\n\r\nover  the  air  and  from  the  Addendum  to   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech, we know  that  our  education\r\n\r\npolicy  will  go  through  a  major  change.   The\r\n\r\ntraditional  education policy of producing  white-collar  workers will be changed. The emphasis  now\r\n\r\nwill  be on the production of blue-collar workers.\r\n\r\nSir, this change is very necessary. Otherwise  the\r\n\r\nlarge  sums  of money that are being  expended  on\r\n\r\neducation will produce a large number of  students\r\n\r\nwho will not be required by society. This would be\r\n\r\na   waste   of  public  funds.  They  would   also\r\n\r\nconstitute a hindrance to social progress.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  to say that the purpose of education is  not\r\n\r\njust to enable those receiving education to have a\r\n\r\nmeans  of  making  a livelihood. Education  should\r\n\r\nalso  teach  students to develop  good  character.\r\n\r\nAbout 20,000 of our secondary school-leavers  have\r\n\r\nthe same standard of ordinary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah (Mr Ho See Beng)\r\n\r\nwalked into the Chamber and took his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But,  on the other hand, the new industries\r\n\r\nwe  are  having now lack the necessary  industrial\r\n\r\npersonnel.  This  will  undoubtedly  produce  many\r\n\r\nsocial  problems. The Government is now trying  to\r\n\r\nrectify this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfavourable  balance  in  our  society.  This  is\r\n\r\nreally a laudable act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some parents of students who still\r\n\r\nhave  the traditional bias for white-collar  work.\r\n\r\nThey  think  that white-collar work is better  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children  and that it will  ensure  them  a\r\n\r\nbetter future. They regard vocational schools as a\r\n\r\nplace  for  students  of  lower  intelligence.  If\r\n\r\npossible, they do not like their children to  have\r\n\r\na vocational education. This wrong attitude should\r\n\r\nbe  changed.  As  the  Minister  for  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology has pointed out, there are three  kinds\r\n\r\nof   technical  personnel,  namely,  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncraftsmen,  the  artisans in the middle,  and  the\r\n\r\ntechnologists  who  are  of  a  higher   standard.\r\n\r\nVocational and technical schools are not meant for\r\n\r\nstudents of low intelligence.
