Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, several Members have\r\n\r\nasked  many  questions  on the  state  of  our  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations  with Malaysia - not only Dr Ong  but  also  Mr\r\n\r\nAhmad Khalis, Mr Ravindran, Mr Sin Boon Ann, Ms Irene  Ng\r\n\r\nand  also  Mr  Steve Chia, and there was a  Question  for\r\n\r\nWritten  Answer  by Mr Zainudin.  They  have  also  asked\r\n\r\nquestions  on  a  number  of  allegations  made   against\r\n\r\nSingapore on a wide range of 'old' issues as well as  new\r\n\r\nissues, from water, Pedra Branca, the ASEAN+3 Secretariat\r\n\r\nto KD Malaya, the former Malaysian naval training base in\r\n\r\nWoodlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These allegations paint Singapore as \"insensitive\",\r\n\r\n\"arrogant\"  and  \"unneighbourly\" in the  conduct  of  our\r\n\r\nbilateral relations with Malaysia.  We are also  said  to\r\n\r\nbe \"selfish\", \"profiteering\" and \"legalistic\".  Now, they\r\n\r\neven  talk  of  war,  using as a peg a  book  that  spoke\r\n\r\nfavourably about the SAF.  The author, Tim Huxley,  is  a\r\n\r\nBritish who has no connections with us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These allegations have no basis whatsoever. KD\r\n\r\nMalaya was an old issue.  The Malaysians left their naval\r\n\r\ntraining  base in Woodlands on their own accord in  1997.\r\n\r\nWhen we revised the rent in 1991, far from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforcing  them  out,  we offered them several  options  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  base  and stay  on  here  in  Woodlands.\r\n\r\nHowever  they chose not to take up the offers and decided\r\n\r\nin 1992 to relocate their base to Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Pedra Branca, it is not true that we were\r\n\r\nreluctant to sign the Special Agreement (SA) to refer the\r\n\r\nmatter  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we were the ones who proposed referring the  issue\r\n\r\nto  the  International  Court of Justice.   Nor  have  we\r\n\r\ncarried  out construction activities recently.  The  last\r\n\r\nstructures were built well over 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, it is untrue that Singapore was the only\r\n\r\nASEAN country which had problems with the proposal for  a\r\n\r\nseparate  ASEAN+3  Secretariat located in  Kuala  Lumpur.\r\n\r\nIndonesia, among others, also did not support it.  And as\r\n\r\nfor the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) proposal, it  is\r\n\r\ncompletely false that Singapore opposed it.  In fact,  we\r\n\r\nwere one of the first countries to come out in support of\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I shall circulate fuller details\r\n\r\non these specific issues as an Annex* to my Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this afternoon, I wish to focus on water,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the core problem underlying all this  endless,\r\n\r\nvitriolic  barrage.  I have to state the  facts  on  this\r\n\r\ncentral  issue  to show what is the true  position.   The\r\n\r\nwater issue is critical to Singapore because it has grave\r\n\r\nimplications for our survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting out the facts, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nshall be releasing the correspondence between the leaders\r\n\r\nof  both countries and also the diplomatic exchanges.   I\r\n\r\nwill also circulate copies of the two Water Agreements of\r\n\r\n1961  and  1962, plus a supplementary water agreement  in\r\n\r\n1990  relating to the building of the Linggiu dam on  the\r\n\r\nJohor  River  and  the purchase by Singapore  of  treated\r\n\r\nwater  in excess of the 250 million gallons per day (mgd)\r\n\r\nfrom this river.  These are all documents for the record.\r\n\r\nMdm Deputy Speaker, I have been reluctant to release\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  documents despite misrepresentation of facts  from\r\n\r\nthe  other  side  because we have  hoped  for  a  win-win\r\n\r\nsituation.   But I have to release them now because  this\r\n\r\nhope   is  no  longer  realistic  and  because  so   much\r\n\r\nmisinformation  on the water issue has been  put  out  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia   that  needs  to  be  rebutted  by   conclusive\r\n\r\nevidence.   Despite repeated attempts to  clear  the  air\r\n\r\nthrough   various  statements  from  my   Ministry,   MFA\r\n\r\nSpokesman's   statements   as   well   as   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nstatements  that  I  have made in this  House,  Malaysian\r\n\r\nmisrepresentations have not ceased.  Recently, there have\r\n\r\neven  been  loose talk of war in some Malaysian  circles.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore  have  no  choice but  to  set  the  record\r\n\r\nstraight by releasing these documents for people to judge\r\n\r\nfor  themselves the truth of the matter.  These documents\r\n\r\nwill  clear the air for everyone, especially Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  travel  to Malaysia, read their media  and  talk  to\r\n\r\ntheir Malaysian friends. These documents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030125/20030125-HA-0752455.htm\">Volume 1 - Correspondences</a><br>\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030125/20030125-HA-0752583.htm\">Volume 2 - Agreements</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare in two volumes which will be given to Members later.\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy Speaker, I request that they be part  of  the\r\n\r\nofficial  records  of  the  House.   I  would   also   be\r\n\r\ncirculating the text of my statement later.  The text  of\r\n\r\nmy   statement  will  contain  cross-references  to   the\r\n\r\ndocuments as well as the various correspondences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, my statement has three parts.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is to make clear that the fundamental issue for\r\n\r\nus  is not the price of water as such. The vital issue is\r\n\r\nnot  how  much  we  pay, but how any  price  revision  is\r\n\r\ndecided  upon.  Malaysia wants Singapore to pay more  for\r\n\r\nwater.   But the price cannot be revised at the  will  or\r\n\r\ndictate  of Malaysia.  The 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements\r\n\r\nwere  enshrined  in  the Separation Agreement  which  was\r\n\r\nregistered  at the United Nations.  They are  fundamental\r\n\r\nto  our very existence as an independent nation.  Neither\r\n\r\nSingapore  nor  Malaysia  can unilaterally  change  them.\r\n\r\nThis is the root of the dispute between us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the negotiations on the package of issues,\r\n\r\nboth  sides  asked  for and offered various  concessions.\r\n\r\nSingapore agreed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay  more  for  existing water, but only  as  part  of  a\r\n\r\npackage  deal that included the future supply  of  water.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  agreed to settle several outstanding  bilateral\r\n\r\nissues as a package.  The documents will demonstrate this\r\n\r\nclearly.    However,  in  October  last  year,   Malaysia\r\n\r\nunilaterally decided to take the water price revision out\r\n\r\nof the package, to be discussed and decided on its own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I will give a full chronology of the talks\r\n\r\non  water.   This  will  show  that  Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\nconsistent  and  forthcoming in  the  negotiations.   The\r\n\r\ndifficulties  arose  because Malaysia repeatedly  changed\r\n\r\nits  position, and shifted their goal posts each time  we\r\n\r\nneared an agreement.  No sooner had we agreed on a  price\r\n\r\nfor  water  when they changed their minds and  upped  the\r\n\r\nprice.   After  the two countries had discussed  all  the\r\n\r\nissues  as  one  package for several years at  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nrequest,  Malaysia unilaterally and without prior  notice\r\n\r\nabandoned  the  package approach, saying that  they  only\r\n\r\nwanted to discuss the current price of water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite all these sudden twists and turns, we\r\n\r\naccommodated and persevered, never closing  the  door  on\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  in  order to reach a  mutually  beneficial\r\n\r\nagreement.   The  Malaysian allegations  against  us  are\r\n\r\ntotally  unjustified  when we  were  trying  to  find  an\r\n\r\namicable way forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of my statement is that I want to\r\n\r\nstress  that it is in the overwhelming interest  of  both\r\n\r\ncountries  to  settle our differences in accordance  with\r\n\r\ninternational law, either through the International Court\r\n\r\nof  Justice  (ICJ) or the Permanent Court of  Arbitration\r\n\r\n(PCA), or in the case of the water price revision through\r\n\r\nthe   method   provided  for  in  the  Water   Agreements\r\n\r\nthemselves, namely, arbitration according to the laws  of\r\n\r\nJohor.  This process of arbitration can determine what we\r\n\r\nhave  not been able to agree on, namely, whether Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas  the right to revise the price after a lapse of 16-17\r\n\r\nyears and, if so, by how much the revision should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Sanctity  of  the  Water Agreements  and  the  Separation\r\n\r\nAgreements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with the first part. Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  some  Singaporeans and foreign  observers  have\r\n\r\nasked  why is it that the two Governments are quarrelling\r\n\r\nover  what  appears to be a relatively small  and  simple\r\n\r\nissue  over the price of water.  Why cannot Singapore  be\r\n\r\nmore accommodating, more reasonable and pay a little more\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake  of  neighbourliness  and  good  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations?  If only the matter were that straightforward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. It is not just a matter of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue goes beyond whether we have to pay 45 sen\r\n\r\nor  60  sen  or  stick  to  3 sen.   Of  course,  we,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  are  not  going  to  be  impoverished  by  an\r\n\r\nincrease  from  3  to 45 sen.  Neither will  Malaysia  be\r\n\r\nenriched.   In fact, Prime Minister Mahathir himself  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  and  I quote: \"We don't depend on them (Singapore)\r\n\r\nto  bring us revenue to finance the government as  income\r\n\r\nfrom  selling water is a small fraction (of our revenue).\r\n\r\nIt's  not  a  major source of income for the government.\"\r\n\r\n(Bernama, 6th August 2002).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of the water price, for both\r\n\r\ncountries, is Singapore's existence as a sovereign nation\r\n\r\nseparate  from  Malaysia, and the sanctity  of  the  most\r\n\r\nsolemn   agreements  that  we  have  entered  into   with\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Water Agreements are no ordinary agreements.\r\n\r\nThey are so vital that they were confirmed and guaranteed\r\n\r\nby  both  Governments  in the 1965 Separation  Agreement,\r\n\r\nalso  known  as the Independence of Singapore  Agreement.\r\n\r\nThe  Separation Agreement was registered  at  the  United\r\n\r\nNations.  Both countries have to honour the terms of  the\r\n\r\nagreements and the guarantee in the Separation Agreement.\r\n\r\nAny  breach  of  the  Water  Agreements  must  call  into\r\n\r\nquestion  the Separation Agreement and can undermine  our\r\n\r\nvery existence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, not many people know that\r\n\r\nMalaysia also gave effect to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Separation Agreement by an amendment to the Malaysian\r\n\r\nConstitution  on 9th August 1965 through an  Act  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Parliament, Act 53 of 1965.  Section 14  reads,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of Singapore shall guarantee that\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Utilities Board of Singapore  shall  on  and\r\n\r\nafter Singapore Day abide by the terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nthe  two Water Agreements dated 1st September, 1961,  and\r\n\r\n29th  September,  1962,  entered into  between  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Singapore and the Government of the State  of\r\n\r\nJohore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of Malaysia shall guarantee that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the  State of Johore will  on  and  after\r\n\r\nSingapore  Day also abide by the terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nthe said two Water Agreements.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the guarantees are an integral part\r\n\r\nof  an  international  agreement solemnly  entered  into,\r\n\r\nadopted  by  a  constitutional amendment in Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nlater   registered   with   the   United   Nations.    In\r\n\r\ninternational  law,  both parties must  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nWater  Agreements  are  observed  and  neither  side  can\r\n\r\nunilaterally   vary  their  terms  and  conditions.    If\r\n\r\nMalaysia  can unilaterally revise the price of raw  water\r\n\r\nfrom  3 sen to 60 sen, and then from 60 sen to RM 3, then\r\n\r\nthey  can eventually fix it at RM 8, which they  said  is\r\n\r\nthe price since that is what Hong Kong pays to China,  or\r\n\r\nto  any  other  price.  The sanctity  of  the  Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement would have been breached.  All other agreements\r\n\r\nwe  have  signed  with Malaysia will become  meaningless.\r\n\r\nNor  will any new agreement we conclude with Malaysia  be\r\n\r\nworth anything.  In such a world, there would be no basis\r\n\r\nfor   international  relations.   There   would   be   no\r\n\r\nfoundation  for international law, which all  UN  members\r\n\r\nhave a duty to uphold, in order to maintain a stable  and\r\n\r\npeaceful international order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has actually acknowledged the importance of\r\n\r\nthe Water Agreements for a long time.  For example, three\r\n\r\nyears  after our independence in 1968 at a very important\r\n\r\nconference of plenipotentiaries, the UN Conference on the\r\n\r\nLaw  of Treaties, mind you, the Conference was on the Law\r\n\r\nof   Treaties,  the  Malaysian  representative  to   that\r\n\r\nConference, Mr M. O. Ariff said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some treaties might be so fundamental to the very\r\n\r\nexistence  of  States  that  they  simply  could  not  be\r\n\r\ndispensed with, whatever political differences might\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\narise.   For  example, the new island State of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  dependent  on  Malaysia for its  water  supply;  the\r\n\r\ntreaty  under  which  Malaysia had to  supply  a  certain\r\n\r\nquantity  of  water  daily  to  Singapore  could  not  be\r\n\r\nterminated  or suspended between the two states  for  any\r\n\r\npolitical reason.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in early 2002, Prime Minister Mahathir\r\n\r\nbegan  to  criticise  the water agreements  as  allegedly\r\n\r\nunequal  treaties  foisted on Malaysia  by  the  British.\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Mahathir said that the price  for  water\r\n\r\nunder  the  agreements  was too  low  and  that  as  such\r\n\r\n\"practically, they (Singapore) get their water free\".  He\r\n\r\nalso  said that \"also, the agreement was drawn up by  the\r\n\r\nBritish  which of course favoured Singapore.\"  Later,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  \"what we know is that we have been charging them  3\r\n\r\nsen  per  thousand gallons of raw water and we also  know\r\n\r\nthat  countries like Hong Kong buy their raw  water  from\r\n\r\nmainland  China  at  RM 8 per thousand  gallons\".   Other\r\n\r\nMalaysian leaders took up the refrain and stoked a frenzy\r\n\r\nof  media  criticism  against  Singapore.   For  example,\r\n\r\nMenteri  Besar  of Johor Ghani said \"all this  while,  we\r\n\r\nhave been supplying Singapore with free water...\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deliberate raising of Malaysian ground\r\n\r\nsentiments seriously alarmed Singapore.  It could  easily\r\n\r\nhave   spiralled  out  of  control  and  led   to   grave\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on 5th February last year, we sent\r\n\r\nMalaysia  a diplomatic note, Third Person Note  (TPN)  in\r\n\r\nwhich we pointed out that \"pending a binding agreement on\r\n\r\nthe  overall package of issues, all legal obligations  of\r\n\r\nthe existing Water Agreements and the Points of Agreement\r\n\r\n(POA)   remain   in  force  and  are  binding   on   both\r\n\r\nGovernments\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reminded them that the Water Agreements are\r\n\r\nbinding  legal arrangements duly confirmed and guaranteed\r\n\r\nby  the  Governments  of Malaysia and  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nSeparation Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said that the Separation Agreement \"is the\r\n\r\nfundamental   basis  of  Singapore's  existence   as   an\r\n\r\nindependent sovereign nation\" and that \"any variation  of\r\n\r\nthe Water Agreements without the consent of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboth  Governments  will  be a breach  of  the  Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement and that cannot be accepted\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also pointed out that \"further negotiations on\r\n\r\nnew  agreements  pertaining to the long  term  supply  of\r\n\r\nwater to Singapore can only proceed on the basis that the\r\n\r\nagreements  already concluded cannot be  altered  without\r\n\r\nthe  explicit  consent of both parties.   And  we  added,\r\n\r\notherwise  any new agreements on water can  similarly  be\r\n\r\naltered   without   consent.   This   will   have   grave\r\n\r\nimplications for bilateral relations.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th March 2002, the Malaysian Government replied\r\n\r\nto  Singapore's demarche.  Malaysia's TPN  conveyed  \"its\r\n\r\ncommitment to resolving the issue of water with Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the context of an agreement on the overall package of\r\n\r\nissues\",  and  they also said, \"at no time  was  there  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that the Government of Malaysia would  depart\r\n\r\nfrom  such  a commitment.\"  They said that any suggestion\r\n\r\nto  the  contrary is \"misleading and constitutes a  gross\r\n\r\nmisinterpretation  of  the well  known  position  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Government.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We replied through another TPN on 25th March 2002\r\n\r\ntaking  note of their commitment and assurances.  And  we\r\n\r\nalso reiterated our own commitment to reaching a mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial   agreement  on  the  package  of  outstanding\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Minister Syed Hamid himself noted at the\r\n\r\nFirst  Ministerial Meeting at Putrajaya on 1st July 2002,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Malaysia has repeatedly said that it will honour\r\n\r\nthe  1961 and 1962 Agreements until their expiry in  2011\r\n\r\nand 2061 respectively..'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe added:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. During the Separation of Singapore, Malaysia did\r\n\r\nnot  propose  for  the Agreements  to  be  reviewed.   It\r\n\r\ncontinues to honour the Agreements and such commitment is\r\n\r\nfurther  reinforced when Malaysia signed  the  Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement in 1965.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were thus flabbergasted when their Minister in\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's  Department  Rais  Yatim  publicly\r\n\r\ndeclared   on  24th  October  2002,  that  as  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nsolution,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia  could enact domestic legislation to render  the\r\n\r\nWater Agreements null and void.  But as I had said at our\r\n\r\nsitting  on 31st October 2002, no country can  evade  its\r\n\r\ninternational treaty obligations by enacting  a  domestic\r\n\r\nlaw.   This  is  a  very  well established  principle  of\r\n\r\ninternational law.  Should any country choose to  violate\r\n\r\nthat principle, it would signal to the world that it  can\r\n\r\nand   will   do  likewise  for  any  other  international\r\n\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that contrary to what Malaysia has\r\n\r\nalleged, these Water Agreements of 1961 and 1962 were not\r\n\r\nfixed  by  the  British  in  Singapore's  favour.   These\r\n\r\nAgreements were signed by the Johore State Government and\r\n\r\nthe Singapore City Council in 1961 and 1962 respectively.\r\n\r\nBy   then,  Malaysia  was  already  an  independent   and\r\n\r\nsovereign  nation,  and  Singapore  had  achieved   self-government.   It  is really absurd to  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nFederal Government of an independent and sovereign nation\r\n\r\nMalaysia  would allow the Johore State Government  to  be\r\n\r\nmanipulated by the British to sign an agreement that  was\r\n\r\nagainst Malaysia's national interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Chronology of the Package and Water Agreements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me address the allegations that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas been the unreasonable party in the negotiations.   To\r\n\r\ndo  so,  I will have to recount to Members in some detail\r\n\r\nhow the matters unfolded over the last few years.  A full\r\n\r\nchronology is set out in the bundle of documents, but let\r\n\r\nme take you through the major milestones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Malaysia experienced problems in the Asian\r\n\r\nFinancial  crisis  in  1997-98,  at  Malaysia's  request,\r\n\r\nSingapore began to discuss a financial assistance package\r\n\r\nfor  Malaysia  in  the context of a framework  for  wider\r\n\r\ncooperation.  The framework included the supply of  water\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  after  the expiry  of  the  current  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements.   Singapore's assistance entailed significant\r\n\r\nmarket   risks   and  potential  financial   losses   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This framework would make it politically\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible  for  Singapore to carry these financial  risks.\r\n\r\nThe  price  review  of  water  under  the  current  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements  was  never  raised  by  then  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir and was not part of that framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ASEAN Summit in Hanoi in December 1998, Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Mahathir  informed  Prime  Minister  Goh   that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  no  longer  needed  financial  assistance  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Prime  Minister Mahathir proposed  that  the\r\n\r\noutstanding  bilateral issues be resolved together  as  a\r\n\r\npackage.   In  the  interest of  clearing  the  decks  of\r\n\r\nbilateral issues, Prime Minister Goh agreed to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the items in the final package as from\r\n\r\nAugust 2000?  The key items in the package were:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future supply of water for 100 years after 2061;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of Malaysian airspace by RSAF;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variation in the terms of the POA, including giving\r\n\r\nan  additional 12 parcels of KTM or Malayan Railway  land\r\n\r\nat Bukit Timah for joint development;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;early withdrawal of CPF monies amounting to some RM\r\n\r\n3 billion by West Malaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later, as I will elaborate, two more items were\r\n\r\nadded to the package by Prime Minister Mahathir, namely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Malaysian proposal to replace the Causeway with\r\n\r\na bridge; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revision of the current water price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting between Prime Minister Goh and Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Mahathir in Hanoi was followed by three  rounds\r\n\r\nof  negotiations  on the package at the officials'  level\r\n\r\nfrom March to May 1999 where not much progress was made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, with Prime Minister Goh's approval,\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister Lee visited Kuala Lumpur to try to  make\r\n\r\nprogress on the package .  He worked through then Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  Tun  Daim Zainuddin.  After first  meeting  Tun\r\n\r\nDaim,  Senior Minister had a four-eye meeting with  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Mahathir on 15th August 2000.   Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrought  into  the package two new issues: the  price  of\r\n\r\ncurrent water, and the replacement of the Causeway with a\r\n\r\nnew   bridge.   Senior  Minister  Lee  agreed  to   these\r\n\r\ninclusions.  The two leaders reached agreement on a  list\r\n\r\nof  items, including a new price of raw water for 45  sen\r\n\r\nper  1,000  gallons  for both current and  future  water.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that the current water agreements\r\n\r\nfeatured in the bilateral package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that meeting, Senior Minister Lee wrote to\r\n\r\nTun Daim on 24th August 2000 to confirm the list of items\r\n\r\nwhich he and Prime Minister Mahathir had agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st February 2001, Prime Minister Mahathir\r\n\r\nreplied  to Senior Minister Lee in which he said, \"Johore\r\n\r\nbelieves  that a fair price would be 60 cents  (sic)  per\r\n\r\nmgd  (sic)  of  raw water\" and this \"should  be  reviewed\r\n\r\nevery  five  years\".  Mgd is million gallons  a  day.   I\r\n\r\nthink  there was a typographical error.  I think what  he\r\n\r\nmeant was \"60 sen per thousand gallons\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd April 2001, Senior Minister Lee replied to\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Mahathir pointing out that  this  was  a\r\n\r\nvariation  from their oral understanding of  15th  August\r\n\r\n2000 which was 45 sen for current and future water.   And\r\n\r\nnow  Prime Minister Mahathir was proposing a higher price\r\n\r\nof 60 sen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2001, Senior Minister Lee made a second\r\n\r\nvisit  to  KL to try to close the gaps on the package  of\r\n\r\nissues.   After  their  meeting on  4th  September  2001,\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister Lee and Prime Minister Mahathir  held  a\r\n\r\njoint  press conference to announce that they had  agreed\r\n\r\non  a  basic  skeleton of an agreement on the package  of\r\n\r\nbilateral  issues.  Senior Minister Lee  told  the  media\r\n\r\nthere, in Putrajaya, that Singapore had offered to pay 45\r\n\r\nsen  for  raw  water  supplied under  the  current  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements,  although we were not legally obliged  to  do\r\n\r\nso.   He explained that this offer was made in return for\r\n\r\nassured  water supply from Malaysia, beyond 2061,  at  60\r\n\r\nsen per 1,000 gallons for raw water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st September 2001, Senior Minister Lee wrote to\r\n\r\nPrime Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMahathir confirming and elaborating on this offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say here that the Malaysians have argued that\r\n\r\nsince  Senior Minister Lee had offered 45 sen for current\r\n\r\nwater,  it  showed that Singapore had, in fact,  accepted\r\n\r\nthat  Malaysia  had the right to review.  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir  said, \"If we don't have the legal  right,  then\r\n\r\nwhy  did Lee Kuan Yew come and see me and suggested  that\r\n\r\nthe  water price should be revised upwards to 45 sen  and\r\n\r\nthen  we said it should be 60 (sen), 15 sen more?\"   But,\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy Speaker, it is clear from the documents  that\r\n\r\nwhen  Senior  Minister Lee offered  45  sen  for  current\r\n\r\nwater,  it was \"in return for assured water supply beyond\r\n\r\n2061\"  at  60 sen.  Senior Minister Lee never  said  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had  the  right to review the  price  of  water\r\n\r\noutside the package, which included water beyond 2061  as\r\n\r\nwell as airspace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking up the chronology again, between 18th\r\n\r\nOctober  and  10th  December  2001,  there  were  further\r\n\r\nexchanges  of  letters between Senior  Minister  Lee  and\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Mahathir to clarify various details of the\r\n\r\nbilateral package, including the price of water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th March 2002, Prime Minister Mahathir wrote to\r\n\r\nSenior   Minister   Lee   enclosing   totally   different\r\n\r\nproposals.   This  was  after Prime  Minister  Mahathir's\r\n\r\nstatements to the press about RM8 being the real price of\r\n\r\nwater.  Under Malaysia's new proposal, the 60 sen  price,\r\n\r\nwhich  he  had  earlier agreed, would now apply  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  five  years from 2002 to 2007, and  from  2007  to\r\n\r\n2011, the price will be RM3 per 1,000 gallons.  And  from\r\n\r\n2011  until  the  expiry of the 1962 Water  Agreement  in\r\n\r\n2061,  the price of water would be revised annually  from\r\n\r\nRM3, based on the average inflation rate of Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about future supply of water after 2061?\r\n\r\nIn that letter, Malaysia proposed that negotiations begin\r\n\r\nonly in 2058; in other words, just three years before the\r\n\r\nexpiry  of  the  1962 Agreement.  Malaysia also  proposed\r\n\r\nthat the new water agreement would be valid for 100 years\r\n\r\nfrom 2002.  In effect, this would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  that the new agreement would only last for 40 years\r\n\r\nafter the expiry of the 1962 Water Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Senior Minister Lee replied on 11th March 2002\r\n\r\nthat  this  had  completely changed from  what  they  had\r\n\r\ndiscussed  before  and  in their subsequent  exchange  of\r\n\r\nnotes and letters.  He said that Singapore would have  to\r\n\r\nstudy the implications of Malaysia's new offers and would\r\n\r\nrespond in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th April 2002, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong\r\n\r\nwrote  to  Prime  Minister Mahathir to  give  Singapore's\r\n\r\nresponse to Prime Minister Mahathir's letter of 4th March\r\n\r\n2002.   Prime Minister Goh stressed that he did not  want\r\n\r\nbilateral relations to be always strained by the issue of\r\n\r\nwater.   Hence, for the sake of good long-term relations,\r\n\r\nhe  said that Singapore would produce as much water as it\r\n\r\ncould   to  supplement  the  existing  Water  Agreements.\r\n\r\nSingapore would ramp up our NEWater programme to  replace\r\n\r\nthe  supply of water under the 1961 Water Agreement  when\r\n\r\nit expires in 2011.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for water after 2061, Prime Minister Goh accepted\r\n\r\nMalaysia's offer of 100 mgd of raw water and 150  mgd  of\r\n\r\ntreated  water.  On price, as Malaysia had withdrawn  its\r\n\r\noffer of 60 sen for current water and future water, Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh proposed to peg the price of future water to\r\n\r\nan  agreed  percentage  of the cost  of  the  alternative\r\n\r\nsource  of water, ie, NEWater.  Why?  This was to provide\r\n\r\na  definite  basis  for  future price  revisions.   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh reminded Prime Minister Mahathir that  this\r\n\r\nagreement should be valid for 100 years from 2061 as this\r\n\r\nhad  been  the basis for negotiations, and not 100  years\r\n\r\nfrom 2002.  Prime Minister Goh did not offer revision  of\r\n\r\nthe current water price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Prime Minister Mahathir's letter of 4th March\r\n\r\n2002  and  Prime Minister Goh's reply of 11th April  2002\r\n\r\nthen formed the basis for further discussions between the\r\n\r\nrespective Foreign Ministers and officials on the package\r\n\r\nof  issues.  Two Ministerial Meetings were held, as  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow, the first in Putrajaya in July 2002, and the second\r\n\r\nin Singapore in September 2002.  I updated Members on the\r\n\r\noutcome of these two meetings on 23rd July 2002 and  31st\r\n\r\nOctober  2002  respectively,  and  the  Senior  Officials\r\n\r\nMeeting  in  Johor  Baru from 16-17th October  2002.   In\r\n\r\nshort, really, there was no progress on the key issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, Malaysia came out with another\r\n\r\nnew  formula under which the price of raw water  in  2002\r\n\r\nwould be RM6.25 per 1,000 gallons.  They did this at  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  talks,  and they did not  explain  how  this\r\n\r\nprice  could  be  justified under the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nwater agreements.   They also insisted that they had  the\r\n\r\nright  to review the price of current water, when we  had\r\n\r\npointed  out  that they had lost their right  of  review.\r\n\r\nThey also said that they would not negotiate the terms of\r\n\r\nfuture water supply until 2059 - now it is 2059 - ie, two\r\n\r\nyears  before  the  expiry of the 1962  Water  Agreement,\r\n\r\ninstead  of the three years before the expiry,  as  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Mahathir had proposed earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Second Ministerial Meeting, as I had told\r\n\r\nthe  House,  when Prime Minister Goh met  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir in Putrajaya on 8th October 2002, Prime Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir said that Malaysia wanted to \"decouple the water\r\n\r\nissue\"  from  the  other  items in  the  package.   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  responded at that  meeting  that  all  the\r\n\r\nissues were tied together.  If the water issue was  taken\r\n\r\nout  of the package, Singapore would have less leeway  to\r\n\r\nmake concessions on the other issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would recall the many statements in the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media  and  from  Malaysian  politicians  that\r\n\r\nmisrepresented  what transpired at that  meeting  between\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Goh  and Prime Minister  Mahathir.   The\r\n\r\nMalaysians  alleged that Singapore had agreed  to  delink\r\n\r\nwater  from  the  package  and  had  accepted  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nprerogative to review the price of current water.   Those\r\n\r\nstatements  distorted what was discussed at  the  meeting\r\n\r\nand, in fact, impugned Prime Minister Goh's integrity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days after his meeting with Prime Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir, Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreceived a letter from Prime Minister Mahathir dated  7th\r\n\r\nOctober 2002, ie, one day before their meeting.   In  his\r\n\r\nletter,  Prime Minister Mahathir informed Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh that Malaysia had decided to \"discontinue the package\r\n\r\napproach and give the highest priority to first resolving\r\n\r\nthe  water  issue, particularly the price review  of  raw\r\n\r\nwater\".   In other words, even before Prime Minister  Goh\r\n\r\nhad  met  Prime Minister Mahathir, Malaysia  had  already\r\n\r\nunilaterally discontinued the package approach, which had\r\n\r\nbeen agreed to by both Prime Ministers, and reaffirmed in\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  TPN of 14th March 2002.  Hon.  Members  would\r\n\r\nremember  that I had quoted the TPN, that they said  that\r\n\r\nit   is  outrageous  that  you  should  even  make   that\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that we would do anything other than  proceed\r\n\r\nin accordance with the package approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th October 2002, Prime Minister Goh replied to\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Mahathir, reminding him that they had both\r\n\r\nagreed on the package approach in December 1998 and  that\r\n\r\nwas  why Singapore had been prepared to make concessions.\r\n\r\nBut now that Malaysia wanted to deal with the water issue\r\n\r\nseparately  and discontinue the package approach,  trade-offs  against other issues in the package were no  longer\r\n\r\npossible.  Henceforth, Singapore would have to deal  with\r\n\r\nwater  and  the other issues on their stand-alone  merits\r\n\r\nand no longer as a package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, the Singapore officials attended the\r\n\r\nmeeting in Johor Baru to discuss the water issue from 16-17th  October 2002.   At that meeting, it was clear  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had no intention of striking a deal  on  future\r\n\r\nwater.   This  left only the current water price  on  the\r\n\r\nagenda.  Now we could no longer trade off a current water\r\n\r\nprice  revision  against  the  supply  of  future  water.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we have no choice but to rely on the  express\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Water  Agreements,  and   that   any\r\n\r\nvariations  must be in accordance with the terms  of  the\r\n\r\nWater Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, from this chronology of events,\r\n\r\nMembers  can see how Malaysia has repeatedly changed  its\r\n\r\nposition,  not only on the water issue, but also  on  the\r\n\r\nentire package negotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, having agreed to 45 sen for current and\r\n\r\nfuture water in 2000, they then raised their demand to 60\r\n\r\nsen.   When  we counter-offered 45 sen for current  water\r\n\r\nand  60  sen  for future water, they raised their  demand\r\n\r\nfurther  -  an immediate increase to 60 sen  for  current\r\n\r\nwater  and then RM3 from 2007.  And, later, they came  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  figure of RM6.25 for current  water.   As  you\r\n\r\nknow,   Prime  Minister  Mahathir  recently  acknowledged\r\n\r\npublicly  that he had proposed 60 sen to Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nLee,  but  he  said  that he had been  later  advised  by\r\n\r\nMalaysian officials that the price was too low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the starting point for the negotiations\r\n\r\nsince  1998 had been the supply of water for another  100\r\n\r\nyears  after  2061.   But in March 2002,  the  Malaysians\r\n\r\nreduced  this  to 40 years, and only at a formula  to  be\r\n\r\nnegotiated  in  2058  and to supply treated  water  at  a\r\n\r\nformula  to  be negotiated every 20 years.  On  2nd  July\r\n\r\n2002,  Malaysia again agreed to 100 years but now with  a\r\n\r\nprice  formula  based  on rates benchmarked  against  the\r\n\r\nChina-Hong  Kong model (or RM8) and other  models.   And,\r\n\r\nfinally,  on  2nd  September  2002,  Malaysia  said  that\r\n\r\nnegotiations on future water can only take place in 2059.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Malaysians committed themselves to\r\n\r\nresolving the issues as a package from December  1998  to\r\n\r\nSeptember  2002.  However, Prime Minister Mahathir  later\r\n\r\nunilaterally took water price revision out of the package\r\n\r\nby  his  letter  of 7th October, without informing  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh when they met on 8th October  that  he  had\r\n\r\nwritten to Prime Minister Goh the day before to have  the\r\n\r\nwater issue dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking current water out of the package, the\r\n\r\nMalaysians wanted to get this price revision without  any\r\n\r\ncommitment to give future water supply in exchange.  They\r\n\r\nhave  changed  the  package deal Prime Minister  Mahathir\r\n\r\nfirst  offered  to Senior Minister Lee in  KL  in  August\r\n\r\n2000,  and  then  followed up  in  a  letter  dated  21st\r\n\r\nFebruary  2001,  where  he named 60  sen  as  what  Johor\r\n\r\nconsidered a \"fair price\".  But the Malaysians  know,  as\r\n\r\nthey have repeatedly acknowledged, they could not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder international law unilaterally revise the price  or\r\n\r\nother provisions of the Water Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, on our part, we have tried our\r\n\r\nbest  to accommodate Malaysia's successive new positions.\r\n\r\nEven   though  Malaysia  had  repeatedly  shifted   their\r\n\r\ngoalposts,   Singapore   has   not   walked   away   from\r\n\r\nnegotiations.   In  fact,  we  attended  the  Johor  Baru\r\n\r\nmeeting in October 2002 in good faith just six days after\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians had unilaterally discontinued the package\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should also note, I think, that four out of\r\n\r\nthe  six items in the package - current water price,  POA\r\n\r\nvariation, CPF and the bridge - were to benefit Malaysia.\r\n\r\nSingapore was not legally obliged to pay more for current\r\n\r\nwater,  we are not obliged legally to vary the Points  of\r\n\r\nAgreement,  or  to  make  special arrangements  for  West\r\n\r\nMalaysians  to  withdraw their CPF monies early.  And  we\r\n\r\nalso  had no interest in demolishing the Causeway and  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  bridge  in  its place.  Singapore's  overriding\r\n\r\ninterest  in  the  package was  future  water.   We  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  agree to the items which  Malaysia  wanted,\r\n\r\nincluding  a  current  water  price  revision,  only   in\r\n\r\nexchange  for Malaysia agreeing to provide us a long-term\r\n\r\nsupply of water beyond 2061, and RSAF access to Malaysian\r\n\r\nairspace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that these concessions to Malaysia\r\n\r\nwould have been at a considerable cost to us.  They  have\r\n\r\nto  be  seen  in the context of the overall package  deal\r\n\r\nbeing  negotiated and, as we have said before, in an  MFA\r\n\r\nstatement  on  2nd February 2002, \"the  total  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney that Malaysia will receive when other items in  the\r\n\r\npackage   are  factored  in  will  be  over  1.5  billion\r\n\r\nringgit.\"   This did not include the cost of  over  S$500\r\n\r\nmillion, cost to us, for building our half of the  bridge\r\n\r\nand  a  new  Customs,  Immigration and  Quarantine  (CIQ)\r\n\r\ncomplex.   But,  we  thought  that  all  these  would  be\r\n\r\njustified if we could secure future water.  This was  why\r\n\r\nwhen   Prime  Minister  Mahathir  proposed  the   package\r\n\r\napproach in 1998, Prime Minister Goh agreed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried to meet their demands as long as future\r\n\r\nwater  supply  was  on offer as the  quid  pro  quo.   As\r\n\r\nnegotiations went on, we became aware that they  did  not\r\n\r\nwant to sign an agreement on future water supplies.   All\r\n\r\nthey  promised at the final meeting in Johor Baru was  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the  matter in 2059, two years before  the  1962\r\n\r\nWater Agreement ends.  Members will understand why I  say\r\n\r\nthat  this  has  pushed  us to  prepare  for  a  negative\r\n\r\noutcome,  one that requires us to develop our  capability\r\n\r\nfor  NEWater and desalination.  These are no light  tasks\r\n\r\nfor us to undertake.  We will need many years to build up\r\n\r\nthe  know-how,  keep abreast with technological  advances\r\n\r\nand,  just  as important, we must prepare psychologically\r\n\r\nour people for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having unfolded the story of how the negotiations\r\n\r\nwent,  and  I  hope  Members will  be  able  to  see  how\r\n\r\nreasonable Singapore has been, now let me reflect on  the\r\n\r\nway forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding our efforts to reach an agreement,\r\n\r\nwe  clearly  find ourselves at an impasse.   So,  Members\r\n\r\nnaturally may ask, what next?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir and Foreign Minister Syed\r\n\r\nHamid  had  spoken  about referring the  water  issue  to\r\n\r\ninternational  arbitration  by  the  Permanent  Court  of\r\n\r\nArbitration (PCA).  On 28th December 2002, when our media\r\n\r\nasked  me about this, I said it was a great pity that  we\r\n\r\nhave not been able to reach agreement on the package, but\r\n\r\nSingapore,  obviously, could not force  Malaysia  to  the\r\n\r\nnegotiating table if it chooses not to do so.   Hence,  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that if Malaysia proposes to submit the water issue\r\n\r\nto PCA arbitration, Singapore would have to agree, albeit\r\n\r\nreluctantly, in the interest of overcoming the impasse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my surprise, their Berita Harian (30th December\r\n\r\n2002)  reported Foreign Minister Syed Hamid as responding\r\n\r\nthat  the option of referring the water issue to PCA  for\r\n\r\narbitration did not arise, although they were  quoted  as\r\n\r\nsuggesting this in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if Malaysia does not wish to send the matter\r\n\r\nfor arbitration to the PCA, a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld   organisation   which   is   renowned   for    its\r\n\r\nimpartiality, then what is the next best solution?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to have recourse to arbitration in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  provisions  of  the  Water  Agreements.    The\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  Clauses 21 and 19 of the  1961  and  1962\r\n\r\nWater  Agreements respectively provide for the settlement\r\n\r\nof   disputes   arising  under  the  Agreements.    Those\r\n\r\nprovisions  stipulate  that  where  disputes  cannot   be\r\n\r\nresolved, the matter shall be referred to arbitration \"in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  and subject to the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\narbitration  law at the time of such dispute existing  in\r\n\r\nthe State of Johore\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Johor State\r\n\r\nSecretary  had sent letters to the PUB dated 14th  August\r\n\r\n2002  seeking to give Notice of price review under Clause\r\n\r\n17  and  Clause 14 of the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements,\r\n\r\nrespectively.   As  Singapore's  position  was  that   as\r\n\r\nMalaysia had lost the right of review, the PUB replied on\r\n\r\n9th  October 2002 that it did not accept that  the  Johor\r\n\r\nState  Government was still entitled to serve  notice  to\r\n\r\nseek  a  review of the charge of raw water under the  two\r\n\r\nWater Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may interject here, on this business of\r\n\r\nthe  price  review of current water, Members will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  I told the House on the 31st October sitting,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian leaders had publicly said that it was  not\r\n\r\nan  oversight or mistake that Malaysia did not review the\r\n\r\nprice  of  current  water  in  1986/87,  but  it  was   a\r\n\r\ndeliberate  move.   Dr  Mahathir said  Malaysia  did  not\r\n\r\nrevise  the  water pricing when it was due  because  they\r\n\r\nthought  Singapore would also revise the price of treated\r\n\r\nwater  supplied  to  Malaysia.   (Bernama,  11th  October\r\n\r\n2002).   Johor  State Assembly Speaker Zainalabidin  Mohd\r\n\r\nZain  also said that the Johor Government had not made  a\r\n\r\nmistake  in  not pressing for a review in 1986  and  said\r\n\r\n\"there  was  no  point  in doing  so  because  Johor  was\r\n\r\ndependent on Singapore for its treated water supply,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore would have also increased its price of  treated\r\n\r\nwater sold to Johor\" (New Straits Times, 3rd July 2002).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Second Ministerial Meeting in September 2002\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  the Notice of price review which Johor had sent  to\r\n\r\nPUB \"made references to Clauses 17 and 14 of the 1961 and\r\n\r\n<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water  Agreements  respectively  as  well  as   to\r\n\r\narbitration  in  the event that both  countries  fail  to\r\n\r\nreach  agreement.\"  These Clauses 17 and  14,  the  price\r\n\r\nreview clauses, provide that \"in the event of any dispute\r\n\r\nor  differences  arising  under the  provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nclause  the  same  shall be referred  to  arbitration  as\r\n\r\nhereinafter provided.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Malaysia, through these formal\r\n\r\nnotices,  has  effectively taken steps towards  referring\r\n\r\nits water dispute with Singapore to arbitration.  At that\r\n\r\ntime,  we  were  reluctant to go along  this  arbitration\r\n\r\nroute  because  we  still hoped for  an  agreement  on  a\r\n\r\npackage deal including future water.  However, now it has\r\n\r\nbecome  clear  that  we cannot expect renewal  of  future\r\n\r\nwater  supply.   As  this removes the basis  for  further\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  we are ready to have the dispute  resolved\r\n\r\nthrough arbitration according to the laws of Johor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question as to whether there is still a right of\r\n\r\nreview, as well as the quantum of the price revision, can\r\n\r\nboth  be  resolved through the legal process as  provided\r\n\r\nfor in the two Water Agreements?  In other words, this is\r\n\r\nthe  way that we are also resolving Malaysia's claim over\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca.  If, in fact, Johor has not lost the right\r\n\r\nof  revision  by not exercising it in 1986/87,  then  the\r\n\r\narbitrator  tribunal's award on the price  revision  will\r\n\r\ntake  effect from the date when Johor gave its Notice  to\r\n\r\nPUB  as  provided for in the two Agreements.  As Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas commenced this process, then I say, let the matter be\r\n\r\nsettled through arbitration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, indeed, I want to stress that\r\n\r\npeaceful  and  amicable settlement of disputes  has  been\r\n\r\nSingapore's  consistent approach.  For the  Pedra  Branca\r\n\r\nissue, we had proposed, and they have agreed, to refer it\r\n\r\nto the ICJ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as concerned as Mr Steve Chia about the loose\r\n\r\ntalk by the Malaysian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders  in  the  Malaysia media  about  \"war\".   Bernama\r\n\r\nreported  Foreign  Minister Syed Hamid on  31st  December\r\n\r\n2002,  saying, \"Singapore has two choices.  If it refuses\r\n\r\nto  compromise ... go to war\".  In his New Year  message,\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Mahathir said \"we promise that if  anyone\r\n\r\nviolates  our  freedom, they will get what  they  call  a\r\n\r\n`bloody  nose'\"  (New Straits Times, 1st  January  2003).\r\n\r\nAsked  by  reporters  the following day,  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nMahathir  did not specify which country he was  referring\r\n\r\nto,  but neither did he categorically rule out Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  further encouraged the Malaysian media to  play  up\r\n\r\nSingapore's alleged forward defence strategy and link  it\r\n\r\nto   Singapore's  \"arrogance\"  in  the  conduct  of   its\r\n\r\nbilateral  relations  with  Malaysia.  This  was  quickly\r\n\r\nfollowed by remarks by various Malaysian leaders publicly\r\n\r\nemphasising   their   military  capability,   the   MAF's\r\n\r\ncapability, in defending Malaysia from external  threats.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak said that\r\n\r\nthe  MAF  had experience fighting in a real war and  that\r\n\r\nsophisticated weaponry systems were not the yardstick  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  whether a country could win a war (Bernama,  7th\r\n\r\nJanuary 2003).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst all the bellicose talk of war, the Malaysian\r\n\r\nmedia  created a furore over Tim Huxley's book \"Defending\r\n\r\nthe  Lion  City\".   Now,  this book,  based  on  academic\r\n\r\nresearch   on   the  SAF's  capabilities,  was   actually\r\n\r\npublished by a British academic from Hull University more\r\n\r\nthan  two years ago.  Back then, the Malaysian media  did\r\n\r\nnot  pay  any attention to this book.  So, one  can  only\r\n\r\nspeculate why the Malaysian media have chosen to do their\r\n\r\nbook reviews only now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, there were almost daily articles\r\n\r\nin   the  Malaysian  Malay  language  press  playing   up\r\n\r\nSingapore's  alleged  aggressive  intentions.   On   18th\r\n\r\nJanuary   2003,   Berita  Harian  (Malaysia)   recklessly\r\n\r\nalleged, and I quote,  - I think Members should note this\r\n\r\nbecause this is not in English, readily available to  all\r\n\r\n-  \"Singapore  has stealthily embarked on a  bioterrorism\r\n\r\ndefence program, and that it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  set  aside  more than RM201 million specifically  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  R&D  to  build  up its  bioterrorism  defence\r\n\r\nsystem.   History  has  proven that  every  country  that\r\n\r\nundertakes  R&D in biodefence will also end up  by  doing\r\n\r\nR&D into weapons for biological attacks.  Singapore is no\r\n\r\nexception to such thinking.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any evidence to substantiate their\r\n\r\nallegations,  they  accuse the  Singapore  Government  of\r\n\r\nbreaching its obligations under international conventions\r\n\r\nit  has signed against the possession of Weapons of  Mass\r\n\r\nDestruction  (WMD).   Such  war-mongering  articles,   it\r\n\r\nshould  be  noted,  are  found especially  in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  press, which can only be designed  to  stir  up\r\n\r\nanimosities in their Malay population against Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, such loose talk of war is both\r\n\r\nirresponsible  and dangerous.  It whips up emotions  that\r\n\r\ncould   become  difficult  to  control.    In   such   an\r\n\r\natmosphere, the Malaysian navy and marine police  vessels\r\n\r\nhave    escalated   their   intrusions   into   Singapore\r\n\r\nterritorial  waters  off Pedra Branca  in  the  past  one\r\n\r\nmonth.   Such provocative actions are not only senseless,\r\n\r\nbut  dangerous.  Why senseless?  Senseless, because  both\r\n\r\nsides   have   agreed  to  refer  the  dispute   to   the\r\n\r\nInternational  Court of Justice, and such actions  cannot\r\n\r\nin  any  way  affect the outcome or the decision  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational court.  Dangerous, because of the  risk  of\r\n\r\naccidents that may not only cause loss of life  but  also\r\n\r\ncause  serious damage to naval vessels with unforeseeable\r\n\r\nconsequences, and the Malaysian Government would have  to\r\n\r\nbear  responsibility for the consequences caused  by  the\r\n\r\naggressive and repeated intrusions of its vessels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, Singapore has exercised exclusive\r\n\r\ncontrol, ownership and sovereignty of Pedra Branca  since\r\n\r\nthe  1840s  without  any protest from any  country  until\r\n\r\nMalaysia published a map in 1979 claiming it as  part  of\r\n\r\nits  territory.  This was, and is, the status quo.  Until\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  claim is decided by the ICJ, the  status  quo\r\n\r\nmust  remain,  consistent  with Malaysia's  own  position\r\n\r\nwhich  it  has  taken  in  the case  of  Sipadan/Ligitan.\r\n\r\nThere, in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  case,  Malaysia adopted the position that  as  they\r\n\r\nwere  in possession of the islands, the status quo should\r\n\r\nprevail.   For  example, this is  what  they  said  in  a\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  note  to  Indonesia on 3rd  January  1994,  a\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  note  which they filed  together  with  other\r\n\r\ndocuments in the International Court of Justice, and that\r\n\r\nnote said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government of Malaysia reiterates that since\r\n\r\nSipadan  and Ligitan are parts of Malaysia, any  and  all\r\n\r\nactivities  undertaken by Malaysia on  or  pertaining  to\r\n\r\nthose  islands  and  their surrounding waters  constitute\r\n\r\nlegitimate exercise of its sovereignty and jurisdiction.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And note this part:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The continuing acts of intrusion by Indonesian\r\n\r\nnaval  vessels  and  aircraft in  Malaysia's  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters  and airspace around Sipadan and Ligitan similarly\r\n\r\ncannot in any way, advance Indonesia's claim over the two\r\n\r\nislands.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having taken that position for Sipadan and\r\n\r\nLigitan,  Malaysia now disregards the status quo  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Pedra Branca by intruding into Singapore  waters\r\n\r\naround  the  island which has belonged to  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nmore than 150 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is in the overwhelming national\r\n\r\ninterest  of  both countries to avoid such escalation  of\r\n\r\ntensions  and  conflicts,  as the  consequences  will  be\r\n\r\ncostly for both countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mahathir said that Malaysia would\r\n\r\nrespect  international  law on territorial  disputes  and\r\n\r\navoid  any confrontation with Singapore on Pedra  Branca.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say that this is also Singapore's position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I want to assure\r\n\r\nthis  House  that it is Singapore's desire to have  good,\r\n\r\nnot  strained, relations with Malaysia.  We believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  much that both countries can gain  by  working\r\n\r\ntogether.  And our common interests definitely exceed our\r\n\r\nbilateral differences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must ensure a firm and level basis for\r\n\r\nconducting   state-to-state  relations.    Whenever   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians run out of arguments on bilateral issues, they\r\n\r\naccuse   Singapore  of  being  unreasonable,  legalistic,\r\n\r\nsticking to facts and the law.  As\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  have  said  to  the House before,  how  else  can  any\r\n\r\ncountry, especially a small country like Singapore,  deal\r\n\r\nwith   other  countries  other  than  on  the  basis   of\r\n\r\ninternational   law  and  the  sanctity   of   agreements\r\n\r\nvoluntarily entered into by governments?  If we were ever\r\n\r\nto  yield  on this basic position, we would suffer  grave\r\n\r\nand  permanent consequences.  Singapore cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nbe intimidated into allowing this to happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's relationship with Malaysia will be\r\n\r\ndifficult  from time to time.  But what is  important  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  stay  calm and rational through these  periodic\r\n\r\ncycles  of  ups  and  downs.  And I  close  by  reminding\r\n\r\nourselves  of what Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong  said  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  to  the Singapore Institute of International\r\n\r\nAffairs on 27th November 2002:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must manage these swings with a certain\r\n\r\npsychological equanimity; not lapsing into complacency or\r\n\r\neuphoria  when  things go smoothly, nor  becoming  unduly\r\n\r\nalarmed or despondent when things go bad'.

It is clear\r\n\r\nfrom the statement given this afternoon that Singapore is\r\n\r\nmost  reasonable, most accommodative and most patient  in\r\n\r\nour  negotiations  with Malaysia.   I  want  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether the Malaysians understand and know  the\r\n\r\nsanctity  of international agreements made by  them  with\r\n\r\nother  countries.   Or  do  they deliberately  choose  to\r\n\r\nignore  this?   And, if so, what is their  motive?   With\r\n\r\nMalaysia chopping and changing its position time and time\r\n\r\nagain,   how  would  Singapore  engage  meaningfully   in\r\n\r\nnegotiations with Malaysia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to know, although the Minister has\r\n\r\nmentioned, what is next.  Is there any date or time-table\r\n\r\nin  mind  or  is  it  going to  be  just  a  vacuum?   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  I would ask the Minister to comment  on  the\r\n\r\nannouncement that Johor would cease to buy treated  water\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore  from mid-2003 onwards, after  their  own\r\n\r\nwater treatment plant has been completed.  What would  be\r\n\r\nour response to this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Dr Ong Chit Chung asked several\r\n\r\nquestions,  whether they know of the  importance  of  the\r\n\r\nsanctity  of  the water agreements and so  on.   From  my\r\n\r\nstatement, Members will realise that I have given  enough\r\n\r\nquotations  -  some  old ones, like what  Mr  Ariff,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian representative to the Vienna Conference on  the\r\n\r\nLaw  of  Treaties  said  in 1968 -  he  was  telling  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the whole world that  the  Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement  and  the  Water  Agreements  were  very   good\r\n\r\nexamples  of  how  agreements or special agreements  that\r\n\r\ncould  not  be suspended or terminated for any  political\r\n\r\nreason - to what Foreign Minister Mr Syed Hamid said last\r\n\r\nyear  that  they would continue to honour the agreements.\r\n\r\nBut  you  have to contrast these statements with some  of\r\n\r\nthe other statements which I mentioned in early 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the motive for making all these statements?\r\n\r\nI  think  that is in the realm of speculation.   What  is\r\n\r\nimportant,  not so much speculation, is for us  to  state\r\n\r\nwhat are the implications, which I have done,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  what is Singapore's position, which is what we  have\r\n\r\ndone.  That is, we cannot allow treaties solemnly entered\r\n\r\ninto to be lightly disregarded or contravened.  And if we\r\n\r\nallow  Malaysia to unilaterally change or alter important\r\n\r\nprovisions  of an agreement so critical as the Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement, then where will all this end?  Are we expected\r\n\r\nto   quietly  accept  any  other  revisions  of  critical\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Separation Agreement  or  any  other\r\n\r\nagreement?  So, that is why we have to state our position\r\n\r\nvery clearly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his other question, that Johor would be having\r\n\r\nits  own  water  treatment plants and they  may  not  buy\r\n\r\ntreated  water, that is entirely their right.  The  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements provide for them to purchase a certain  amount\r\n\r\nof treated water from Singapore.  In fact, they have been\r\n\r\npurchasing water well beyond the amounts stipulated.  But\r\n\r\nif  they  choose not to, then it is their right,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot compel them to purchase treated water from us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> What is the next step?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As for the next step, we have to\r\n\r\nwait  and see.  We have stated our position that the  way\r\n\r\nforward  is  through  peaceful,  amicable  settlement  of\r\n\r\ndisputes.   What  does that mean?  In  normal  diplomatic\r\n\r\npractice, countries discuss, talk and negotiate to try to\r\n\r\nfind  an  agreement.  I have outlined in  the  chronology\r\n\r\nthat  we  have tried that.  We have been reasonable,  but\r\n\r\nthere  is  an impasse.  What do we do after the  impasse?\r\n\r\nThen,  I  pointed  out  either  the  Permanent  Court  of\r\n\r\nArbitration  or we have to follow the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nagreement,   which   provide  for  arbitration,   and   I\r\n\r\ncontrasted  this  with the loose talk of  war,  which  is\r\n\r\ncertainly not the way forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding   the  fact  that   we   are   developing\r\n\r\nalternative   sources  of  water  such  as  NEWater   and\r\n\r\ndesalination - and we know that, today, there even exists\r\n\r\nequipment  that allows us to extract drinking water  even\r\n\r\nfrom  air - and in spite of the fact that we are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith a party that is bent on shifting the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoal  post  frequently  in  the  negotiations,  does  the\r\n\r\nMinister agree that it is still in the interests of  both\r\n\r\nsides  to  reach an amicable solution to the  issues  and\r\n\r\nthat the successful conclusion of the Water Agreement  is\r\n\r\nstill  our  aim?   As such, an agreement,  besides  being\r\n\r\ncritical  to  our survival, serves also to symbolise  the\r\n\r\ninextricable  links between our two countries,  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  issues  before  us should not be allowed  to  hinder\r\n\r\nother areas of bilateral cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does the Minister agree that the current\r\n\r\nclimate of frenzy and agitation that has been whipped  up\r\n\r\nby  the Malaysian media overlooks the larger interests of\r\n\r\nboth  countries and serves only to undermine the  efforts\r\n\r\nto  broaden other areas of bilateral cooperation, and it,\r\n\r\nin   no   way,  contributes  towards  enhancing   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors' confidence in the region at a time when we are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  many  other important  challenges,  such  as\r\n\r\neconomic  competition from North Asia and the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism, all of which require our joint efforts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As to the first part of Mr Tan Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon's question, whether it is possible to have any room\r\n\r\nfor  further negotiations and talks, I would  agree  with\r\n\r\nthat - let us continue to talk.  That has always been  my\r\n\r\nposition.   It  has  always been the  position  of  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh and of the Government.  And I hope  that  I\r\n\r\nhave sufficiently demonstrated by taking Members through,\r\n\r\nin  some  detail, the chronology that we have taken  that\r\n\r\nposition because, if we can have a win-win deal, that  is\r\n\r\ngood  for both countries.  After all, it would deal  with\r\n\r\nour   future  water  supply  situation.   But,  as  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  said,  we must also  bear  in  mind  that,\r\n\r\nbecause we do not want the water issue to be a thorn that\r\n\r\nbedevils  our relationship, we will have to  develop  our\r\n\r\nown  alternative supply of water.  But in response to his\r\n\r\nspecific question, if we can have a deal, is it not worth\r\n\r\nto  continue talking?  I say, yes, of course, and that is\r\n\r\nprecisely why we have continued our discussions.  But for\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  I have pointed out, they have, through  the\r\n\r\nmany changes of positions and, finally, discontinuing the\r\n\r\npackage and not wanting to talk about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture   supply   of  water  till  2059,   made   further\r\n\r\nnegotiations impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of his question is related to the\r\n\r\nmedia  frenzy.   Does  it  not  hinder  cooperation   and\r\n\r\nundermine efforts between both countries?  The answer is,\r\n\r\nyes.  It does not make sense for the two countries to  be\r\n\r\nin this state of ups and downs, particularly on the water\r\n\r\nissue.   But  there are so many issues where  allegations\r\n\r\nhave  been  hurled  at us.  Rather  than  this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  where  accusations have been hurled  at  us,  it\r\n\r\nreally  makes  sense for us to cooperate in  many  areas.\r\n\r\nAnd,   indeed,  there  are  many  areas  which  we   have\r\n\r\ncooperation in the past, and we continue to have areas of\r\n\r\npotential  cooperation, such as in the area  of  economic\r\n\r\ncooperation.  Both sides are important to each other  for\r\n\r\ntrade and investments.  I think Members are aware of  the\r\n\r\nfigures.   We  also  have to cooperate  in  the  area  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  as the former Speaker has mentioned.   And  I\r\n\r\nwould add that both Malaysia and Singapore are also  well\r\n\r\npositioned  to  work  together to advance  the  cause  of\r\n\r\nASEAN.   So,  there  are many areas  where  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  could  work  together to  advance  our  mutual\r\n\r\nbilateral interests and work together for the advancement\r\n\r\nof the interest of our region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  first,  could  I  ask  the  Minister  why  does\r\n\r\nSingapore  maintain  that Johor has  lost  the  right  of\r\n\r\nreview  when the Water Agreements provide for the  review\r\n\r\nafter 25 years, but does not specify exactly when such  a\r\n\r\nreview  should  take place?  Second question,  could  the\r\n\r\nMinister explain why Singapore is not insisting that  the\r\n\r\nprice  review  be  referred to the ICJ or  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nCourt of Arbitration?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On his first question, Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran is a lawyer, and also a few other Members, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think this is a place to engage in a detailed  legal\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the  Water Agreement  provisions.   I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned before that if you look at the Water Agreements\r\n\r\nwhich  are in the bundle of documents, both have  clauses\r\n\r\non price review, which provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the rates can be reviewed after 25 years.   We  can\r\n\r\nhave  a legal argument as to whether it should be on  the\r\n\r\n25th  year,  or at any time after 25 years, or  within  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  period  after 1986-87.  Now,  we  have  legal\r\n\r\nadvice  which  said that Malaysia has lost its  right  of\r\n\r\nreview.   Well, that is a legal issue which will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  debated at an appropriate forum, and I have said that\r\n\r\nit  is  a matter that can also be put through the process\r\n\r\nunder the Water Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to also note, in this context, that\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian  leaders  have  said  that   they   chose\r\n\r\ndeliberately  not to review at that time when  they  were\r\n\r\nentitled to because they feared that the price of treated\r\n\r\nwater  supplied  by  Singapore would  also  be  reviewed.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  review clauses cannot  apply  only  to  raw\r\n\r\nwater, it must also apply to treated water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that I should mention, which we\r\n\r\npointed  out  to  the Malaysians, is  that  if  they  had\r\n\r\nexercised  the right to review then, it might  well  have\r\n\r\ncaused  different decisions on our part as to the amounts\r\n\r\nof  money that we have invested in Johor on various kinds\r\n\r\nof works, which actually have come to more than a billion\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollars - water works, pipe lines,  ancilliary\r\n\r\nworks, the Linggiu Dam.  So this is a question which will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be decided at an appropriate time, but we  have\r\n\r\ntaken legal advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are on the subject, even though we took the\r\n\r\nlegal position, we told the Malaysians, \"We know this  is\r\n\r\nimportant to you.  So, we are prepared to discuss this in\r\n\r\nthe  context of the package; in other words, on a without\r\n\r\nprejudice basis.  But if you take it out of the  package,\r\n\r\nshelve future water to 2059 and insist on discussing just\r\n\r\nexisting  water, then we will have to go by the terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Agreement.\"  And they have a legal\r\n\r\nview, we have a legal view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is: why not international\r\n\r\narbitration  and adjudication?  I would say  that,  as  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  principle, if you ask me as a  Foreign  Minister\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomeone  who has taught international law, when countries\r\n\r\nhave   disputes,   it  is  always  preferable   to   have\r\n\r\ninternational adjudication or international  arbitration.\r\n\r\nBut as Mr Ravindran knows, that is not something that you\r\n\r\ncan  compel another side.  It requires consensual  basis.\r\n\r\nBoth  disputing parties must agree to that  international\r\n\r\narbitration process.  And in this case, of course, it  is\r\n\r\nbetter for international credibility and transparency and\r\n\r\nthe  signals we are giving to the international community\r\n\r\nthat even this dispute is referred to, say, the PCA.  But\r\n\r\nthey have said, no.  How do we resolve it amicably?   So,\r\n\r\nwe  have to fall back on the provisions in the Agreement.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  provisions  provide  for  arbitration  by  that\r\n\r\nparticular mode, and we are parties to the Agreement, and\r\n\r\nwe  have  said,  OK,  we  follow the  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Just to follow\r\n\r\nup on that point.  Can we not insist that the more proper\r\n\r\nforum  would be the PCA?  It is a more neutral body.   If\r\n\r\nwe  go according to the laws of Johor, it might not be as\r\n\r\nneutral  as  we would like it to be.  And I  would  think\r\n\r\nthat if Malaysia is confident of its case, as it has said\r\n\r\nit  is,  it would be prepared to take it to the PCA.   My\r\n\r\nsecond  question is also on water.  Given that it  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  realistic to hope for future water from Malaysia,\r\n\r\ncan the Minister assure all Singaporeans that we are well\r\n\r\nprepared  to be self-sufficient for all our water  needs,\r\n\r\npresent and future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On the first part of Ms Irene Ng's\r\n\r\nquestion, why shall we not insist, and so on, I have just\r\n\r\nanswered  Mr  Ravindran's question that PCA requires  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  both sides.  We can insist, but it  requires\r\n\r\ntheir consent.  It is preferable.  That is my view.   But\r\n\r\nwe  deal  with  the  situation as it exists.   We  cannot\r\n\r\ncompel  them.  So, we fall back on the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nWater Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her second question as to whether we can assure\r\n\r\nthe House, Members have heard both Prime Minister Goh and\r\n\r\nmy  colleague, Minister Lim Swee Say, inform the House in\r\n\r\ndetail  of  all  the efforts being done  to  develop  our\r\n\r\ncapability for alternative sources of water - NEWater,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesalination - and we will press on with them.  But we do\r\n\r\nnot  know  when  and  how fast that capability  can  come\r\n\r\nabout.  Therefore, in the meantime, what is important  is\r\n\r\nthat  the obligations under the Water Agreements must  be\r\n\r\ncomplied  with.  And that is why I have said that  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  important.   It  is  not only  important  from  the\r\n\r\ntheoretical  principle  of  observance  of  international\r\n\r\nagreements,  it  is also critical for our  existence  and\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould like to go back to the question of the sanctity  of\r\n\r\ncontract  which, unfortunately, Rais Yatim does not  seem\r\n\r\nto  have  a  basic  understanding of.  Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the Malaysian accusation that Singapore  has\r\n\r\nfailed  to  abide  by the agreement  which  was  made  at\r\n\r\nindependence,   offering  the  right  of  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nmilitary  to  maintain  facilities  in  Singapore?    And\r\n\r\nrelated to that question, I understand that there was  an\r\n\r\nissue on revised rental.  Is there no contradiction  when\r\n\r\nSingapore  raised  the rental of land for  KD  Malaya  to\r\n\r\nreflect  market rates while objecting to the revision  of\r\n\r\nthe price of water to reflect to market rate?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Perhaps, during the break, Members\r\n\r\nhave  not  had  time to read the written  answer  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion  on  KD  Malaya  in  the  Annex  which   I   had\r\n\r\ncirculated.   But if I may just sum up, I will  make  two\r\n\r\npoints which were further elaborated in my Annex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is this. While there was a rental\r\n\r\nincrease for KD Malaya, it was not targeted at KD Malaya.\r\n\r\nIt  was  part of Singapore's policy to adjust rentals  on\r\n\r\nproperties towards market rates.  And that policy applied\r\n\r\nto others, including voluntary and welfare organisations.\r\n\r\nSo, that is the first point I want to stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to stress is: far from\r\n\r\nwanting to chase them out of KD Malaya, Malaysian leaders\r\n\r\nwere  told  by Singapore leaders - both the then  Defence\r\n\r\nMinister Dr Yeo Ning Hong and Prime Minister Goh  himself\r\n\r\n-  that we wanted them to stay in Singapore, and we  made\r\n\r\nseveral proposals and alternative suggestions which would\r\n\r\nhave enabled\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  to stay on, including staggering and phasing in  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  rentals.   And our proposals also  included  an\r\n\r\noption of our building, at considerable cost to us, of  a\r\n\r\ncamp  for  them  at a much lower rental.   I  forgot  the\r\n\r\nfigure.   It is in the Annex.  But they decided on  their\r\n\r\nown volition that they would leave.  And, in fact, in the\r\n\r\npassing-out ceremony in 1997, their then Defence Minister\r\n\r\n-  and now Foreign Minister - thanked Singapore for these\r\n\r\nfacilities.  The quote is in the Annex, and he said  that\r\n\r\nthey had no problems with or complaints about Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of the question as to whether this\r\n\r\nwas a breach of the Separation Agreement, the hon. Member\r\n\r\nwas  probably  referring to some  statements  made  that,\r\n\r\nunder the Separation Agreement, they had a right to  stay\r\n\r\nin Singapore and so on.  Perhaps Members ought to look at\r\n\r\nthe  terms of the Separation Agreement, which is also  in\r\n\r\nthe  bundle  of  documents.  Members  will  find  in  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Separation Agreement a reference to the\r\n\r\nright  of  Malaysia  to  maintain  bases  and  so  on  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But that was envisaged, together with  other\r\n\r\nitems,  as part of an agreement to be concluded  by  both\r\n\r\ncountries  on  mutual defence, which never  materialised.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it was not a substantive provision of the\r\n\r\nSeparation   Agreement.   It  was  part  of  the   points\r\n\r\nindicative  of  what our future mutual defence  agreement\r\n\r\ncould  be,  and it was never concluded.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nfrom 1965 to 1997 when they left, they stayed here not on\r\n\r\nthe basis of any treaty provisions, but because we wanted\r\n\r\nthem  to continue having those facilities.  I hope I have\r\n\r\nanswered that question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  with reference to the proposal by Malaysia  for\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN+3 Secretariat to be located in KL, may  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether there were other members  of  ASEAN\r\n\r\nbesides  Indonesia,  as mentioned in the  Statement,  who\r\n\r\nwere  opposed  to this proposal?  My second question  is:\r\n\r\nhow  and  when did Singapore express its support  to  the\r\n\r\nEAEC proposal, and why is there a confusion on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On ASEAN+3, I can inform Members\r\n\r\ncategorically  that  I  was  present  at  all  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmeetings  where this topic had been discussed,  including\r\n\r\nat  some retreats of Foreign Ministers.

From what he said regarding  the\r\n\r\nchronological  events  in the negotiation  of  water,  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear to me that the major turning point  is  the\r\n\r\nletter from Dr Mahathir to Senior Minister Lee dated  4th\r\n\r\nMarch  2002, which led us to a major decision to ramp  up\r\n\r\nour NEWater programme to replace the 1961 Water Agreement\r\n\r\nwhen  it  expires  in  2011.  I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he could clarify or elaborate on what is\r\n\r\nso  unattractive  or unreasonable in the Malaysian  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  letter  that led to our major  decision  like\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The full text of the letter is in\r\n\r\nthe  bundle.  It is a short letter, and the proposals are\r\n\r\nattached to the letter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why I said in my speech that they were totally\r\n\r\ndifferent  proposals, they came about after Dr Mahathir's\r\n\r\nvarious  statements that maybe the real  price  of  water\r\n\r\nought to be RM8.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the differences in this new proposal? Let\r\n\r\nme  recap.  Under Malaysia's new proposal that he tabled,\r\n\r\n60  sen would apply not only from 2002 for five years  to\r\n\r\n2006, but also be backdated.  Backdated to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen?  Backdated to 1st September 1986 and 29th September\r\n\r\n1987,  in respect of the two Water Agreements.  And  from\r\n\r\n2007  to  2011, the price would be RM3 per 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThat  was another change.  And from 2011 until the expiry\r\n\r\nof   the  Water  Agreements,  the  RM3  would  be  raised\r\n\r\nannually, based on average inflation rate, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nin  my  speech.  The other major change is the  way  they\r\n\r\ndealt differently with the question of treated water.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as treated water is concerned, they proposed to  fix\r\n\r\nthe price of treated water, which we were selling back to\r\n\r\nthem  under  the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements  at  RM1,\r\n\r\nfrom 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points worth noting here. First,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no backdating to 1986 and 1987.   Raw  water,\r\n\r\nrevised - backdated to 1986 and 1987.  Treated water,  no\r\n\r\nbackdating.  Second, under this proposal, raw water  from\r\n\r\nJohor  is worth RM3 per 1,000 gallons.  So, having raised\r\n\r\nit,  after  processing, our revised  treated  water  will\r\n\r\nstill be only RM1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same letter, they proposed to supply 100 mgd\r\n\r\nof  treated water in 2011, which was in response  to  our\r\n\r\nearlier  proposal  for the supply of 100  mgd  raw  water\r\n\r\nafter  the expiry of the 1961 Water Agreement.  Based  on\r\n\r\nthe  formula that they proposed, do you know how much  we\r\n\r\nwould  have to pay?  We would have to pay about RM10  per\r\n\r\n1,000  gallons of treated water.  At this price,  treated\r\n\r\nwater from Malaysia would be much higher than the cost of\r\n\r\nNEWater.  It is also much more than desalinated water.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> I have a few\r\n\r\nquestions  for  the Minister arising from  certain  facts\r\n\r\nthat   the  Minister  has  put  forward.   We  know  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  exercised sovereignty over  Pedra  Branca\r\n\r\nsince the 1840s.  We know that we had separation in 1965,\r\n\r\nand  the first time that the Malaysians had made a  claim\r\n\r\nto  Pedra  Branca was in 1979 in a map, which  means  139\r\n\r\nyears  after we exercised sovereignty and 14 years  after\r\n\r\nSeparation.   Have the Malaysians given  any  explanation\r\n\r\nwhy  there has been this deafening silence on their  part\r\n\r\nin relation to assertion of sovereignty for 139 years\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  14  years?  More specifically, is it their case  that\r\n\r\nthey did not know in 1965 and they suddenly knew in 1979?\r\n\r\nOr  is  it that they knew in 1965 but forgot until  1979?\r\n\r\nOr  is it the case that they neither knew nor forgot  and\r\n\r\nsuddenly  decided in 1979?  And, if so, is it a principle\r\n\r\nof  international law that they can suddenly decide  that\r\n\r\nthey have sovereignty over their neighbour's property?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> These are questions which should\r\n\r\nbe  directed to the Malaysians.  But the pointed  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  Ms Indranee asked those questions, maybe we should\r\n\r\ninclude  her  in  our team to argue in the  International\r\n\r\nCourt of Justice!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, really, 1979 was the first time that they\r\n\r\npublished a map.  I have looked at some of the maps prior\r\n\r\nto 1979.  And prior to 1979, Malaysian maps showed \"Pedra\r\n\r\nBranca  (Singapura)\".  After 1979, it was shown as  being\r\n\r\nwithin  Malaysian waters, and the \"Singapura\"  was  taken\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a principle of international law that they can\r\n\r\nsuddenly  claim  ownership, out of the  blue,  after  130\r\n\r\nyears,  and 14 years after our independence?   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink one has to be an international lawyer to know  that\r\n\r\nthat  is not the case.  Although, as I have said, we have\r\n\r\nbeen in possession, control and ownership of Pedra Branca\r\n\r\nand  the surrounding waters for more than 150 years,  can\r\n\r\nsomebody spring this and claim that they are owners?  And\r\n\r\nthey  also  claim that they have the right  to  come  and\r\n\r\npatrol  our waters?  In international law, in  our  view,\r\n\r\nthat proposition is not tenable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask hon. Members to imagine this. You have a\r\n\r\ncompound  house with a garden.  You have lived there  all\r\n\r\nyour  life.   Your  parents have lived  there  all  their\r\n\r\nlives.   Your  grandparents had  lived  there  all  their\r\n\r\nlives.  Nobody has ever challenged your ownership or your\r\n\r\nforefathers' ownership of that property.  You have  lived\r\n\r\npeacefully there and suddenly one of the neighbours says,\r\n\r\n\"Hey,  your  house belongs to me.\"  And he  says  he  has\r\n\r\nfound  some ancient document in his attic and this  house\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  him.   You maintain your  legal  rights,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  and  he says he is going to go  to  court.   And\r\n\r\ninstead\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  coming  to  blows, you say, \"Go  ahead.

So,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  observance of international law, and observance\r\n\r\nof  international law is that the status quo  has  to  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.   And  the status quo is that  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nalways been in sovereignty and ownership of the territory\r\n\r\nand of the waters, and that continues to be the case, and\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  be  the case, until  and  unless  the\r\n\r\nInternational Court were to rule otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nback to the issue of water.

When the Minister  talked  about\r\n\r\n\"shifting  of  goal-posts\", I think there are  no  longer\r\n\r\ngoal-posts now in this whole game.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysians have also, unilaterally, from time to\r\n\r\ntime, changed their positions, eg, taking the water issue\r\n\r\nout  of  the package of issues.  Do we not think that  we\r\n\r\nhave wasted enough time with the Malaysians?  Maybe it is\r\n\r\nabout  time the Minister took the position that water  is\r\n\r\nan  issue  that we are no longer interested in discussing\r\n\r\nwith them and focus on building our own sources of water,\r\n\r\nrather  than to waste the Malaysians' time and our  time,\r\n\r\nand  also  to bring us all back on a Saturday to  discuss\r\n\r\nissues like this.  I think it is about time that we  just\r\n\r\nput  our  foot down and said that the water issue  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  for discussion.  We have an agreement.   If  they\r\n\r\nwant to sue us, go ahead and we will settle it in a court\r\n\r\nof law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Well, I hope the Member is not\r\n\r\ncomplaining  that his Saturday golf game or whatever  has\r\n\r\nbeen spoilt.  It is a matter of grave importance, whether\r\n\r\nSaturday or Sunday, it is necessary to meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it must be clear from my speech that we have\r\n\r\nbeen  as reasonable as we can.  Why?  In order to achieve\r\n\r\na  win-win solution, and we thought it is possible.  But,\r\n\r\nI  think  we  have come to the end of the  road,  not  on\r\n\r\naccount  of  our  intransigence or rigid  positions,  but\r\n\r\nbecause of, as the Member has said, the \"shifting of goal-posts\", and finally discontinuation of the package by the\r\n\r\nMalaysians.   That is why I say we are at an impasse  and\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  to think of how to move  on.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nSingapore's  intention  to  be  fixated  on  this   issue\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  I answered Mr Tan Soo Khoon's question,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to move on and do not let this issue so affect  the\r\n\r\nsum  total of our relations, because there are many other\r\n\r\nissues  that  we need to focus on, both domestically  our\r\n\r\neconomic and other problems, as well as bilaterally,  and\r\n\r\nin  the  region.   So, we need to move  on,  and  I  have\r\n\r\noutlined to Members how we can move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> It was claimed\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  made huge profits by  selling  water  to\r\n\r\nships,  and  the water supplied by Johor  should  be  for\r\n\r\ndomestic consumption.  Could the Minister comment on this\r\n\r\naccusation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> This matter - that we buy water\r\n\r\nfrom them at 50 cents and we sell at exorbitant rates  to\r\n\r\nships  and  therefore  we  are profiteering  -  has  been\r\n\r\nanswered  several times in this House by  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh,  as well as myself.  So, let me restate the position\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  really without basis.  It  is  an  absurd\r\n\r\nallegation.  Yes, PUB sells water to ships at the maximum\r\n\r\nrate of S$21 per thousand litres.  But, as Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh said in this House on 5th April, the sale of water to\r\n\r\nships  is less than 1% of Singapore's total water demand,\r\n\r\nor  one  mgd.  And why do we do this?  It is deliberately\r\n\r\ndone  to  price  it  at such a high  rate  to  discourage\r\n\r\ndemand,  not to make a huge profit.  But, more important,\r\n\r\nis  this:   Malaysia also does the same at  their  ports.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, the Port of Tanjong Pelapas in Johor sells\r\n\r\nwater  to ships at the maximum rate of RM455 per thousand\r\n\r\ngallons  for  volumes of 50 thousand  litres  and  above.\r\n\r\nThis is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobviously substantially higher than the rate charged  for\r\n\r\ndomestic consumers, and I presume they do so for the same\r\n\r\nreason,  to discourage demand.  So, it is not a  question\r\n\r\nof profiteering.  It is less than 1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy Speaker, finally, you caught my eye!  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  join  my  colleague,  Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung,  in\r\n\r\nexpressing  our  appreciation to the Government  for  its\r\n\r\nvery  level-headed  and rational approach  to  this  very\r\n\r\nimportant  issue,  in  contrast to the  Malaysian  style,\r\n\r\nwhich  seems to be twisting and turning all the time.   I\r\n\r\nhave four questions for the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I note in the Minister's statement that the\r\n\r\nMalaysians now want to review the second Water  Agreement\r\n\r\nonly  in  2058.  This seems to be a bit late in  the  day\r\n\r\nbecause,  as he said, there would be only two years  left\r\n\r\nbefore the expiry of the actual Agreement.  I want to ask\r\n\r\nwhether  in  the  formal Agreement  itself,  is  there  a\r\n\r\ntimeframe   for  an  earlier  form  of  consultation   or\r\n\r\ndiscussion  because, obviously, two years is  not  enough\r\n\r\nfor us to prepare ourselves.  If it is true that there is\r\n\r\nnot enough time for us to review until 2058, what are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do about our own water provision plans  before\r\n\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that the Minister said that the\r\n\r\nMalaysians always have this cycle in their relations with\r\n\r\nus  -  there are ups and downs, and now it seems like  we\r\n\r\nare  in  the  low  end of the cycle.  Maybe  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister  could enlighten the House on whether there  are\r\n\r\nreasons  behind  their more agitated behaviour  now,  eg,\r\n\r\ndomestic reasons or other reasons that cause them to want\r\n\r\nto  always use Singapore as a whipping boy on this  water\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that we also read in the papers\r\n\r\nthat  the  Malaysians now want to have  their  own  water\r\n\r\nprocessing  plant in Johor.  In future,  they  would  not\r\n\r\nneed to get processed water from Singapore any more.  But\r\n\r\nwe know that Singapore has spent a lot of money; in fact,\r\n\r\n$1.5 billion on our own water processing plant, which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  also  cater for Johor.  Should we not talk  to  them\r\n\r\nabout  the possibility of this spare capacity to be  used\r\n\r\nfor their own water processing, instead of spending their\r\n\r\nmoney on building new plants for their purposes?  In  the\r\n\r\nprocess, there is mutual benefit.  We can put it  in  the\r\n\r\nterms  for  discussion, so that we can find  it  mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial for us to help them to process their water and\r\n\r\nbecome   part  of  the  agreement.   Because  the   water\r\n\r\nprocessing plant can be very expensive for the Malaysians\r\n\r\nto build themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Pedra Branca, I want to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  really is the economic or real value of this  piece\r\n\r\nof rock, so to speak, for the Malaysians?  For Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  know it is our sovereign right, because we have  been\r\n\r\nowning this piece of island for the last 150 years.   But\r\n\r\nI  am surprised that the Malaysians suddenly took a stand\r\n\r\nand  want to claim it.  Is there any particular economic,\r\n\r\nor  maybe touristic, reasons for Malaysia wanting to make\r\n\r\na claim on this island?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> First, of the four questions, is\r\n\r\nthat  2058  or 2059 is rather late in the day.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  a real under-statement.  On this, he asked  two\r\n\r\nquestions: is there any provision in the Water Agreements\r\n\r\nwhich  provides for review and so on.  The answer is  no.\r\n\r\nThe  Water  Agreements are self-contained.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nhave   built-in  provisions  which  provide  for  trigger\r\n\r\nmechanism  for a review process.  So, the legal  position\r\n\r\nis  that  -   and we are not taking any other position  - both Agreements, when they expire, unless both sides have\r\n\r\nagreed to extend, will lapse.  That is the position.  So,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are  talking about agreements, we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  agreements which will be separate from  the  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements  for the supply of water after the  expiry  of\r\n\r\nthe Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of his question, since it is late\r\n\r\nin  the  day, what should we do and so on.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is, as Mr Lim Swee Say and others have  said,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  ramp up our capability and capacity to  develop\r\n\r\nour  alternative sources of water supply.   That  is  one\r\n\r\nvery important task that we have in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  as  Members  know, we are taking it seriously.   The\r\n\r\nsecond  question he asked is what could  be  the  reasons\r\n\r\nbehind  all these ups and downs and bashing of Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  think  Members  are  used to  my  style  in  answering\r\n\r\nquestions,  ie, I try not to speculate.   It  has  really\r\n\r\nreached a point of diminishing returns.  Your speculation\r\n\r\nis  as  good  as mine.  I prefer to answer questions  and\r\n\r\nmake statements based on hard facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they want to have their own water treatment\r\n\r\nfacilities  and so on.  Should we engage  them  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  why  are you guys doing this?\"  I think  if  they\r\n\r\nwant to have their own water treatment plants and be self-sufficient in their treatment of water, let them  do  so.\r\n\r\nIt  is not necessary for us to tell them that they should\r\n\r\nnot do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Pedra Branca, it is partly speculative. I do not\r\n\r\nknow  how many tourists that rock can take.  I have  been\r\n\r\nthere.   Again,  I  do  not  want  to  speculate.    But,\r\n\r\nobviously,  one answer to his question is, if  they  take\r\n\r\naway the rock, it would reduce Singapore's space.  Let me\r\n\r\nsay this.  For every country in the world, whether big or\r\n\r\nsmall,  political independence and sovereignty over  land\r\n\r\nand  territorial waters is of paramount importance.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  key  attribute  of  nationhood.   When  we  became\r\n\r\nindependent   on  9th  August  1965,  the  territory   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  consisted  of  our  main  island  and  several\r\n\r\nsmaller  islands, including Pedra Branca, as Ms  Indranee\r\n\r\nhas  pointed  out.   When we became  independent  on  9th\r\n\r\nAugust  1965,  this  is  what we  have.   If  territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  and sovereignty is important for all  nations,\r\n\r\nit  is  very important for Singapore as a small  country.\r\n\r\nWe  are one of the smallest countries in the world.   But\r\n\r\nour  size  has  been  determined on independence  on  9th\r\n\r\nAugust 1965 and we cannot change it.  Although we are one\r\n\r\nof the smallest countries in the world, every inch of our\r\n\r\nterritory  or  of our waters is of paramount  importance,\r\n\r\nand we will have to safeguard our territorial sovereignty\r\n\r\nand preserve it.  If anybody challenges us, it has to  be\r\n\r\nresolved  by  reference  to an international  body.   And\r\n\r\nuntil  any  international body,  like  the  World  Court,\r\n\r\ndecides otherwise, that sovereignty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  territorial integrity must be preserved by Singapore\r\n\r\nat all costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  taken  a  somewhat unprecedented  move  in\r\n\r\nreleasing correspondence between the leaders of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia,  as  well  as  other  communiques  at  the\r\n\r\ndiplomatic level.  His reason has been that the hope  for\r\n\r\na  win-win  outcome on the issue of water, in particular,\r\n\r\nis  now not realistic.  May I ask why he has come to this\r\n\r\nconclusion  at this stage, because most Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nthis  House certainly are very familiar with the rhetoric\r\n\r\ncoming  from across the Causeway on the issue  of  water,\r\n\r\nand  the noise levels have a cyclical nature?  This time,\r\n\r\nthe noise levels have gone up again.  But we have arrived\r\n\r\nat  a  very  major  decision, it would  appear,  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  in wanting to set the record straight  publicly,\r\n\r\nand  I  would appreciate it if the Minister could clarify\r\n\r\nthe thinking behind such a move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have taken a move of great gravity on a\r\n\r\nmatter  that  has  been at the centre of  bilateral  ties\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and Malaysia for some time.   I  think\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would want to know and  appreciate  how  is\r\n\r\nthis  going  to  repercuss on the broader bilateral  ties\r\n\r\nbetween  our two countries.  Because we have stated  that\r\n\r\nwe  want  to move on from the issue of water on to  other\r\n\r\nmatters,  and  find resolution.  I would appreciate  some\r\n\r\nclarifications from the Minister on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The first part of Mr Iswaran's\r\n\r\nquestion  was  about  the  release  of  these  documents,\r\n\r\nexchanges  and diplomatic notes.  I think it  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  clear  from  my speech that I  have  done  so  with\r\n\r\nreluctance.  But why are we doing this?  If I may sum  up\r\n\r\nthe  reasons again: first, we did not want to release all\r\n\r\nthese  documents because there was still  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nnegotiations could continue and there would  still  be  a\r\n\r\ndoor open for talking.  But, alas, that was not the case.\r\n\r\nIf  it  had been just that, it would have been all right.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been  painted  as the unreasonable  party,  the\r\n\r\nintransigent party,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  party  to  blame for all this.  And accusations  and\r\n\r\nallegations have come forth with that line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that these accusations have to be\r\n\r\ncountered.   Otherwise,  repetitions  of  untruths,   and\r\n\r\nrepeated incantations of these untruths might be taken to\r\n\r\nbe   the   truth.   It  is  important  for   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nparticularly, to know the facts.  To do that,  should  we\r\n\r\njust  say, \"That is not true\", and sit down?  I think  we\r\n\r\nhave  to come out with all these facts so that the  facts\r\n\r\nand  the  documents  will speak for  themselves.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that all concerned have a clear idea  of  where\r\n\r\nwe are, what we are and how we came about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of his question was, since this has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  central issue, whether it will impact  on  other\r\n\r\nareas  of cooperation.  In answer to an earlier question,\r\n\r\nI  have made it clear that there are many other areas  of\r\n\r\ncooperation which both Singapore and Malaysia can gain to\r\n\r\nbenefit  by  focusing ourselves on  them.   And  that  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  why  we should not let this be  such  a  spiky\r\n\r\nthorn  in  our  relationship,  that  its  non  resolution\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  affect the sum total of our  relationship.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why I pointed out that we are in this  impasse.\r\n\r\nLet  us find a way out of the impasse.  If talks are  not\r\n\r\npossible, then arbitration - and let us try to  move  on.\r\n\r\nThere are many more urgent things at stake.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Given the\r\n\r\nhistory  of their habit of changing their minds  ever  so\r\n\r\noften,  does the Minister foresee that they might  decide\r\n\r\nto  go  back on the package route again?  If so, what  is\r\n\r\nour response to that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, now that the package has been dismantled,\r\n\r\ncan  the Minister explain how the other bilateral issues,\r\n\r\napart from water, are going to be resolved?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Members somehow do not believe me\r\n\r\nwhen  I  said that I would not like to speculate.   If  a\r\n\r\nproposal  comes  back and they say, \"Let  us  resume  the\r\n\r\ntalks\", I would take it a step at a time and deal with it\r\n\r\nwhen that happens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issues are unresolved and they would have\r\n\r\nto  be  dealt with separately on a stand-alone merit.   I\r\n\r\nthink that is very clear.  They are no longer linked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister must be aware that the Malaysians  have  no\r\n\r\nintention   to  settle  the  various  issues.    To   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians, no solution is also a solution, and  we  have\r\n\r\nto  remember this.  They have their own domestic politics\r\n\r\nto  play  to.  If they were to settle all the  issues,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they have a difficult way of winning their ground.\r\n\r\nSo,  we  must have this behind our heads when we  go  and\r\n\r\nnegotiate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I ask the Minister to see whether there\r\n\r\nis  an  easier version of what he has given to us as  our\r\n\r\nground.   I think our ground is very important.   Let  us\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  our  own ground, ie,  we  must  convince\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  for example, that we are not unreasonable,\r\n\r\nthat   we   are  always  sticking  to  the  3-sen   price\r\n\r\nnegotiation,  and  that we have actually  been  the  more\r\n\r\nreasonable party.  And that we are also prepared to up it\r\n\r\nto 45 sen, but it is always changing at every negotiation\r\n\r\ntable.  Therefore, I believe that the Malaysians have  no\r\n\r\nintention to sell us water in the coming years.   Let  us\r\n\r\nface the truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pedra Branca, let the ground know that it\r\n\r\nbelongs to Singapore.  It is not a disputed territory and\r\n\r\nthat  if Malaysia wants to challenge us, they have to  do\r\n\r\nso  through the International Court, and that their  navy\r\n\r\ncannot come and patrol our waters.  And I think we should\r\n\r\ntell them very seriously that we really mean business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank the Member for his speech.\r\n\r\nHe  asked  whether  I  could give an easier  and  simpler\r\n\r\nversion  of my speech.  I thought his summary  itself  is\r\n\r\nexcellent  and  maybe  we should  distribute  it  to  the\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that Dr Tan Cheng Bock made is right - that the process of getting Singaporeans to know the\r\n\r\nfacts cannot just be done by the Foreign Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking  this  one-hour speech in Parliament,  and  people\r\n\r\nreading it the next day.

And I hope  that\r\n\r\nit would not be just the Government MPs.  It has to be  a\r\n\r\ncollective effort of all the MPs in this House.

It is, in a\r\n\r\nway,  a matter of our lifeline.  My question is: how does\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  intend  to  get  the  message  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway to the Malaysian people when the Malaysian media\r\n\r\nand leaders are bent on giving misrepresentations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, having bared the facts - and Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds  to do that - how does the Minister ensure that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not add unnecessary heat to the important bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations which are already emotionally charged in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the word \"war\" being bandied around irresponsibly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The Member is right that the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media does not portray the Singapore  side  of\r\n\r\nthe story either sufficiently or accurately, or sometimes\r\n\r\nnot  at  all.  We will do our best to present our  facts.\r\n\r\nAs  I  mentioned before, all these will be on the website\r\n\r\nof  MFA  and  also on the Kuala Lumpur Mission's  website\r\n\r\n(embassy's website), and we will find other ways.  But  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  both the people and leaders in Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nread  the  statement carefully because it is not intended\r\n\r\nto  add heat, as Mr Zainul has mentioned.  Rather, I have\r\n\r\ncarefully  drafted  my statement in  a  measured  way  to\r\n\r\npresent  the  facts.  And facts sometimes  not  only  can\r\n\r\nelucidate  but  they can also dispel  rumours  and  false\r\n\r\nallegations,  but  the facts must be able  to  speak  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  And bringing up the facts cannot be said  to\r\n\r\nbe motivated by wanting to up the temperature.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  I  have  two  supplementary  questions.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  I understand that while we operate a lighthouse\r\n\r\nat  Pedra  Branca, we also operate a lighthouse at  Pulau\r\n\r\nPisang.   But while we say that Pedra Branca  belongs  to\r\n\r\nus,  we  do not have a similar position as regards  Pulau\r\n\r\nPisang.   My  first question is: what are the differences\r\n\r\nin  Singapore's  position  as  regards  Pedra  Branca  as\r\n\r\nopposed to Pulau Pisang?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question, to borrow my colleague, Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee's terms, has Malaysia decided or realised or  in\r\n\r\nany  other way taken any steps to claim any other  island\r\n\r\nthat belongs to us, besides Pedra Branca?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> What is the difference between\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca  and  Pulau Pisang?   Let  me,  first,  say\r\n\r\nupfront  that Pulau Pisang belongs to Malaysia.  We  have\r\n\r\nnever  disputed Malaysia's sovereignty over Pulau Pisang.\r\n\r\nBut  our  Maritime Port Authority (MPA), however,  has  a\r\n\r\nright  to operate the Lighthouse on Pulau Pisang and  the\r\n\r\nplot of land on which the Lighthouse stands\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the  roadway leading to the Lighthouse  was\r\n\r\ngranted  in perpetuity to Singapore, so long as Singapore\r\n\r\noperates  the  Lighthouse.  And this was in an  indenture\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Johor  Sultan and the Straits  Settlement's\r\n\r\nGovernment in 1900 and we became successor to that.   So,\r\n\r\nfor   Pulau   Pisang,  we  have  never  contested   their\r\n\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Pedra Branca, we have sovereignty over it.\r\n\r\nIt  is ridiculous to say - as the Malaysians have said  - that  Singapore  can  only  operate  the  Lighthouse  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   I  might  add that, in 1968,  the  Malaysians\r\n\r\nobjected  to  the flying of the Singapore flag  over  the\r\n\r\nLighthouse  in Pulau Pisang.  They objected to  the  flag\r\n\r\nand  we  took it down.  But they never objected then,  or\r\n\r\nlater,  to  the  flying of the Singapore  flag  on  Pedra\r\n\r\nBranca.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they making any other claims? I think the\r\n\r\nMember is asking because there were some press reports, I\r\n\r\nbelieve, in March last year where Berita Harian carried a\r\n\r\nreport  from  some Malaysian lawyer.  That might  be  the\r\n\r\nreport where it said that Pulau Tekong Kechil was part of\r\n\r\nJohor.   But  this  is  important.  The  very  next  day,\r\n\r\nMalaysia's Foreign Minister publicly denied the claim  on\r\n\r\nPulau  Tekong Kechil.  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid  said,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had  \"no  wish  to  create  new  problems   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  by  staking new claims\" and that  \"as  far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore was concerned, the only outstanding territorial\r\n\r\nmatter with Singapore was over Pedra Branca.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  may  I ask the Minister whether  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nconsidered  using mediation, instead of  arbitration,  to\r\n\r\nresolve this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The difference between mediation\r\n\r\nand arbitration is this.  A mediator would listen to both\r\n\r\nsides  and suggest a solution which will not be  binding,\r\n\r\nand  it is up to both sides.  Arbitral tribunal or  court\r\n\r\nwill  listen to both sides' facts and evidence, and  give\r\n\r\nan award or decision which will be binding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mediation possible? I will not rule out\r\n\r\nanything.  But after so many years of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussions  at  such  high  levels  between   officials,\r\n\r\nbetween  Ministers and between Prime Ministers, and  even\r\n\r\ninvolving  Senior  Minister,  and  we  do  not  reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement  -  and  I have shown you what their  attitudes\r\n\r\nhave been - I am not sure whether mediation would produce\r\n\r\nbetter results.  But in line with my position of amicable\r\n\r\nsettlement of disputes, I would not rule out any form  of\r\n\r\namicable settlement of disputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Two supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions,  Mdm Deputy Speaker.  First, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  Minister's views as to how he  sees  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  between Singapore and Malaysia,  how  has  that\r\n\r\nimpacted  upon the relationship in ASEAN.   Because  many\r\n\r\noutside ASEAN look upon ASEAN as being not a very  strong\r\n\r\norganisation,  particularly in this era of  multi-lateral\r\n\r\norganisations where people get together in order  to  put\r\n\r\nup  a  great  supposition  of  strength.   How  has  this\r\n\r\nimpacted ASEAN?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is whether the Minister considers\r\n\r\nthat  there is a need or possibility to develop a channel\r\n\r\nfor  dispute settlement among the ASEAN countries  itself\r\n\r\nbecause,  up  to now, there appears to be no channel  for\r\n\r\nsuch  a  settlement of disputes, if such disputes develop\r\n\r\nwithin ASEAN?  And whether this would be something useful\r\n\r\nfor  ASEAN  to  consider, particularly, since  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  like Singapore and Malaysia are very important\r\n\r\ncountries in the grouping?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> On the first question of whether\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties in our bilateral relations will  affect\r\n\r\nASEAN,  I would give a mixed answer, yes and no.  No,  in\r\n\r\nthe  sense that, fortunately, the way ASEAN has developed\r\n\r\nover the years, it has had a very good tradition of ASEAN\r\n\r\nmeetings  continuing among officials and  Ministers,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  of  the  10 countries  meeting  on  ASEAN\r\n\r\nprojects  without  letting bilateral  differences  impede\r\n\r\ncooperation.  So, if Members look back in the history  of\r\n\r\nASEAN, the members of ASEAN have had, at different times,\r\n\r\ntheir ups and downs in their relations, not just Malaysia\r\n\r\nand Singapore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nothers  too.   Indonesia and Malaysia had  problems  over\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants, Philippines and Malaysia  had  other\r\n\r\nproblems, and so on.  But the laudable feature  of  ASEAN\r\n\r\nis  when  you go to meetings, whether at leaders'  level,\r\n\r\nForeign Ministers' level, or other Ministers, not only do\r\n\r\nwe  sit  down and discuss, but there is also the personal\r\n\r\ncamaraderie  that continues.  For all the differences  we\r\n\r\nhave with Malaysia, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid and I are\r\n\r\nable to meet and talk and discuss at ASEAN meetings.  So,\r\n\r\nin that sense, I would say the answer is \"no\".  The \"yes\"\r\n\r\npart of a mixed answer is that, while it has not affected\r\n\r\ncooperation within ASEAN, obviously, questions  would  be\r\n\r\nasked  by  commentators outside  ASEAN  as  to  why  some\r\n\r\ncountries  are  bickering, and so on, and the  impression\r\n\r\nmay be given that ASEAN countries are in a disarray.  So,\r\n\r\nI  think  it is important for ASEAN countries to  try  to\r\n\r\nresolve these disputes among themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her second question was whether it would be useful\r\n\r\nfor  ASEAN  to  have a mechanism for dispute  settlement.\r\n\r\nActually, the answer to the question is that there  is  a\r\n\r\nfairly  high level dispute settlement procedure  provided\r\n\r\nfor in the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.  It  is\r\n\r\nknown  as  the TAC.  That is a very high level  mechanism\r\n\r\nwhich  will  involve  the  high  council  in  ASEAN.   It\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  leaders of all the ASEAN  countries.   But\r\n\r\nthat  envisages a very grave kind of situation  and  that\r\n\r\ndispute  settlement  procedure mechanism  has  not  taken\r\n\r\nplace  and,  I  think,  on  the understanding  that  most\r\n\r\ncountries  should  be  able  to  work  this  out  amongst\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

But I would like to allay the\r\n\r\nfears  of the Members that, amidst all this, one  of  the\r\n\r\nsilver   linings,  if  I  may  say  so,   is   that   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  in  our law enforcement agencies  on  both\r\n\r\nsides  - our intelligence, our narcotics, police,  CID  - have  an excellent record of close cooperation.  And this\r\n\r\nrecord  of  close cooperation continued in the  past  and\r\n\r\ncontinues  even  during the ups and  downs  in  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.   And  I  can say so from  personal  knowledge\r\n\r\nbecause, for some years, I was Minister for Home Affairs,\r\n\r\nand  there is excellent cooperation.  In fact, only a few\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  one  of our highest awards  was  bestowed  by\r\n\r\nPresident  Nathan  on  Malaysia's  Inspector-General   of\r\n\r\nPolice  - I turned up at the Investiture Ceremony  -  and\r\n\r\nthat cooperation will continue.  It has to be so.  We are\r\n\r\nso close to each other and that there is so much movement\r\n\r\nof  people at the borders that, if we were not  so,  both\r\n\r\ncountries will suffer in dealing with not just terrorism,\r\n\r\nbut  law and order, narcotics and so on.

When it  was  published\r\n\r\ntwo  years  ago, there was no fuss, and now, out  of  the\r\n\r\nblue,  it is used as a peg to stir up emotions.  I  would\r\n\r\nnot be able to tell you why.  But I will tell you,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  I  did, that such fanning of emotions is, to  put  it\r\n\r\nvery bluntly, dangerous.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nat least, now we have heard something more positive.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has said that there is good cooperation  between\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants of Home Affairs Ministry  and  their\r\n\r\nMalaysian  counterparts.  When the civil  servants  could\r\n\r\nstrike   such   a   cooperation  with   their   Malaysian\r\n\r\ncounterparts, I wonder why are our Ministers not able to.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  Mdm  Deputy Speaker, I was quite surprised  to\r\n\r\nhear  about  the  chronological sequence of  negotiations\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister and the Prime Minister had  with  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians.  It seems to me that our Ministers are  being\r\n\r\npulled  around by the Malaysians, going up and down,  and\r\n\r\nchanging the goal posts here and there.  To me, I thought\r\n\r\nthis  is  quite  uncharacteristic of the PAP  Government,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  always  talking about no  nonsense  and  being\r\n\r\ntough.   So, I am quite surprised that, in the  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations  and negotiations, it seems that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nbeing pulled around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I understand that we\r\n\r\nhave a non-speculative Foreign Minister, always based  on\r\n\r\nfacts,  very  diplomatic and very  accommodating  and,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  in the negotiations, was even prepared  to  dance\r\n\r\nwith  the  Malaysians from 45 sen to RM3 and so  on,  for\r\n\r\nwater  supply.  But I wonder whether up to this point  in\r\n\r\ntime,  with  the  approach that has been taken,  we  have\r\n\r\nreached  the  point  where there is a  need  to  open  up\r\n\r\neverything  to  the public and to tell  the  public  that\r\n\r\nperhaps there is no return to negotiations.  With the way\r\n\r\nof   Singapore's  approach  to  the  negotiations  -   so\r\n\r\naccommodating, so diplomatic - could the Foreign Minister\r\n\r\ncomment on whether this has been the correct approach  so\r\n\r\nfar?   If  so,  why  is  it that we  end  up  in  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> That is a good question, because\r\n\r\nit  causes us to pause and reflect.  As he said, why have\r\n\r\nwe  reached this position?  Have we reached the  position\r\n\r\nbecause  of  some  \"incorrect\" approach  of  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister and the correct approach of their Foreign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister?  These are not personal whims and fancies of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Minister  dealing  with  personal  whims   and\r\n\r\nfancies  of  a Malaysian Minister.  These are negotiating\r\n\r\npositions and national positions taken in the conduct  of\r\n\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have been accommodating and very reasonable\r\n\r\nin the negotiations.  But if the hon. Member had listened\r\n\r\nto  me,  and as it would be clear from the documents,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  seen how the Singapore side - not  just  the\r\n\r\nofficials  or  the Foreign Minister, but  leaders  -  the\r\n\r\npositions  we  have articulated at every turn,  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen  uppermost  in  our  minds  has  been  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest  of  Singapore.  And in  pursuing  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest  of Singapore, in the negotiations we  have  had\r\n\r\ncertain   markers,  and  those  markers  have  not   been\r\n\r\ncompromised.   What are the markers that  have  not  been\r\n\r\ncompromised?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, observance of agreements solemnly and\r\n\r\nwillingly  entered  into.   On observance  of  the  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements,  the guarantees in the Water  Agreements,  we\r\n\r\nhave always insisted on and never departed from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we were prepared to have the issues resolved\r\n\r\nin  a  package, in return for future water.   That  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  in Singapore's national interest.   That  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  central  point  in the  negotiations.   Have  we\r\n\r\nconceded on that?  We have not conceded on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, when they discontinued with the package and\r\n\r\ninsisted on the price of current water, our position  has\r\n\r\nbeen another marker - that we are prepared to discuss the\r\n\r\nprice of current water in the context of the package.  If\r\n\r\nthey  take  it out of the package, push future  water  to\r\n\r\n2059, it is off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, when it is off, we cannot be bullied and\r\n\r\nintimidated into agreeing to unilateral revision  of  the\r\n\r\nWater  Agreements.   There are clear  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nWater Agreements, and they cannot do it at their whim and\r\n\r\nfancy.  It has to be resolved in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nAnd, in accordance with the law, we say they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave lost the right to review.  They disagree, then there\r\n\r\nis  a process.  So, at every stage, I think it should  be\r\n\r\nclear  that  Singapore's negotiation  position  has  had,\r\n\r\nuppermost, the overriding interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nboth  Singapore  and  Malaysia have agreed  to  sign  the\r\n\r\nspecial  agreement on the 6th of next month to refer  the\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca  matter  to  the  International  Court   of\r\n\r\nJustice.   May I ask the Minister how long will  the  ICJ\r\n\r\ntake  to  resolve this problem and, during  this  period,\r\n\r\nwhat is Singapore's stand on the management of this small\r\n\r\nisland?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I wish I could give the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  a  specific deadline as to when  the  Court  will\r\n\r\ndecide  after  the  signing of the agreement,  but  I  am\r\n\r\nunable  to do that.  There are certain timelines.   After\r\n\r\nsigning  the agreement, within so many months, each  side\r\n\r\nmust  submit  certain kinds of documents.   And  after  a\r\n\r\nparticular  date,  each side must reply  to  the  other's\r\n\r\ndocuments,  and so on, in what is known as the pleadings.\r\n\r\nThen, a date is set for hearing.

I do not have to spell this out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her second question, what are the instructions\r\n\r\ngiven, I have no doubt that the Defence Minister, Dr Tony\r\n\r\nTan,  would  have  given whatever instructions  that  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us to maintain our territorial  integrity\r\n\r\nand sovereignty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The Minister said that our\r\n\r\ncommon   bilateral   interests   exceed   our   bilateral\r\n\r\ndifferences.

I answered that there are areas for economic\r\n\r\ncooperation and, in answer to Prof. Ngiam, I talked about\r\n\r\ncooperation  in  security  and  law  enforcement   areas,\r\n\r\ncooperation in the wider area in ASEAN and so on.  So,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  are areas for cooperation,  and  we  should\r\n\r\nendeavour  to continue in those areas and try to  resolve\r\n\r\nthese issues in a way that does not mar such cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock has observed  that,  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians, no solution is their solution, and I  believe\r\n\r\nDr  Lily  Neo has alluded to the loose talk of war.   The\r\n\r\nsituation of no-peace no-war is not good for both  sides.\r\n\r\nThere  may be an accident and a war can happen.  In 1914,\r\n\r\nhon.

I will refer to  them  from\r\n\r\nnow on as off-peak car offenders;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to require the disclosure of vehicle recalls\r\n\r\nand rectification of safety-related vehicle defects;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to provide a legislative framework for the\r\n\r\nlicensing of taxi companies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to enable enforcement action to be taken in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  jaywalking  at bus interchanges,  false  and\r\n\r\nmisleading  statements made in relation to vehicle  type-approval     and    de-registration    processes,     and\r\n\r\nindiscriminate parking of heavy vehicles; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to formalise existing procedures and to\r\n\r\nrevise outdated definitions and procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the key provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\nfor the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the penalty framework for off-peak car\r\n\r\noffenders.   My  Ministry has reviewed the penalties  for\r\n\r\noff-peak   car   offenders   who   tamper   with    their\r\n\r\nsupplementary  licences.  Typically, such  offenders  are\r\n\r\ncaught  with supplementary licences that have  torn  tabs\r\n\r\nthat are pasted back. Presumably, the offender had pasted\r\n\r\nthe tabs back in order to re-use the licence.  Currently,\r\n\r\noffenders  who  are  convicted of  tampering  with  their\r\n\r\nsupplementary  licences are given  jail  sentences,  even\r\n\r\nthough  the Road Traffic Act does not require a mandatory\r\n\r\njail sentence.  As a result, the careers of the offenders\r\n\r\nare  likely  to be ruined.  The jail sentence  is  unduly\r\n\r\nharsh for those who are convicted for the first time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the severity of the penalty for first-time\r\n\r\noffenders,  clause 13 amends section 129 of  the  RTA  to\r\n\r\nremove  the  custodial sentence provision for  first-time\r\n\r\noffenders.   However, to emphasise that it is  a  serious\r\n\r\noffence  to  tamper  with  a supplementary  licence,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine  will  be raised from  $5,000  to  $10,000.\r\n\r\nRepeat   offenders   who   tamper   with   off-peak   car\r\n\r\nsupplementary licences will face stiffer penalties.  They\r\n\r\nwill  now  be  fined up to a maximum of $20,000  or  face\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for a term of not more than  12  months  or\r\n\r\nboth.   This  represents a substantial  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nmaximum fine from $5,000 to $20,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also taken the opportunity to\r\n\r\nrationalise the penalty framework for some of  the  other\r\n\r\noff-peak car related offences.  Currently, offenders  who\r\n\r\ndrive  off-peak cars without valid supplementary licences\r\n\r\nare  liable  to  a fine, which is subject  to  a  minimum\r\n\r\npegged  to  the  road tax of a normal  car  in  the  same\r\n\r\ncategory.   This  means  that the  minimum  fine  quantum\r\n\r\nvaries according to the engine capacity of the car,  even\r\n\r\nthough the savings derived from the offence are the same,\r\n\r\nregardless of the engine capacity or road tax of the car.\r\n\r\nHence, clause 3 amends section 11A of the Act to de-link\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  penalty framework for the offence of driving an off-peak  car without a supplementary licence from the  value\r\n\r\nof  the  road tax.  It also aligns the penalty  framework\r\n\r\nfor  this  offence with other off-peak car  offences,  by\r\n\r\nsetting a maximum rather than a minimum fine.  Under  the\r\n\r\nnew  provision, first-time offenders will face fines  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $5,000 while repeat offenders will be  subject\r\n\r\nto fines not exceeding $10,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 11A(4) deals with offenders who falsify the\r\n\r\nnumber  plates  of off-peak cars, so that their  vehicles\r\n\r\ncan pass off as normal vehicles.  The Government takes  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious view of these offences.  Clause 3  enhances\r\n\r\nthe  penalty  for such offences by replacing the  current\r\n\r\nfine,  which is based on a minimum of 24 months  of  road\r\n\r\ntax,  with  a  more definitive penalty  which  carries  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine  of  $20,000 and a  provision  for  a  jail\r\n\r\nsentence.  This new penalty for this offence is  in  line\r\n\r\nwith  that proposed for repeat offenders who tamper  with\r\n\r\noff-peak car supplementary licences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the amendments serve to rationalise the\r\n\r\npenalty framework for off-peak car offences and make  the\r\n\r\npenalties  more  reflective  of  the  severity   of   the\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of amendments deals with vehicle recall\r\n\r\nrequirements  to better protect the interest  of  vehicle\r\n\r\nowners.  Currently, vehicle recalls by manufacturers  for\r\n\r\ndefects  due to the design or production process  of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle are carried out only through the co-operation and\r\n\r\ngoodwill  of  motor traders. Clause 5  introduces  a  new\r\n\r\nsection 23A to make manufacturers and dealers responsible\r\n\r\nfor  disclosing vehicle safety-related defects to the LTA\r\n\r\nand the affected vehicle owners.  To ensure the safety of\r\n\r\nthe affected vehicles, manufacturers and dealers will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to effect the necessary rectification  to  such\r\n\r\ndefects.   Manufacturers and dealers who fail to disclose\r\n\r\nsafety-related   defects   and   effect   the    required\r\n\r\nrectification will face heavy penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on now to the amendments pertaining to\r\n\r\nthe taxi industry.  A\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor  source  of dissatisfaction with the taxi  industry\r\n\r\ntoday  is  the mismatch between supply and demand  during\r\n\r\npeak  periods,  and poor service standards.   To  address\r\n\r\nthese  concerns,  clause  11 of the  Bill  introduces  an\r\n\r\nentire  new  part to set up a framework for licensing  of\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies,  with  a view to  raising  taxi  service\r\n\r\nstandards.   The new licensing framework will  also  pave\r\n\r\nthe   way  for  the  further  deregulation  of  the  taxi\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have put in place the rules on how taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  can  be  set  up  and  how  they  are  to   be\r\n\r\naccountable  for their service standards,  we  will  lift\r\n\r\ncontrols  on the number of taxi companies, and the  fleet\r\n\r\nquota  imposed on each company.  Such a move  will  allow\r\n\r\nthe market to respond freely to demand, thereby providing\r\n\r\na  better  match  between supply and demand.   This  will\r\n\r\ncomplete our move to liberalise the taxi industry,  which\r\n\r\nstarted with the de-regulation of taxi fares in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new framework, any person who wishes to\r\n\r\nrun  a  taxi  business  must apply for  a  taxi  operator\r\n\r\nlicence.   Applicants  will  be  assessed  based   on   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive set of criteria.  This would include  their\r\n\r\nfinancial   resources   and   plans   for   providing   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  service.  Applicants will  be  required  to\r\n\r\noperate  a minimum fleet size of 400 taxis, and  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven four years to achieve this.  This will ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe new operators will have sufficient economies of scale\r\n\r\nto  provide a good service, for example, by being able to\r\n\r\ninvest in GPS-based taxi booking services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the licensing framework, LTA will impose\r\n\r\nlicensing  conditions aimed at improving overall  service\r\n\r\nlevels  in  the taxi industry.  These conditions  include\r\n\r\nminimum Quality of Service standards and compliance  with\r\n\r\naudit  directions.   The  taxi  companies  will  also  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  pay  a  licence fee, which  will  be  based\r\n\r\nlargely  on  the  principle of cost recovery.   LTA  will\r\n\r\nformulate  benchmark performance standards and track  the\r\n\r\ntaxi companies' actual performance.  Companies which fail\r\n\r\nto  meet  these benchmarks will be subjected to financial\r\n\r\npenalties,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are  capped  at  $100,000 per  contravention.   In\r\n\r\nsevere and recalcitrant cases, their licences may also be\r\n\r\nsuspended or terminated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the licensing framework, LTA will also be\r\n\r\nempowered   to  specify  codes  of  practice  and   issue\r\n\r\ndirectives  in several areas, including the  preservation\r\n\r\nand  promotion  of  fair  competition  in  the  industry.\r\n\r\nTogether  with the introduction of a licensing  framework\r\n\r\nfor taxi companies, LTA will be revising the disciplinary\r\n\r\nframework for errant taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, LTA handles all disciplinary cases for taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  according to internal procedures and guidelines.\r\n\r\nLTA  will  be  revising the framework  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\ntransparent and to enable the taxi companies  to  play  a\r\n\r\nrole  in  disciplining their errant  taxi  drivers.   The\r\n\r\nrevised  framework  will be similar to  Traffic  Police's\r\n\r\nDriver  Improvement Points System.  The  details  of  the\r\n\r\noffences  and  the disciplinary framework  will  be  made\r\n\r\nknown to taxi drivers and the public in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised taxi driver vocational licence demerit\r\n\r\npoints system will complement the licensing framework for\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies.  Together, they will bring about  better\r\n\r\ntaxi  services  for commuters, and pave  the  way  for  a\r\n\r\nliberalised,   competitive  and  more   responsive   taxi\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore.  LTA will shortly release  details\r\n\r\nof the licensing framework for the taxi companies and the\r\n\r\ntaxi driver vocational licence demerit points system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enable enforcement actions to be\r\n\r\ntaken in several areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill enables the Registrar to\r\n\r\nempower employees of bus operators to take action against\r\n\r\nanyone   caught  jaywalking  at  a  bus  interchange   or\r\n\r\nterminus.   In recent years, there have been a number  of\r\n\r\nserious accidents where pedestrians were hit by reversing\r\n\r\nbuses while taking short cuts across bus parking bays  at\r\n\r\ninterchanges.   The bus operators have  put  up  advisory\r\n\r\nsigns  and  fencing to deter pedestrians from  jaywalking\r\n\r\nwithin the bus park areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, they have been unable to act against persons who\r\n\r\nignore  the  signs.  Allowing the bus operators  to  take\r\n\r\nenforcement action against jaywalking therefore serves to\r\n\r\nensure the safety of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 129 of the RTA, false or misleading\r\n\r\nstatements  or  declarations  made  in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of a vehicle are punishable. However,  this\r\n\r\nprovision does not cover similar offences in relation  to\r\n\r\nvehicle  type-approval and de-registration  applications.\r\n\r\nClause  13 extends the scope of section 129 to allow  for\r\n\r\nenforcement  action  to  be taken against  vehicle  type-approval and de-registration applications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Minister to make rules to\r\n\r\nregulate  the  keeping  and the use  of  heavy  vehicles.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  owners of heavy vehicles have to  demonstrate\r\n\r\nthat  they have approved parking places before  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  renew  their road  tax.   They  do  this  by\r\n\r\nfurnishing  their  Vehicle Parking  Certificates  (VPCs).\r\n\r\nThe  VPCs are issued by the operator of the heavy vehicle\r\n\r\npark  at which they have their designated parking places.\r\n\r\nThere  are  39,200 heavy vehicle parking lots island-wide\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  population of 27,000 registered  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles.   As  such, there are more  than  enough  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  parking  places, an excess of 12,000  additional\r\n\r\nparking places than there are vehicles.  However, despite\r\n\r\nhaving  their  designated  parking  places,  some   heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  drivers  still  park  their  vehicles  overnight\r\n\r\nillegally  or  indiscriminately along  public  roads  and\r\n\r\nwithin  private housing estates.  Usually, this  involves\r\n\r\ndrivers  or individual owners who were unable  to  obtain\r\n\r\ndesignated  parking places near to their  homes.   I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  preference  to  park  their   vehicles\r\n\r\nnearby,  so  that they can walk in the morning  to  where\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles are parked.  Unfortunately, HDB  and  URA\r\n\r\nhave  stopped providing new heavy vehicle parking  places\r\n\r\nwithin  HDB estates.  This is because of noise  pollution\r\n\r\nand  safety  concerns.  URA is also not able to  allocate\r\n\r\nnew heavy vehicle parks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext  to HDB estates because in most areas, the currently\r\n\r\navailable  large  plots of vacant land are  usually  land\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  reserved  for development  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.   As such, these drivers should, like  the  other\r\n\r\ndrivers  who  are  parking their vehicles  in  designated\r\n\r\nparking places, make the necessary transport arrangements\r\n\r\nto   get  to  and  from  their  vehicles  parked  in  the\r\n\r\ndesignated parking places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will enable enforcement actions to be\r\n\r\ntaken  against indiscriminate parking of heavy  vehicles.\r\n\r\nBut  before LTA proceeds to take enforcement actions,  it\r\n\r\nwill provide a grace period for owners and drivers to  be\r\n\r\ninformed  about this new regulation.  As there are  still\r\n\r\nsome vacant parking lots available near HDB estates,  LTA\r\n\r\nwill work with URA and HDB to make known to heavy vehicle\r\n\r\nowners  and drivers where these additional parking spaces\r\n\r\nare  still available. In the meantime, I would urge heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle    owners   and   drivers   who    are    parking\r\n\r\nindiscriminately  at night to make appropriate  transport\r\n\r\narrangements  to  travel  between  their  home  and   the\r\n\r\ndesignated parking places of their heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments proposed under the Bill\r\n\r\nconcern   the  refinement  of  existing  procedures   and\r\n\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in summary, this Bill contains several\r\n\r\namendments  aimed  largely at supporting  new  regulatory\r\n\r\nframeworks,   as  well  as  formalising   and   improving\r\n\r\nprocedures  for better administration and more  effective\r\n\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  wish to speak in support of  this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill.   There are several areas of amendments listed  out\r\n\r\nby   the  Minister  and,  in  general,  I  support  these\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I want to focus today on this issue\r\n\r\nof  licensing  of taxi operators.  This is  an  important\r\n\r\nfeature in this list of amendments, and it focuses mainly\r\n\r\non  the  legislative  framework  for  licensing  of  taxi\r\n\r\noperators which will come in place.  We have heard a  lot\r\n\r\nof  complaints  and we read about them regularly  in  the\r\n\r\npapers  from  the public concerning this call  for  taxis\r\n\r\nduring peak hours or rainy period, and this is one of the\r\n\r\nissues  which I suppose the Bill addresses,  ie,  service\r\n\r\nstandards of taxi companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that while there are certain conditions\r\n\r\nwhich are attached to this legislative framework for  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of taxi operators within the context  of  more\r\n\r\ncompetition,  as  spelt out in section  111,  I  am  not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  entirely persuaded that by licensing conditions\r\n\r\nalone,  we  can  properly  and  adequately  tackle   this\r\n\r\nquestion   of   service  standards  during   periods   of\r\n\r\nheightened  demand,  such  as during  holiday  season  or\r\n\r\nduring  peak hours and rainy season, and so on.  While  I\r\n\r\ncan  understand  public  sentiments  when  taxis  do  not\r\n\r\nrespond  during holiday seasons and the attempts made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to try and correct them, we can think about\r\n\r\nissues  or instances of airport service standards  during\r\n\r\nChinese New Year, or shopping centres, and so on,  during\r\n\r\nrainy periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a journalist wrote a long piece decrying\r\n\r\nthe transport service standards in Singapore when she had\r\n\r\nto  wait  for hours for taxis at Centrepoint  during  the\r\n\r\nChristmas  season  or  rainy period.   I  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nfrustration  of  any member of the public  waiting  at  a\r\n\r\nstand  for a taxi which does not turn up.  But I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat we should try to understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe problem of delivering service to satisfy peak demands\r\n\r\nin  its  proper  context.  This kind of  heightened  peak\r\n\r\ndemand  is  not  something new.  Just a  heightened  peak\r\n\r\ndemand,    epitomises   by   the   long   queue   outside\r\n\r\nCentrepoint's taxi stand, cannot be satisfied within that\r\n\r\nwindow,  especially when the holiday shopping  season  is\r\n\r\ncoupled with a rainy period.  It is the same, whether  we\r\n\r\nare  talking  about waiting for a taxi in Centrepoint  or\r\n\r\nwaiting for a taxi outside Harrods in London.  It is  the\r\n\r\nsame problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not trying to explain away the problem of taxi\r\n\r\noperators'  service standard.  But it is only logical  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  when  the demand within the window  period  is\r\n\r\nheightened,  as  is  expected  during  rainy  or  holiday\r\n\r\nseasons, some mechanism for rationing and allocation must\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to  operate, to solve this  problem  of  the\r\n\r\nfrustrated  long  queue wait.  We have to  solve  such  a\r\n\r\nproblem  in  micro-management terms as best as  possible.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  not  fair, I would say, to  blast  away  the\r\n\r\noverall  transport system and decry the world's  standard\r\n\r\nservice that we have delivered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, economists have been talking about this\r\n\r\nand the answer comes from the time of Adam Smith.  It  is\r\n\r\ncalled  the  price  mechanism in  allocating  of  limited\r\n\r\nresources.   Whenever there is a long queue  waiting  for\r\n\r\ntaxis  and  the  taxis are not available,  we  should  be\r\n\r\nwondering  where  they  are.   If  the  taxis  are  fully\r\n\r\noccupied in servicing all the other parts of the  island,\r\n\r\nand if we are so concerned about that particular belt  or\r\n\r\nshopping  point in town that must be serviced,  then  the\r\n\r\nanswer is to put in a price differential factor through a\r\n\r\nproper  pricing mechanism sufficiently enough to  attract\r\n\r\nthe supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wonder whether the Minister, in this taxi\r\n\r\noperating  licence and service standard  framework,  will\r\n\r\nalso  instruct  the  LTA to think along  that  line.   We\r\n\r\nshould allow for the price loading interesting enough for\r\n\r\nthe  taxis to ply into the city, not just to attract  the\r\n\r\nflow  of  taxis  into  the city but also  to  offset  the\r\n\r\nadditional cost of coming into the city because of ERP\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges.   And  a price loading must also be sufficiently\r\n\r\nattractive  for  taxi drivers to come into  town  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  so many other demands for their  services  in\r\n\r\nother places at those times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said this, it is possible that too many\r\n\r\ntaxis  are  changing shifts during certain  hours.   This\r\n\r\nactually  can  be  adjusted by administrative  rules  for\r\n\r\noperators so that they do not change shifts at one  time,\r\n\r\ntaking  away  taxis during a certain  time  window.   The\r\n\r\nauthority  can ask operators to actually smooth  out  the\r\n\r\navailability  within  a certain band  or  plus  or  minus\r\n\r\ncertain percentage so that the changing of shifts can  be\r\n\r\nactually  distributed  across a  day  period.   Then  you\r\n\r\nsmooth  out  this  aberration in availability  of  supply\r\n\r\nduring  those changing shift periods.  Another  thing  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the  supply is actually to  require  a  certain\r\n\r\nminimum  logging of mileage by taxis, which  I  think  is\r\n\r\npresently being done by the LTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support these new amendments for taxi\r\n\r\noperators, I would also caution that we should let market\r\n\r\nforces  more play and more room to play, so that  choices\r\n\r\ncan  be offered to the customers.  Customers should  also\r\n\r\nbe  realistic about service standard at peak times and be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  bear with increased charges for  delivering\r\n\r\nservices at those hours.  These amendments also pave  the\r\n\r\nway  for the liberalisation of the taxi industry and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said that it will probably  be  the  final\r\n\r\ntouch to the completion of this liberalisation effort.  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  this.  However, while deregulation is  welcomed,\r\n\r\nbasic standards of deliverables must be set with rules to\r\n\r\ncomply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sections 111(g) and (h) of the Bill spell out\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  the operators to meet the  guidelines  on\r\n\r\ncodes   of  practice,  performance  standards  and   fair\r\n\r\ncompetition.   In the past, I understand there  had  been\r\n\r\nhalf-yearly  performance yardsticks  by  which  operators\r\n\r\nhave  to  fulfill  and I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  operators,  in general, up  to  now  meet  these\r\n\r\nyardsticks.  I suppose these include\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nutilisation   rate,  the  engaged  mileage  rate,   radio\r\n\r\ndespatch  rate, and so on.  If so, what are  the  further\r\n\r\nyardsticks or performance indicators that he has in  mind\r\n\r\nthat the LTA will need to target.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing these performance indices (KPIs), we\r\n\r\nmust  not  tilt the index list so that the  operators  in\r\n\r\nfulfilling  them  end  up giving a  buyer's  product  and\r\n\r\noutput  which  will  not  benefit  the  larger  group  of\r\n\r\nconsumers.   What do I mean?  If a KPI list is  drawn  up\r\n\r\nfor  monitoring  and it has too much  weight  given,  for\r\n\r\nexample, to measuring booking performance, then operators\r\n\r\nwill  play this game.  Or the LTA might want to put heavy\r\n\r\nweight  on  utilisation rate such as, for  example,  paid\r\n\r\nmileage out of a total mileage plied by the taxis.  Then,\r\n\r\nwe  may  end up with most taxis waiting around for calls.\r\n\r\nIf  that happens, this would work against the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  public who need taxis for street hire.  So  the  end\r\n\r\nresult  is that the poor hirer on the street suffers  and\r\n\r\ntaxis  will not be available to the people on the street,\r\n\r\nwhile meeting the demand for those who want to book.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in implementing these regulations, I urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry to apply the light regulatory touch.  We  should\r\n\r\ngive market forces more play and more room to play.   The\r\n\r\nmore  regulations we put in, the less room there  is  for\r\n\r\ncompetitive  market forces to be at  work,  and  the  net\r\n\r\nresult is a loss of consumer welfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory costs should be minimum so that the\r\n\r\nconsumer does not end up paying for all these.   While  I\r\n\r\nam  a firm believer in relative pricing mechanism to draw\r\n\r\nout the allocation, I am not urging for heavy fees to  be\r\n\r\nslapped  on in a non-discriminatory way.  That  way  will\r\n\r\nnot  allow  for the allocation mechanism  to  work.   The\r\n\r\nprice mechanism must give room for differentiation in the\r\n\r\nprice  level  for  allocation.   Slapping  on  additional\r\n\r\nlicensing fees alone is not necessarily the solution.  In\r\n\r\nthe same way, any cost of administration or audit, or for\r\n\r\ncompliance,  should not be passed on  to  the  operators.\r\n\r\nThis  is  important.   In times like  this  when  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the competitiveness in our  private  and\r\n\r\npublic sectors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  economy,  we  should not pass  down  costs  from\r\n\r\nadministration,  which properly should  be  part  of  the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy,   to  the  private  sector.    Because   the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the bureaucracy and the public sector  must\r\n\r\nalso  be  subject to the rigours of audit and performance\r\n\r\nand to the yardsticks of efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nrise  in support of the Bill.  First of all, I would like\r\n\r\nto  applaud  the Ministry of Transport for introducing  a\r\n\r\nlegislative  framework  for the  licensing  of  the  taxi\r\n\r\nindustry,  which plays an important role in  our  tourism\r\n\r\nand  transportation development.  But I am not  sure  how\r\n\r\nthis  licensing  framework is  going  to  address  public\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  with  the  taxi  industry  and   improve\r\n\r\nservice for the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key issues we have to look at first is\r\n\r\nwhether taxis are considered public transport service  or\r\n\r\na   mode   of  private  transportation.   In  the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council's  \"Framework  of  Regulating   Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Services\",  the Land  Transport  Authority  is\r\n\r\nacknowledged  to have the responsibilities  of  licensing\r\n\r\nand  regulating  rapid transit system  as  well  as  taxi\r\n\r\nservices.   But,  in  reality, taxis  do  not  enjoy  any\r\n\r\nbenefits that are accorded to public transport providers.\r\n\r\nBe  it the ERP charges, vehicle tax structure or the COE,\r\n\r\ntaxis  are basically treated no differently from  private\r\n\r\ncars.   Yet,  taxi  drivers  have  to  abide  by  various\r\n\r\nregulations  and  face constraints that  are  imposed  on\r\n\r\nprivate car drivers.  So, perhaps ERP charges are one  of\r\n\r\nthe  key  reasons  for the complaint of mismatch  between\r\n\r\nsupply and demand during peak hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what many thought, taxis do pick up\r\n\r\npassengers inside the CBD at peak hours.  But  once  they\r\n\r\ndrive  out of the CBD, most would cruise outside the  CBD\r\n\r\nas  there are not many passengers who travel into the CBD\r\n\r\nduring  week day evenings.  Most taxi drivers  would  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  risk driving back into the CBD without a  fare,\r\n\r\npay  ERP charges and put up with the traffic jams in  the\r\n\r\nhope of picking up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers  within  the  CBD a second  time.   Naturally,\r\n\r\nwithout  this  turnaround, peak hour demand  will  always\r\n\r\nexceed supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I then look at the proposed licensing\r\n\r\nframework  again  and wonder whether it will  solve  such\r\n\r\nservice shortcomings and bring about improvements.  There\r\n\r\nare  about  19,000 taxis on our roads today.   Of  these,\r\n\r\nsome  18,000, or 95%, are managed by the big operators  - Comfort,  City  Cab  and TIBS.  They  are  either  public\r\n\r\nlisted  or  owned  by public listed  entities.   I  would\r\n\r\nassume  that these operators do care about their  service\r\n\r\nstandards, are concerned about public complaints  and  do\r\n\r\nhave  the  resources to invest in training and facilities\r\n\r\nto maintain certain performance standards.  How would the\r\n\r\nproposed  licensing  framework cause  taxi  companies  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their  service  beyond  what  the  existing  big\r\n\r\noperators  are already doing?  It is not that  I  do  not\r\n\r\nsupport  the  need for taxi operators to be licensed  and\r\n\r\nregulated.   My  concern is about the big taxi  companies\r\n\r\npassing   on  the  cost  of  compliance  to  the   38,000\r\n\r\nindividual  taxi  drivers or to taxi commuters  who  make\r\n\r\n600,000 trips daily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are an estimated 85,000 persons holding taxi\r\n\r\nvocational  driving  licence in our  economy.   With  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  poor economic conditions, there is  a  queue  of\r\n\r\npeople  waiting to be taxi drivers.  The income  of  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers has fallen by 10-15% because of the weak economy.\r\n\r\nCommuters' expectations and pressure on the taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nto  meet higher standards continue to rise.  Taxi drivers\r\n\r\ndare  not  speak up against their operators for  fear  of\r\n\r\nlosing  their  rice  bowl.  In  the  meantime,  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  shifting  the operational  and  financial\r\n\r\nrisks and liabilities to their drivers.  The taxi licence\r\n\r\nthus  has  become  a  money printing machine,  where  the\r\n\r\nlicence  holder simply sits back and rents out  its  taxi\r\n\r\nwithout much financial risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much taxi drivers can do if operators\r\n\r\ndecide  to  shift their cost burden to them,  or  not  to\r\n\r\nshare  any  increase in revenue with them.  For  example,\r\n\r\nLTA  recently  approved a taxi operator's application  to\r\n\r\nplace an advertising panel sitting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  top  of the back of the taxi boot.  The panel  covers\r\n\r\nhalf   of  the  rear  view  of  the  taxi  driver.   This\r\n\r\ncompromises  the  safety  of the driver,  passengers  and\r\n\r\nother  road  users.   If the panel is damaged,  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  would most certainly be made responsible for  the\r\n\r\nrepairs.   But how much of this advertising revenue  does\r\n\r\nthe taxi company share with the driver?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to move on to the revised\r\n\r\npenalty for off-peak car offenders.  Considering that the\r\n\r\ntotal  number  of weekend or off-peak cars registered  in\r\n\r\nthe last 10 years is only about 7,000, I am surprised  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that  close to 200 people have received  custodial\r\n\r\nsentences   for   tampering  with   their   supplementary\r\n\r\nlicences.  I fully support the revised penalty framework,\r\n\r\nas  I  see this as a necessary move by Parliament to step\r\n\r\nin  and  entrench in the law the desired  punishment  for\r\n\r\nfirst-time offenders and to have a higher maximum fine in\r\n\r\nplace of a custodial sentence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to formalising procedures to make\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  and  dealers  responsible  for  disclosing\r\n\r\nvehicle safety related defects and rectifying them,  this\r\n\r\nis  indeed  a  good move.  This is particularly  so  when\r\n\r\nthere are now more and more parallel importers.  But with\r\n\r\nthe relative ease of setting up a parallel import agency,\r\n\r\none would also expect more of such agencies going out  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Who could the car owner turn to in the  event\r\n\r\nthat  his dealer has gone bust?  And instead of requiring\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the  defects  to be  given  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nnewspaper  advertisements, would it not be more effective\r\n\r\nif  media  releases were issued and carried by the  local\r\n\r\nnews  networks?   The dealer can then be  charged  a  fee\r\n\r\nbased  on  the number of defective vehicles he  has  sold\r\n\r\nwhich needed to be recalled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this Bill also deals with the indiscriminate\r\n\r\nparking  of  heavy vehicles.  I believe the  solution  to\r\n\r\nillegal  parking of heavy vehicles is not just in beefing\r\n\r\nup  enforcement  and  introducing  more  regulations  and\r\n\r\nfines,   but  to  couple  strict  enforcement  with   the\r\n\r\nprovision of more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlots  for such vehicles at more accessible parking  areas\r\n\r\ncloser  to the housing estates.  I would like to strongly\r\n\r\nurge  the Ministry of Transport to work closely with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development to solve this  problem.\r\n\r\nHeavy  vehicle  drivers  play an important  role  in  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment as a logistics and transportation  hub.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  a port driver has to be on call and get  up  at\r\n\r\nodd hours of the night and morning to move containers and\r\n\r\nkeep  our  port bustling around the clock.  I believe  we\r\n\r\nowe it to them to provide them with some transportational\r\n\r\nand  infrastructural support, to help them in their  work\r\n\r\nduties.   We cannot just leave them to tackle  their  own\r\n\r\nproblems  and  inconveniences, while we  take  pride  and\r\n\r\napplaud  when  our  port is ranked the  world's  best  or\r\n\r\nbusiest.  Let us not forget the individuals and the  nuts\r\n\r\nand bolts that help drive our success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  (Amendment)  Bill  authorises  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\npunish  the  drivers of heavy vehicles for indiscriminate\r\n\r\nparking.  Instead of parking their heavy vehicles in  the\r\n\r\ndesignated  places,  these drivers chose  to  park  their\r\n\r\nbuses  and lorries near the HDB estates or in the private\r\n\r\nhousing  estates, resulting in a lot of  complaints  from\r\n\r\nthe residents there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners of these heavy vehicles have actually\r\n\r\npurchased  the licences to have their vehicles parked  at\r\n\r\nthe designated vehicle parks. Yet, the drivers choose  to\r\n\r\npark  these  vehicles in the housing  estates.   I  think\r\n\r\nthere  must be a  reason why they are doing so.   I  have\r\n\r\nspoken  to  some  of these drivers and I  now  understand\r\n\r\ntheir problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two important factors. Most of the\r\n\r\ndrivers  of  these heavy vehicles, including lorries  and\r\n\r\nbuses,  are  living in HDB estates.  They belong  to  the\r\n\r\nlower middle income group of people.  Their working hours\r\n\r\nare irregular, having to leave home early and return home\r\n\r\nlate  every  day.  Naturally, they would prefer  to  park\r\n\r\ntheir vehicles at proper parking places near their flats.\r\n\r\nBut parking lots for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheavy vehicles are not readily available near the housing\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the Land Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority,  if an owner wants to renew the road  tax  for\r\n\r\nhis  heavy  vehicle, he must produce  a  Vehicle  Parking\r\n\r\nCertificate (VPC) to prove that he has a proper place  to\r\n\r\npark  his  vehicle.    Since such parking  lots  are  not\r\n\r\navailable near their HDB estates, he would have no choice\r\n\r\nbut to purchase a VPC for parking at a designated vehicle\r\n\r\npark  at  some remote industrial estate, just to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  requirement for the renewal of road tax.   As  these\r\n\r\nparking  places are far away, private bus  drivers  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  leave home before 5 o'clock in the  morning  to\r\n\r\nferry  the students to school and lorry drivers too  have\r\n\r\nto  leave  home  early to avoid the morning  peak  hours.\r\n\r\nMore  often than not, public transportation such  as  MRT\r\n\r\nand  buses  are not available in the early hours  of  the\r\n\r\nmorning.  In the circumstances, they decide to park their\r\n\r\nvehicles somewhere near their HDB estates, and risk being\r\n\r\nbooked  for  such parking offences and incur heavy  fines\r\n\r\nevery month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, some 2,000 parking lots for heavy vehicles\r\n\r\nwere  allocated  in Jurong East, Jalan  Bahar,  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang,  Bukit  Panjang  and Bukit Gombak.   The  needs  of\r\n\r\ndrivers  in  the western part of Singapore are  basically\r\n\r\nsatisfied.   But such parking facilities in  the  eastern\r\n\r\nand  northern  parts  of Singapore, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nnewer  HDB estates in Sengkang, Woodlands, etc, are still\r\n\r\nlacking.  I  hope that the Minister would understand  the\r\n\r\nplight of these drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister mentioned that the total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  available parking lots exceeds the number  of\r\n\r\nheavy vehicles registered in Singapore. But most of these\r\n\r\nparking  lots  are  situated at  industrial  estates  and\r\n\r\nremote  places which are impractical for the  drivers  to\r\n\r\nuse  them.  Yes, there are parking lots, but the  drivers\r\n\r\njust  cannot  make  use of them. Therefore,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to liaise with the HDB and URA to  open  up  or\r\n\r\ndevelop more parking lots for heavy vehicles in order  to\r\n\r\nmeet  their demands.  Lorries and bus drivers have played\r\n\r\na great role in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  nation building and economic development. We  should\r\n\r\ndo something to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With advanced IT, can LTA dispense with the need to\r\n\r\nproduce  the  VPC when renewing the road  tax  for  these\r\n\r\nheavy  vehicles,  just like the way we  renew  our  radio\r\n\r\nlicence  with the road tax of our motorcars?  This  would\r\n\r\nsave the owners the trouble of having to go personally to\r\n\r\nLTA just to physically produce the VPC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  on  the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill,  I  will\r\n\r\ntouch mainly on clause 11 which refers to the new Part VA\r\n\r\nof the Bill that sets out the framework for the licensing\r\n\r\nof  taxi operators with the aim of bringing about  better\r\n\r\ntaxi services for commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting a licensing framework in place, the\r\n\r\namendments   will   provide  a  direction   for   further\r\n\r\npossibilities in deregulating the taxi industry, such  as\r\n\r\nallowing  it  to respond to market forces that  determine\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of  taxis.  The new section 111A  defines  a\r\n\r\nperson  who operates a taxi service as one who owns  more\r\n\r\nthan  one taxi and leases them to individual drivers  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of providing taxis for hire or booking.  The\r\n\r\ninsertion  of  Part VA is timely for the  taxi  industry.\r\n\r\nThis is especially so in view of NTUC Comfort's plans  to\r\n\r\nmerge  with Delgro to form a huge transport company  with\r\n\r\nthe potential to monopolise the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the merger, NTUC Comfort will be the market\r\n\r\nleader  with 17,000 taxis, or 90% of the market,  leaving\r\n\r\nTIBS taxis as the other operator with only 2,000 taxis to\r\n\r\ncompete.  This Bill will then allow other players, be  it\r\n\r\nbig or small, to enter the market to compete.  However, I\r\n\r\nwish  to highlight that, while the legal framework allows\r\n\r\nplayers  to  compete within the rules,  it  must  not  be\r\n\r\nstifling to participants who are comparatively of smaller\r\n\r\norganisation sizes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must try to create an environment for competition\r\n\r\nto be fair, irrespective of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  size of market participants.  Competition should  be\r\n\r\nbased not only on cost but also on services.  New section\r\n\r\n111D(1)(g) states that the Ministry must specify codes of\r\n\r\npractice and standards of performances in connection with\r\n\r\nthe  preservation and promotion of fair competition.   An\r\n\r\nindustry that merely consists of two players is certainly\r\n\r\nnot  healthy  for our public transport system.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe  Transport Ministry may, as a start, promote a scheme\r\n\r\nto  encourage successful taxi drivers to band together to\r\n\r\nform  their  own  corporations to hold licences  as  taxi\r\n\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to raise some concerns relating\r\n\r\nto taxi drivers.  Taxi drivers are the frontline faces of\r\n\r\nthe  industry.   How  they  carry  out  the  services  to\r\n\r\ncommuters  will  determine  the  success  of   the   taxi\r\n\r\noperators  that rent the vehicles to them.  Collectively,\r\n\r\nthey are a potent force in promoting goodwill to tourists\r\n\r\nand  a  conduit for the latest news in town.   They  work\r\n\r\nlong  hours  and,  most  of the time,  in  heavy  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions  under wet and hot weather.  It takes  stamina\r\n\r\nand  endurance to drive a taxi for eight to ten  hours  a\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, regulations must be in place to monitor the\r\n\r\ntaxi operators' house rules, which have to be observed by\r\n\r\nthe  taxi drivers and which may, at times, be onerous  to\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  drivers when these rules are taken in addition\r\n\r\nto  the  usual  regulatory obligations of  the  industry.\r\n\r\nSuch  monitoring would go a long way in making sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  operators give due consideration to  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers   in   their  pursuit  to  provide   better   and\r\n\r\ncompetitive services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New operators who are successful should also be\r\n\r\nencouraged to provide assistance schemes to taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nNTUC Comfort has a retirement scheme which has begun this\r\n\r\nmonth.   Taxi drivers with at least ten years of  service\r\n\r\nwill  receive  a  lump-sum ranging from $300  to  $1,400.\r\n\r\nThey  will also receive annual amounts ranging from  $100\r\n\r\nto   $400.    TIBS  taxis  also  has  an  incentive   and\r\n\r\nprogressive  bonus  of up to $1,300 every  year  for  its\r\n\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority, which I assume will\r\n\r\ncontinue to regulate the taxi industry, should take  into\r\n\r\naccount  new incentives to encourage taxi drivers  to  be\r\n\r\nproud  of  their vocation, in which this new  legislation\r\n\r\nhas  not taken into account.  Provisions, such as  relief\r\n\r\npackages  for  taxi drivers in the event of  an  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  can  be  mandatory for taxi operators  to  set\r\n\r\naside.   This  safety net provided for  by  the  industry\r\n\r\nplayers will be more and more crucial when commuters have\r\n\r\nmore  choices  of transport to choose from,  causing  the\r\n\r\nearnings  of  taxi  drivers to fall  heavily  during  bad\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an illustration, a taxi hirer pays about $100 per\r\n\r\nday  as hirer's fee, which is usually borne by the  hirer\r\n\r\nand  his relief driver.  In addition, diesel cost per day\r\n\r\ncomes  up to about $15, after discount.  This means that,\r\n\r\neach  day, a taxi driver has an overhead cost of at least\r\n\r\n$115  to recover before seeing any profits.  In order  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  decent income each month, a taxi driver  has  to\r\n\r\ndrive  long  hours to earn more, in order  to  cover  his\r\n\r\nfixed  overhead  costs.  This may be at  the  expense  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining a safe level of concentration for  themselves\r\n\r\nand  other  road  users.  A relief  package  during  poor\r\n\r\neconomic conditions will help in reducing business  costs\r\n\r\nto the taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC Comfort, as a responsible taxi operator, has\r\n\r\nalready  extended a relief package to taxi drivers  since\r\n\r\nNovember  2001, which will last till August  2003.   This\r\n\r\npackage  consists of a monthly rental rebate  of  $40  in\r\n\r\ncash  and $20 worth of diesel, adding up to a $60  relief\r\n\r\npackage.  It has also promised to sell diesel to  cabbies\r\n\r\nat  a discounted price.  However, I urge the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nmonitor such relief schemes, in order to do more to  help\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers tide over tough times.  This help scheme  is\r\n\r\neven  more necessary, as the relationship between drivers\r\n\r\nand  operators is no longer that of a cooperative,  where\r\n\r\nthe  drivers  are  shareholders of  the  cooperative  and\r\n\r\nowners of their cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which regulators need to note in\r\n\r\nregulating  a robust taxi industry is the taxi operators'\r\n\r\nway   of  handling  taxi  drivers'  welfare  after   road\r\n\r\naccidents.  Let\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  illustrate.  For NTUC Comfort drivers, a  deposit  of\r\n\r\n$1,500,  excluding  GST,  has  to  be  paid  irregardless\r\n\r\nwhether the driver was at fault or not.  Deductions would\r\n\r\nthen  be made from the deposit for repairs when he is  at\r\n\r\nfault.  However, if the driver is not at fault, it  takes\r\n\r\nup  to  a year for the refund to be made.  The driver  is\r\n\r\nfurther disadvantaged as he would be out of pocket during\r\n\r\nthe period of repairs to his vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 111C(3)(d) of the Bill states that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  consider  \"the existence  of  other  taxi\r\n\r\nservices\", which is the supply side, \"and the demand  for\r\n\r\ntaxi services\" to determine whether to grant a licence to\r\n\r\noperate  a  taxi service.  I would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nclarify  what  are the considerations the  Ministry  will\r\n\r\ntake into account to determine the number of taxi drivers\r\n\r\nand  operators in the market, and what are the guideposts\r\n\r\nthat  will  signal the Ministry that the  market  may  be\r\n\r\nsaturated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC Comfort started with a fleet of 1,200 taxis in\r\n\r\n1970, rising to 11,000 in 2002.  TIBS taxis started  with\r\n\r\n50  taxis  in 1990 and, in 2000, it released its  2,000th\r\n\r\ntaxi on the road.  This steady increase in the number  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  has  been even felt by passengers.   A  grassroots\r\n\r\nleader  told  me that 10 years ago, one has  to  wait  at\r\n\r\nleast  20-30  minutes for a cab.  Today, according  to  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  conducted by NTUC Comfort, 90% of passengers  say\r\n\r\nthey can get a cab within 10 minutes.  While this is good\r\n\r\nnews  to  the commuters, it translates into lower  income\r\n\r\nfor drivers, but not necessarily taxi operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when regulating the taxi industry, fines\r\n\r\nand  punishments, as stated in new section 111H for  both\r\n\r\ntaxi  operators and taxi drivers for offences,  need  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be made in haste for the sake of efficiency,\r\n\r\nthrough imposing heavy fines according to the book.   But\r\n\r\noptions  must  be in place for a dispute  resolution  and\r\n\r\nmediation process, which may eventually lead to either  a\r\n\r\nwaiver  or reduction of the fine.  This avenue  can  help\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers who find that the cost of doing the business\r\n\r\nin  driving  a  taxi already too high.  The Ministry,  in\r\n\r\nplanning for a well-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrun  taxi industry, should have a market mechanism,  such\r\n\r\nas  a dispute resolution and mediation panel that is fair\r\n\r\nand  unbiased for taxi drivers and operators to  turn  to\r\n\r\nfor help when faced with unfair practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe this Bill will provide\r\n\r\na  foundation  for  the Ministry of  Transport  to  allow\r\n\r\nhealthy competition in the taxi industry which, in  turn,\r\n\r\nwill be more responsive to changes in the transport needs\r\n\r\nof the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nplease  allow me to seek clarification from Mr Andy  Gan.\r\n\r\nIs he aware that Comfort is a publicly-listed company and\r\n\r\nnot a NTUC cooperative?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Yes, I am aware of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  the four MPs who have spoken, and Mr Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang,  the  5th MP, who pointed out that Comfort  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger a NTUC cooperative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will address the points brought up by the Members\r\n\r\nin  turn.   Some  of them may overlap, because  they  all\r\n\r\ntouch on pretty much the same theme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay started by talking about the problems faced\r\n\r\nby  the  taxi  industry, particularly the dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nwith the taxi industry in terms of supply versus demand - that  during peak periods, commuters have to wait  for  a\r\n\r\nlong time.  And he felt that the price solution is really\r\n\r\nthe  best mechanism, that when there is a scarce resource\r\n\r\nand  there  is a mismatch between supply and demand,  the\r\n\r\nprice  mechanism needs to come in to make sure that there\r\n\r\nis  a  better balance.  I totally agree with Mr Chay that\r\n\r\nthis  indeed is the case, especially when the  demand  is\r\n\r\nnot  constant throughout the day.  The commuters complain\r\n\r\nabout  the  long queues for taxis at peak periods  during\r\n\r\nrainy  weather and that, even when there is fine weather,\r\n\r\nduring  the peak periods, there is never enough.  But  it\r\n\r\nis not because taxi drivers are not working.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  demand far outstrips supply.  So,  the  question\r\n\r\nis: Is the supply of taxis in Singapore inadequate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the answer is: No, far from it.\r\n\r\nWe  actually  have  more taxis per  1,000  population  in\r\n\r\nSingapore than any other equivalent major city.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain.  In Singapore today, we have 4.8 taxis per 1,000\r\n\r\npopulation.   This compares with only 2.8 taxis  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  2.9 in New York, 2.6 in London, and 2.3 in  Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIf  we have almost double the number of taxis compared to\r\n\r\nother  places, and despite the fact that we have  a  good\r\n\r\nbus  and  MRT system, why is there such a strong mismatch\r\n\r\nbetween  supply  and  demand during  peak  periods?   The\r\n\r\nanswer,  as  pointed  out  by  Mr  Chay,  is  the   price\r\n\r\nmechanism.   In  Singapore, the average fare  for  a  10-kilometre taxi ride costs about $7, compared to $16.70 in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong and $20 in New York and London.  In fact, with\r\n\r\nour low taxi fares, 3-4 persons travelling together as  a\r\n\r\ngroup  will  find the taxi fare only a little bit  higher\r\n\r\nthan if they had taken a bus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not for my Ministry to set taxi fares, as\r\n\r\nwe  had  deregulated taxi fares already  in  1998.   Taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  need  to strike a good  balance  between\r\n\r\nfares that are too low versus raising them too high.  Low\r\n\r\nfares  will  result in taxi drivers having to  work  very\r\n\r\nlong  hours  to  earn a decent living, but will  generate\r\n\r\nplenty  of  consumer demand.  On the other  hand,  higher\r\n\r\nfares  will give the taxi hirers a better income but  may\r\n\r\nreduce taxi ridership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, the taxi companies have been careful\r\n\r\nabout raising fares in a weak economy.  Also, there is no\r\n\r\nshortage  of  taxi  drivers,  as  the  income  is   still\r\n\r\nattractive.   But  when the economy  recovers,  the  taxi\r\n\r\nindustry  will  have to compete with other employers  for\r\n\r\nworkers  and drivers.  And what the drivers are  able  to\r\n\r\nearn,  compared to other jobs, will then  be  a  relevant\r\n\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, even today, it may be useful for the\r\n\r\ntaxi companies to look into,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Chay  has  pointed out, whether a higher  premium\r\n\r\nshould be added for certain places.  For example, at  the\r\n\r\nairport.   The  airport needed to put on a  surcharge  in\r\n\r\norder  to  attract  taxis  to  go  there  to  serve   the\r\n\r\npassengers.   So,  for  certain  shopping  centres,  etc,\r\n\r\nwhether a surcharge may be needed to attract taxi drivers\r\n\r\nto  go  there to serve the passengers, that is  something\r\n\r\nthe taxi companies will have to look at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also talked about the changing of shifts.\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy Speaker, the taxi companies are exploring now\r\n\r\nthe  various  means  to encourage  taxi  drivers  not  to\r\n\r\nperform  shift change during the peak periods.  LTA  also\r\n\r\nproposes  to  use this macro approach for a start.   With\r\n\r\nthe  proposed quality of service standards, one indicator\r\n\r\nthat  LTA  will  be  using is the cater  rate  for  phone\r\n\r\nbookings of taxis.  This cater rate is the percentage  of\r\n\r\ncalls  despatched  that  are  successfully  matched  with\r\n\r\ntaxis, and this is to be measured during the peak periods\r\n\r\nespecially.   In order for the taxis to be  available  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the cater rate, taxi companies will have to explore\r\n\r\nways  to encourage the taxi drivers not to perform  shift\r\n\r\nchange during the peak periods.  If this does not work, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  LTA will also look into other ways of effecting\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about the quality of service\r\n\r\nstandards,  whether the operators have met  the  existing\r\n\r\nstandards,  and what the new standards meant to  achieve.\r\n\r\nMdm  Deputy  Speaker,  in  the  past,  the  LTA  did  not\r\n\r\nprescribe any standards.  What the LTA did was to monitor\r\n\r\nthe  indicators  of  performance  captured  by  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  themselves, and use the different  submissions\r\n\r\nfrom  the three companies as a comparison and rank  them,\r\n\r\nie,  it  was  not  meant to be a service standard  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplied  with,  but rather for LTA to  monitor  how  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  are actually doing.  By having the quality  of\r\n\r\nservice  standards now under this new framework, LTA  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  proceed to stipulate what are  the  benchmarks\r\n\r\nthat  the  taxi companies would have to comply with.   As\r\n\r\npointed  out  by  Mr  Chay, we will make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nbenchmarks  are such that they are not overly  biased  in\r\n\r\nany direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of service standards will comprise a few\r\n\r\nelements,  including performance with the phone bookings,\r\n\r\nwhich really must be the guaranteed service.  Anyone  who\r\n\r\nwants  a taxi very badly, all they have to do is to  call\r\n\r\nup  any of the taxi companies, and they should be able to\r\n\r\nget  a taxi within a prescribed time-frame.  So, in  this\r\n\r\nway, we are able to assure anyone who needs a taxi badly,\r\n\r\nthat they will be able to get one.  However, we would not\r\n\r\nbe  able to guarantee that a street hailer would be  able\r\n\r\nto  just  raise  a  hand  and get one,  because  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which is fully out of the hands  of  LTA.   If\r\n\r\nthey  are at the taxi stand or they are waiting somewhere\r\n\r\nand  cannot  get a taxi, which company is guilty  of  not\r\n\r\nsupplying  enough taxis?  Whereas we can make  sure  that\r\n\r\nwhen a commuter calls in to a specific taxi company, that\r\n\r\ntaxi  company  must  be able to meet the  needs  of  that\r\n\r\ncaller.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay called for LTA to have a light regulatory\r\n\r\ntouch and to leave to the market enough room to play, and\r\n\r\nalso  to make sure that the cost of administration should\r\n\r\nnot  be passed on to operators.  Indeed, that is what LTA\r\n\r\nintends  to  do.   LTA  intends  to  implement  this  new\r\n\r\nframework  with  a  light  touch,  and  leave  the   taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  to decide on how they want to operate,  decide\r\n\r\non  what fares they want to charge, which they are  doing\r\n\r\nnow, as well as what size of the taxi fleet they wish  to\r\n\r\nhave.   Also,  we hope that with the opening  up  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket, new players would come in and, therefore, provide\r\n\r\nadditional competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the licence fees, LTA will keep the\r\n\r\nlicence  fees very moderate, and will only aim to recover\r\n\r\ncost.   Why  do  they  need to recover  cost?   Basically\r\n\r\nbecause this work that they are doing is meant to benefit\r\n\r\nboth commuters and the taxi companies.  They will need to\r\n\r\ndo   some  auditing  and  they  will  need  to  do   some\r\n\r\nadministrative  work.   It will  not  impose  much  of  a\r\n\r\nfinancial burden on the companies and, in fact, in  terms\r\n\r\nof  the audit work, LTA does not intend to set up a full-time workforce within LTA.  As and when needed, they will\r\n\r\nfarm the auditing work to consultants outside, who then\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to bid for the job.  So, in this way, we make  sure\r\n\r\nthat work is being done in the most cost-effective way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min asked whether the taxi companies are\r\n\r\npublic   or  private  transport.   Taxi  is  a   high-end\r\n\r\npersonalised  form  of  public  transport,   because   it\r\n\r\nprovides   fast,  convenient,  door-to-door  service   to\r\n\r\ncommuters, without the burden of the commuters having  to\r\n\r\nown  a  vehicle.  As it does not belong to the mainstream\r\n\r\npublic transport, our policy is to treat the taxi service\r\n\r\nlike  a  private  car  in  terms of  the  tax  structure.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it will provide incentives for people to  hire\r\n\r\ntaxis and to use it as a private vehicle because the taxi\r\n\r\nis  exempted from all the different taxes and fees.  This\r\n\r\nwould  be contrary to our policy.  Notwithstanding  this,\r\n\r\ntaxis  still enjoy some form of tax concession, in  terms\r\n\r\nof  their  road tax and the COE category.   In  addition,\r\n\r\ntaxi companies get automatic renewal of their COE by just\r\n\r\npaying the prevailing quota premium instead of having  to\r\n\r\nbid for a new COE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min also speculated as to whether the\r\n\r\nERP  is one of the factors why taxis refuse to come  into\r\n\r\nthe  city  centre to pick up passengers.  The  answer  is\r\n\r\nvery  simple.  Because the demand outstrips supply,  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers who fetch passengers from the city centre to  the\r\n\r\noutlying  areas normally do not need to come  in  because\r\n\r\nthey can find passengers wherever they are, whether it is\r\n\r\nin  an  HDB estate or elsewhere.  The answer, as Mr  Chay\r\n\r\nhas mentioned, is if you want to draw them in, it may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  taxi companies to impose a  surcharge  to\r\n\r\nmake  it attractive for the taxi drivers to come in.   In\r\n\r\nany case, with this new framework, anyone within the city\r\n\r\ncentre, if they require a taxi badly, whether they are in\r\n\r\na  taxi  queue or otherwise, they should just be able  to\r\n\r\ncall up and be guaranteed of a taxi within, I think, a 10-minute timeframe.  This would be much shorter than having\r\n\r\nto queue up for half-an-hour in a taxi queue if they need\r\n\r\na taxi badly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong was also concerned about the welfare of the\r\n\r\ntaxi  operators.  He is afraid that companies  will  just\r\n\r\npass  on  the cost of compliance to drivers  and  not  be\r\n\r\nconcerned about the welfare of the drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think the actions of the three taxi companies over the\r\n\r\npast  year  or so when the taxi drivers were  facing  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  the economic downturn show that  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  actually been very concerned  about  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of their drivers.  And this is for a good reason.\r\n\r\nThey  are \"employers\", in effect, and as \"employers\",  if\r\n\r\nthey  do not look after their own employees, I think they\r\n\r\nare  going to have very, very great difficulty recruiting\r\n\r\nfresh  drivers whenever there are resignations.  I would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, leave it to the taxi companies and the  market\r\n\r\nplace  to  operate  in this area, rather  than  have  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intervene  in terms of making  compulsory  or\r\n\r\nmandate what sort of relief package would be needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Mr Ong also said that the taxi licence may be\r\n\r\nakin  to  a money printing machine.  If it was so,  under\r\n\r\nthis new framework new companies can be set up because if\r\n\r\nthe  taxi companies are indeed making outrageous profits,\r\n\r\nI  am sure other companies would very gladly come in  and\r\n\r\nset up their own taxi fleet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong asked about the vehicle recall. He asked\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  if the dealer goes bust, and  he  proposes\r\n\r\nthat  we  require  the use of the local news  network  to\r\n\r\npublicise the recall.  Under the new framework, if  there\r\n\r\nis a recall, the manufacturer and the present dealer will\r\n\r\nhave  to make the recall.  If the dealer is no longer  in\r\n\r\nexistence, we will still go to the manufacturer,  through\r\n\r\nthe  new dealer, to do the recall.  This has been the on-going   practice.   But,  in  the  past,  this   was   an\r\n\r\nadministrative   procedure,  and  we  depended   on   the\r\n\r\ncooperation of the dealer and the manufacturer.  With the\r\n\r\npassing  of  this Bill, we will now have  the  regulatory\r\n\r\npowers to do so, if cooperation is not forthcoming.   So,\r\n\r\nit  has been on-going and it has worked quite well.   The\r\n\r\ndealers  would  then communicate directly with  the  car-owners because they have the details of who bought  which\r\n\r\nmodel.   So,  for  that particular model they  will  know\r\n\r\nexactly  who are the owners.  And, if they are unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  or to identify the current owners, LTA will  assist\r\n\r\nthem because we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the details of who the current owners are.  So,  it\r\n\r\nis  unlikely  they need to really go to  the  local  news\r\n\r\nnetwork to reach out to the current owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Mr Ang touched on heavy vehicle parks and\r\n\r\nI  will answer them together.  As I explained just now, I\r\n\r\ncan  understand  why  the individual owners  and  drivers\r\n\r\nwould  prefer to have their heavy vehicles parked nearby.\r\n\r\nIt  is great if we could achieve this but, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nall the MPs must also have encountered this.  If we allow\r\n\r\nheavy vehicles to be parked within the HDB estates, there\r\n\r\nare  a  lot of complaints about the noise level and  also\r\n\r\nabout  the  safety issue.  In fact, I had one huge  lorry\r\n\r\npark in my area before when I was in Hong Kah South,  and\r\n\r\nI  had  no  end of complaints from the residents  in  the\r\n\r\narea.   When  HDB  closed down the lorry  park,  all  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  stopped.  So, residents are really  concerned\r\n\r\nabout the noise because the drivers of the heavy vehicles\r\n\r\ntend to begin work quite early, as pointed out by Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Ang, quite often 5.00 - 6.00 am, and  when  they\r\n\r\nstart the vehicles it creates a lot of noise.  Because of\r\n\r\nthat,  HDB and URA have relocated the heavy vehicle parks\r\n\r\nout  of the HDB estates.  There are still some remaining,\r\n\r\nbut I think the majority have already been moved out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is: Is URA able to provide new\r\n\r\nheavy  vehicle parks at sites adjoining HDB estates?   We\r\n\r\nhave  asked.  URA have informed us that most of the large\r\n\r\nvacant  plots  available today are earmarked  for  future\r\n\r\ndevelopments and therefore they are not able  to  convert\r\n\r\nthese  plots  of  land to heavy vehicle parks.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to work with URA on this.  But, nonetheless,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is very important for the minority of  drivers\r\n\r\nand  owners  who  are still parking indiscriminately  and\r\n\r\nillegally,  to follow the example set by the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  owners  and  drivers.  Most of  them,  from  what  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, either ride a bicycle or a motor cycle to the\r\n\r\nheavy vehicle park.  In some cases, the companies provide\r\n\r\ntransport or a transport allowance.  This is no different\r\n\r\nfrom  workers  who have to work three shifts.   When  the\r\n\r\nworker has to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork the midnight shift or morning shift, quite often the\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  have to provide private transport  or  a\r\n\r\ntransport allowance, if the workforce is small.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  what  is  happening for most of  the  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  as well.  So, for the minority, we  will  give\r\n\r\nthem  some  grace  period  to  understand  that  the  new\r\n\r\nregulations will be in place soon, and for them  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  necessary transport arrangements to enable  them  to\r\n\r\nget  to  their  heavy vehicle in the morning  in  a  very\r\n\r\nconvenient way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng also brought up the issue of the\r\n\r\nowners  of  heavy  vehicles having to bring  the  Vehicle\r\n\r\nParking  Certificate  (VPC) to the LTA  when  they  renew\r\n\r\ntheir  road tax.  Madam, the VPC is issued to the  owners\r\n\r\nwhen  they purchase their season parking permit from  the\r\n\r\noperator  of  the  heavy vehicle park.   Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nalready have it.  When they go and renew their road  tax,\r\n\r\nit  is no additional problem for them to bring along  the\r\n\r\nVPC,  just as when we renew the road tax for our cars  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  show the inspection certificate,  we  bring  it\r\n\r\nalong with us as well.  It is no additional inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  them.  But, if there is anything in addition to  that\r\n\r\nwhich we are not aware of, I would be very happy to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom Mr Ang on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan asked that in this competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment it is important that we be fair to  both  the\r\n\r\nbig  and small taxi operators.  Yes, we intend to do  so.\r\n\r\nAnd,  in fact, for the QOS, LTA will be making sure  that\r\n\r\nfor  the  smaller companies, with a smaller  taxi  fleet,\r\n\r\nthings  like cater rate, where they would not be able  to\r\n\r\nperform  in  the  same way as the bigger companies,  they\r\n\r\nwill be given some concession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether we have a target figure for\r\n\r\nthe  number of taxi companies in Singapore as well as the\r\n\r\ntaxi  population.   We  do  not believe  that  with  this\r\n\r\nframework there is a need for us to arbitrarily establish\r\n\r\na  number.  We will leave it to the market to decide.  If\r\n\r\nthere are new companies that are coming in, and they  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to invest because they feel that they are  able\r\n\r\nto  do  a good job, we should not be stopping them.   But\r\n\r\nthe  provision is there, just in case it is needed in the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered all the questions, Madam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I would like to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification  from the Minister.  My question  is:   are\r\n\r\nthere sufficient taxis on our roads today?  Based on  the\r\n\r\ncomparative figures per 100,000 population, mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, it seems that there are sufficient  taxis,\r\n\r\nbut  yet we all agree that during peak periods and  rainy\r\n\r\ndays,  there  is  a mismatch.  So, how  would  the  price\r\n\r\nmechanism help?  If you impose a surcharge, let  us  say,\r\n\r\nfor  the  CBD or any particular area, would it  not  just\r\n\r\nshift  supply  from one area and transfer it  to  another\r\n\r\narea?   Could it be that demand actually outstrips supply\r\n\r\nonly  during  peak  hours, and that during  other  hours,\r\n\r\nthere  is  actually  an oversupply,  and  increasing  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of taxis would only lead to an adverse impact  on\r\n\r\nthe income of all taxi drivers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I think Mr Ong answered the\r\n\r\nquestion himself.  During peak hours, the supply  is  not\r\n\r\nadequate.   But  if the taxi companies  expand  the  taxi\r\n\r\nfleet  significantly to meet this supply, they are  going\r\n\r\nto  be  in  deeper  problems during the off-peak  period.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a case for differential charging  during\r\n\r\npeak  and  off-peak periods.  That is already being  done\r\n\r\nfor  the  midnight surcharge.  Perhaps there could  be  a\r\n\r\ncase for differential charging.  In any case, if the taxi\r\n\r\nfares  remain low, so that three passengers will find  it\r\n\r\nmore  attractive to ride a taxi than to take a bus, there\r\n\r\nwill  never be enough taxis during peak periods.  So  the\r\n\r\nprice mechanism must come in sooner or later to establish\r\n\r\na  better balance.  But where that balance is, we have to\r\n\r\nleave it to the taxi companies to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The deletion of \"No. 2\" and the\r\n\r\nchange  of  the citation year from \"2002\" to  \"2003\",  as\r\n\r\nindicated in the Order Paper Supplement, will be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 14 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time\r\n\r\nand passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed. \" - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Ten minutes to Five o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER'S REMARKS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Zainudin Nordin</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs what is his Ministry's response  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Foreign  Minister's remarks  that  during  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis when Malaysia was looking for a loan from\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  latter  had agreed  but  made  it  'very\r\n\r\nonerous'.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of the Asian financial crisis in early\r\n\r\n1998,  the  ringgit  was  under speculative  attack,  and\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Malaysian stock market had fallen.   At\r\n\r\nthat   time,   the  Singapore  Government   was   holding\r\n\r\nsubstantial funds in ringgit as part of our reserves.  We\r\n\r\nalso   had   investments  in  Malaysian  stocks.    Other\r\n\r\ninvestors   were  selling  their  ringgit  and  Malaysian\r\n\r\nstocks,  but  we  held  on to ours despite  the  risk  of\r\n\r\ncurrency and capital losses.  We did not want the ringgit\r\n\r\nand Malaysian stock market to further weaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Malaysian banking system was\r\n\r\nexperiencing  a  credit  crunch.   Deposits  were   being\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  from Malaysian banks, to be placed instead  in\r\n\r\nforeign banks.  We did the opposite to help Malaysia.  At\r\n\r\nthe  request of Malaysia, we transferred RM2  billion  of\r\n\r\nour  deposits from banks in Singapore to Malaysian  banks\r\n\r\nin Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia also requested a package of financial\r\n\r\nassistance from Singapore amounting to RM15 billion (US$4\r\n\r\nbillion).   This  was  to consist of  additional  ringgit\r\n\r\ndeposits  with Malaysian banks in Kuala Lumpur,  purchase\r\n\r\nof  the  ringgit,  and purchase of Malaysian  stocks.  As\r\n\r\nthese  actions involved considerable financial risks  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,   we   proposed  to  provide   the   financial\r\n\r\nassistance  within  a  framework  of  wider  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween the two countries, which would include the supply\r\n\r\nof  water to Singapore after the expiry of the 1962 Water\r\n\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Malaysia requested the RM15 billion package\r\n\r\nto  be  converted into a US dollar loan.   We  offered  a\r\n\r\nmedium-term US$4 billion loan at an interest  rate  which\r\n\r\nwas significantly lower (about 4 percentage points lower)\r\n\r\nthan what Malaysia would have had to pay in the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, however, we did not proceed with this\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance package.  At a bilateral meeting  in\r\n\r\nHanoi  during  the ASEAN Summit in December  1998,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Mahathir  informed  Prime  Minister  Goh   that\r\n\r\nMalaysia no longer needed it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, Singapore had tried to be helpful to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  during the financial crisis. The terms  of  our\r\n\r\nproposed  assistance  were far from  \"very  onerous\",  as\r\n\r\nalleged by Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">ANNEX</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Pedra Branca (Question asked by Mr R Ravindran)</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedra Branca is not a new issue in Singapore-Malaysia relations.

Prior  to  that,  Singapore  had  occupied  and\r\n\r\nexercised full sovereignty for more than 150 years  since\r\n\r\nthe   1840s  without  protest  from  Malaysia.

After the 17th December 2002\r\n\r\njudgement  of  the ICJ on the Sipadan and  Ligitan  case,\r\n\r\nthere  was  an outburst of wild allegations,  made  on  a\r\n\r\ndaily  basis.   These  came hot on  the  heels  of  their\r\n\r\nMingguan  Malaysia  story  on 22nd  December  2002  which\r\n\r\nclaimed   that   we  were  engaged  in  many   kinds   of\r\n\r\nconstruction activities on PB.  They were wrong  both  in\r\n\r\nlaw  and  facts  and  we have rebutted these  allegations\r\n\r\nfully in the MFA statement on 26th December 2002.  Let me\r\n\r\nrecap the main points.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that we were dragging our feet on the signing\r\n\r\nof the Special Agreement.  What are the facts?  Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  always  been ready to sign the Special Agreement  at\r\n\r\nany  time  and at any place.  It was Singapore which  had\r\n\r\nfirst  proposed to resolve Malaysia's claim  through  the\r\n\r\nICJ process, as early as 1989.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had suggested that the Special Agreement could be\r\n\r\nsigned  at  the  sidelines  of the  ASEAN-EU  Ministerial\r\n\r\nMeeting  in  Brussels,  on 27-28th January  2003  because\r\n\r\nMalaysia  wanted  to sign the Agreement quickly  and  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  in Brussels was the earliest and most convenient\r\n\r\ntime   for  Minister  Syed  Hamid  and  myself  to  meet.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Malaysians  later  counter-proposed  other\r\n\r\ndates in January and February so that the signing can  be\r\n\r\ndone  either  in Malaysia or Singapore.  As I  have  said\r\n\r\npublicly,  it is absurd to quibble over the  location  of\r\n\r\nthe signing ceremony as it will not affect the outcome of\r\n\r\nthe case at the ICJ in any way.  As Members know, we have\r\n\r\nnow agreed to sign the Special Agreement in Putrajaya  on\r\n\r\n6th February 2003.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Singapore's so called construction and other\r\n\r\nalleged  \"illegal\" activities on Pedra Branca.  The  fact\r\n\r\nis  that  there has been no recent construction  work  on\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca.  The last structures were built  in  1991,\r\n\r\nwell over 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there is no cause to make an issue of\r\n\r\nthis,   as   it   is  a  well-established  principle   in\r\n\r\ninternational law that acts done by disputing parties  to\r\n\r\nadvance  their  own  case after the dispute  has  already\r\n\r\narisen will not be given credence.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen their allegations, Malaysia claimed\r\n\r\nthat  they  had never done similar \"unfriendly\"  or  \"un-neighbourly\"  acts  to Indonesia in  their  dispute  over\r\n\r\nSipadan  and Ligitan.  What are the facts?  According  to\r\n\r\ndocuments filed by Indonesia at the ICJ, Jakarta  had  in\r\n\r\nfact  protested  at  least  five  times  about  continued\r\n\r\nMalaysian  activities on Sipadan.  Malaysia had  rejected\r\n\r\nthese  complaints, saying that the activities were simply\r\n\r\nthe  continuation  of actions they had undertaken  before\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  arose.   Well, in this  light,  Singapore's\r\n\r\nactions  on  Pedra Branca are no different  in  law  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia's own actions on Sipadan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Singapore's position on Pedra Branca\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  be clear and consistent.  Our  sovereignty\r\n\r\nand ownership of Pedra Branca is based on facts and sound\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  law.  Nevertheless, we are  prepared  and\r\n\r\nready to work with Malaysia to move forward with the  ICJ\r\n\r\nprocess.   We  have  always dealt with  Malaysia's  claim\r\n\r\namicably and in the spirit of goodwill, and will continue\r\n\r\nto  do so.  Our media has never attacked Malaysia in  the\r\n\r\nway their media has attacked Singapore.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>KD Malaya (Question asked by Ms Irene Ng)</i></b>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was never an issue. The Malaysian Navy\r\n\r\ndeparted  from  the  Woodlands Naval Base  on  their  own\r\n\r\naccord  in December 1997.  In fact, then Defence Minister\r\n\r\nSyed  Hamid  gave a warm final address at the passing-out\r\n\r\nceremony  in August 1997, where he thanked the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  for its \"help and cooperation  in  making  it\r\n\r\npossible to have a recruit centre here for so long\".   He\r\n\r\nsaid that as Malaysia was an independent country, it  was\r\n\r\ntimely that its navy had its own training centre.  He had\r\n\r\nalso described Singapore-Malaysia relations as \"good with\r\n\r\nno problems or complaints\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that in 1997 there were \"no problems\r\n\r\nor  complaints\",  but  five  years  later  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nleaders  have  turned  their  voluntary  departure   from\r\n\r\nSingapore   into   an  issue  and  an  example   of   how\r\n\r\nunneighbourly we have been.  PM Mahathir said that  \"they\r\n\r\n(Singapore) deliberately increased the rate for the lease\r\n\r\nfor  the  naval base in Woodlands that we were forced  to\r\n\r\nvacate  and  we vacated without being paid  even  a  sen\"\r\n\r\n(Bernama, 30th December 2002).\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They allege that we 'forced' the Malaysian Navy to\r\n\r\nleave the Woodlands naval base by increasing the rent.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the facts? Yes, there was a rent revision\r\n\r\nin  1991.   But  the  truth is that Singapore  Government\r\n\r\ntried  to find ways to help the Malaysians maintain their\r\n\r\nbase  and  stay in Woodlands when the rent  revision  was\r\n\r\ncarried out in 1991.  When we increased the rental it was\r\n\r\npart  of  a government revision of property rates applied\r\n\r\nto  all, not targeted at KD Malaya, but in line with  our\r\n\r\nmarket-based rental policy to maximise the use of land in\r\n\r\nland  scarce  Singapore.  This  policy  applied  to  all,\r\n\r\nincluding  voluntary and charitable  organisations.   The\r\n\r\nincrease of rental from $1.936 million to $6.152  million\r\n\r\nreflected  the  difference  between  the  rent  that  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Navy was paying, and the market rental rate  of\r\n\r\nthe  day.   We  understood that such a sudden  and  sharp\r\n\r\nincrease  in rental might cause the Malaysian  government\r\n\r\nbudgetary difficulties and we went out of our way  to  be\r\n\r\nas  helpful  as possible.  So, in the spirit of  goodwill\r\n\r\nand  on  our own volition, we offered them a 20% discount\r\n\r\nof  the  proposed  rate of $6.152 million,  reducing  the\r\n\r\nrental  to $4.8 million, with a phase-in period  of  five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also offered a second option, whereby Singapore\r\n\r\nwould build a camp on an alternative piece of land nearby\r\n\r\nin place of the facilities at the Woodlands base, for the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Navy  to  occupy at a  nominal  fee  of  about\r\n\r\nS$500,000  for as long as it needed.  The new camp  would\r\n\r\nhave cost MINDEF about S$50 million to build.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nDuring  all  stages of the discussions  on  this  matter,\r\n\r\nSingapore repeatedly emphasised to the Malaysians that we\r\n\r\nwelcomed their Navy to stay at the Woodlands base for  as\r\n\r\nlong as it wanted to.  In 1981, then PM Lee Kuan Yew told\r\n\r\nPM  Mahathir that Singapore would not seek the return  of\r\n\r\nthe  land for as long as the Malaysian Navy needed to use\r\n\r\nit.   PM Goh also told PM Mahathir in September 1992 that\r\n\r\nhe  would like KD Malaya to stay in Singapore for as long\r\n\r\nas  Malaysia  wished.  It was our policy to continue  our\r\n\r\nclose defence links with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, after the Malaysians announced that they\r\n\r\nwould withdraw from Woodlands in 1997, we reiterated  our\r\n\r\nassurance  that they were welcome to stay  and  that  our\r\n\r\noffer  of the substitute camp remained open.  In December\r\n\r\n1992,  when  then  Malaysian Defence Minister  Najib  Tun\r\n\r\nRazak  wrote  to  us  formally  to  inform  us  of  their\r\n\r\ndecision,  then  Defence Minister Dr Yeo  Ning  Hong  had\r\n\r\nreplied  to  convey that PM Goh would like the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nNavy  to  stay in Woodlands.  It was emphasised that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  offer of SAF-built facilities to be placed  at\r\n\r\nthe  disposal of the Malaysian Navy remained open, if  it\r\n\r\nwished to take it up later.  But Malaysia never did.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Singapore's best efforts to offer\r\n\r\nalternative  options  to enable  the  Malaysian  Navy  to\r\n\r\nremain in Singapore, then Defence Minister Najib had made\r\n\r\na  public  announcement on 25th November  1992  that  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Navy would relocate the base from Woodlands  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia after 1997.  Until then, the Malaysian Navy will\r\n\r\nstay  at  Woodlands \"at the rate rental  which  has  been\r\n\r\ndetermined by the Singapore Government\".  Najib explained\r\n\r\nthat  Malaysia's decision to leave was \"based on economic\r\n\r\nfactors\".   He  also said that \"the Malaysian  government\r\n\r\nunderstands  the decision of the Singapore Government  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  rate  of rental on  the  basis  of  market\r\n\r\nprinciples\", and this \"will not adversely affect the good\r\n\r\nrelations  in  the  realm  of  defence  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries\".   It was clear that citing economic  reasons,\r\n\r\nthe Malaysians had left Woodlands on their own accord.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was five years ago. Now, in 2002, we are\r\n\r\naccused  of not having displayed neighbourliness  in  our\r\n\r\ndealings  with  them.   But the KD  Malaya  case  clearly\r\n\r\nshowed that we had put in tremendous effort to help  them\r\n\r\nout.   We  did  offer alternatives at  our  expense.   We\r\n\r\noffered  to  fork out S$50 million to build another  camp\r\n\r\nnear the Woodlands site for the Malaysian Navy to use  at\r\n\r\na  nominal fee.  This proposal, which entailed additional\r\n\r\ncapital outlay on the part of Singapore, was made in  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  goodwill and to show the Malaysians  that  we\r\n\r\nwere sincere in keeping our word to them about staying on\r\n\r\nin Woodlands.  It was Malaysia which chose not to take up\r\n\r\nthis offer.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>ASEAN+3  Secretariat and Malaysia's proposal on the  East\r\n\r\nAsia Economic Caucus (Question asked by Mr Sin Boon Ann)</i></b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the other absurd\r\n\r\nallegations.   Mr  Sin Boon Ann asked about  their  claim\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  was the country which  had  opposed  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of an ASEAN+3 Secretariat in  KL;  that  (a)\r\n\r\nSingapore always opposes any initiative from Malaysia and\r\n\r\n(b) Singapore was the only country to do so.  Related  to\r\n\r\nthis  was  the other complaint that we had opposed  their\r\n\r\nEAEC proposal.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on Singapore's reaction to Malaysia's\r\n\r\nASEAN+3  Secretariat  proposal,  PM  Mahathir  had  said,\r\n\r\n\"Singapore  rejects everything that comes from  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWe have problem with the EAEC (East Asia Economic Caucus)\r\n\r\nbefore  because  Singapore rejected  (it),\"  adding  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had  tried to be as friendly as  possible  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  that this was impossible  (Bernama,  11th\r\n\r\nOctober 2002).\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nIn  more  recent  remarks,  FM  Syed  Hamid  had  accused\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  influencing the other ASEAN  countries  to\r\n\r\noppose  the  proposal. He said \"sometimes  we  find  that\r\n\r\nquietly,  they (Singapore) also have given very  negative\r\n\r\nsignals  to  other countries, like in  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nASEAN+3   Secretariat.   Singapore  has   objected   very\r\n\r\nstrongly  and  yet they host the APEC Secretariat  there,\r\n\r\nand   they   go  very  strongly  in  trying  to  belittle\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  efforts  and yet they talk  about  East  Asia\r\n\r\ncommunity\" (Star, 2nd January 2003).  In a Berita  Minggu\r\n\r\ninterview  (5th  January 2003), Syed Hamid  alleged  that\r\n\r\n\"when  Malaysia proposed the establishment of the ASEAN+3\r\n\r\nSecretariat,  Singapore was the  only  ASEAN  country  to\r\n\r\noppose it.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were we the 'only' country to oppose it?

While\r\n\r\nSingapore recognises the value of the ASEAN+3 process, we\r\n\r\nhold  the  view  that  it should  be  allowed  to  evolve\r\n\r\ngradually.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true only Singapore had this view? Other\r\n\r\ncountries   such   as   Indonesia   were   also   clearly\r\n\r\nuncomfortable  with  the proposal.  In  a  Kompas  report\r\n\r\n(14th  August  2002), Indonesian FM Hassan  Wirajuda  was\r\n\r\nquoted as saying that \"there is no consensus - if we want\r\n\r\nto speak honestly - ... because most of the ASEAN members\r\n\r\ndo  not  see  the  need  for  the  formation  of  ASEAN+3\r\n\r\n(secretariat) yet\".  More recently, former Trade Minister\r\n\r\nof  Indonesia Arifin Siregar said that Indonesia  is  not\r\n\r\nkeen on another secretariat for the ASEAN+3 grouping  and\r\n\r\nhe  said  that  the Indonesian view is that  the  ASEAN+3\r\n\r\nsecretariat  could  be a unit within the  existing  ASEAN\r\n\r\nsecretariat in Jakarta (Straits Times, 8th January 2003).\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the EAEC, Singapore was one of the first\r\n\r\ncountries  to support, and I stress support, not  oppose,\r\n\r\nMalaysia's proposal to establish the EAEC.
