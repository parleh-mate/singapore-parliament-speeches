Experience in implementing the Act  during\r\n\r\nthis period has shown that it is inadequate in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of respects in dealing with new  problems\r\n\r\nthat  have  arisen and requires  to  be  amended.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this Bill is before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill extends the jurisdiction of courts-martial to SAF personnel who have committed the\r\n\r\noffences   of   murder,  culpable  homicide   not\r\n\r\namounting  to  murder,  waging  war  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  offences against the  President.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to ensure that if there is a repetition\r\n\r\nof  last year's incident in which a soldier  shot\r\n\r\nand  killed  an  officer, such offences  will  be\r\n\r\ntried  swiftly  and  punished swiftly.  A  court-martial  will, however, try a case of  murder  or\r\n\r\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder only if\r\n\r\nall  parties, victim and accused are SAF members.\r\n\r\nThese are grave offences. In view of this, it has\r\n\r\nbeen provided in the Bill that the President of a\r\n\r\ncourt-martial  trying  these  offences  will   be\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the Chief Justice and  will  be  a\r\n\r\nJudge   of   the  Supreme  Court.  An  additional\r\n\r\nsafeguard is that in such cases an appeal will be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  a specially constituted  Military\r\n\r\nCourt  of Appeal composed of three Judges of  the\r\n\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts-martial inflict sentences of between two\r\n\r\nmonths   and  24  months  detention  for  absence\r\n\r\nwithout  leave (AWOL) depending on the length  of\r\n\r\nAWOL.      Detention     for     insubordination,\r\n\r\ndisobedience, and so on is also for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar  lengths.  It  is doubtful  whether  long\r\n\r\ndetention  sentences  are appropriate  for  these\r\n\r\noffences, taking into account the nature  of  the\r\n\r\noffender,  usually  a  poorly  educated   teenage\r\n\r\nnational  serviceman. Keeping  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nsoldiers under detention is also costly in  terms\r\n\r\nof food they consume and the administrative staff\r\n\r\nneeded to house and look after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these facts the Bill provides that\r\n\r\nsuch  offenders  will be sent to  a  disciplinary\r\n\r\nbarrack  for a short stint, where offenders  will\r\n\r\nbe  subject  to  a harsh regimen. Such  detention\r\n\r\nwould  serve  as a more effective deterrent  than\r\n\r\npresent  detention under conditions  of  well-fed\r\n\r\nidleness.  Detention in the disciplinary  barrack\r\n\r\ncan only be awarded by courts-martial and will be\r\n\r\nfor a short period not exceeding three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A harsh regimen in the disciplinary barrack is\r\n\r\nbound  to encounter resistance and, unless  these\r\n\r\ninstances  are  handled firmly, the  system  will\r\n\r\nbreak  down.  In view of this, the Bill  empowers\r\n\r\nthe officer-in-charge of the disciplinary barrack\r\n\r\nto  inflict corporal punishment for offences such\r\n\r\nas mutiny, escape or attempted escape, assaulting\r\n\r\na  disciplinary barrack officer,  and  such  like\r\n\r\noffences. This power is similar to that given  to\r\n\r\nthe Superintendent of Prisons under section 54 of\r\n\r\nthe  Prisons  Act  (Cap. 79). Certain  additional\r\n\r\nsafeguards, which I shall enumerate below,  have,\r\n\r\nhowever,  been provided when corporal  punishment\r\n\r\nis to be inflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service intakes cover all strata of\r\n\r\nsociety,  including those of  low  education  and\r\n\r\nintelligence.   Past   experience   shows    that\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant offenders belong to this  group  and\r\n\r\nexisting  forms  of  punishment  have  not   been\r\n\r\nadequate  as a deterrent. In view of this,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  detention in the disciplinary barrack,  the\r\n\r\nBill   provides   for  corporal   punishment   of\r\n\r\nincorrigible offenders committing the offences of\r\n\r\nprolonged absence without leave, desertion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nescape from custody, disobedience of order,\r\n\r\ndisobedience     of     general     orders     and\r\n\r\ninsubordination. Care has, however, been taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  punishment administered under  these\r\n\r\nregulations  will not be of the kind  administered\r\n\r\nto  hardened  criminals. Firstly, such  punishment\r\n\r\nwill  not cause bleeding or leave permanent scars.\r\n\r\nSecondly,   the  Bill  provides  that   all   such\r\n\r\npunishment  must be approved by the  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nCouncil before it is carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present limit for dealing summarily with\r\n\r\noffences  is  six  months from  the  date  of  the\r\n\r\ncommission  of the offence. This limit has  caused\r\n\r\nproblems in dealing with those reservists who fail\r\n\r\nto report for routine or occasional reporting, in-camp  training, etc, and who cannot be traced till\r\n\r\nafter  six  months.  There are also  instances  of\r\n\r\nnegligence  in  stores  administration  and  other\r\n\r\nsimilar  work being detected by MINDEF's  Internal\r\n\r\nAudit  or by Boards of Inquiry. However,  in  some\r\n\r\ncases,  by  the time the offence is  detected  six\r\n\r\nmonths  have  passed  and the  offender  has  been\r\n\r\nreleased from full-time national service into  the\r\n\r\nreserve. Often these offences do not merit a court-martial  but because of the six months limit  they\r\n\r\ncannot  be  tried  in any other  way  such  as  by\r\n\r\nsummary  proceedings. The Bill  therefore  extends\r\n\r\nthe  period of summary dealing to three years  for\r\n\r\noffences   committed  by  reservists   and   those\r\n\r\ncommitted within six months prior to the date that\r\n\r\na serviceman is released from the SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other amendments deserve attention. One of\r\n\r\nthese  empowers the Armed Forces Council to review\r\n\r\na  case  on  its  own initiative  even  though  no\r\n\r\npetition  for  a  review has been submitted  by  a\r\n\r\nserviceman.  The other provides that a  serviceman\r\n\r\nunder open arrest will not lose his pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ENLISTMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal amendment to section 29 of the\r\n\r\nEnlistment  Act  is to rectify  an  omission.

The purpose of\r\n\r\nthe   Bill   is  to  facilitate  the  control   of\r\n\r\nmoneylending  in the Republic and to increase  the\r\n\r\npenalties   for  offences  committed   under   the\r\n\r\nMoneylenders  Act  (Chapter  220  of  the  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present 453 licensed moneylenders in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic, whose main clients are  the  poorer\r\n\r\nmembers   of  our  community.  It  is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessary  to safeguard the interest of  the  poor\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure that the law protects them against\r\n\r\nexploitation   by   unscrupulous   persons.    The\r\n\r\nMoneylenders  Act is not wholly satisfactory,  and\r\n\r\nthe  proposed amendments are essential to plug the\r\n\r\nloopholes  in the Act and to curb malpractices  in\r\n\r\nmoneylending activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for illegal moneylending will be\r\n\r\nheavier  under the proposed amendments. Section  8\r\n\r\nof the Act will be amended to increase the maximum\r\n\r\nfine  for  such offences from $1,000 to $5,000.  A\r\n\r\nsecond   or  subsequent  offender  is  liable   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment not exceeding 12 months or a  maximum\r\n\r\nfine  of  $1,000  or both imprisonment  and  fine.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  proposed amendment, the  maximum  fine\r\n\r\nwill  be  raised  to $5,000.  In  the  case  of  a\r\n\r\ncompany,  the  penalty for a second or  subsequent\r\n\r\noffence   will  be  increased  from  a  fine   not\r\n\r\nexceeding $5,000 to a fine not exceeding  $10,000.\r\n\r\nMy Ministry takes a serious view of illegal money-lending  and will not hesitate to act against  any\r\n\r\nperson who is guilty of this offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 9 of the Act\r\n\r\nto  empower  the Registrar to refuse  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nlicence  if the applicant or any partner, director\r\n\r\nof  other person responsible for the management of\r\n\r\na  moneylending firm is below the age of 21  years.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, section 10 will be repealed  and  re-enacted  to give the Registrar powers to revoke  a\r\n\r\nlicence.  However,  the person whose  licence  has\r\n\r\nbeen  revoked  will be allowed to  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister whose decision will be final. Some  forms\r\n\r\nof  malpractice in the moneylending  business  are\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  prove, and this new provision  will\r\n\r\nenable the Registrar to cancel the licence of  any\r\n\r\nmoneylender if there is adequate information  from\r\n\r\nvarious sources to indicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the moneylender is not fit to hold a licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 16 of the Act will be amended to make it\r\n\r\nmandatory for moneylenders to give out every  loan\r\n\r\nin  the form of a crossed account payee cheque. If\r\n\r\nthey fail to do so, they will be liable to pay the\r\n\r\npenalty   of  a  fine  not  exceeding  $2,000   or\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding  six  months\r\n\r\nor  both fine and imprisonment. The safeguard that\r\n\r\nthis   requirement  provides  for   the   borrower\r\n\r\noutweighs  the inconvenience to the  borrower  who\r\n\r\nhas  no  bank  account. In addition,  moneylenders\r\n\r\nwill  be required to obtain from the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nMoneylenders forms to be used as promissory notes.\r\n\r\nSuch   forms   will  be  serially   numbered   and\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the Registrar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 19 of the\r\n\r\nAct. Moneylenders will be required to account  for\r\n\r\nor  explain  any item or detail appearing  in  the\r\n\r\nquarterly  statements  of  their  cash  and   loan\r\n\r\nposition which they submit to the Registrar  under\r\n\r\nthis  section. The penalty for failure  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the  requirements  of  section  19  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased from a fine not exceeding $50 to a  fine\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding $1,000. In the case of a continuing\r\n\r\noffence, the penalty will be increased from a fine\r\n\r\nnot exceeding $10 to a fine not exceeding $100 for\r\n\r\neach  day  during which the offence  is  continued\r\n\r\nafter  conviction. The present penalty  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  deterrent and many  moneylenders  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  contravened this section of  the  Act.\r\n\r\nSince  1970,  the  Registry  of  Moneylenders  has\r\n\r\nrecorded 94 convictions under this section. It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  desirable to increase the  penalty  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the requirements of the Registry  are\r\n\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, section 20 of the Act requires a\r\n\r\nmoneylender to issue a receipt for every repayment\r\n\r\nhe  receives,  only if the payer demands  it  This\r\n\r\nsection will be amended to make a moneylender give\r\n\r\nsuch receipts for every repayment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregardless of whether the payer demands  one.  The\r\n\r\npenalty  for  an  offence  committed  under   this\r\n\r\nsection  will be increased ten-fold to a fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 23 of the\r\n\r\nAct  to  make  usury an offence, and a moneylender\r\n\r\nconvicted under this section will be liable  to  a\r\n\r\nfine  not  exceeding  $2,000.  For  a  second   or\r\n\r\nsubsequent offence, he will be liable  to  a  fine\r\n\r\nnot exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  one  year  or  to  both  fine  and\r\n\r\nimprisonment.  If it is a company that  lends  the\r\n\r\nmoney,  the  penalty  for a second  or  subsequent\r\n\r\noffence  will be a fine not exceeding $10,000.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  interest rates above 18% per  annum  for\r\n\r\nunsecured  loans  and 12% per  annum  for  secured\r\n\r\nloans  are considered excessive, but there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision  to prohibit moneylenders from  charging\r\n\r\ninterest above these rates or to penalise them  if\r\n\r\nthey  do  so. The Bill seeks to make it an offence\r\n\r\nfor  a  moneylender to charge  a  higher  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest  for  a  loan than is prescribed  in  the\r\n\r\nRules made under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 25 of the Act will be amended to require\r\n\r\na moneylender to accept any repayment above $10 in\r\n\r\nthe form of a cheque, money order or postal order.\r\n\r\nMoneylenders who contravene this requirement  will\r\n\r\nbe  liable  to  a  fine not exceeding  $500.  This\r\n\r\nprovision is desirable to protect the borrower and\r\n\r\nalso to facilitate Police investigations. Many low\r\n\r\nwage  earners and poor traders settle their  loans\r\n\r\nby instalments of $10 to $50, and the amendment is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure that such borrowers  are  not\r\n\r\ncheated  at  the  time when repayments  are  made.\r\n\r\nAlthough a moneylender will be required to issue a\r\n\r\nreceipt  for  any payment received  by  him,  this\r\n\r\nalone  is  not adequate because, in any particular\r\n\r\ncase,  it  would  be difficult  to  prove  that  a\r\n\r\nreceipt  was  not issued when a repayment  was  in\r\n\r\nfact  given.  The  extra costs  involved  for  the\r\n\r\npayment of bank commission or fee for the purchase\r\n\r\nof postal order or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  order  are  negligible,  and  it  is  worth\r\n\r\nincurring such expenditure to further protect  the\r\n\r\nborrower. Cheques, money orders and postal  orders\r\n\r\ncan  be  easily obtained, and I am confident  that\r\n\r\nthis  requirement  will soon  become  an  accepted\r\n\r\npractice  although  it  may initially  cause  some\r\n\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 31 of the\r\n\r\nAct   to   increase  the  penalty  for  making   a\r\n\r\npromissory note in which the principal or the rate\r\n\r\nof  interest is not truly stated or is left blank.\r\n\r\nThe  maximum  fine  for such an  offence  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased  four times to $2,000. For a  second  or\r\n\r\nsubsequent offence, the present penalty is a  fine\r\n\r\nnot exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding\r\n\r\nsix  months,  or  both fine and imprisonment.  The\r\n\r\nmaximum fine will now be increased to $5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, section 33 of the Act will be amended\r\n\r\nto increase the penalty for harassment of a debtor\r\n\r\nor  any  member  of his family.  At  present,  the\r\n\r\npenalty   is   a  fine  not  exceeding   $250   or\r\n\r\nimprisonment not exceeding three months,  or  both\r\n\r\nsuch fine and imprisonment. The proposed amendment\r\n\r\nwill  raise  the  maximum fine to $2,000.  If  the\r\n\r\noffender  is  a company, the fine will  be  $5,000\r\n\r\ninstead of the present $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to introduce a new\r\n\r\nsection 34A to the Moneylenders Act. The Registrar\r\n\r\nor   a  Police  Officer  not  below  the  rank  of\r\n\r\nAssistant Superintendent of Police may authorise a\r\n\r\nPolice  Officer of the rank of Sergeant and  above\r\n\r\nto  enter  the  premises  of  any  person  who  is\r\n\r\nsuspected of having contravened the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  and  to  inspect or seize  any  book  or\r\n\r\ndocument  relating  to moneylending  transactions,\r\n\r\nwithout  warrant from a magistrate. This provision\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate  Police  investigations.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  legal  action could not be  taken  in  many\r\n\r\ncases   of   alleged   illegal   moneylending   or\r\n\r\nmalpractices   by  moneylenders   simply   because\r\n\r\nevidence was lacking. For instance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince  1970, the Registry of  Moneylenders\r\n\r\nhas   received   80  complaints  against   illegal\r\n\r\nmoneylenders,  and yet only five  of  these  cases\r\n\r\nresulted in the conviction of the culprits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, it has been difficult to convict\r\n\r\nmoneylenders  for other offences  committed  under\r\n\r\nthe  Act,  partly because the borrowers themselves\r\n\r\nare  reluctant to cooperate with the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nMoneylenders    and   the    Police    in    their\r\n\r\ninvestigations.  It  is, therefore,  desirable  to\r\n\r\nwiden the powers of the Registrar and to introduce\r\n\r\namendments  to the Act which will help curb  these\r\n\r\nmalpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister for Social Affairs on clause 5, amendment\r\n\r\nto  section  16  of  the  Act,  which  requires  a\r\n\r\nmoneylender to make a loan to the borrower in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  an  account payee crossed cheque.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  this  may  create  difficulties  for   the\r\n\r\nborrower because, in encashing the cheque that  is\r\n\r\nso  endorsed,  the borrower must  have  a  banking\r\n\r\naccount  unless  he banks it in  the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings  Bank. Moreover, if the borrower wants  to\r\n\r\nopen  a  bank account, he must have a  minimum  of\r\n\r\n$500.  In  other  words,  we  are  encouraging   a\r\n\r\nborrower    to    borrow    more    than     $500.\r\n\r\nAdministratively this requirement will create some\r\n\r\ndifficulty for the borrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I seek clarification whether any other form\r\n\r\nof payment can be allowed, such as the moneylender\r\n\r\npurchasing a money order or a postal order in  the\r\n\r\nname of the borrower?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, as I have said just now, in the initial\r\n\r\nstage,  there  will be inconveniences.

But in the case of an\r\n\r\naccount payee cheque, if he has no bank account  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  could sign it and pass  it  on  to  his\r\n\r\nfriend who will put it in his own bank account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> No. He cannot do that unless it is a simple\r\n\r\ncrossed cheque.

So\r\n\r\nunless  the person has a bank account he will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to encash the cheque.

The   Bill  is  needed   because   an\r\n\r\nintegrated   and  comprehensive  Water   Pollution\r\n\r\nControl and Drainage legislation is very necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the  Republic.  Since the  enactment  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance on which  the  present  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Integration Act is based, circumstances\r\n\r\nand   environmental  problems  have  changed.  The\r\n\r\npopulation  has grown and there  has  been  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic and industrial development over the  past\r\n\r\n10  years.  New towns and large numbers of  public\r\n\r\nhousing units have been built. There has also been\r\n\r\na  corresponding increase in the demand for  water\r\n\r\nand,  with  rising  affluence,  a  demand  for   a\r\n\r\nhealthier and cleaner environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has developed new water catch ment\r\n\r\nareas  and constructed new reservoirs to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  collection and storage capacity of  water  in\r\n\r\nthe Republic. It is important that these catchment\r\n\r\nareas  are  protected from pollution  from  farms,\r\n\r\nhouseholds,   industries  and  other   activities,\r\n\r\notherwise the run-off water would not be  suitable\r\n\r\nfor  drinking purposes. While the Government  will\r\n\r\nmake  every effort to ensure that adequate  supply\r\n\r\nof  water  is available, the provision of sewerage\r\n\r\nand  the  control of water pollution must also  be\r\n\r\ngiven  equal  priority  as sewerage  is  the  most\r\n\r\neffective  method  of  water  pollution   control.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  cooperation of the public  is  also\r\n\r\nrequired  to ensure that these sewerage facilities\r\n\r\nare  fully  utilised. Until recently,  only  waste\r\n\r\nwater  from  the water closets and some industries\r\n\r\nwere  discharged  into the  sewers.  We  have  now\r\n\r\nrequired  all waste water from premises, including\r\n\r\ntrade  effluent, to be discharged into the sewers.\r\n\r\nThis  will  reduce and minimise the  pollution  of\r\n\r\nwater  in  our streams and canals, some  of  which\r\n\r\ndrain into our reservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small urbanised and industrialised country\r\n\r\nlike  ours,  frequent and heavy  rainfall  demands\r\n\r\nthat there must be good drainage. Land development\r\n\r\nalters the natural topography and affects the run-off  characteristics of surface water. More  often\r\n\r\nthan  not,  it  will  affect  drainage  and  cause\r\n\r\nflooding. It is therefore essential that there  is\r\n\r\nan effective drainage system to ensure a free flow\r\n\r\nof  water in our drains and canals. The Government\r\n\r\nis giving priority to drainage projects, and funds\r\n\r\nwill be provided for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present laws governing water pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol  have  been  found to  be  inadequate  and\r\n\r\nsomewhat  obsolete. By updating and extending  the\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions as well as  by  incorporating\r\n\r\nnew  provisions,  this  Bill  will  enable  better\r\n\r\nenforcement of the various sewerage, drainage  and\r\n\r\nwater  pollution requirements. More  broadly,  the\r\n\r\nBill is designed not only to create and promote  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  and  aesthetic environment  but  also  to\r\n\r\nconserve our water resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill incorporates many of the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Government Integration Act (Cap.  210)\r\n\r\nand the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap. 155)\r\n\r\nwhich  deal with matters of sewerage and drainage.\r\n\r\nThe sections of the Acts dealing with sewerage and\r\n\r\ndrainage  will be repealed and replaced with  more\r\n\r\ndetailed  provisions  in  the  Bill.  As  I   have\r\n\r\nindicated,  Sir,  the  existing  Local  Government\r\n\r\nIntegration   Act   does  not   contain   adequate\r\n\r\nprovisions  on the control of pollution  of  water\r\n\r\ncourses   and   drainage   and   the   departments\r\n\r\nresponsible have been relying on powers vested  in\r\n\r\nother  authorities.  The  Bill  will  remedy  this\r\n\r\ninadequacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority for sewerage, drainage and water\r\n\r\npollution  control will be vested in the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Water Pollution Control and Drainage who  will\r\n\r\nalso  have  the  powers  to control  the  quality,\r\n\r\nextraction, storage and use of water in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions on drainage empower the authority\r\n\r\nto  construct  and  maintain any drainage  system.\r\n\r\nThere  are new provisions which can require owners\r\n\r\nto execute any drainage work to provide for better\r\n\r\ndrainage.  New  provisions for  the  control  over\r\n\r\nearthworks or construction sites which pollute and\r\n\r\naffect  the  drains  and  canals  have  also  been\r\n\r\nincorporated in the Bill. The authority will  have\r\n\r\nthe  powers  to  vest private drains  or  drainage\r\n\r\nreserves in the Government which it does not  have\r\n\r\nunder   the  Local  Government  Integration   Act.\r\n\r\nAnother  new  provision  is  the  control  on  the\r\n\r\nerection  of  structures over  drains  and  canals\r\n\r\nwhich may obstruct the flow of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals specifically with Water\r\n\r\nPollution  Control. A new provision prohibits  any\r\n\r\nperson  from  extracting  water  from  any   place\r\n\r\nwithout permission. The Public Utilities Board  is\r\n\r\nexempted, of course, from this prohibition on  its\r\n\r\nown  property. Another new provision empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make  regulations  to  control   the\r\n\r\nquality,  storage and use of water  in  any  water\r\n\r\ncourse,  river,  lake or pond  and  prohibits  the\r\n\r\ndischarge of any pollutant in any such places.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  any person who discharges any pollutant\r\n\r\ninto  any  water  course whether  wilfully  or  by\r\n\r\naccident must report to the authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with sewerage. There are\r\n\r\ngeneral provisions for the authority to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe construction, operation and maintenance of the\r\n\r\nsewerage   system.  It  covers   the   collection,\r\n\r\ntreatment   and  disposal  of  sewage  and   trade\r\n\r\neffluent  and  the approval and  control  of  such\r\n\r\nfacilities. Under the new provision an owner of  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  may  be  required to construct  adequate\r\n\r\nsewerage   system  and  to  provide  and  maintain\r\n\r\nsanitary  facilities  in his  premises.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nextends control of water pollution into farm areas\r\n\r\nto  protect our water catchments. The Bill further\r\n\r\nempowers the authority to prohibit the unauthoris-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ned discharge of trade effluents into the sewer and\r\n\r\nto   prescribe  the  charges  for  the  discharge,\r\n\r\ncollection, maintenance and disposal of any waste.\r\n\r\nPowers  are also given to vest any sewerage system\r\n\r\nand  land set aside for a sewerage system  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The construction or erection  of  any\r\n\r\nstructure  across  or over a sewer  is  prohibited\r\n\r\nunder a new provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill deals with miscellaneous\r\n\r\nmatters  such  as  the issue of mandatory  orders,\r\n\r\nappeals  to  court, procedures for enforcement  of\r\n\r\nthe   Bill,   compensation,  recovery  of   costs,\r\n\r\npenalties  for the contravention of the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill, exemptions, appeals to the Minister\r\n\r\nand the making of regulations under the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support this Bill. This Bill is designed to\r\n\r\ncontrol the pollution of water and to maintain the\r\n\r\ncleanliness of the drainage and sewerage  systems.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  has  much to do with  my  constituency\r\n\r\nbecause Sembawang is bounded by the sea. Hence the\r\n\r\nBill   will  preserve  the  cleanliness   of   the\r\n\r\nwatercourses  in my constituency so that  we  will\r\n\r\nhave a cleaner and healthier living environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Government is allocating\r\n\r\nmillions   of   dollars   every   year   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  drainage and  sewerage  systems.\r\n\r\nHence  many  roads have been dug for the  purpose,\r\n\r\nthus  causing obstruction to traffic. But for  the\r\n\r\nlong-term   interest   of   the   country,    such\r\n\r\ninconveniences should be put up with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along the Government has been paying great\r\n\r\nattention to public health. In the past few  years\r\n\r\nthere  have been several nation-wide campaigns  to\r\n\r\npromote  public  cleanliness  and  public  health.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently there was an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nepidemic of conjunctivitis. We have also heard  of\r\n\r\noutbreaks of typhoid and other diseases. All these\r\n\r\ndiseases  were  brought  about  because   of   the\r\n\r\nunhealthy environment and the spreading of  germs.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Public Health Division  should  be\r\n\r\nmore  concerned with the maintenance of a hygienic\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  an  increase  in  the  number  of  cases  of\r\n\r\nmosquito breeding, particularly on vacant plots of\r\n\r\nland.  This brings about all kinds of diseases  to\r\n\r\nthe  people. So Health Inspectors should  be  more\r\n\r\neffective  in  their work. We  used  to  see  them\r\n\r\nspraying  insecticides on certain places. However,\r\n\r\nthis practice seems to have stopped and this could\r\n\r\nbe  the  reason  for  the  increased  breeding  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have complained that the Inspectors\r\n\r\nfrom  the Public Health Division are very arrogant\r\n\r\nand  fault-finding. Let me quote an example. In  a\r\n\r\ncertain  worksite, certain parts of the land  have\r\n\r\nsubsided  because  of  the  piling  work,  causing\r\n\r\npotholes  here and there. One day a Public  Health\r\n\r\nInspector  visited this worksite to carry  out  an\r\n\r\ninspection.  He saw these potholes  and  told  the\r\n\r\nforeman whether or not he was aware that it was an\r\n\r\noffence  to  leave such potholes in the  worksite.\r\n\r\nThe foreman was surprised and asked the Inspector,\r\n\r\n\"What  law have I broken?\" The Inspector  replied,\r\n\r\n\"You  have  allowed mosquitoes to  breed  in  such\r\n\r\npotholes.\" The foreman was even more surprised and\r\n\r\nasked  him,  \"There  are no  mosquitoes  in  these\r\n\r\npotholes.   There  is  no  water  in  them.\"   The\r\n\r\nInspector  said,  \"Stupid.  These  potholes   will\r\n\r\ncollect   water  when  it  rains,  and   therefore\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  , will  breed in  them.  Do  you  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  this? Therefore, you  must  fill  them\r\n\r\nup.\"  The foreman replied that whenever there  was\r\n\r\npiling  work  there would inevitably be  potholes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Inspector told him to fill up the\r\n\r\npotholes, otherwise he would issue a summons.  The\r\n\r\nforeman was helpless. The Inspectors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Public Health Division should not be\r\n\r\narrogant.  They  should  be  impartial  in   their\r\n\r\nattitude  so  as  to gain the cooperation  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   in   helping   to  maintain   a   healthy\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up another matter to the\r\n\r\nMinister. In my constituency there is a big swampy\r\n\r\nland along 14 m.s. This swampy land has all along\r\n\r\nbeen  used  as  a rubbish dump by  people  in  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  areas. Because of the  narrowness  of\r\n\r\nthe  watercourse, dirty water cannot flow out into\r\n\r\nthe big river, thus causing the water to stagnate.\r\n\r\nResidents   there  often  complain   of   mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding  in  that place. Now that  we  have  this\r\n\r\nBill, the authorities will be in a better position\r\n\r\nto  cope with public health and the environment of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  I hope the Minister will  look  into\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, I must say that public interest and anxiety\r\n\r\nin relation to water conservation, water pollution\r\n\r\nand  drainage are arranged with some coherence  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. Having studied this Bill,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nseek some clarification and to invite the Minister\r\n\r\nto respond with some answers on the matters that I\r\n\r\nintend to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 of the Bill, there is provision for\r\n\r\nthe  Director to declare the adoption  of  private\r\n\r\ndrains. There is also provision for appeal by  the\r\n\r\nperson  or owner affected. If the grievance  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility  of loss of land, as would  appear  to\r\n\r\narise under subclause (4) of clause 5 of the Bill,\r\n\r\nthen  provision  in regard to compensation  should\r\n\r\nhave been made here. But there is no reference  to\r\n\r\ncompensation in the clause. The question therefore\r\n\r\narises  as  to whether or not the aggrieved  owner\r\n\r\ncan  make a claim for compensation because  clause\r\n\r\n39, the section that refers to compensation, makes\r\n\r\nreference  to compensation only when it arises  in\r\n\r\nthat particular provision in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with reference to clause 11 of the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  refers to drainage works that the  Director\r\n\r\ncan   undertake,  will  notice  arise  under  this\r\n\r\nprovision  as  much  as notice  will  arise  under\r\n\r\nclause S of the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with reference to clause 40 of the Bill,\r\n\r\nthere is provision to allow the occupier or tenant\r\n\r\nof  the  premises to undertake drainage  works  as\r\n\r\napproved  by the Director and to make a  claim  on\r\n\r\nthe owner for the cost of such work. Provision  is\r\n\r\nalso  made  here  for the occupier  or  tenant  to\r\n\r\noffset against the rental due to the owner of  the\r\n\r\npremises.  But  such offsetting could  be  written\r\n\r\ninto  an  agreement  between the  tenant  and  the\r\n\r\nowner,  in  which  event this  would  deprive  the\r\n\r\ntenant of the facility to offset under this clause\r\n\r\nagainst  the  rental  due  to  the  owner.  Is  it\r\n\r\ncontemplated  in the provision that  the  Director\r\n\r\nwill  claim from the owner the cost of  the  works\r\n\r\nundertaken by the tenant? I will appreciate it  if\r\n\r\nthe  answers to my queries will be accorded by the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I may first deal with the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang.  Earlier in his speech he talked  about\r\n\r\nmosquitoes and then he went on to criticise Health\r\n\r\nInspectors  for requiring building contractors  to\r\n\r\nfill up potholes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many building sites in Singapore have been found\r\n\r\nto  be  breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Whenever\r\n\r\nthere  are complaints, the Inspectors go  down  to\r\n\r\nlook  for the breeding places and either eradicate\r\n\r\nthem or, if that is not possible, oil the water in\r\n\r\nwhich the mosquitoes are breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the swamps, this Bill has been drafted to\r\n\r\ndeal with swamps just like those in Sembawang. Let\r\n\r\nme  assure  the  Member that if  he  can  tell  me\r\n\r\nexactly where the swamp is we will do our best  to\r\n\r\neradicate mosquitoes breeding thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens sought\r\n\r\nclarification on certain clauses. If I  may  start\r\n\r\nwith  clause 40. Surely the answer he seeks  would\r\n\r\ndepend on the agreement between the owner and  the\r\n\r\noccupier.  As for clause 5(4), it ideas  with  the\r\n\r\nprovision  where the Director may cause drains  to\r\n\r\nbe  constructed after reasonable notice in writing\r\n\r\nhas been given. Clause 5 gives the Director powers\r\n\r\nto  declare  under  subclause  (I)  notice  of   a\r\n\r\nproposal  to the owner or owners of the  drain  in\r\n\r\nquestion  for  the adoption of the private  drain.\r\n\r\nSubclause  (2) gives the owner, aggrieved  by  the\r\n\r\nproposal  of the Director, a chance to  appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. One deals with the drain, the other\r\n\r\ndeals  with the grievance. Surely a grievance  can\r\n\r\narise  not  only because the Government is  taking\r\n\r\nover  the private drain but also because the owner\r\n\r\nmay   have   other   reasons  for   objecting   to\r\n\r\nGovernment's proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not exactly follow the Member's speech on\r\n\r\nclause  II.  If  he wants an answer,  probably  he\r\n\r\ncould stand up and repeal what he has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, if I may first clarify. With regard to\r\n\r\nclause  5  (4), I was making reference to  line  3\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  a possibility of  enlarging  the\r\n\r\nprivate  drain. If it is adopted by the  Director,\r\n\r\nsuch  enlargement, I think, would necessarily mean\r\n\r\na  loss  of land. And if there is loss of land  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  case,  will  there be  any  compensation?\r\n\r\nMatters of compensation as provided for in  clause\r\n\r\n39  can  arise only if they specifically refer  to\r\n\r\ncompensation  arising from that particular  clause\r\n\r\n39.  But  in  clause  5 there  is  no  mention  of\r\n\r\ncompensation. Therefore, if there is loss of  land\r\n\r\non  the part of the owner due to an enlargement of\r\n\r\nthe  drain which has been adopted by the Director,\r\n\r\nwill  the owner be entitled to compensation?  That\r\n\r\nis  the  point  that  I intended  to  make  in  my\r\n\r\nreference to clause 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 11, the only point that I\r\n\r\nintend to make thereto is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.   If  any  action  under  clause  11(1)   is\r\n\r\ncontemplated by the Director, will any  notice  be\r\n\r\nissued  to the owner? I ask this question  because\r\n\r\nno mention of notice has been made in this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As for the first question, Sir, it appears from\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance that the answer is no. As for clause\r\n\r\n11,  although notice is not specifically  provided\r\n\r\nfor  or  required to be given under clause  11,  I\r\n\r\nassure the Member that such a notice will be given\r\n\r\nin the ordinary course of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr E.

The\r\n\r\nsuccess  we  have achieved has been due  in  large\r\n\r\nmeasure to our policy of welcoming the free inflow\r\n\r\nof all capital, whether regional or international,\r\n\r\nand whether for use directly in trade, industry or\r\n\r\nconstruction  or merely for portfolio investments.\r\n\r\nFew  if  any  restrictions  are  imposed  on  such\r\n\r\ninvestments  which, when so desired,  may  be  and\r\n\r\noften  are  in  wholly-owned locally  incorporated\r\n\r\ncompanies  as  well as in branches of  foreign  or\r\n\r\nmulti-national companies. The presence of many old\r\n\r\nand  new trading houses, manufacturing industries,\r\n\r\nbanks,   insurance  companies,   merchant   banks,\r\n\r\ndiscount  houses as well as holding companies  and\r\n\r\nconglomerates  is  sufficient  evidence   of   the\r\n\r\neffective  operation  of our policy.  However,  to\r\n\r\nensure  orderly  conditions  and  fair  terms   of\r\n\r\ncompetition   -  and  where  many  investors   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, fair treatment of minority interests  - it  has  been  necessary, here  as  elsewhere,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  by  law  for  the regulation  of  company\r\n\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years I have paid special\r\n\r\nattention to the question of im-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproving the system of regulation of the securities\r\n\r\nindustry  and  of  enforcing  high  standards   of\r\n\r\nconduct  on  the  part of companies  operating  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Honourable Members will be aware of the\r\n\r\nmany  legislative measures introduced during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  in the form of amendments to the Companies\r\n\r\nAct  and  the Securities Industry Act. A  Code  on\r\n\r\nTakeovers   and  Mergers  was  enacted   and   the\r\n\r\nSecurities Industry Council was entrusted with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for administering it. The rules and\r\n\r\nbye-laws  of the Stock Exchange of Singapore  were\r\n\r\nmade  subject  to  my approval.  These  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures which I have taken are by now well  known\r\n\r\nto  companies whose shares are listed on the Stock\r\n\r\nExchange of Singapore. Companies have also  become\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with  the  new  procedural  requirements\r\n\r\nimposed by the Code and the rules of the Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Council, in which members\r\n\r\nfrom  the private sector outnumber those from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,    has   so   far    discharged    its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities in a conscientious and  efficient\r\n\r\nmanner.  Together with the Committee of the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange,   the   Council  has   exercised   close\r\n\r\nsupervision of the securities industry and ensured\r\n\r\nmaximum protection for the small shareholder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few weeks the Securities Industry\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the Committee of the Stock  Exchange\r\n\r\nhave  had  to  deal with an important  transaction\r\n\r\ninvolving  a  leading  quoted Singapore-registered\r\n\r\ncompany,  namely,  Haw Par Brothers  International\r\n\r\nLtd.  In  view of the large number of shareholders\r\n\r\ninvolved and the very considerable publicity which\r\n\r\nhas been given to the transaction in Singapore and\r\n\r\nabroad, I deem it my duty to make a full report to\r\n\r\nthis  House  on  the Council's  decision  on  this\r\n\r\ntransaction and also on my decision to appoint two\r\n\r\nInspectors  to  investigate  the  affairs  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th May this year, the then Managing Director\r\n\r\nof Haw Par, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOgilvy Watson, asked my secretary for what he said\r\n\r\nwould  be a brief ten-minute appointment with  me.\r\n\r\nHe would be leaving for Kuala Lumpur the next day,\r\n\r\nhe  said,  and he would like to see  me  about  an\r\n\r\nimportant and rather urgent matter before he left.\r\n\r\nAt the interview he handed me an advance copy of a\r\n\r\nPress statement which he said his company would be\r\n\r\nissuing  the next day. The statement was  about  a\r\n\r\nproposed  exchange of shares between Haw  Par  and\r\n\r\nPERNAS  Securities Sdn Bhd of Malaysia. It  was  a\r\n\r\nbrief  interview and I did not have time to elicit\r\n\r\nany  details regarding the transaction. After  the\r\n\r\ninterview, I made enquiries in my Ministry and was\r\n\r\ntold  that  it  had no previous knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed transaction. But my Ministry was aware of\r\n\r\na local newspaper report which appeared on 3rd May\r\n\r\nover  three  weeks  earlier  to  the  effect  that\r\n\r\nturnover  in  the shares of Haw Par on  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange was exceptionally high and that there was\r\n\r\nspeculation  as  to whether any major  development\r\n\r\naffecting the company was afoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Press statement announced that agreement had\r\n\r\nbeen reached between Haw Par and PERNAS Securities\r\n\r\nSdn Bhd whereby Haw Par would issue 70,413 million\r\n\r\nshares to PERNAS in exchange for the entire issued\r\n\r\nshare capital of Tradewinds (M) Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PERNAS. The principal  assets of Tradewinds were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% of the issued capital of London Tin Corp Ltd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19% of the issued capital of Island & Peninsular Development Bhd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10% of the issued capital of Sime Darby Holdings Ltd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   other  quoted  securities  valued  at   M$l2\r\n\r\nmillion.  PERNAS would thus acquire a 40% interest\r\n\r\nin  the  enlarged Haw Par, while  London  Tin  and\r\n\r\nIsland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n& Peninsular would become subsidiaries of Haw Par.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Council was informed of\r\n\r\nthis  transaction by Haw Par on 28th May, the  day\r\n\r\non which the company's Press statement was issued.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no prior consultation whatsoever.  The\r\n\r\nthen Managing Director, Mr Ogilvy Watson, appeared\r\n\r\nbefore  the Council on 30th May, at the invitation\r\n\r\nof the Council, and argued that the Singapore Code\r\n\r\non  Takeovers  and Mergers did not  apply  to  the\r\n\r\ntransaction. This was an argument Mr Watson was to\r\n\r\nabandon on the 4th of June. Nevertheless,  it  was\r\n\r\nnot  until the 11th of June that the Council  even\r\n\r\nreceived a copy of the Agreement executed  by  Haw\r\n\r\nPar and PERNAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th May the Stock Exchange suspended the\r\n\r\nquotation of the shares of Haw Par and invited the\r\n\r\ncompany to justify the proposed issue to PERNAS of\r\n\r\n70.413 million shares with a market value of  $169\r\n\r\nmillion  in  exchange for Tradewinds whose  assets\r\n\r\nhad  a  market value of only $114.4 million.  This\r\n\r\nwas  the first of a series of queries by the Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.  The directors of the company  were  not\r\n\r\nable  to give satisfactory answers to any of these\r\n\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tabling as an Annex (See cols. 1161-3) to this Statement a\r\n\r\nsummary of these queries and the answers received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd June I saw the Chairman of PERNAS\r\n\r\nSecurities  Sdn Bhd, Tengku Razaleigh  Hamzah,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at his request. I assured him  at  this\r\n\r\nmeeting  that  the  Singapore  Government  had  no\r\n\r\nobjection  in principle to PERNAS or  any  foreign\r\n\r\ncompany  acquiring  an  interest  in  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompany.  I also told him of my concern  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  deal  with PERNAS would  result  in  the\r\n\r\nsmall  shareholders' interest  in  Haw  Par  being\r\n\r\ndiluted   from  74%  to  44%.  It  was   important\r\n\r\ntherefore  that  the Securities Industry  Council,\r\n\r\nwhich was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  safeguarding  the  interests  of\r\n\r\nsmall shareholders, should have the opportunity of\r\n\r\nexamining  the proposed deal in the light  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Takeover Code. Tengku  Razaleigh\r\n\r\nfor  his part acknowledged that the proposed  deal\r\n\r\nwas  subject  to  the approval of  the  Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Council and indeed of  the  London  City\r\n\r\nPanel,   in  addition  to  the  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nregulatory  authorities  of  Malaysia.  After  our\r\n\r\ninterview,  my Ministry issued a Press  statement,\r\n\r\nthe   text  of  which  was  agreed  to  by  Tengku\r\n\r\nRazaleigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Council ruled on 3rd June\r\n\r\nthat  the  Takeover Code applied to  the  proposed\r\n\r\ntransaction.  On  4th June, the  Council  informed\r\n\r\nPERNAS  of its ruling and enquired of PERNAS  what\r\n\r\nsteps  it  proposed  to take to  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Code, in particular  Rule  27.\r\n\r\nThis  Rule  laid down that partial offers,  though\r\n\r\ngenerally undesirable, may be contemplated on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  of  special circumstances but  even  then\r\n\r\nonly  with  the prior approval of the Council.  In\r\n\r\nthe  light of Tengku Razaleigh's statement at  his\r\n\r\nmeeting with me that he realised that PERNAS would\r\n\r\nhave to have the approval of the Council before it\r\n\r\ncan  proceed  with  its deal  with  Haw  Par,  the\r\n\r\nCouncil had expected to hear representations  from\r\n\r\nPERNAS  as  to why approval should be given  under\r\n\r\nRule 27 of the Code. However, in its reply to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  dated 10th June, PERNAS argued that  none\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions  of the Code  applied  to  the\r\n\r\nproposed  transaction except the general  rule  to\r\n\r\ngive   the   fullest   possible   information   to\r\n\r\nshareholders.  PERNAS must  or  should  have  been\r\n\r\naware  that  the Companies Act provides  that  the\r\n\r\nrulings of the Council are final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter from PERNAS went on to say that PERNAS\r\n\r\nwished to see maintained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  a  lasting basis the present  liberal\r\n\r\npolicy  of  enabling investors in  our  respective\r\n\r\ncountries   to   participate   in   the   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  both countries.  The  partnership\r\n\r\nwith  Haw  Par  investors would  be  an  important\r\n\r\nmilestone  in that direction\". Four days  earlier,\r\n\r\non 6th June, the London City Panel had this to say\r\n\r\non the concept of partnership:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The concept that there should be a partnership\r\n\r\nbetween    British   industrial   and   commercial\r\n\r\ninterests and those of Malaysia is to be welcomed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Panel considers  that  for  such  a\r\n\r\npartnership to be successful, it should arise as a\r\n\r\nresult of an association entered into willingly by\r\n\r\nall   shareholders  in  accordance   with   normal\r\n\r\ncommercial practice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 19th June the Securities Industry Council\r\n\r\nruled  that  PERNAS, having failed to advance  any\r\n\r\nreasons to justify a waiver, had an obligation  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  general offer to the shareholders of  Haw\r\n\r\nPar  at  $2.42  per share, and that  the  proposed\r\n\r\nissue  of 70.413 million Haw Par shares to  PERNAS\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  at that price. The  London  City\r\n\r\nPanel  had  already ruled that Haw Par and  PERNAS\r\n\r\nhad  acted in concert in acquiring a 51%  interest\r\n\r\nin London Tin and that they should make or procure\r\n\r\na  bid  for the remaining shares of London Tin  at\r\n\r\n197  3/16  pence  per share.  There  has  been  no\r\n\r\nsignificant  development since these  two  rulings\r\n\r\nwere published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange was unable to verify the claim\r\n\r\nmade by the company that 57% of the group's assets\r\n\r\nwas situated in Malaysia. Nor could Mr Watson,  Mr\r\n\r\nTamblyn  or  Mr Gammell explain the diminution  in\r\n\r\nthe value of shareholders' assets to the extent of\r\n\r\nover  $112  million  - from $234.4  million,  as\r\n\r\nstated  in the offer document for the takeover  of\r\n\r\nMotor  &  General Underwriters Investment Holdings\r\n\r\nLtd  in January 1974, to $121.6 million, as stated\r\n\r\nin  the company's Press statement of 28th May 1975\r\n\r\n-  all  in  the  course of less  than  18  months.\r\n\r\nQueries  from the Stock Exchange produced  replies\r\n\r\nfrom the company which merely led to further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqueries.  Finally, at a meeting with the Committee\r\n\r\nof the Stock Exchange, Mr Gammell, the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe company, requested the Stock Exchange to query\r\n\r\nthe  company on a confidential basis. This request\r\n\r\nwas  unacceptable to the Stock Exchange  as  their\r\n\r\nsole  purpose in asking the questions was to  keep\r\n\r\nthe general public, including the shareholders  of\r\n\r\nthe company, fully informed. Mr Gammell also asked\r\n\r\nfor  a  waiver of the requirement imposed  by  the\r\n\r\nStock   Exchange  that  the  information   to   be\r\n\r\nfurnished  to  shareholders by Chartered  Merchant\r\n\r\nBankers  Ltd,  who  had been appointed  to  advise\r\n\r\noutside    shareholders,   should    include    an\r\n\r\nAccountant's report on the business of the company\r\n\r\nand  all  its subsidiaries. This request  too  was\r\n\r\nturned down by the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Securities Industry Council was\r\n\r\nexamining  the terms of the proposed deal  between\r\n\r\nHaw  Par  and  PERNAS and the Stock  Exchange  was\r\n\r\nscrutinising the accounts of Haw Par, my  Ministry\r\n\r\nreceived information which strongly suggested that\r\n\r\nthere  might have been misapplication  of  company\r\n\r\nfunds  in  the  past.  The information  was  about\r\n\r\ntransactions which took place well before, and did\r\n\r\nnot  appear  to  be related to, the proposed  deal\r\n\r\nbetween   the   company  and  PERNAS.  Preliminary\r\n\r\ninvestigations  tended  to confirm  the  suspicion\r\n\r\nthat there may have been serious wrongdoing on the\r\n\r\npart of some of the company's officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was evidence of the existence of a company\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Kong  known as Spydar  Securities  (Hong\r\n\r\nKong)  Ltd,  which  was formed  in  1972  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of share dealing for the personal benefit\r\n\r\nof  directors. The parent company, i.e.  Haw  Par,\r\n\r\nwould  sell  quoted securities of its subsidiaries\r\n\r\nto  this Hong Kong company at cost which was  well\r\n\r\nbelow  prevailing  market prices.  The  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\ncompany would in turn sell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese securities in the market and distribute  the\r\n\r\nprofit  to directors participating in the  scheme.\r\n\r\nThe existence of Spydar Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd\r\n\r\nwas never disclosed to the shareholders of Haw Par\r\n\r\nBrothers International.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also evidence of directors setting up\r\n\r\nUnit Trust operations to circumvent the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Companies Act. There appeared also to have\r\n\r\nbeen  other  irregularities  or  breaches  of  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act relating to share options  given  to\r\n\r\nsome  directors which have not been  disclosed  to\r\n\r\nshareholders as required by the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd July I consulted the Securities Industry\r\n\r\nCouncil, whose unanimous advice was that  Haw  Par\r\n\r\nBrothers  International  Ltd  should  be  made   a\r\n\r\nDeclared  Company under Part IX of  the  Companies\r\n\r\nAct  and that an Inspector should be appointed  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate its affairs. It was unacceptable  that\r\n\r\na  cloud  of suspicion should hang over a  leading\r\n\r\nSingapore-registered  company,  whose  shares  are\r\n\r\nquoted on the Stock Exchange of Singapore and  are\r\n\r\nheld  by  a  wide cross-section of the  public  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia. On 10th and 11th  July,  I\r\n\r\nappointed two Inspectors -- Mr G. Starforth  Hill,\r\n\r\na  senior  member of the Bar, and Mr  PG.  Grundy,\r\n\r\nsenior   partner  of  an  international  firm   of\r\n\r\nAccountants  - to investigate the affairs  of  the\r\n\r\nCompany.  A public statement issued by my Ministry\r\n\r\nmade  it clear that recent developments in respect\r\n\r\nof a proposed takeover of Haw Par by PERNAS had no\r\n\r\ndirect   bearing   on  my  decision   to   appoint\r\n\r\nInspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of the Inspectors was quickly\r\n\r\nfollowed by the resignations and the rather  hasty\r\n\r\ndepartures from Singapore of both Mr Ogilvy Watson\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Tamblyn.  It  is of course  open  to  the\r\n\r\nInspectors to invoke the powers conferred on  them\r\n\r\nunder the Companies Act to obtain the evidence  of\r\n\r\npersons  who,  in  the opinion of the  Inspectors,\r\n\r\nwould be able to assist them with the investiga-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntion.  It is to be hoped that both these gentlemen\r\n\r\nwill,  in  accordance  with  their  assurances  of\r\n\r\ncooperation and affording every assistance to  the\r\n\r\nInspectors, duly show up when requested to do  so.\r\n\r\nHowever,  up till now the Inspectors'  notices  to\r\n\r\nthese  two  gentlemen have not been answered.  The\r\n\r\nInspectors  have accordingly taken steps  provided\r\n\r\nfor  under  the  Companies  Act  to  compel  their\r\n\r\nappearance. Motion papers have been filed  in  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court this morning, and leave to serve these\r\n\r\npapers  outside this jurisdiction is being sought.\r\n\r\nOnce   this  is  obtained,  the  actual   contempt\r\n\r\nproceedings,  consequent upon a continued  failure\r\n\r\nto  appear  on behalf of a witness so required  to\r\n\r\nappear before the Inspectors, will be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of the utmost importance that\r\n\r\npending   compliance  with  the  ruling   of   the\r\n\r\nSecurities Industry Council, no major asset of the\r\n\r\nHaw  Par group of companies should be disposed of.\r\n\r\nAs  a  precaution, the present Board of  Directors\r\n\r\nhave  called  for  the immediate  resignations  of\r\n\r\nMessrs Gammell, Ogilvy Watson and Tamblyn from the\r\n\r\nBoards of all subsidiaries and associate companies\r\n\r\nof Haw Par Brothers International Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably there has been speculation in the\r\n\r\nPress  as to the repercussion of the investigation\r\n\r\non  the  proposed deal between Haw Par and PERNAS.\r\n\r\nThe  Securities  Industry Council recognises  that\r\n\r\nthere  may well be sound commercial logic  in  Haw\r\n\r\nPar  entering into an arrangement with PERNAS.  So\r\n\r\nlong as the requirements of the Companies Act  and\r\n\r\nthe  Takeover Code are complied with, there is  no\r\n\r\nreason why the two companies should not enter into\r\n\r\nany such arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Haw Par directors originally concerned with\r\n\r\ninitiating the negotiations appeared to have tried\r\n\r\nto  force  the transaction through the  Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry Council and the Stock Exchange. They  may\r\n\r\nhave believed that, because of its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconnection with PERNAS and because the transaction\r\n\r\nappears  as  the  carrying out  of  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy of controlling its own  natural\r\n\r\nresources,  the deal would not be subject  to  the\r\n\r\nscrutiny of the regulatory agencies. The directors\r\n\r\nof  Haw  Par who have resigned and left  Singapore\r\n\r\nafter  the appointment of the two Inspectors  must\r\n\r\nhave  believed  that they could  ignore  complying\r\n\r\nwith  any of the regulations of the Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nor  the Code on Takeovers and Mergers. They do not\r\n\r\nseem  keen to help ascertain and clarify the  true\r\n\r\npresent  financial position of  Haw  Par  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of shareholders and investors, in spite of\r\n\r\nthe  discrepancies  between the  Haw  Par  figures\r\n\r\ngiven  for the present transactions and  those  it\r\n\r\nhad  presented  on  other occasions,  and  in  its\r\n\r\nAnnual Reports and accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we are prepared to accept the dismantling\r\n\r\nof  our regulatory agencies, the normal procedures\r\n\r\nmust   be  observed  in  the  interests   of   the\r\n\r\nsecurities industry and the investing public.  But\r\n\r\nI  restate  my assurance to Tengku Razaleigh  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no intention to frustrate the legitimate\r\n\r\naspirations of Malaysia in the control of its  own\r\n\r\nnatural   resources.   The   procedures   of   the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry  Council  allow   for   prior\r\n\r\nconsultation and advice on any proposals which may\r\n\r\nbe  contemplated. The Securities Industry  Council\r\n\r\nhas  ruled  on  the arrangements which  have  been\r\n\r\nsubmitted. It is possible that if these  proposals\r\n\r\nare  now  formally  withdrawn,  new  and  suitable\r\n\r\nalternative   proposals  can  be   submitted   for\r\n\r\nconsultation and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation by the Inspectors, however,\r\n\r\nwill continue irrespective of the outcome of these\r\n\r\ndiscussions  or of any possible fresh negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween Haw Par and PERNAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the investigations by the two\r\n\r\nInspectors  are  to  discover,  first,  the  facts\r\n\r\nregarding Spydar Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd and  a\r\n\r\nUnit  Trust,  second, the circumstances  regarding\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffer  of  share  options  to  specific  directors\r\n\r\ncontrary to the law and third, the reasons for the\r\n\r\ndiminution   of   assets  of  Haw   Par   Brothers\r\n\r\nInternational   Ltd.  The  investigations   cannot\r\n\r\nprevent,   and  indeed  were  never  intended   to\r\n\r\nprevent,  the Malaysian Government taking  control\r\n\r\nof  any  percentage of the equity of  any  company\r\n\r\noperating  in  Malaysia, be it in  tin  mining  or\r\n\r\nrubber  and  palm  oil plantations  or  any  other\r\n\r\ncorporate  investment.  These  investigations  are\r\n\r\ndesigned   to   unravel  the  facts   related   to\r\n\r\nwrongdoing which appears to have been committed by\r\n\r\nat  least  two of the directors who have  resigned\r\n\r\nand  left  Singapore. The Government is  under  an\r\n\r\nobligation to unravel the facts and to protect the\r\n\r\nassets of innocent shareholders of Haw Par as best\r\n\r\nit can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I may be allowed to read\r\n\r\nthe  Annex  which I have tabled and  which  I  had\r\n\r\npreviously intended to circulate to Members except\r\n\r\nthat insufficient copies were available.

But  Tradewinds,\r\n\r\nwhose  assets  were  all  quoted  securities,  was\r\n\r\nvalued  at  market value.

I hope that my present Statement will\r\n\r\nclear the air that there has been no intention\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to frustrate any plan of the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment in the control of its assets and that\r\n\r\nthis would be accepted as a statement of our total\r\n\r\nattitude towards this particular transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's second question on\r\n\r\nwhether the Board of Directors as at present\r\n\r\nconstituted is able to manage its day-to-day,\r\n\r\naffairs of the company, I am not able to express\r\n\r\nany definite opinion because I have not been\r\n\r\nacquainted with the members of the Board of\r\n\r\nDirectors. But I believe that these are executive\r\n\r\ndirectors responsible for the operational\r\n\r\nmanagement of the company other than the\r\n\r\nmanagement of financial affairs or the dealings in\r\n\r\nshares or stocks. I can see no reason why they\r\n\r\nshould not be equally effective in carrying out\r\n\r\nthe day-to-day operations of the company as they\r\n\r\nhave done before. I believe the company's\r\n\r\noperating divisions are able, by and large, to\r\n\r\nmake an adequate return on the capital invested in\r\n\r\nthem.

If it were only as\r\n\r\na  matter of courtesy to establish direct contact,\r\n\r\nit  will not cost us anything and I am quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  that  will remove quite a lot of unnecessary\r\n\r\nspeculation or misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I accept the suggestion that there is a need for\r\n\r\ngreater contact with the Malaysian Government.

I realise that Tengku  Razaleigh\r\n\r\nis  an eminent personality in Malaysia but in this\r\n\r\nmatter, while he may be pursuing the wishes of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on the control of natural assets,  his\r\n\r\nstatus  is  that of Chairman of PERNAS  Securities\r\n\r\nand not as a member of the Malaysian Government.

The existing Act gives a special  status\r\n\r\nto  maintenance orders of a court in  England  and\r\n\r\nNorthern  Ireland  (excluding  Scotland)   without\r\n\r\nsubjecting    the   matter   to   any   reciprocal\r\n\r\narrangement. The legislation is typical  of  those\r\n\r\nenacted  for a British colony. Since it  has  been\r\n\r\nconsidered desirable to make certain amendments to\r\n\r\nour existing Act, it is now considered appropriate\r\n\r\nto  introduce  an  entirely new Act  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsecure   new   arrangements  for  the   reciprocal\r\n\r\nenforcement of maintenance orders. In the drafting\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill,  consideration has  been  given  to\r\n\r\nsimilar  legislation enacted in the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nin 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has dealt with the subject of reciprocal\r\n\r\nenforcement of maintenance orders in great  detail\r\n\r\nwhile,  under the existing Act, some of the matter\r\n\r\nare  dealt with by regulations made under the Act.\r\n\r\nApart from changes of a procedural nature relating\r\n\r\nto  the  powers  of  a court  to  vary  or  revoke\r\n\r\nmaintenance  orders  and provisional  orders,  the\r\n\r\nother  changes  introduced  by  the  Bill  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Bill would enable the whole of the United\r\n\r\nKingdom, including Scotland, as well as any  other\r\n\r\ncountry within or outside the Commonwealth  having\r\n\r\nsimilar  legislation,  to  be  designated   as   a\r\n\r\nreciprocating country. Once a country has been  so\r\n\r\ndesignated,  persons who are entitled to  payments\r\n\r\nunder  maintenance  orders  made  by  a  court  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be able to enforce the maintenance\r\n\r\norders  in the reciprocating country and similarly\r\n\r\npersons   who  are  entitled  to  payments   under\r\n\r\nmaintenance orders made in a reciprocating country\r\n\r\nwill be able to enforce the maintenance orders  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The definition of \"maintenance orders\"\r\n\r\nappearing in the Bill has been amended to  include\r\n\r\nmaintenance orders made in favour of ex-wives  and\r\n\r\naffiliation orders. A maintenance order is defined\r\n\r\nto be an order for the periodical payments of sums\r\n\r\nof  money  towards the maintenance of  any  person\r\n\r\nwhom   the  payer  is  liable  to  maintain,  e.g.\r\n\r\nmaintenance   of  a  child,  whether   legitimate,\r\n\r\nillegitimate or adopted, maintenance of  a  spouse\r\n\r\nand  maintenance of a former spouse after divorce.\r\n\r\nAn   affiliation  order  is  an  order  adjudging,\r\n\r\nfinding or declaring a person to be the father  of\r\n\r\na  child.  In  other  words,  the  Bill  makes  it\r\n\r\npossible for an ex-wife and an illegitimate  child\r\n\r\nto available themselves of the facilities afforded\r\n\r\nby  the  Bill  for the enforcement of  maintenance\r\n\r\norders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Bill makes provision for applying the\r\n\r\nmachinery for making provisional orders to be\r\n\r\nused in respect of affiliation orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to, move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill, - [Mr E.
