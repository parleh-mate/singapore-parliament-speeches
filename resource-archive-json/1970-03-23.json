An Unemployment Insurance Scheme in Singapore can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  supplement  other measures  to  reduce\r\n\r\nunemployment,  to  provide  more  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  to intensify  vocational\r\n\r\ntraining;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) any unemployment insurance scheme should be\r\n\r\nfinanced  by  the  contributions  both  from\r\n\r\nworkers and employers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the scheme should be designed in such a way\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be self-supporting, covering\r\n\r\nfinancial administrative expenses  from  the\r\n\r\nworkers' and employers' contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to abandon for the\r\n\r\ntime  being  the  introduction of  an  unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance    scheme   based    on    payroll    tax\r\n\r\ncontributions. There are several reasons for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as I said before, the introduction of an\r\n\r\nunemployment   insurance   scheme   would   require\r\n\r\ncontributions not only from the employer, which  he\r\n\r\nis  now doing under the payroll tax, but also  from\r\n\r\nthe   employee.   In   view   of   the   additional\r\n\r\ncontributions which both employer and employee  are\r\n\r\nmaking   in  the  enhanced  rate  to  the   Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund,  this is not the right  moment  to\r\n\r\nimpose further exactions on employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's view is that in the\r\n\r\ncircumstances facing the Republic in the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  it  would  be better to solve  problems  of\r\n\r\nunemployment and other social problems  related  to\r\n\r\nit  through  an accelerated programme  of  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  rather  than by arranging  transfers  of\r\n\r\nincomes  from those who are well off to  those  who\r\n\r\nare unfortunate to lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government to use\r\n\r\npayroll  tax  contributions  to  offset  additional\r\n\r\nliabilities which employers incur when they  employ\r\n\r\ndischarged  national servicemen who are  called  up\r\n\r\nfor  their  annual  training exercises.  This  will\r\n\r\nremove any handicaps which national servicemen  may\r\n\r\nencounter in their  efforts to find employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TEACHERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars of termination of services and resignations)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation (a) the number of teachers whose services\r\n\r\nwere   terminated  from  1969  up  to  the   latest\r\n\r\nconvenient  date,  and  on what  grounds;  (b)  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   teachers   who   left   the   service\r\n\r\nvoluntarily, and the reasons for their leaving; (c)\r\n\r\nhow  many  of  the  teachers  whose  services  were\r\n\r\nterminated  were  (i) trained, and  (ii)  untrained\r\n\r\nteachers; and (d) how many of the teachers who left\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  were (i) trained, and  (ii)  untrained\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the period 1st January,\r\n\r\n1969,  to  17th  March, 1970,  39  trained  and  46\r\n\r\nuntrained  teachers  had their services  terminated\r\n\r\nfor  unsatisfactory  work and conduct,  failure  to\r\n\r\npass probationary or professional examinations,  on\r\n\r\nvacation  of office, on medical grounds,  or  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of disciplinary action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the same period, 445 trained and 145\r\n\r\nuntrained teachers left the service voluntarily  to\r\n\r\njoin  commercial firms or statutory bodies  or  for\r\n\r\nemployment  in other institutions, such as  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, Ngee Ann College, or for the purpose  of\r\n\r\npursuing  further  studies,  or  for  personal   or\r\n\r\nundisclosed reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MARKET IN JALAN PIPIT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nand  National Development if he will ascertain from\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board what was the cost\r\n\r\nof  building the former market in Jalan Pipit,  and\r\n\r\nwhy  that market was demolished late last year; and\r\n\r\nwhat  are the reasons for rebuilding another market\r\n\r\non the same site, and how much it will cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  certain extra-curricular  activities\r\n\r\nthere is no representative from --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time is up.

Right now a new  scheme\r\n\r\nis  being devised and the Singapore Teachers' Union\r\n\r\nand  the principals are being consulted. Therefore,\r\n\r\nif the Member has any strong views on the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich extra-curricular activities should be graded,\r\n\r\nI  am sure he can put them forward through his  own\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, the Member for Delta mentioned the\r\n\r\nprovision   of  facilities  for  the  training   of\r\n\r\nkindergarten  teachers in Singapore.  Kindergartens\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  may  be  broadly  divided  into  two\r\n\r\ngroups - those   which  are  run  by   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  a  quasi-government  body,  and   the\r\n\r\nprivate  kindergartens. Teachers  in  kindergartens\r\n\r\nrun  by  the  People's Association  have  undergone\r\n\r\nintensive courses in kindergarten methods.  As  for\r\n\r\nthe private kindergartens, the position varies from\r\n\r\none  institution to another. While  the  registered\r\n\r\nprivate  kindergartens have a sprinkling of trained\r\n\r\nteachers,  the  unregistered private kindergartens,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  in the vast majority, do not  have  any\r\n\r\ntrained staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last eight years, kindergartens have\r\n\r\nmushroomed  all over Singapore. Whether  they  were\r\n\r\nmotivated  politically or for  private  gain,  they\r\n\r\nreflected a rising standard of living of the people\r\n\r\nand  an awareness of the advantages of a pre-school\r\n\r\neducation   in  our  highly  competitive   society.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, for those Asian parents who  have  not\r\n\r\nlost  their roots in their own society and culture,\r\n\r\nthere   is   a   certain   sanctity   attached   to\r\n\r\nscholarship.  Any form of learning is intrinsically\r\n\r\ngood and is rarely questioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation quickly lent itself to exploitation\r\n\r\nby  profiteers  and unscrupulous political  parties\r\n\r\nlike   the   Barisan   Sosialis.   Some   of    the\r\n\r\nkindergartens,  because  of  the  lack  of  trained\r\n\r\nstaff,  offered  children a very poor  standard  of\r\n\r\neducation  and the results were sometimes  counter-productive  in the manner described by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Delta. On\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, in the kindergartens organised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis,  the  children  were  given\r\n\r\nindoctrination  in  Communist ideology.  While  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  not  in  a  position  to   finance\r\n\r\nuniversal  free  kindergarten education,  it  could\r\n\r\nimprove   the  situation  by  organising   training\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  the  large  number  of   untrained\r\n\r\nkindergarten  teachers. And when a  large  pool  of\r\n\r\ntrained  kindergarten teachers was  available,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could introduce measures to require  all\r\n\r\nkindergartens to employ only trained teachers. With\r\n\r\nthis  in  view, in June 1966, my Ministry officials\r\n\r\nwere  instructed  to  explore  the  feasibility  of\r\n\r\nconducting  professional courses  for  kindergarten\r\n\r\nteachers.  Owing  to financial stringency  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  and  also  because of staffing problems,  the\r\n\r\nproposal  did  not get started.  In  1967,  it  was\r\n\r\ndecided  that the Ministry and the Adult  Education\r\n\r\nBoard  should jointly organise the training  course\r\n\r\nwhereby   the   Ministry  would  look   after   the\r\n\r\nprofessional aspects of the course while the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Board  would provide the  administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery  to  run  the course. However,  for  some\r\n\r\ninexplicable  reasons,  the  course  did  not   get\r\n\r\nstarted  until  May 1969 when the first  in-service\r\n\r\ncourse  in  English for 60 teachers  in  registered\r\n\r\nkindergartens was started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1969, the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  ran  379  kindergartens   for   12,000\r\n\r\nchildren.   There  were  also  registered   private\r\n\r\nkindergartens with a total of 175 classes for 5,000\r\n\r\nchildren.  The  unregistered private  kindergartens\r\n\r\nrun  by  the P.A.P., the Barisan Sosialis, churches\r\n\r\nand  other private individuals probably catered for\r\n\r\nanother 20,000 children. In relation to the need in\r\n\r\nboth the registered and unregistered kindergartens,\r\n\r\nthe  training  facilities offered  at  present  are\r\n\r\ngrossly inadequate to meet the situation. The Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Board  is aware of the situation  and  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that it has decided to introduce a basic\r\n\r\nkindergarten course in the middle of this year  for\r\n\r\nuntrained   kindergarten  teachers  who   are   not\r\n\r\nattached   to   Government,   quasi-Government   or\r\n\r\nregistered kindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of abolishing\r\n\r\npost allowances was again raised by the Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah last Friday. As I pointed out in  my\r\n\r\nreply  to  the  same question in  the  last  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate, my Ministry had made detailed proposals  to\r\n\r\nthe Harvey Salaries Commission for the abolition of\r\n\r\npost  allowances and the institution of  a  unified\r\n\r\nsalary  structure  which  would  include  promotion\r\n\r\nscales  for the entire education service.  However,\r\n\r\nin  its Report, the Salaries Commission recommended\r\n\r\nthe  continuance of the existing practice of paying\r\n\r\npost  allowances on promotion but recommended  that\r\n\r\nthe    Ministry's   proposals   warranted   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I  understand  that  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnion  has  since  written to the Finance  Ministry\r\n\r\nseeking  an interview to thrash out this and  other\r\n\r\nrelated  problems. The Finance Ministry  has  again\r\n\r\nreferred the matter to my Ministry. It is now  left\r\n\r\nwith  the  Teachers' Union to start  the  rigmarole\r\n\r\nonce  again.  My views on this question  are  quite\r\n\r\nclear. As the Member for Telok Blangah is aware, in\r\n\r\nthe  new  promotion posts created in the  Technical\r\n\r\nEducation Department, for instance, principals  and\r\n\r\nvice-principals   of  vocational   institutes   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  training centres,  there  are  no  post\r\n\r\nallowances attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the proposal to have an assistant\r\n\r\nprincipal  in  place  of  a  senior  assistant   in\r\n\r\nschools, I am afraid no progress has been made. The\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah, I am sure, is not unaware\r\n\r\nof the fact that in all salary matters and creation\r\n\r\nof new posts, more than one Ministry is involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah complained that\r\n\r\nprimary  school teachers have to attend courses  in\r\n\r\nhealth  education and that such courses  have  been\r\n\r\nconducted  by  unqualified teachers.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it has been felt for some time that the  best\r\n\r\nway  to  inculcate sound health habits is to  begin\r\n\r\nwith the young children in schools. It is with this\r\n\r\nin view that a refresher course in health education\r\n\r\nis  being organised for primary school teachers  to\r\n\r\nbring them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  to  date in respect of health matters  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  in a better position  to  stimulate\r\n\r\ngreater health consciousness among school children.\r\n\r\nThe  lectures  are delivered by teachers  who  have\r\n\r\npreviously attended an intensive course on  general\r\n\r\nand  dental health education. However, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  large  number  involved and  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ndoctors   qualified  to  teach  the  subject,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry has to make do with such teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Member for Telok Blangah and the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong touched on the duties of Inspectors  of\r\n\r\nSchools.  Briefly, it is the duty of inspectors  to\r\n\r\nimprove the quality of teaching in all our schools.\r\n\r\nTo  achieve this, they visit teachers in schools to\r\n\r\noffer  advice and assistance when necessary.  After\r\n\r\nobserving  the teachers, they generally hold  short\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with them to stimulate new  ideas  and\r\n\r\napproaches  to  effective  teaching,  the  use   of\r\n\r\nteaching  aids,  up-to-date  information  on   such\r\n\r\nmatters,  methodology and problems arising  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  work.  The inspectors are also  required  to\r\n\r\nassess  the  work of teachers who have  to  satisfy\r\n\r\ncertain service requirements from time to time; for\r\n\r\nexample,  crossing efficiency bars or  confirmation\r\n\r\nin  the  service. However, as the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah has pointed out, the Inspectorate staff has\r\n\r\nnot been increased over the years while the student\r\n\r\nenrolment  has gone up. As a result, the inspectors\r\n\r\nof   Schools   cannot  devote  as  much   time   to\r\n\r\nprofessional  and service matters as  they  should.\r\n\r\nThis  has  led to the allegation by the Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong that the inspectors were feared rather  than\r\n\r\nrespected by the teachers. I believe that with  the\r\n\r\ngeneral improvement in the quality of teaching  and\r\n\r\nas  our  inspectors gain in experience and possibly\r\n\r\nwith  some additions to the inspectorate  staff,  a\r\n\r\nbetter  relationship  between  the  inspectors  and\r\n\r\nteachers can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education on having at last  realised\r\n\r\nthe need to abolish post allowances.

I realise that\r\n\r\nthis  is not just a matter between the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and  the  Singapore Teachers'  Union.  I\r\n\r\nrealise  that  the Treasury is also involved.  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou have just heard that the Teachers' Union, after\r\n\r\nhaving had a bash at the Ministry of Education, has\r\n\r\nhad  a  bash at the Treasury. What has the Treasury\r\n\r\ndone?  It  has  referred the  matter  back  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. Sir, we cannot just kick the\r\n\r\nball  about. It is about time that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation and the Treasury decided to rectify  this\r\n\r\nanomaly which the Minister for Education knows  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  existence for the last 20 years. Now  the\r\n\r\nball  is  at the foot of the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  says that it is waiting for the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnion   to   make   representations   again.   Sir,\r\n\r\nrepresentations have been made over and over again.\r\n\r\nHow  much longer are we to wait? The same questions\r\n\r\nwere  raised  by  my  colleague,  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nPunggol,  during the debate on the 1967  Estimates.\r\n\r\nAre  we  going to wait for next year for  the  same\r\n\r\nproblem  to crop up? Sir, on the question  of  post\r\n\r\nallowances   and   also   allowances   for   senior\r\n\r\nassistants,  I  urge the Ministry of  Education  to\r\n\r\npursue actively these matters in the course of this\r\n\r\nyear. And I hope I will not have reason to speak on\r\n\r\nthis  again  when we meet next year to  debate  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N.

The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  has  said that, in view of  the  present\r\n\r\nfinancial  position, it is not possible to  conduct\r\n\r\ntraining courses for kindergarten\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers  at  present. Sir, with the  help  of  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'   Training  College  and  the   Technical\r\n\r\nEducation Department, perhaps some training courses\r\n\r\ncan  be arranged for kindergarten teachers.  As  we\r\n\r\nall  know  that children are the future pillars  of\r\n\r\nour  society,  they should be well  educated  while\r\n\r\nthey  are young. For instance, if we plant  a  tree\r\n\r\nand  we  do  not  give  it  enough  nourishment  or\r\n\r\nfertiliser, it will not live up to expectations. In\r\n\r\nthe  end,  whatever effort and energy we  spend  on\r\n\r\ncultivating it will be lost. Therefore, if we  want\r\n\r\nto have good fruits, we must have good trees. It is\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  provide  the  trees   with   enough\r\n\r\nfertiliser   during  the  early  stages.   If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment thinks that there is not enough money to\r\n\r\nconduct training courses for kindergarten teachers,\r\n\r\nthen   perhaps   it  can  take  other   alternative\r\n\r\nmeasures.  For instance, kindergarten teachers  can\r\n\r\npay for the training which is organised for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sure the Minister would love to answer Madam\r\n\r\nChan's questions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my criticism was that the\r\n\r\ncourse  for  the training of kindergarten  teachers\r\n\r\nhad  not started earlier and expanded to the  scale\r\n\r\nthat  I  would like to see it expanded.

However, the same\r\n\r\ncannot be said about educational research. There is\r\n\r\na  distinct  lack  of advance in this  field.  This\r\n\r\naspect  has  been neglected. Is it  right  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  neglect  it? I think we  should  give  more\r\n\r\nthought to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1968, there was a seminar on education\r\n\r\nwhich  was  attended by teachers from all  schools.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a  suggestion to set up an  educational\r\n\r\nresearch   centre.  This  was   accepted   at   the\r\n\r\npreliminary  meeting  of  the  seminar,   and   was\r\n\r\nsubsequently   submitted  to   the   Ministry   for\r\n\r\nconsideration. However, no one is in a position  to\r\n\r\nknow what is the outcome of this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, there was a suggestion in this\r\n\r\nHouse  in May 1968 that every encouragement  should\r\n\r\nbe  given to set up an educational research centre.\r\n\r\nThe  reason why I am touching on this point is that\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  research in education plays  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  role in the development of our  national\r\n\r\neducation.  Let  us take a look at our  educational\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We have carried out many  educational\r\n\r\nreforms. Many of them are novel in nature, but this\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that all of them are  good.  I  had\r\n\r\noccasion   to   read  an  article  on   educational\r\n\r\nresearch.  Sir,  permit me  to  quote  one  or  two\r\n\r\nsentences   from  this  particular  article.   This\r\n\r\narticle says that we have a fine set of educational\r\n\r\ntheory,  but  we  lack  systematic  and  scientific\r\n\r\nresearch  in  education. Advancement  in  education\r\n\r\nmust  be  matched  by  advancement  in  educational\r\n\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which publication are you referring to, Mr Tay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am referring to an article in a booklet published\r\n\r\nby the T.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is this booklet with you?

My  main  point   is   to\r\n\r\nemphasise that research in education should also be\r\n\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the educational reforms which have\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out.  For  example,  the  system  of\r\n\r\nintegrated  schools,  the teaching  of  Civics  and\r\n\r\nHistory  in  Chinese in English  Schools,  and  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  Mathematics and  Science in  English  in\r\n\r\nChinese    schools.   All   these   are   important\r\n\r\neducational  reforms.  They not  only  reflect  our\r\n\r\neducational policy, but they are also part  of  our\r\n\r\nnational   policy.  They  go  to  prove  that   our\r\n\r\neducational objectives are ideal, but they  do  not\r\n\r\nprove that we have rational and scientific research\r\n\r\nin education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to make certain\r\n\r\ncriticisms  of  the policy of teaching  Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science through the use of English in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools. What is the objective of this reform? When\r\n\r\ndefining  the  objective of bilingualism  some  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago, the Minister for Education stated  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  been trying to carry out the teaching  of\r\n\r\nMathematics  and Science in English in  non-English\r\n\r\nschools, and the result of this experiment has been\r\n\r\nvery  encouraging. This is but a start towards  the\r\n\r\nobjectives   that  we  have  for  our   educational\r\n\r\nreforms.  Our  belief is that, apart from  teaching\r\n\r\nthe second language as a subject, and using it as a\r\n\r\nmedium  of instruction to teach other subjects,  it\r\n\r\nwill  help  in  better progress  in  mastering  the\r\n\r\nlanguage.  No  doubt, the Research  and  Statistics\r\n\r\nUnit  in the Ministry of Education has conducted  a\r\n\r\nsurvey into the teaching of Mathematics and Science\r\n\r\nin  Government Chinese Primary schools  in  Primary\r\n\r\none  and two classes. As the Minister has said, the\r\n\r\nresult   of   this   experiment   has   been   very\r\n\r\nencouraging.  However, the report  of  this  survey\r\n\r\nhas now been shelved and kept as a highly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidential document. Ordinary people are not in a\r\n\r\nposition to know what its contents are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I may be ignorant of matters\r\n\r\npertaining to education, but why is it that such  a\r\n\r\nsurvey,   which   has  a  grave  bearing   on   our\r\n\r\neducational  reform,  should  select  only  certain\r\n\r\nGovernment schools for this experiment? I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   these  questions.  How  many  Government\r\n\r\nschools  were selected for such a survey, and  what\r\n\r\nwas  the  number  of  Primary one  and  two  pupils\r\n\r\ninvolved in it? Were the conclusions of this survey\r\n\r\napplied    to   all   Chinese   Primary    schools?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the statement is made that in addition\r\n\r\nto   teaching  the  second  language  as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  if  it  is  also used  as  a  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction to teach other subjects, it will result\r\n\r\nin  better progress in mastering the language. This\r\n\r\nmeans  that if we use the second language to  teach\r\n\r\nother  subjects, it will help our pupils to acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge of the second language in a shorter time.\r\n\r\nThis is only a hypothetical assumption. There is no\r\n\r\nevidence  to  show that this is the result  of  the\r\n\r\nexperiment.  In  my view, the printed  language  is\r\n\r\nonly a tool, and the ability to use any language is\r\n\r\nthe ability to manipulate a skill. Let us call it a\r\n\r\n\"printed  language\". On the other  hand,  from  the\r\n\r\npoint of view of teaching Mathematics, mathematical\r\n\r\nsymbols  are also a kind of tool. Let  us  call  it\r\n\r\n\"mathematical language\". The question is  this:  is\r\n\r\nit  true  that  the  teaching of Mathematics  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain language will result in a better mastery of\r\n\r\nthat  language?  I think this question  merits  our\r\n\r\ndetailed  study.  The teaching of  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience  through  the  use of  English  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools is already an accomplished fact. I have  no\r\n\r\nintention  to reopen here the debate on the  merits\r\n\r\nand  demerits of this policy, but certain questions\r\n\r\narise.   We   have  carried  out  many  educational\r\n\r\nreforms, and we must be courageous enough to  admit\r\n\r\nthat  not  all  of  them have been successful.  Our\r\n\r\nvocational  schools are examples of the failure  of\r\n\r\none  of  our reforms. We should not embark  upon  a\r\n\r\nreform in haste without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaking into consideration all the relevant factors.\r\n\r\nMore  important, it is not enough just to  have  an\r\n\r\neducational  ideology. It must be complemented  and\r\n\r\nsupported  by  scientific, rational and  systematic\r\n\r\nresearch  into education, otherwise  the  time  and\r\n\r\nmoney  spent will be wasted. It will be not a  boon\r\n\r\nbut  a  bane to our educational system.  To  embark\r\n\r\nupon reforms in education is, I feel, a question of\r\n\r\nprinciple, but how these reforms are to be  carried\r\n\r\nout  and what results they will bring is a question\r\n\r\nof  detail. I believe there are people who share my\r\n\r\nsentiments that educational reforms must be matched\r\n\r\nand supported by educational research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I be allowed to pose three questions?\r\n\r\nFirstly,  since the Government has  carried  out  a\r\n\r\nsurvey into the teaching of Mathematics and Science\r\n\r\nin  English in Government Chinese Primary  schools,\r\n\r\nare  the  conclusions of this experiment valid  for\r\n\r\nall Chinese Primary schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there a need to reassess the policy\r\n\r\nof  teaching Mathematics and Science in the English\r\n\r\nlanguage in Chinese schools? Thirdly, what are  the\r\n\r\nprospects   of  setting  up  a  National  Education\r\n\r\nResearch Centre?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, everyone knows that we\r\n\r\npractise  equality  in  all  the  four  streams  of\r\n\r\neducation.  In the last few years, we  have  placed\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  technical  education  so  that   more\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel  can be trained  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of our industrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk on vocational and\r\n\r\ntechnical  education. There are limited  places  in\r\n\r\nthe  institutes for technical education.  According\r\n\r\nto  statistics, the enrolment this  year  is  about\r\n\r\n8,000  students. However, the institutes  are  only\r\n\r\nable  to  absorb  about 1,000 students,  and  about\r\n\r\n7,000  students are unable to get places  in  these\r\n\r\ninstitutes.  Can the Minister inform  me  how  many\r\n\r\nplaces are available in the technical institutes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we require a great number of technical\r\n\r\npersonnel  at  this  time,  we  must  set  up  more\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools  so that  we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nproduce in the shortest possible time the necessary\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel that we need. I  remember  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation   saying  that  about  35,000   technical\r\n\r\npersonnel  will be trained in two or  three  years.\r\n\r\nBut  if  we can only enrol about 1,000 students  at\r\n\r\npresent, the training of 35,000 technical personnel\r\n\r\nwill  take  about  30  years.  By  that  time,  our\r\n\r\nfactories will have closed down, or we will have to\r\n\r\nrecruit more and more technicians from abroad. This\r\n\r\nis  a  matter of crucial importance, and I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  if  the  Minister has any new  plans  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining of technical personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is the special classes conducted\r\n\r\nby   the   Adult  Education  Board.  These  special\r\n\r\nclasses,  of  course, are commendable because  they\r\n\r\nare able to cater for the thousands of students who\r\n\r\nare not able to go to secondary schools. Their ages\r\n\r\nrange from 14 to 15, and the Government has set  up\r\n\r\nthese  classes so as to give them certain technical\r\n\r\ntraining  to enable them to acquire certain  skills\r\n\r\nwhich will be useful to them when they go on to the\r\n\r\nlabour market. However, what is regrettable is that\r\n\r\nthese  classes  are  mostly concentrated  in  urban\r\n\r\nschools.  In many schools in the rural  areas,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in  Sembawang and Nee Soon, such  classes\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  set  up. It  is,  therefore,  very\r\n\r\ninconvenient for those who live in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nto  attend  these  classes in  the  city,  and  the\r\n\r\nexpenses  incurred on transport will  be  an  extra\r\n\r\nburden on their parents. I would like to plead  for\r\n\r\nthose  students  who live in the rural  areas,  and\r\n\r\nurge  the Ministry of Education to consider setting\r\n\r\nup such special classes in the rural areas in order\r\n\r\nto cope with the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is about food stalls in school\r\n\r\ntuckshops.  I  have received many  complaints  from\r\n\r\nstallholders  who are licensed to  sell  food  and\r\n\r\ndrinks  to school children. One complaint  is  that\r\n\r\nthe rental is too high. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample,  a stall selling sweets at 5 cents  or  10\r\n\r\ncents  has  to pay a monthly rent of  $20  to  $30.\r\n\r\nTheir  profit  is very small, and  with  such  high\r\n\r\nrentals,  it  is  impossible for  them  to  earn  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  I  hope  the  Minister  will  consider\r\n\r\nreducing the rentals for such stalls. We know  that\r\n\r\nmost of these stallholders are former recipients of\r\n\r\npublic   assistance   from   the   Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment.  The rule is that if they are  given  a\r\n\r\nstall  licence,  they will not receive  any  public\r\n\r\nassistance. Having set up a stall in a school tuckshop,  they have to make a certain amount of profit\r\n\r\nin  order  to support their families. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Ministry will consider their hardship  and\r\n\r\nbe sympathetic to their case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint of the stallholders is about\r\n\r\nthe  change  in  regulations. For example,  take  a\r\n\r\nstall  that  sells fried mee. It happens  that  the\r\n\r\nschool  principal is changed. The  stall-holder  is\r\n\r\ntold  that he can sell only fried mee and  not  mee\r\n\r\nsoup.  I hope that such regulations are not changed\r\n\r\nevery  now  and  then so that no  inconvenience  is\r\n\r\ncaused to the stallholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nclarify  is  the question of setting up  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage study centre. I remember this question was\r\n\r\nalso  raised in the debate on the last Budget.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  then agreed, in principle, to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nChinese language study centre. Today, after a lapse\r\n\r\nof  one year, can he tell us what are the plans for\r\n\r\nsetting up this centre, and what progress has  been\r\n\r\nmade?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether  last  year  his  Ministry   has\r\n\r\nreceived  complaints from principals,  parents, or\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public about the inefficiency  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  teachers in Chinese schools. These English\r\n\r\nteachers  often  adopt  an unco-operative  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards the principal. They also physically  punish\r\n\r\nthe  students without the consent of the principal.\r\n\r\nThey also often make applications for transfer back\r\n\r\nto  English  schools. If there are, in  fact,  such\r\n\r\ncomplaints, I would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister what steps he proposes to take\r\n\r\nagainst these irresponsible English teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only one question to\r\n\r\nask of the Minister for Education. I notice that in\r\n\r\nthe  provision  for  salaries of  secondary  school\r\n\r\nprincipals, the salary scale for the principals  of\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution and Raffles Girls'  School  is\r\n\r\nhigher   than   that  for  the  other   54   school\r\n\r\nprincipals.  If these 54 principals carry  out  the\r\n\r\nsame  work  as  that of the principals  of  Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution and Raffles Girls' School,  why  is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have a difference  in  their  salary\r\n\r\nscales?  Does  the  Government propose  to  convert\r\n\r\nthese two schools into junior colleges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to one of\r\n\r\nthe  topics  which the Member for  Paya  Lebar  has\r\n\r\nbrought up in his comments on this subhead. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  that\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science should be taught in English\r\n\r\nin  non-English medium schools, and that Civics and\r\n\r\nHistory  should be taught, for example, in English-medium schools, in the second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this policy of bilingualism. For that\r\n\r\nreason,  Sir,  I would like to know  if  there  are\r\n\r\nenough   teachers   able  to  teach   Science   and\r\n\r\nMathematics   in  English  in  non-English   medium\r\n\r\nschools. Further, I hope that every effort is being\r\n\r\nmade to improve the quality of English used in non-English medium schools so that pupils may not be at\r\n\r\na  disadvantage  in their study of Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience.  In addition, I hope there will be  enough\r\n\r\nteachers trained in History and Civics who will  be\r\n\r\nable to teach these subjects in the second language\r\n\r\nin English-medium schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fear that teachers teaching the\r\n\r\nsubjects  would  be  language teachers  instead  of\r\n\r\nteachers  who  are  adequately  equipped   with   a\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  History  and Civics,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  would  be  on language teaching  although\r\n\r\nthis is a laudable aim, rather than on the teaching\r\n\r\nof Civics and History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Sir, which I would like\r\n\r\nto  raise.  I have some matters to bring  up  under\r\n\r\nsubhead  1111,  for  which I  have  an  amendment\r\n\r\nstanding  in  my name. This topic of  research  has\r\n\r\nalready  been touched upon by the Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar,  and with your permission, may I also  touch\r\n\r\non it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting will also be speaking on subhead\r\n\r\n1111.

These documents are necessary because\r\n\r\nclass   teachers  are  required  to  fill  in   the\r\n\r\nattendance  register  many details  concerning  the\r\n\r\nstudents  and their parents or guardians. There  is\r\n\r\nalso  a standing instruction that there must be  no\r\n\r\neraser  marks  in the register, and no  unnecessary\r\n\r\ncancellation of words wrongly written.  Filling  in\r\n\r\nthe  entries in the attendance register is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  factors whereby school inspectors  assess  the\r\n\r\nteachers'  efficiency. Consequently,  the  teachers\r\n\r\ncannot  help  but check all the relevant  documents\r\n\r\nmeticulously  before they enter the particulars  in\r\n\r\nthe  attendance register. Teachers, therefore,  have\r\n\r\nto  spend a lot of time and energy in order to  get\r\n\r\nthe  register accurate and up to date. However,  if\r\n\r\nit  really serves some practical purpose, there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  be  said about it. But,  as  the  name\r\n\r\nimplies, the attendance register is mainly used for\r\n\r\nrecording  the students' attendance.  The  detailed\r\n\r\nparticulars of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  students  and their parents  which  have  been\r\n\r\nentered  in  the register at so much  sacrifice  of\r\n\r\ntime  and energy are seldom, if ever, used.  Should\r\n\r\nthe  occasion arise when such information is really\r\n\r\nnecessary, it can easily be found in the  students'\r\n\r\nschool  record  cards. May I ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation whether the attendance register now being\r\n\r\nused  by all schools in Singapore can be simplified\r\n\r\nand  made more practical? If this can be done,  the\r\n\r\nparents will not have to produce the same documents\r\n\r\nfor  checking year after year. Teachers  will  also\r\n\r\nnot  have to waste too much time in filling up  the\r\n\r\nattendance register which, except for recording the\r\n\r\nstudents' attendance, is not being fully  made  use\r\n\r\nof.  I  wonder  what the Minister  thinks  of  this\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, teachers from the different\r\n\r\nlanguage  media  have  their own  unions.  However,\r\n\r\nthese  unions do not count for much in the eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe   officials  of  the  Ministry  of   Education.\r\n\r\nWhenever  there  is  any  proposed  change  in  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  or  some innovation in the  educational\r\n\r\nsystem   itself,  the  teachers'  unions  have   no\r\n\r\nopportunity to express their views. If there is any\r\n\r\nreform  in  the educational system,  they  are  not\r\n\r\nnotified.  Needless to say, whenever there  is  any\r\n\r\neducational  function organised by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation, they are not invited. It should be noted\r\n\r\nthat   teachers  have  direct  contact   with   the\r\n\r\nstudents. Their study problems and practical  needs\r\n\r\nare  better known to the teachers. If the teachers'\r\n\r\nunions are consulted whenever there is a change  in\r\n\r\nthe  educational system, I believe they can make  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  contribution. Unfortunately, it  is  only\r\n\r\nwhen  something  is  amiss  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  will consult the teachers'  unions,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  make  them share part of  the  blame.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  last  year,  the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\ndevised a teacher's record book which proved to  be\r\n\r\nimpracticable. As a result, the Ministry convened a\r\n\r\nconference of teachers' unions at the beginning of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  year to consider the matter. In the end, a new\r\n\r\nteacher's  record  book suitable  for  use  by  the\r\n\r\nteachers was devised. Sir, usually it is only  when\r\n\r\nthings are in a mess that the Ministry will consult\r\n\r\nthe teachers' unions and ask them to help clear  it\r\n\r\nup.  I  hope the staff in the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nwill  pay  more respect to the teachers' unions  of\r\n\r\nall the language media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar has\r\n\r\ntouched  on the question of bilingualism in schools\r\n\r\nand  the use of the second language as a medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction  in certain subjects. He  says  further\r\n\r\nthat  proper consideration should be given to  this\r\n\r\nmatter  before its implementation. The question  of\r\n\r\nbilingualism  has  been taxing the  minds  of  many\r\n\r\npeople for a long time. Ours is a multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual society. Everybody is  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nimportance of knowing more than one language in our\r\n\r\nsociety.  The Member for Paya Lebar probably  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  a  Chinese school and I am sure he  is  aware\r\n\r\nthat English has always been the second language in\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese schools for the last 30 or  40  years.\r\n\r\nFrom  his  personal experience, I am sure  he  will\r\n\r\nagree  with me that it has been a complete failure.\r\n\r\nMost  of  the  graduates from the Chinese  schools,\r\n\r\nprobably with a few exceptions, have not been  able\r\n\r\nto   make   use   of   English,   particularly   in\r\n\r\nconversation, although they have been  studying  it\r\n\r\nas  a  second language for more than ten  years  in\r\n\r\nschool.   Obviously   this  situation   cannot   be\r\n\r\nperpetuated and something drastic has  to  be  done\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience and also from observations made,\r\n\r\nit  has  been  found that if a second  language  is\r\n\r\nlearnt  while at an early age, it will  not  be  as\r\n\r\ndifficult to master as when one begins to study  it\r\n\r\nat, say, after the primary stage. If the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  will remember, Professor Haliday, who\r\n\r\nwas  a  linguist, came to Singapore last  year  and\r\n\r\ngave  a  few  lectures  at the  Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege.  He  made  the  point  that  to  master  a\r\n\r\nlanguage well, one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  to start at a very young age in fact, as early\r\n\r\nas possible. It was for this reason and the need to\r\n\r\nmake  some drastic changes that we have decided  to\r\n\r\nintroduce   a  second  language  as  a  medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction  in  certain subjects  in  the  Primary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingualism in schools is being implemented in\r\n\r\ngradual  stages  as  far as academic  subjects  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.   For   instance,   the   teaching    of\r\n\r\nMathematics  in  non-English  schools  through  the\r\n\r\nmedium  of  English began in 1968 for  Primary  one\r\n\r\nclasses  in  all  the  Government  Chinese  Primary\r\n\r\nschools  and  some aided schools as  well.  It  was\r\n\r\nextended to Primary II in 1969 and Primary  III  in\r\n\r\n1970. History taught through the medium of a second\r\n\r\nlanguage  was  introduced  in  the  English  medium\r\n\r\nschools early this year in Primary III and will  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  the higher classes by yearly  stages.\r\n\r\nThis  gradual  implementation of  the  scheme  will\r\n\r\nobviate  undue hardship on the part of  pupils  and\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the adequacy of teachers for\r\n\r\nimplementing   the   bilingual  education   policy,\r\n\r\nseveral  in-service courses have been organised  to\r\n\r\ntrain second-language teachers. An English language\r\n\r\ncourse   for   non-English   medium   teachers   of\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science has also been conducted. In\r\n\r\naddition,  seminars on the teaching of Civics  have\r\n\r\nbeen  held  and one on the teaching of  History  is\r\n\r\nbeing organised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary school teachers are normally non-specialists who have been trained to teach a\r\n\r\nvariety of subjects. As language teachers are  also\r\n\r\ngeneral  teachers,  they are able  to  teach  other\r\n\r\nPrimary school subjects as well as language.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  have additional training in the teaching of  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language are not necessarily  incapable  of\r\n\r\nteaching  such subjects as History or Civics  which\r\n\r\ndo  not  need specialised knowledge at the  Primary\r\n\r\nschool  level.  However,  when  it  comes  to   the\r\n\r\nSecondary  school level, History will be taught  in\r\n\r\nthe  second language by teachers with the necessary\r\n\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly there is room for improvement, and\r\n\r\nbilingualism  in  schools is no  exception.  Active\r\n\r\nmeasures have been and are being taken to meet  any\r\n\r\nanticipated  difficulty and  to  remedy  any  known\r\n\r\ndeficiency  so that bilingualism will be  achieved.\r\n\r\nThese measures include the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective evaluation of the curricula,\r\n\r\ntextbooks and methods of teaching. Several  schools\r\n\r\nhave  been chosen as experimental schools to devise\r\n\r\nimproved  methods of teaching Mathematics,  Science\r\n\r\nand English where English is the second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee has been formed to make a careful\r\n\r\nstudy of the content and vocabulary of the textbook\r\n\r\nin  History  for  Primary schools as  well  as  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties encountered by teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Director of Research was appointed early last\r\n\r\nyear,  and  one of her duties is to look  into  all\r\n\r\nthese   questions,  quite  apart  from  educational\r\n\r\nresearch. She has gathered around her half a  dozen\r\n\r\neducationists who have had training in research and\r\n\r\nmethodology.  I am sure that in the course  of  the\r\n\r\nnext few years some positive results will come  out\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has mentioned just now\r\n\r\nthat  our vocational institutions could enrol  only\r\n\r\nabout  1,000  students and that it  would  possibly\r\n\r\ntake more than 30 years before we could achieve the\r\n\r\ntarget of 35,000 technical personnel a year.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know where he got his information from.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure he has been misinformed. The Ministry proposes\r\n\r\nto   recruit  3,000  to  4,000  students  for   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  courses  this  year.  The   intake   of\r\n\r\nstudents   will  be  undertaken  in   four   phases\r\n\r\nannually. We have recruited about 1,000 students in\r\n\r\nFebruary  and have already advertised  to  take  in\r\n\r\nanother 1,000 in May 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also mentioned that\r\n\r\nthere are no special classes organised by the Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board in his constituency. Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Adult Education Board  conducts\r\n\r\nspecial classes for Primary Six leavers in the  day\r\n\r\ntime in the following centres:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Keat Vocational School Centre;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountbatten Vocational School Centre;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bukit Batok Vocational School Centre;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parry Avenue Vocational School Centre; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai Sing Dewasa Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special classes in the rural areas are now\r\n\r\nconducted  during  the day by the  Board  in  Parry\r\n\r\nAvenue  and Bukit Batok Vocational School  Centres.\r\n\r\nThe  Board's Parry Avenue Vocational School  Centre\r\n\r\ncaters  for students in the Yio Chu Kang,  Punggol,\r\n\r\nSembawang  and  Tampines  areas.  The  Bukit  Batok\r\n\r\nVocational School Centre caters for students in the\r\n\r\nJurong, Choa Chu Kang and Upper Bukit Timah  areas.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is not true to say that the Board  has  not\r\n\r\norganised  special classes for Primary Six  leavers\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas. However, the Board  will  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to conduct these special classes  in  any\r\n\r\nother rural areas provided facilities are available\r\n\r\nand  student  numbers warrant the opening  of  such\r\n\r\nclasses.  If the Member for Sembawang can gather  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  number of Primary Six  leavers  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency to one particular centre,  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthe  Adult Education Board will be only too pleased\r\n\r\nto  look  into the feasibility of starting a  class\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tuck-shops in schools, the rental includes\r\n\r\npublic  utility  charges for  water  and  lighting.\r\n\r\nThese  charges have now gone up as a result of  the\r\n\r\n10  per  cent  tax  and,  therefore,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nlikelihood of lowering the rental of school stalls.\r\n\r\nThe   conditions  of  selling  are  laid  down   in\r\n\r\nindividual tuck-shop agreements signed by the stall-holders at the beginning of the year or at the time\r\n\r\nwhen  they take up the stalls. All cases of varying\r\n\r\nof  conditions  of selling are sympathetically  and\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered and decided by  the  school's\r\n\r\ntuck-shop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommittees of the respective schools in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance.  Should  the  stall-holder  feel  unhappy\r\n\r\nabout   the   decision  of  the  school   tuck-shop\r\n\r\ncommittee, he can appeal to the Tuck-shop  Standing\r\n\r\nCommittee  of the Ministry of Education. His  whole\r\n\r\ncase  will then be carefully reviewed by the  Tuck-shop Standing Committee and I am sure in most cases\r\n\r\nthe decision will be a reasonable one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has complained that\r\n\r\ncertain second-language teachers are unco-operative\r\n\r\nand  inflict  corporal punishment on  the  students\r\n\r\nwith  a view to getting themselves transferred back\r\n\r\nto  the  English medium schools. I am  quite  aware\r\n\r\nthat  there  are second-language teachers  who  are\r\n\r\nunhappy  in Chinese medium schools. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable, because the Chinese medium  schools\r\n\r\nare a new environment and probably quite strange to\r\n\r\nthe  English language teacher. Until now, they have\r\n\r\nonly one subject to teach, and that is English.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,  their  duties  become  very  monotonous  and\r\n\r\nonerous. However, with the introduction of  English\r\n\r\nas the medium of instruction in certain subjects in\r\n\r\nnon-English  schools, I am sure the second-language\r\n\r\nteachers  will now no longer find their  duties  so\r\n\r\nmonotonous. If the Member for Thomson can bring  up\r\n\r\ninstances   of   teachers  who  have   administered\r\n\r\ncorporal  punishment  with the  motive  of  getting\r\n\r\nthemselves transferred, I am sure we will deal with\r\n\r\nthem  quite  firmly. For his information,  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment  is  prohibited.  Only  principals   are\r\n\r\nvested  with the authority to administer it.  If  a\r\n\r\nteacher is found guilty of administering it without\r\n\r\nthe permission of the principal concerned, far from\r\n\r\ngetting himself transferred to English schools,  he\r\n\r\nmay find himself out of a job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Tiong Bahru's question,\r\n\r\nthe  posts of Principal of Raffles Institution  and\r\n\r\nPrincipal    of   Raffles   Girls'   School    have\r\n\r\ntraditionally   been   superscale    posts    among\r\n\r\nGovernment English schools. The two schools,  which\r\n\r\nhave a long and outstanding record of achievements,\r\n\r\nare generally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccepted as being among the premier schools in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic. As the number of promotion posts  in  the\r\n\r\neducation service is small compared to the strength\r\n\r\nof the service, it is desirable to retain these two\r\n\r\nsuperscale  posts  as  senior promotion  posts  for\r\n\r\nmembers  of this service. There is no intention  of\r\n\r\nconverting these two schools into junior  colleges.\r\n\r\nThe current thinking is that we should build half a\r\n\r\ndozen  or  more junior colleges to absorb all  pre-university   students  now  studying   in   various\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

But can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nsafely  say  in this House that these  two  schools\r\n\r\nhave  been producing top students during  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  decades,  thereby warranting the retention  of\r\n\r\nthese two superscale posts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I can only presume that it is so.

Under  such  circumstances,  can  he\r\n\r\nreconsider  his  statement  that  since  these  two\r\n\r\nschools  are  premier schools, it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nretain the two superscale posts of Principals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they were premier schools in\r\n\r\nthe  past.

Perhaps I may not agree\r\n\r\nwith my colleague, the Member for Punggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first allow me to get one point of\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister? Does he mean  that\r\n\r\nthe Principals of these two schools are holders  of\r\n\r\nsuperscale posts because their schools produce good\r\n\r\nresults?  If so, then I think the whole  system  is\r\n\r\nwrong. Sir, are we going to classify our principals\r\n\r\naccording to the results that their schools produce\r\n\r\nor   on  the  calibre  of  the  principal  of   any\r\n\r\nparticular  school? I will agree with the  Minister\r\n\r\nif  he  says  that  we  should  continue  with  the\r\n\r\ntradition  of having superscale posts of Principals\r\n\r\nfor  our  two premier schools and not just  because\r\n\r\nthey produce good results. At the same time, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwas  quite happy when I heard the Minister say that\r\n\r\nthere   are  very  few  superscale  posts  in   the\r\n\r\neducation  service  and therefore  we  must  retain\r\n\r\nthese  two posts. If that is the case, is  there  a\r\n\r\npossibility of creating more superscale posts?  The\r\n\r\nstudent  enrolment has increased and I think  there\r\n\r\nis  a  need  for  creating more super-scale  posts,\r\n\r\nthereby enhancing the promotion prospects of  those\r\n\r\nin the education service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, as I have said just now, the current\r\n\r\nthinking is to build more junior colleges.

The  blame partly probably  lies  at  the\r\n\r\ndoorstep  of  the Teachers' Union  for  not  making\r\n\r\nthemselves more active in educational matters,  and\r\n\r\nI  think there is a singular lack of interest among\r\n\r\nthe teachers in their own union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the\r\n\r\nMinister's reply, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since its implementation\r\n\r\nof   in-service  courses,  the  Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege  has  been very energetic and  vigorous  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  them  out.  In 1969 alone,  it  conducted\r\n\r\nabout  50  courses which included arts and  crafts,\r\n\r\nAudio  and  Visual Aid education, Chinese language,\r\n\r\nEnglish   language,   Geography,   History,   Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Science and Career Guidance. The courses  are\r\n\r\nnumerous.  This  is  a  good  sign,  because  these\r\n\r\ncourses  enable qualified teachers to keep  abreast\r\n\r\nof  the  latest trend in education,  and  to  widen\r\n\r\ntheir  professional knowledge.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  may be certain people who question the  need\r\n\r\nfor  these courses. They may well say, even without\r\n\r\nattending them, it does not mean that teachers will\r\n\r\nnot  improve  their  professional  skills.  By  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  this  is  not impossible. However,  without\r\n\r\nattending such courses it is not easy to do  so.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  my duty to go into this  in  greater\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trainee teacher is directly influenced by his\r\n\r\nlecturers and the kind of textbooks which  he  uses\r\n\r\nat the Teachers' Training College. In the course of\r\n\r\nhis  training,  certain  concepts  and  values   on\r\n\r\neducation and methodology are formed. However, when\r\n\r\nhe   leaves  the  T.T.C. and  joins  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice, he may be confronted with a principal  who\r\n\r\nmay  require another teaching method. He  may  also\r\n\r\nhave to face an inspector of schools who wants  him\r\n\r\nto   teach   in   a  different  way.   Under   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is well nigh impossible  for  him\r\n\r\nto please two masters.

These\r\n\r\ncourses  must  form an important  link  in  teacher\r\n\r\neducation.  The  ideal  teacher  education  at  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training College should not be  confined\r\n\r\nonly  to trainee teachers. Those teachers who  have\r\n\r\nqualified  also need to be trained.

I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch on school inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959 when the People's Action Party, on the\r\n\r\nmandate  of the people of Singapore, took over  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of the country, thereby ending  British\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule  which lasted over a hundred  years,\r\n\r\nour  achievements  in the field of  education  have\r\n\r\nbeen  impressive and outstanding. In  the  process,\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  a large number  of  reforms  and\r\n\r\nrevisions in our educational system, but what I  do\r\n\r\nnot understand is that in the reforms over the last\r\n\r\nten  years, we have overlooked the use of the  term\r\n\r\n\"official\" which, in Chinese, relates to inspectors\r\n\r\nof  schools. The term \"official\" in Chinese  has  a\r\n\r\nvery   strong  flavour  of  feudalism  and  British\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  It  is  not  surprising   that   some\r\n\r\nprincipals are at a complete loss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  they are confronted with these Inspectors  of\r\n\r\nSchools. Similarly, it is not surprising that  many\r\n\r\nteachers  break  into a cold sweat  when  they  are\r\n\r\nconfronted by these school inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a teacher myself. I have\r\n\r\noften   heard   complaints   about   these   school\r\n\r\ninspectors from my colleagues. I want to  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  only  some  inspectors  who   are\r\n\r\nunhelpful.  These inspectors more often  scold  and\r\n\r\nreprimand the teachers than offer them guidance and\r\n\r\nassistance.  In other words, when they  come  round\r\n\r\nand  supervise the teaching of teachers, they  only\r\n\r\nreprimand  the teachers but they do not offer  them\r\n\r\nany  advice  on how to improve and get rid  of  the\r\n\r\ndefects  in  the method of teaching. If  they  only\r\n\r\nindulge  in reprimanding and scolding the  teachers\r\n\r\nand  not offering them any kind of assistance, then\r\n\r\nhow  do  we  expect them to carry out our excellent\r\n\r\neducational policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we require of our Inspectors of Schools is\r\n\r\njust  a more courteous attitude. The assistance  of\r\n\r\ninspectors  who  can offer advice and  guidance  on\r\n\r\nteaching methods will be useful to the teachers who\r\n\r\ncan  thereby improve their teaching. From this,  we\r\n\r\ncan  then raise the standard of efficiency  of  our\r\n\r\nteachers  so  that they can better  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nexcellent educational policy of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\ncomplains that we are still using the colonial term\r\n\r\n\"inspectors\",  and  that they  are  not  fulfilling\r\n\r\ntheir   role.  I  have  outlined  the   duties   of\r\n\r\ninspectors  only a few minutes ago, and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  repeat  them. There is  no  advantage  in\r\n\r\nchanging  the term \"inspector\" to some other  name,\r\n\r\nas  the  duties of the inspectors remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Education is not the only Ministry\r\n\r\nto  use this term, which has been used in the  last\r\n\r\nhalf  century. In the Police Force,  this  term  is\r\n\r\nstill being used and no one seems to complain  that\r\n\r\n\"Inspector of Police\" is a colonial term and should\r\n\r\nbe changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what is important is that the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between teacher and inspector  should\r\n\r\nbe  improved.  The  inspector should  be  respected\r\n\r\nrather than feared. With the general improvement in\r\n\r\nthe quality of teaching and, as I have said, as our\r\n\r\ninspectors  gain experience, a better  relationship\r\n\r\ncould  be  achieved. The Member for Paya  Lebar  is\r\n\r\naware  that inspectors are drawn from the rank  and\r\n\r\nfile  of the teaching service. Therefore, one would\r\n\r\nexpect   that   teachers,  on  being  promoted   to\r\n\r\ninspectors,  would  be  very sympathetic  to  their\r\n\r\nformer colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that other\r\n\r\nMinistries  also use the term \"inspector\".

If you analyse\r\n\r\nthe  word \"inspector\" in Chinese, he is a  man  who\r\n\r\nthinks that his duty is only to inspect and not  to\r\n\r\ndo  anything else. If the Minister is agreeable,  I\r\n\r\nshould  say  that  this  officer  should  not  only\r\n\r\ninspect but also guide the teachers, and so do more\r\n\r\nthan  just  inspect the schools.

I remember having spoken in this House\r\n\r\non   a   previous  occasion  on  this  subject   of\r\n\r\neducational  research. I then mentioned  that  this\r\n\r\nresearch    unit    should   be   independent    of\r\n\r\nadministrative control by civil servants who do not\r\n\r\nbelong  to  it. I would now like to ask, therefore,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the degree of independence that this  unit\r\n\r\nenjoys; to what extent can it decide on priorities;\r\n\r\nand  on what basis are its priorities decided  with\r\n\r\nregard to research? I would also like to ask,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the scope of research that has indeed been\r\n\r\ndecided upon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that adequate funds will be available for\r\n\r\nthis Research Unit for the proper implementation of\r\n\r\nits  functions,  and  that it will  enjoy  a  happy\r\n\r\nrelationship   with  other  bodies  interested   in\r\n\r\nresearch,  like the Teachers' Training College  and\r\n\r\nthe University of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one matter to which I feel\r\n\r\nthis  Research Unit should give some attention.  We\r\n\r\nin   Singapore   have  constantly  emphasised   the\r\n\r\nimportance of our human resources. In fact,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  reference has been made to the mild  derision\r\n\r\nwith  which  our intention to start  industries  in\r\n\r\nJurong  was  greeted.  But  we  have  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nestablishing  these industries at  Jurong,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave also succeeded in other enterprises because of\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of our human resources. Since  we  do\r\n\r\ngive  such emphasis to our human resources, perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  instrument could be devised by this  Research\r\n\r\nUnit, or the matter could be gone into, whereby the\r\n\r\ndetection of specially intelligent people among  us\r\n\r\nwill be made much easier. And having detected those\r\n\r\nwho  are specially intelligent, we could give  them\r\n\r\nspecial  attention in school so that their  talents\r\n\r\ncould be nurtured for the benefit of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Education has\r\n\r\nspoken  to  some extent on the setting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nResearch  and  Statistics Unit in his  Ministry.

All  I  could  get  from  him  was\r\n\r\nsomething pertaining to methodology and other forms\r\n\r\nof  research,  and  that  in  a  few  years'  time,\r\n\r\naccording to him, we might get the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the unit will play an important role\r\n\r\nin  shaping  the  type of educational  system  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  ought  to  have  in  relation   to   the\r\n\r\nconditions we are in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has been in office for the past\r\n\r\n11  years, and it has seen some changes, though not\r\n\r\nvery  drastic.  The  educational  policy  today  is\r\n\r\ndifferent from that in the colonial days.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, will this Research and Statistics Unit  do\r\n\r\nresearch into our educational system so that in the\r\n\r\nnot   too  distant  future  we  will  be  able   to\r\n\r\nstreamline and trim off all the rough edges, so  to\r\n\r\nspeak, and formulate the proper type of educational\r\n\r\nsystem that we need?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I venture to suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat   this   unit  take  into  consideration   the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  education, the  syllabuses  in  the\r\n\r\nprimary   schools,  the  academic   and   technical\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, and in the technical institutes,\r\n\r\nand also the extra-curricular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities  that students are required to  take  up\r\n\r\nduring  their  leisure hours? I think these  extra-curricular   activities  are  being   pursued   too\r\n\r\nvigorously,  so much so that the students  have  to\r\n\r\nspend more time in the field than in their studies.\r\n\r\nMy question is this: has the Minister realised that\r\n\r\nthe   heavy  emphasis  placed  on  extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities  has resulted in our having one  of  the\r\n\r\nlowest  Cambridge  School  Certificate  examination\r\n\r\nresults  for  last year?

Therefore, this Research Unit  has  an\r\n\r\nimportant part to play, and I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nenlighten  this  House on the exact  role  it  will\r\n\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> I wish to thank Members for their very kind words\r\n\r\nabout  the Research and Statistics Unit, and  their\r\n\r\nappreciation of the important role this unit has to\r\n\r\nplay in the development of our educational system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise for the fact that the work of\r\n\r\nthe  Research  Unit  has not  been  made  known  to\r\n\r\nMembers.

As  the name implies, extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities  should  be carried out  outside  normal\r\n\r\nschool  hours.

In  such cases, students will have  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  many  rehearsals. To do so outside  school\r\n\r\nhours  may  not be possible at times.

We know that traffic congestion and road\r\n\r\naccidents   are   problems  which   confront   many\r\n\r\ncountries. Since we are faced with these  problems,\r\n\r\nwe should think of some schemes to resolve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make two suggestions to relieve the\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion. First, we should do away  with\r\n\r\nparking  lots on the streets in the city  area.  If\r\n\r\nyou  widen  the streets, the traffic can flow  more\r\n\r\nfreely.  This  will reduce traffic congestion  and,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government's viewpoint, this  is  better\r\n\r\nthan  taking  20 cents per hour from motorists  for\r\n\r\nparking in the city area. The levy of this fee will\r\n\r\nnot   help  the  flow  of  traffic.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  more public highways  is  a  pressing\r\n\r\nproblem. We should undertake this task straightaway\r\n\r\nand  not  wait until several years later, otherwise\r\n\r\nit will complicate matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics on accidents, there are\r\n\r\nabout 200 deaths on the road every year. This is  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious  problem. I have two  suggestions  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the number of traffic accidents. First,  we\r\n\r\nshould promote more campaigns on road courtesy  and\r\n\r\ngive   them  wide  publicity.  For  instance,   the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary attached to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence is quite reckless in his driving. He should\r\n\r\nset  a  good example. We should ask all drivers  to\r\n\r\nabide   by   the  traffic  rules  and  drive   more\r\n\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Political Secretary, I will now\r\n\r\ntouch upon the question of old and shabby cars. The\r\n\r\nengines   of   these  cars  are   not   functioning\r\n\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Communications can take\r\n\r\nmeasures to reduce the number of such cars  because\r\n\r\nthey  emit  obnoxious  fumes  which  endanger   our\r\n\r\nhealth.  Furthermore, these cars cause many traffic\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nwill consider issuing more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxi  licences. According to statistics, there  are\r\n\r\nabout   14,000   drivers  who   have   taxi-driving\r\n\r\nlicences,  but  there are only  3,800  taxis.  From\r\n\r\nthese  figures, we can see that there is a shortage\r\n\r\nof  taxis.  Therefore,  I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nseriously consider issuing new licences for  taxis,\r\n\r\nas   this   can   help  resolve  the  question   of\r\n\r\nunemployment to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Transport Advisory Board was set up last\r\n\r\nyear.   Can   the  Minister  say   what   are   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   of   this   Board?    How    many\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been implemented, and what are\r\n\r\nthe recommendations that have not been implemented?\r\n\r\nWhat    are   the   Minister's   views   on   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to bring up the question of\r\n\r\nold  bicycles.  Sir,  we often  see  people  riding\r\n\r\nbicycles which are 20 or 30 years old. Some of them\r\n\r\nare  without  lamps, some without  brakes,and  some\r\n\r\nhave   worn-out  parts.  Accidents  have   occurred\r\n\r\nbecause  of ineffective brakes. Therefore,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will look into this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one or two years ago, buses\r\n\r\nwere  provided for workers who live in the  eastern\r\n\r\npart  of  Singapore  and who  work  in  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial  estate. Sir, this bus  service  is  not\r\n\r\navailable now. At that time, the demand for workers\r\n\r\nwas  not so great. With the rapid increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of industries in Jurong and as workers  are\r\n\r\nin   great  demand  now,  can  the  Minister   make\r\n\r\narrangements  with bus companies  in  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nstart an express bus service at centralised pick-up\r\n\r\npoints, say, from 6 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. and from 4.30\r\n\r\np.m. to  6.30 p.m. staggered every half  an  hour?\r\n\r\nThis  bus service will greatly help workers  living\r\n\r\nin the eastern part of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since I have put in an amendment* on the main Head, I would like to say something now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  The amendment reads as follows: \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Madam Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that the plans to ease traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion should be co-ordinated with the plans to\r\n\r\nredevelop our city. The Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nhas said that the traffic problem in Singapore is\r\n\r\nacute. I would like to know whether there are new\r\n\r\nproposals to resolve the traffic problem in our\r\n\r\nsmall island of 225 square miles. In this\r\n\r\nconnection, can the Minister say whether there is a\r\n\r\nplan to construct subways to solve part of our\r\n\r\ntraffic problem? Some countries have this system\r\n\r\nfor commuters to go from one place to another and\r\n\r\nthis may be a means to ease traffic congestion in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up bus stations and\r\n\r\nparking  lots. The number of vehicles is increasing\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Finance says that it is due to\r\n\r\nour  prosperity and that the living standard of our\r\n\r\npeople has gone up. More and more of our people are\r\n\r\nusing motor-cars not as a means of transport but as\r\n\r\na  means  of  showing off, thereby causing  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  on the road. I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he will consider another proposal\r\n\r\nfor  easing  traffic congestion,  and  that  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent  all  private cars from entering  the  city\r\n\r\nwithin  a  three-mile radius. Workers can get  into\r\n\r\nthe city area only by public buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, you have only one minute to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to try to reply in one minute\r\n\r\nto the comments of the three Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nI  think,  is  a  little  difficult,  but  I  shall\r\n\r\nendeavour  to do so. First of all, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang, when speaking about traffic congestion,\r\n\r\nsuggested that we should do away with car parks and\r\n\r\nbuild more public highways. These are matters which\r\n\r\ncome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin  the  purview of my colleague, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development. I shall convey to him the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang's suggestion for doing  away\r\n\r\nwith  car  parks and thereby doing  away  with  the\r\n\r\nrevenue from car parks. On the suggestion to  build\r\n\r\nmore  public highways, I think this is  already  in\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of reducing traffic accidents, we\r\n\r\nentirely  agree  with the Member's suggestion  that\r\n\r\ndrivers should show more road courtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the dangers of having many old vehicles\r\n\r\neither breaking down on the road or emitting fumes,\r\n\r\nand  also causing accidents, this problem is  being\r\n\r\nlooked  into. In fact, this is one of the  subjects\r\n\r\ntouched  upon  by the Transport Advisory  Board  in\r\n\r\ntheir  second interim report which I received early\r\n\r\nthis month and which is now under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise the question of whether or not we should\r\n\r\nissue  more  taxi licences. This is coming  up  for\r\n\r\nconsideration and I am not in a position as yet  to\r\n\r\ngive an answer to Members of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the suggestion of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  to  have  express buses  running  from\r\n\r\nvarious city centres to and from Jurong is  a  good\r\n\r\none.  This will be given serious consideration.

But there is a defect\r\n\r\nin  their construction. Under the building by-laws,\r\n\r\nI believe it is required that the toilet facilities\r\n\r\nin  a  building  should be at a specified  distance\r\n\r\naway  from  the  kitchen.  But  the  type  that  is\r\n\r\nprovided  in  these quarters is not  in  conformity\r\n\r\nwith the building by-laws. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nnot  say that this is a matter for the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, because these  quarters  are\r\n\r\nmeant  for the Marine Department. As such, if these\r\n\r\nquarters  have modern sanitation, then  it  is  all\r\n\r\nright.  Furthermore, because of the bucket  system,\r\n\r\nnobody  uses the toilet facilities. I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat   sufficient  toilet  facilities   should   be\r\n\r\nprovided  for  these quarters. I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill   take   up  this  matter  with   the   proper\r\n\r\nauthorities  so  that these quarters  are  provided\r\n\r\nwith toilet facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Telok Blangah did answer the  question\r\n\r\nfor me, that is, I will have to pass the matter  on\r\n\r\nto  some other authority.

The Immigration  and  Customs\r\n\r\nofficers  do give such an impression to  passengers\r\n\r\nusing the airport.

I  also  see  that  such\r\n\r\nallowances  are  provided for in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nInterior and Defence. When are we going to do  away\r\n\r\nwith  the  payment of allowances for good  conduct?\r\n\r\nThis  seems  ridiculous, especially  when  monetary\r\n\r\nincentives  are  offered to our  guardians  of  the\r\n\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have referred to the relevant\r\n\r\nHansard  and  there  were  statements  about   good\r\n\r\nconduct allowances, etc. At that date there were no\r\n\r\npayments,  but  I  understand  these  good  conduct\r\n\r\nallowances   are   payable  to   police   officers,\r\n\r\nincluding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetectives,  between  the  ranks  of  sergeant  and\r\n\r\nconstable.

Therefore,  so\r\n\r\nlong as they are still payable under the scheme  of\r\n\r\nservice, I am afraid we will have to meet the bill.\r\n\r\nMay I say that since I last spoke in Parliament, it\r\n\r\nhas  been  discovered that 72 of the rank and  file\r\n\r\nare, in fact, eligible for this allowance, and many\r\n\r\nof  them  are eligible for it retrospectively  from\r\n\r\n1st  July,  1966. Therefore, there is  a  huge  sum\r\n\r\npayable  by  the  end of this month,  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$9,240.

But  they  are  entitled  to   this\r\n\r\nallowance  if they are generally of good behaviour,\r\n\r\netc, for three years, and they are eligible for  a\r\n\r\nsecond allowance after another three years, and  so\r\n\r\non  and  so forth. This is part of their scheme  of\r\n\r\nservice.

I  have also noticed  that  in  other\r\n\r\ninternational airports small trolleys are  provided\r\n\r\nfor  the  passengers' use.

In  the  basement,\r\n\r\nthe  parcel room, backroom and stores are the  same\r\n\r\nrooms used since 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if the Minister would make\r\n\r\nsurprise  checks  - not to tell  the  head  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  that he was going there,  as  otherwise\r\n\r\neverything  would be made clean -- at these  places\r\n\r\nin  order  to  see for himself the  actual  working\r\n\r\nconditions of the postal staff. Does he know  about\r\n\r\nthat? Does he know how difficult it is for them  to\r\n\r\nwork there? If he wants them to work very hard,  he\r\n\r\nshould  see  that  there is proper ventilation  and\r\n\r\nadequate  space for them to sort out  the  letters,\r\n\r\nand  to put them into bags and so on. He must  give\r\n\r\nthem the space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there is a provision of $33,000 in the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates for an extension - I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  is the extension - of the General  Post\r\n\r\nOffice.  But I think the Minister should look  into\r\n\r\nthe  matter  and make improvements to  the  General\r\n\r\nPost  Office,  especially for the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last Budget sitting I did\r\n\r\nraise the question of provision of a full range  of\r\n\r\npostal  facilities for the residents in Toa  Payoh.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Communications then said that  it\r\n\r\nwas anticipated that the Postal Services Department\r\n\r\nwould  be able to provide such services during  the\r\n\r\nlatter part of 1969. The number of residents in Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  has  now  nearly  doubled,  and  many  light\r\n\r\nindustries are being set up in the estate.

What I wish to touch on is the delivery\r\n\r\nservices not only in Punggol Constituency but  also\r\n\r\nin  the  other rural constituencies.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nestablish that there is a need to provide more  and\r\n\r\nbetter  and  faster delivery services,  I  have  to\r\n\r\nexplain   my  points  by  means  of  a  couple   of\r\n\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first illustration concerns letters that are\r\n\r\nto  be  delivered from Paya Lebar  Post  Office  to\r\n\r\nareas in Upper Serangoon, Tampines, and Punggol.  I\r\n\r\nhave  received complaints that notices of  meetings\r\n\r\nsent  out  by  my Citizens' Consultative  Committee\r\n\r\nSecretary  were  not delivered  until  a  few  days\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second illustration - there was a time when\r\n\r\none  or two postmen went up to one of the community\r\n\r\ncentres  with  a  pile  of letters  and  asked  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre staff to deliver them. When I  was\r\n\r\ntold  of  it,  I  said  no.  The  function  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre and its staff is not  to  deliver\r\n\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third illustration, Sir, is in regard to a\r\n\r\ncase which I received of a national serviceman  who\r\n\r\nwas registered for national service in 1967 but was\r\n\r\nnot  called  up until last year. His complaint  was\r\n\r\nthat  he  had  not received any enlistment  notice.\r\n\r\nWhether enlistment notices were sent to him or not,\r\n\r\nI  am  not  in  a position to say. On  the  2nd  of\r\n\r\nJanuary  1970,  I  wrote to the  Postmaster-General\r\n\r\nasking  for an explanation. To my surprise,  all  I\r\n\r\ngot  was a little blue card dated 5th January 1970,\r\n\r\nacknowledging receipt of my communication. He  gave\r\n\r\nme a reference number, and to date, Sir, I have not\r\n\r\nreceived  any further reply. I tried  to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  had been done in this respect, but all I  was\r\n\r\ntold  was that a reply had, in fact, been  sent  to\r\n\r\nme. When I asked the Department whether it would be\r\n\r\npossible for me to get a copy of their reply  since\r\n\r\nI had not received one, they said that they were in\r\n\r\nno position to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this state of affairs really surprises\r\n\r\nme  because  I have a high regard for  the  Postal\r\n\r\nServices Department which has managed to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  ever-increasing volume of work - handling  and\r\n\r\ndelivering letters, parcels, etc.\r\n\r\nwith  a  good degree of efficiency. Then,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nborrow  the  saying, the last  straw  came.  I  was\r\n\r\nsurprised  to  hear, over the radio, of  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom residents in Choa Chu Kang Constituency - Sir,\r\n\r\nI am not for one moment speaking for the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang who is now absent - that in  places\r\n\r\nlike  Choa Chu Kang, letters were not delivered  in\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Communications will\r\n\r\nconsider  my  comments with  a  view  to  providing\r\n\r\neither more postmen\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Motor-cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Motor-cycles, yes. The question of motor-cycles\r\n\r\njust came to my mind. In Punggol there is only  one\r\n\r\ndelivery, and the old motor-cycle used for delivery\r\n\r\nbroke  down and a replacement, I believe, was  sent\r\n\r\nfor.  Unfortunately the new motor-cycle also  broke\r\n\r\ndown.  Sir, with these remarks, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill care to look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to put forward\r\n\r\nthis point: in my constituency of Delta, the postal\r\n\r\nservices are inadequate. As all Members know, Delta\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the constituencies where  mobility  is\r\n\r\nhighest, i.e., a lot of people move about. In  1962\r\n\r\nthe  ratio  was one to three or one  to  four.  The\r\n\r\npostal  services in my constituency have not  shown\r\n\r\nany   improvement   since   1962.   The   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee has on many occasions  asked\r\n\r\nme  why  the  postal services have not improved.  I\r\n\r\nhave requested for more pillar boxes or the opening\r\n\r\nof  more post offices, but these requests have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  acceded  to. The Committee has  made  several\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Director of Postal Services,\r\n\r\nand  has  also  written  to the  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General for more pillar  boxes  or  post\r\n\r\noffices. If the Postal Department thinks that my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency is too small for a postal branch to be\r\n\r\nset  up,  then I would like to mention that  in  my\r\n\r\nneighbouring  constituencies, i.e., Bukit  Ho  Swee\r\n\r\nand  Tiong  Bahru, there is also a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\npopulation movement. With this population  movement\r\n\r\nfrom  1962  up  to now, the ratio is still  one  to\r\n\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 10 years the number of people in\r\n\r\nthese  constituencies  who have  made  use  of  the\r\n\r\npostal  services is not big. But with the  increase\r\n\r\nof  literacy of our population, our postal services\r\n\r\nhave  to bear a greater burden because more  people\r\n\r\nknow  how to read and write, especially the younger\r\n\r\nset.  Of  course, in the past some people  did  not\r\n\r\nhave   much   of  an  education,  and   when   they\r\n\r\ncommunicated their love to one another, they did so\r\n\r\nverbally. But nowadays they can write, and so  they\r\n\r\ncan  express  their  love  through  correspondence.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have placed a greater burden on the\r\n\r\nPostal Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is the increase in cultural\r\n\r\nactivities,  which  has  also  contributed  to  the\r\n\r\nburden of the Postal Department. For instance, many\r\n\r\nprogrammes  over  Television  Singapore,  such   as\r\n\r\npublic  forums  and games, require  correspondence.\r\n\r\nThis  has  resulted in a greater volume of  letters\r\n\r\nbeing delivered. As an example, the Chinese Chamber\r\n\r\nof  Commerce  organises a public essay competition.\r\n\r\nAll the entries have to rely on the postal services\r\n\r\nto be delivered. Therefore, we know that the burden\r\n\r\non the Postal Department is greater nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in the past people made use\r\n\r\nof  other  channels  of  communication,  e.g, oral\r\n\r\ncommunication.  But  nowadays,  because  of   urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  development,  more  and  more  people  are\r\n\r\nscattered  over a wider area, and this necessitates\r\n\r\ncorrespondence through the post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more people are making use of the postal\r\n\r\nservices  to  send  messages  from  one  place   to\r\n\r\nanother.   Therefore,   with   the   increase    in\r\n\r\npopulation, there is a greater volume of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorrespondence. It has been said that in  the  past\r\n\r\nthe  number  of people who made use of  the  postal\r\n\r\nservices  was  only 30 per cent of the  population,\r\n\r\nbut now probably 80 per cent of our people make use\r\n\r\nof  them.  If our postal services remain  in  their\r\n\r\npresent state, of course, there will be an increase\r\n\r\nin  inconvenience.  The  inconvenience  is  brought\r\n\r\nabout in two ways. First, more and more people will\r\n\r\nbecome  discontented. Secondly,  the  postal  staff\r\n\r\nwill  also become discontented as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nheavy  load  of work. We often say that the  postal\r\n\r\nservice  staff lose their temper whenever they  are\r\n\r\noverworked  and  have to bear too great  a  burden.\r\n\r\nWith  a  bigger crowd queueing up every  day,  they\r\n\r\nfind  it difficult to cope up with their work. This\r\n\r\nis one of the reasons why they lose their temper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will improve the postal\r\n\r\nservices  in  the  three  constituencies   I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned. For example, in Queenstown a post office\r\n\r\nwas  built  to provide for the needs of the  people\r\n\r\nthere. I think they are rather privileged. They can\r\n\r\nget  whatever  they  want. But  we  in  the  poorer\r\n\r\nconstituencies cannot get what we want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full sympathy with the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. He feels strongly about the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the General Post Office building was built  as\r\n\r\nlong ago as 1928. It is now more than 40 years old.\r\n\r\nConditions in that building may not be as  good  as\r\n\r\nin the many new public buildings, some of which are\r\n\r\neven air-conditioned. Of course, personally I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  a  new General Post Office  building\r\n\r\nbeing  built  somewhere on the water front.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that it is possible that certain parts of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding, for instance, the basement, may not be as\r\n\r\ngood as what one would like them to be. However,  I\r\n\r\nshall  make  surprise checks at  the  General  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  in compliance with the Member's request.  I\r\n\r\nwant to say that things in the General Post Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  always be the same. As and when  we  are\r\n\r\nable to get sites, we will remove the stores branch\r\n\r\nwhich is at present in the basement. I understand a\r\n\r\nsite has been allotted somewhere in Tannery Lane. I\r\n\r\nthink  provision  has  been  made  in  the  1970-71\r\n\r\nEstimates.  There  will, therefore,  be  additional\r\n\r\naccommodation at the General Post Office to  handle\r\n\r\nthe mail, and conditions should improve as a result\r\n\r\nof this additional accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Toa Payoh, here again it is our intention\r\n\r\nto provide more facilities in this new town. But  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Member will appreciate that building  in\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  is largely in the hands of the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board. I think the Member is aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  planning  of the  town  centre  was  not\r\n\r\ncompleted  until the latter part of last year.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board made a statement  in\r\n\r\nthe   newspapers  as  follows.  I  will  read  this\r\n\r\nstatement which I assume is the official reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The construction of a town centre is expected to\r\n\r\nstart next year [which is 1970].\r\n\r\nIt is normal practice for the Board to start on the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the residential sector first and  to\r\n\r\nincorporate a town centre only when the township is\r\n\r\nthree-quarters developed in order that there should\r\n\r\nbe  a  sufficient  population to support  the  town\r\n\r\ncentre.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Our  post  office is part of this town centre.  So,\r\n\r\nmuch  as  we  would  like to  provide  full  postal\r\n\r\nservices  for  Toa Payoh, the building  of  a  post\r\n\r\noffice  in the town centre is in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. When they are ready,\r\n\r\nwe will provide the facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Punggol, I am sorry to\r\n\r\nhear  that the delivery of mail in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nis  not  quite up to expectations. I  think  if  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  we are able to provide even  one  proper\r\n\r\ndaily  service  in the rural areas,  we  have  done\r\n\r\nreasonably  well. We do know that there  are  other\r\n\r\ncountries  which may be more affluent, but  if  you\r\n\r\npost a letter there, probably that is the last time\r\n\r\nyou  will see it. It never gets delivered  at  all.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  cannot  excuse  Singapore  of   being\r\n\r\nindifferent. We expect letters, when posted, to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelivered in due time. As stated by the Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol,  it  is  possible  sometimes  for  letters\r\n\r\ncalling  for meetings to have been posted  but  not\r\n\r\ndelivered until after the event has taken place. It\r\n\r\ncan  happen. After all, millions of postal articles\r\n\r\nare being posted and delivered at any one time.  If\r\n\r\nyou allow for .001 per cent of something happening,\r\n\r\nthen  it  might be that something has  happened  to\r\n\r\nthat  particular letter. Of course, there  are  the\r\n\r\nusual  difficulties of incorrect  addresses  or  no\r\n\r\naddresses  at  all and so on. There could  be  such\r\n\r\ndifficulties. But if, as stated by the  Member,  he\r\n\r\nhas taken issue with the Postmaster-General and all\r\n\r\nthat  he had received was just a post-card  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the matter was receiving attention -this  was\r\n\r\nway back in January and now it is almost the end of\r\n\r\nMarch - I would like to say that in anticipation of\r\n\r\nthe  complaint  from  the Member,  I  did  ask  the\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General whether there was  any  specific\r\n\r\ncomplaint  from the Member. I was told  that  there\r\n\r\nwas such a complaint. I said, \"Please let me have a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the  complaint and  the  reply  from  our\r\n\r\ndepartment.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, to my horror  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that  there was no copy of the  complaint.  I\r\n\r\nasked   how  that  could  be  possible.  I   would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, appreciate it if, after the meeting, the\r\n\r\nMember  would  be good enough to let me  have  that\r\n\r\nparticular reference so that I could follow  up  to\r\n\r\nsee  which  particular officer had dealt  with  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

She  is\r\n\r\nquarrelling  about  Queenstown  being  a   favoured\r\n\r\nconstituency. I do not know why. A new non-delivery\r\n\r\npost  office is scheduled to be built at Chin  Swee\r\n\r\nRoad  towards  the end of 1970. I  hope  that  will\r\n\r\nsatisfy her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

If he will look  at\r\n\r\nthe  bottom of the page in the estimates,  he  will\r\n\r\nsee  note (ii) which reads: \"Includes provision for\r\n\r\none  House Foreman and four Carpenters.\" If he will\r\n\r\nlook further up note (1) says: \"Provision for daily\r\n\r\nrated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaff now shown separately under Subhead 2024.\"  If\r\n\r\nhe  looks at subhead 2008, he will see \"Maintenance\r\n\r\nof  Compounds and Buildings\"; against subhead  2009\r\n\r\nthere  is  \"Maintenance of Telecommunications\"  and\r\n\r\nagainst  subhead  2010  there  is  \"Maintenance  of\r\n\r\nVehicles\".

But\r\n\r\nfor the 12 months for this year's estimates, half a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars was extracted from this  provision\r\n\r\nand made into a separate subhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the position is as follows. For the\r\n\r\nyear  1969-70, there are as many as 200 daily-rated\r\n\r\nstaff.

In all, there is a total\r\n\r\nof 258 daily-rated staff. There is no provision for\r\n\r\nany  grass cutters here. All I can say is that  out\r\n\r\nof  the  258  daily-rated  staff,  107  are  office\r\n\r\ncleaners, labourers, store assistants, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> There is provision for grass cutters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is put in somewhere, but the whole provision\r\n\r\nis not for grass cutters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  reply,  I beg leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,185,520 for Head 0806 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0807 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs.

I  am just  wondering  what  is\r\n\r\nholding up the implementation of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nhow  effective the Transport Advisory Board  is  in\r\n\r\nhelping  us  solve  the  all-important  subject  of\r\n\r\npublic transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been encouraging the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to keep Singapore clean so that\r\n\r\nwe can have a healthy environment and better health\r\n\r\nfor  the  people. But I have seen many cars,  buses\r\n\r\nand lorries in the streets of Singapore letting out\r\n\r\ndirty and poisonous fumes from their exhaust pipes.\r\n\r\nThese  dirty  and poisonous fumes not only  pollute\r\n\r\nthe air but they are also endangering the health of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. We must put a stop to it,\r\n\r\nand the sooner the better. I understand that action\r\n\r\nhas  been taken against the offenders but there are\r\n\r\nstill  too  many  vehicles letting  out  dirty  and\r\n\r\npoisonous fumes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I request stronger action should be taken\r\n\r\nagainst  the offenders and heavier fines should  be\r\n\r\nimposed on them. Perhaps an effective system  can\r\n\r\nbe adopted by empowering the Traffic Police to deal\r\n\r\nwith  offenders on the spot. I would  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe fines be paid by the owners of the vehicles and\r\n\r\nnot  by  the  drivers, because the owners  must  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for their vehicles. If the emission  of\r\n\r\ndirty  and poisonous fumes is due to the negligence\r\n\r\nof the drivers, then it is up to the owners to deal\r\n\r\nwith   them.   I  hope  the  Minister   will   give\r\n\r\nconsideration  to my proposal and take  strong  and\r\n\r\nimmediate action against the offenders for  letting\r\n\r\nout dirty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  poisonous fumes from their vehicles.

It is not  an\r\n\r\nuncommon sight to see small vehicles carrying large\r\n\r\nloads  and big vehicles carrying loads twice  their\r\n\r\nlength. Vehicles which are not designed for certain\r\n\r\ntypes  of  haulage are used indiscriminately  along\r\n\r\nour  roads, thereby posing a grave danger to  other\r\n\r\nroad users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have witnessed three incidents along the\r\n\r\nroads  in  Singapore. One incident was along  Jalan\r\n\r\nAhmad Ibrahim. A lorry, stacked high with crates of\r\n\r\nknocked-down  units of motorcar  spare  parts,  was\r\n\r\nnegotiating  a  bend when half  a  dozen  of  these\r\n\r\ncrates  fell on to the road. Fortunately,  my  car,\r\n\r\nwhich was following behind, was quite some distance\r\n\r\naway.  In another instance at Queenstown Circus,  a\r\n\r\nlorry,   carrying  goods  which  were  inadequately\r\n\r\nsecured,  was negotiating the circus when  part  of\r\n\r\nthe load fell off the vehicle. In this instance, my\r\n\r\ncar  was  also  following behind,  but  fortunately\r\n\r\nnothing untoward happened. In the third instance, a\r\n\r\nlorry,  carrying  a lot of steel  rods  which  were\r\n\r\ntwice the length of the lorry itself, was going  up\r\n\r\na  steep  incline when suddenly the  front  of  the\r\n\r\nlorry upended and all the steel rods fell on to the\r\n\r\nroad.  As I said, I wonder whether the Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  has any regulations preventing owners  of\r\n\r\nlorries  from  stacking their vehicles  with  goods\r\n\r\nthat are two or three times as high as the lorry or\r\n\r\ngoods that are twice the length of the lorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a common practice for transport\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  make  the  maximum  use  of  their\r\n\r\nvehicles. For instance, if the lorry is licensed to\r\n\r\ncarry  three  tons,  they will stack  goods  in  it\r\n\r\nweighing about three tons. Imagine empty oil  drums\r\n\r\nand  rattan loaded into the lorry and their  height\r\n\r\nis two or three times that of the lorry. This can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate  a  very dangerous situation for other  road\r\n\r\nusers. I hope the Minister for Communications  will\r\n\r\ntake  notice of such undesirable practices and stop\r\n\r\nthem from being continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the bus services in Singapore, we all\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Singapore Traction Company  has  a\r\n\r\nvirtual monopoly of city routes. Since it is unable\r\n\r\nto  provide  an efficient and frequent service  for\r\n\r\nbus  users,  I  wonder whether  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider  other alternative measures like  allowing\r\n\r\nother bus companies to ply these routes until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as  the  S.T.C. can improve  their  services.\r\n\r\nThere   are  also  frequent  break-downs   of   the\r\n\r\nCompany's  buses.  In Toa Payoh, this  Company  has\r\n\r\nmore  than half a dozen bus services running.  This\r\n\r\ngives  the false impression that it is providing  a\r\n\r\nproper service to the people. But the truth of  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is that only a minimum number of buses  are\r\n\r\nbeing used. Can the Minister for Communications look\r\n\r\ninto  this  matter  and  try  to  improve  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices in the new town?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, stories of rudeness and cheating by taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers are rampant and are frequently in print  in\r\n\r\nthe  local newspapers. Some taxi drivers  are  even\r\n\r\nreported   to   have  threatened  passengers   with\r\n\r\nassault.  I have heard that some top civil servants\r\n\r\nand  a Parliamentary Secretary were threatened with\r\n\r\nassault and abuse. Of course, these rude, dishonest\r\n\r\nand belligerent taxi drivers are in a minority. But\r\n\r\nthey  are  enough to give Singapore a bad  name  to\r\n\r\nvisitors,  and if unchecked, may also  force  local\r\n\r\npassengers  to  avoid taking taxis. There  must  be\r\n\r\nstricter supervision of these taxi drivers and more\r\n\r\nenergetic  action should be taken on complaints  by\r\n\r\npassengers. Recently, there was a campaign to  have\r\n\r\ncleaner  taxis. There should also be a campaign  to\r\n\r\nhave  honest  and polite taxi drivers. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nwhen it rains, it is impossible to get a taxi. So I\r\n\r\nhope  when  the findings of the Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard  are  to  hand,  the Minister  will  consider\r\n\r\nwhether there is a need to issue more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxi   licences.

Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one small point -and one would\r\n\r\nhave thought that it was a fairly obvious point! In\r\n\r\nspite  of the fact that we have introduced  one-way\r\n\r\ntraffic along most of Singapore's roads, it is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult  to find buses, lorries and  even  motor-cars travelling abreast of one another at about 20\r\n\r\nmiles per hour and preventing other road users from\r\n\r\ngoing through. It occurred to me quite a number  of\r\n\r\ntimes, and I would have thought that it would  have\r\n\r\noccurred  to  most people, that this problem  could\r\n\r\nhave  been  easily  solved by the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nlanes  on  the left-hand side of the road for  slow\r\n\r\ntraffic and lanes on the middle and right-hand side\r\n\r\nof  the  road for faster traffic. I wonder if  this\r\n\r\nplan can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have heard just now that\r\n\r\nthere  are about 200 deaths on the road every year.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister for Health and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Communications seldom go to the hospital to see\r\n\r\nhow  many  road  accidents occur in  Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nrealise  that  most  of these fatal  cases  involve\r\n\r\nmotor-cyclists.   Recently,   the   Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications ordered all motor-cyclists  to  wear\r\n\r\ncrash  helmets but they were not ordered to put  on\r\n\r\niron gloves and iron boots. Of course, the head  is\r\n\r\nimportant and must be protected, but the  arms  and\r\n\r\nthe   limbs  are  also  very  important.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  not  see  that it is also  necessary  for\r\n\r\nmotor-cyclists to wear iron gloves and boots? If  a\r\n\r\nyouth  becomes  crippled in  an  accident  for  not\r\n\r\nhaving  iron  gloves or boots on, then perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister will have to see to the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point that I want to bring up.\r\n\r\nWhen  an  \"L\" driver takes his test, he  should  be\r\n\r\nasked to pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncareful  attention  to  the  fundamental  rules  of\r\n\r\ndriving.  Some \"L\" motor-cyclists go at a  terrific\r\n\r\nspeed. At times, they drive recklessly, swerving to\r\n\r\nthe  left and to the right. They look like shooting\r\n\r\narrows  flying  past. I myself have witnessed  them\r\n\r\ncutting across the paths of other vehicles in  one-way  streets.  I am worried about the children  and\r\n\r\nold  folks  on  the  road.  These  reckless  motor-cyclists are really a menace to these people.  They\r\n\r\nare not aware of this, particularly the young motor-cyclists  who  have their girl friends  as  pillion\r\n\r\nriders.  They want to show off and they are  liable\r\n\r\nto  skid on slippery roads. Therefore, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Communications should advise motor-cyclists  to\r\n\r\nbe  more  careful  when driving  on  newly-metalled\r\n\r\nroads  and  sandy  stretches  on  rainy  days  when\r\n\r\ncertain  stretches of the roads are  dangerous  for\r\n\r\ndriving.  Driving testers should also inform  them,\r\n\r\nduring  the  test,  that when  they  are  about  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate a corner and they cannot see anything  in\r\n\r\nfront,  they should not speed and they  should  not\r\n\r\novertake  the vehicles in front. They  should  pass\r\n\r\nall these tests before licences are issued to them.\r\n\r\nSir,   I   hope  the  Minister  will  consider   my\r\n\r\nsuggestions  regarding testing for \"L\" drivers  and\r\n\r\nmotor-cyclists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime in the middle of\r\n\r\nFebruary  this  year, a number of  driving  licence\r\n\r\nholders whose licences expired either in the middle\r\n\r\nof  February or at the end of February went to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Vehicles  to  have  their   licences\r\n\r\nrenewed.  They  had a document stating  that  their\r\n\r\nlicences  were expiring sometime in the  middle  of\r\n\r\nFebruary. However, they were told that all licences\r\n\r\nwere valid only up to the end of January because of\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of computers.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nalthough  a  driver actually had his licence  valid\r\n\r\ntill about the 15th February, he was told that,  in\r\n\r\nactual fact, his licence had expired at the end  of\r\n\r\nJanuary. These licence holders were also told  that\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Vehicles wrote to them  informing\r\n\r\nthem of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  computers,  and,  as  a   result,\r\n\r\nlicences  were only valid till the end of  January.\r\n\r\nTherefore, not renewing their licences at  the  end\r\n\r\nof  January was an offence and, although  they  had\r\n\r\nlost  some days as a result of the introduction  of\r\n\r\ncomputerisation, they had to pay a fine. This is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  incongruous because they had an  authorised\r\n\r\nlicence  which  stated, \"Your licence  expires  on,\r\n\r\nsay,  18th  February\"; yet when they  went  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Vehicles on the 15th February  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  licences renewed, they were told that  their\r\n\r\nlicences had, in actual fact, expired at the end of\r\n\r\nJanuary  because of computerisation. I  think  this\r\n\r\npractice  is  wrong  as  they  were  still  holding\r\n\r\nlicences  valid up to the middle of February.  Even\r\n\r\nif  with the introduction of computerisation, their\r\n\r\nlicences  should have been renewed on the  31st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary, I feel they should not have been fined for\r\n\r\nlate renewal. Sir, I hope the Minister will find it\r\n\r\npossible to comment on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to answer\r\n\r\nthe  query from the Member for Jalan Kayu.  I  will\r\n\r\ntake his second question first. As to how effective\r\n\r\nthe Transport Advisory Board is, I wish to say that\r\n\r\nI  consider it to be of great value to me,  because\r\n\r\nit  does  help to get opinion outside  of  official\r\n\r\nquarters,  as a good number of the members  on  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory Board are not in Government service.  They\r\n\r\nare  people who are prepared to express an  opinion\r\n\r\non   a   difficult  subject,  that  of  traffic   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  have  seen to it,  too,  that  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary be the  Chairman  of  this\r\n\r\nBoard.  So,  in my opinion, the Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard is doing a good service and I want to say how\r\n\r\nmuch  I  appreciate  its good  work.  Most  of  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  have  been  accepted.  The  second\r\n\r\ninterim report has come to me early this month  and\r\n\r\nit  is under study. I can, I think, divulge some of\r\n\r\nits  main  recommendations, but I will not disclose\r\n\r\nthe details. The recommendations cover the subjects\r\n\r\nof  ordinary  taxis, school taxis (the  SCH  cars),\r\n\r\nschool buses, and the age limit of public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice    vehicles.    These    are    the    main\r\n\r\nrecommendations, and as soon as I am in a  position\r\n\r\nto  form  an  opinion on them, they  will  be  made\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that I have given an undertaking to look\r\n\r\ninto  the matter of checking old cars on the roads.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I have found it better not to confine  my\r\n\r\nstudy  of the problem only to old private vehicles,\r\n\r\nbut  to all other types of vehicles as well. I have\r\n\r\ntherefore  withheld action, and as  indicated  just\r\n\r\nnow,  the Transport Advisory Board has made certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations on the age limit of public  service\r\n\r\nvehicles. So when I do come to a decision on public\r\n\r\nservice  vehicles, I will at the same time  make  a\r\n\r\ndecision   on   private  cars.  I  hope   that   my\r\n\r\nexplanation will satisfy the Member for Jalan Kayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the comments by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nHo Swee on air pollution, the smoky exhaust  from\r\n\r\ncars,  taxis, buses, lorries and so on, I  want  to\r\n\r\nsay  that action has been taken in recent years  on\r\n\r\nthese matters. I would like to say that the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  compounded as many as 7,353 cases in  1969;\r\n\r\nthat is to say, when a traffic policeman notices  a\r\n\r\ncar  emitting  smoke  from its  exhaust  pipe,  the\r\n\r\ndriver is given a ticket and is asked to report  to\r\n\r\nthe  police station where he is allowed to compound\r\n\r\nhis  offence for $20. There were 7,353  such  cases\r\n\r\nlast  year.  In addition, last year  we  called  up\r\n\r\n8,800  vehicles for a check-up of their exhaust  at\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  of Vehicles' office. Therefore,  in\r\n\r\ntotal,  about 16,000 vehicles were pulled up.  They\r\n\r\nwere mainly diesel-operated cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that it is the intention of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  to  conduct a  campaign  against  air\r\n\r\npollution   very  soon.  There  will  be   stronger\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken against cars with smoky exhaust  be\r\n\r\nthey private cars, lorries, taxis, buses and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen  the campaign is to be set in motion, we  will\r\n\r\ngive  adequate  notice  to  the  public  before  we\r\n\r\nproceed  to  take  stronger  action  against  smoky\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments of the Member for Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh on overloading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof    vehicles   as   a   result   of   our   rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, with lorries  overloading  goods\r\n\r\nand  building materials, I think there is something\r\n\r\nup  the  sleeve of my colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence, to deal with this matter. His very  active\r\n\r\nTraffic   Police  does  go  round   ticketing   the\r\n\r\noffenders. I am sure they will continue to keep  up\r\n\r\nwith  their  good  work to book them  so  that  the\r\n\r\nrecalcitrants  will  not  find  it  profitable   to\r\n\r\noverload their lorries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the inability of the Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company to provide an adequate service for\r\n\r\nToa Payoh, I would like to say that, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nthere  are  not  enough buses  to  serve  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday.  There are, in all, only about  1,500  buses\r\n\r\nowned  by  the S.T.C. and the other 11 Chinese  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies to provide a public transport service for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  are  looking into  this  matter  of\r\n\r\ninadequate buses for public transport. In fact,  we\r\n\r\nare  getting  the Singapore Traction Company's  co-operation  to  permit the Chinese bus companies  to\r\n\r\noperate bus services along certain routes for which\r\n\r\nit  is unable to provide an adequate service. There\r\n\r\nis  closer co-ordination now than in the past among\r\n\r\nthe  12 bus companies. I am confident that given  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more time and discussion, we may be able\r\n\r\nto co-ordinate the bus services of Singapore and to\r\n\r\nimprove  them  in due course. Certain  matters  are\r\n\r\nunder discussion and I think it would not be proper\r\n\r\nfor me to reveal them here at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments of the Member for Havelock\r\n\r\non rudeness and cheating by taxi drivers, he has, I\r\n\r\nthink, partly answered the criticism by saying that\r\n\r\nonly  some of the taxi drivers are bad. As  in  any\r\n\r\nstratum  of society, there are always the good  and\r\n\r\nthe  bad.  So  I think it is not fair  to  pinpoint\r\n\r\nthem, especially as the Member for Changi wants  to\r\n\r\nknow  who  these rude taxi drivers are, because  he\r\n\r\nhas  to  defend his drivers as well.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that we are taking action on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  complaints. Most times complainants are  not\r\n\r\nprepared to furnish particulars. That is why it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to follow up on such complaints.  But  if\r\n\r\nafter  investigation we do find  they  are  genuine\r\n\r\ncomplaints, we will either suspend the taxi  driver\r\n\r\nconcerned  from driving for one week or longer,  or\r\n\r\neven  cancel  his licence if it is  necessary.  The\r\n\r\nMember has asked for the number of complaints  from\r\n\r\n1968.  Details will probably take some time  to  be\r\n\r\nforthcoming, but I hope he will be satisfied  if  I\r\n\r\nsend  him the figures later by post for his follow-up  and  criticism. However, I can assure him  that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  get complaints, we do follow up, provided\r\n\r\nthe   complaints  lodged  give  all  the  necessary\r\n\r\nparticulars, and not complaints stating merely that\r\n\r\nthere is an overcharge and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Bukit Panjang who\r\n\r\nsuggested the marking out of slow and fast  traffic\r\n\r\nlanes, I think this is a very good suggestion which\r\n\r\nI  am  sure the Transport Advisory Board will  give\r\n\r\ndue consideration. We have the Officer-in-Charge of\r\n\r\nthe Traffic Police on the Transport Advisory Board.\r\n\r\nSo a matter like this will receive due attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the Member for Ulu Pandan. I cannot\r\n\r\nsee  how,  after  advising motor-cyclists  to  wear\r\n\r\ncrash  helmets to save their skulls, the Member  is\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that they should also wear iron  gloves\r\n\r\nto  save  them  from breaking their arms.  That  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  I  think  cannot  be  taken   too\r\n\r\nseriously.  He  also  suggests lecturing  to  young\r\n\r\npeople  who  ride motor-cycles. It  is  unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat   young   people  will  always  do   something\r\n\r\nreckless, and they have to pay the price for  their\r\n\r\nrecklessness. We can only advise them  as  best  we\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah talks about driving\r\n\r\nlicences  which actually expired in mid-month  but,\r\n\r\nbecause  of computerisation, had been valid  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the preceding month only, so that  the\r\n\r\nholders of these licences lost out by two or  three\r\n\r\nweeks.  As  a  result, they  were  fined  for  not\r\n\r\nrenewing their licences in time. However,  even  if\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  fined, it was only $3. I think they had  been\r\n\r\ngiven  one  full year's notice of this change,  and\r\n\r\nsuch a thing happens once in a lifetime. Perhaps we\r\n\r\ncan  just  forget  about it. It is  all  over  now.\r\n\r\nBecause of computerisation, some people would stand\r\n\r\nto gain something, while others would stand to lose\r\n\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> In view of the not unsatisfactory answers, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of\r\n\r\nMadam  Chan  Choy  Siong  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be reduced by $10 in\r\n\r\nrespect of subhead 1012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2012.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I just want to seek\r\n\r\nelucidation  from  the  Minister  why  there  is  a\r\n\r\nprovision of $4,000 for Highway Code Tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, Highway Code tests\r\n\r\nwere  done orally. But because of the large  number\r\n\r\nof  people being kept waiting to take their driving\r\n\r\ntests,  which  include the Highway  Code  test,  we\r\n\r\ndecided to institute a written test. It is like  an\r\n\r\nexamination  paper  where  everything  is  done  in\r\n\r\nwriting.  In  an  oral  test the  tester  can  take\r\n\r\nprobably 10 or 20 candidates per day, but a written\r\n\r\ntest  can perhaps take 400 candidates per day.  The\r\n\r\napplicant's  paper is marked, and he either  passes\r\n\r\nor  fails the examination. So this money really  is\r\n\r\nto  pay for the stationery and a small fee, like an\r\n\r\nexaminer's fee, for the people who mark the papers.\r\n\r\nI think this expenditure is really worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 11 months from April 1969 to February\r\n\r\n1970  since  we started this written  Highway  Code\r\n\r\ntest,  there were 10,632 candidates, of whom  7,642\r\n\r\npassed,  or nearly 72 per cent.

We know that the Government provides  this\r\n\r\nlarge sum because of practical needs. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  raise  three questions. First, whether national\r\n\r\nservice  has  affected highly  qualified  technical\r\n\r\npersonnel.   Second,  whether   the   Minister   is\r\n\r\nconsidering  national  service  for  women.  Third,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have adequate measures to counter  the\r\n\r\nentry of illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question we know that national\r\n\r\nservice   has  been  very  successful   since   its\r\n\r\nintroduction. As a young country we have managed to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  great deal in respect  of  our  defence\r\n\r\nwithin a short period of time. This is commendable.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that  in order to build  up  our  defence\r\n\r\nforces,  we  have to adopt a strict policy  on  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of national service. For the good of\r\n\r\nthe country, this policy is beyond reproach. But as\r\n\r\na  result  of the strict implementation of national\r\n\r\nservice,  a  number of problems  have  arisen.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  certain  engineering  students   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity have been called up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor national service. This has caused a shortage of\r\n\r\nengineers in Government and statutory boards,  such\r\n\r\nas the Economic Development Board, and also in some\r\n\r\nfactories. Let me quote an example. There were  two\r\n\r\nmechanical engineering graduates from New  Zealand,\r\n\r\none  a Malaysian citizen, and the other a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen.  The  Malaysian citizen was  very  quickly\r\n\r\nappointed by the Government. On the other hand, the\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizen,  who  is  also  a   mechanical\r\n\r\nengineer,  was called up for national  service.  Is\r\n\r\nthis not a show of favouritism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that it is the duty of a citizen to\r\n\r\nundergo national service, but when we suffer from a\r\n\r\nsevere shortage of engineers who are needed for the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our economy and industry, we  should\r\n\r\nmake  good  use of the talent of our  graduates  in\r\n\r\nthis field, so that they can play a greater part in\r\n\r\ncontributing towards the building of our country. I\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister will agree with me that  it  is\r\n\r\nequally important to develop our industries and our\r\n\r\neconomy. If we can do so without affecting national\r\n\r\nservice,  I would like to ask him if he  will  give\r\n\r\nspecial    consideration   to   these   engineering\r\n\r\ngraduates  who are called up for national  service.\r\n\r\nFor example, perhaps we can devise some arrangement\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  could  put them on part-time  national\r\n\r\nservice.  I  do  not know what the Minister  thinks\r\n\r\nabout this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in regard to national service\r\n\r\nby  our women. I remember during the debate on  the\r\n\r\nlast  Budget,  I  asked  the Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was considering drafting our women  into\r\n\r\nnational  service. The Minister's  reply  then  was\r\n\r\nthat  this was a very good suggestion, but  because\r\n\r\nwe  did  not have enough instructors, the plan  was\r\n\r\ntemporarily postponed and he would reconsider it at\r\n\r\na  later stage. But now after a lapse of about  two\r\n\r\nyears,  I  think  we  have  a  greater  number   of\r\n\r\ninstructors. Therefore, the time has come for us to\r\n\r\nconsider the implementation of national service for\r\n\r\nour women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons for putting forward this\r\n\r\nsuggestion  are  twofold.  First,  we  believe   in\r\n\r\nequality  of the sexes, and, therefore,  our  women\r\n\r\nshould   also  shoulder  their  responsibility   of\r\n\r\nprotecting  our  country. Duty  and  responsibility\r\n\r\ncome  together. Second, it is necessary for  us  to\r\n\r\nensure  that, in the utilisation of our  resources,\r\n\r\nwe  will not meet with a lop-sided situation,  that\r\n\r\nis,  concentrating on one aspect and neglecting the\r\n\r\nother. Our female citizens should do their part  in\r\n\r\nnational  service.  All  our  youths  have  to   do\r\n\r\nnational  service, and therefore they are  hampered\r\n\r\nor  restricted. Some of them cannot go for  further\r\n\r\nstudies. If we allow this situation to carry on, we\r\n\r\nwill  find  that  our youths, as  compared  to  our\r\n\r\ngirls,  will  suffer. Our women will be  graduates,\r\n\r\nscholars or doctors of philosophy, and the majority\r\n\r\nof  our  men  will  be just ordinary  citizens  and\r\n\r\nsoldiers  and not distinguished professionals.  Our\r\n\r\nsociety  will be lopsided in favour of  the  women,\r\n\r\nand there will be no equality of the sexes. I think\r\n\r\nall  Members  of Parliament will not like  this  to\r\n\r\nhappen, because if it did, then perhaps there would\r\n\r\nbe   more   lady  Members  than  male  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  purpose  of  nation  building  is  to  have  a\r\n\r\nsociety where both sexes are equal. We do not  like\r\n\r\nto  see a reversal of the situation where they  are\r\n\r\nnot  equal.  So  we should deal with this  question\r\n\r\nvery carefully. I think the girls will support  the\r\n\r\nidea  of drafting them for national service.  There\r\n\r\nare  many  countries in the world which  have  done\r\n\r\nthis.  For  example,  Israel has  already  inducted\r\n\r\nwomen into national service. And we can learn  from\r\n\r\nthem how to induct our girls into national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that I would like to raise is\r\n\r\nthis.  Not very long ago we amended our immigration\r\n\r\nlaws  to  help us deal with the question of illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants. Since then, have we had better  control\r\n\r\nover illegal immigrants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang was\r\n\r\nvery  kind  when  he  said  that  women  should  do\r\n\r\nnational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice and so play their part. His logic is  this: if  the  women should survive, then the  men  would\r\n\r\nhave no place to go to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody is concerned with the question of\r\n\r\ndefence. When the British Government announced  its\r\n\r\naccelerated  withdrawal by the end of  1971,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nall the British armed forces stationed in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  fully withdrawn by the end of  1971,  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  started to carry out effective  schemes\r\n\r\nin advance to prepare for such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every young man in our country will then become\r\n\r\npatriotic.  He will be concerned about the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people. Our youths will have  a  sense  of\r\n\r\npatriotism and take up military training. Within  a\r\n\r\nshort  time  we have managed to build up  a  strong\r\n\r\ndefence  force,  consisting  of  brave  and  strong\r\n\r\nsoldiers who will defend our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether we have\r\n\r\nplans to replace all the military personnel as well\r\n\r\nas  all  the  military equipment  which  are  being\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  by the British. In other words,  can  we\r\n\r\ntake  over  the  role played by  the  British?  Our\r\n\r\noriginal   defence  planning  was  based   on   the\r\n\r\nassumption that the British armed forces  would  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn in 1971 or 1972. Our defence forces might\r\n\r\nbe able to replace the British armed forces by that\r\n\r\ndate. But as they are to be withdrawn earlier  than\r\n\r\nanticipated, do we have enough trained men to  fill\r\n\r\nthe  vacuum  left  by them? Can  the  Minister  say\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can replace the British  armed  forces\r\n\r\nwith our own forces when they finally withdraw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the Government has been quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in its efforts to build  up  our  armed\r\n\r\nforces.  However, as the Member for  Sembawang  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now,  as  a  result  of   national\r\n\r\nservice,  there  is a shortage of skilled  manpower\r\n\r\nand   this  is  having  an  effect  on  our  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.  Will the Minister, therefore,  introduce\r\n\r\nsome changes in the regulations governing national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice? National service can be introduced in  the\r\n\r\nschools.  The  youths of Singapore  should  undergo\r\n\r\nnational service earlier, preferably when they  are\r\n\r\nstill  in  the  Primary schools. They should  begin\r\n\r\ntheir national service training in Primary V or VI.\r\n\r\nThey  can  receive  military training  and  acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge  of military affairs at this  stage,  and\r\n\r\nwhen they go to the Secondary schools they can then\r\n\r\nreceive   regular   military  training,   including\r\n\r\ntraining  in the handling of weapons. In this  way,\r\n\r\nthey will have undergone some military training and\r\n\r\nhave  acquired a knowledge of how to  use  military\r\n\r\nequipment by the time they leave school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also said just now\r\n\r\nthat both males and females should undergo national\r\n\r\nservice.  If we can introduce some changes  in  our\r\n\r\nnational service regulations according to what  has\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested, then both males and  females  will\r\n\r\nundergo national service at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are many uniformed groups in\r\n\r\nthe  schools,  e.g., the School Cadet Corps.  These\r\n\r\ngroups  have done some military training and gained\r\n\r\nsome knowledge of the use of military equipment. In\r\n\r\nview  of  this, it is not impossible  to  introduce\r\n\r\nsome changes in our national service regulations on\r\n\r\nthe  lines suggested. At the same time, we can also\r\n\r\nsolve the problem of the shortage of highly skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower  and technical personnel which has  arisen\r\n\r\nas  a result of national service. A great number of\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel  have  been  called   up   for\r\n\r\nnational   service.  This  shortage  of   technical\r\n\r\npersonnel  is hampering our efforts to develop  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  If we can build up our defence forces  on\r\n\r\nthe  lines suggested, we can perhaps reduce the sum\r\n\r\nprovided for defence expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, in order to meet the situation\r\n\r\nbrought  about by the accelerated British  military\r\n\r\nwithdrawal, national service was implemented  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of course. But we have reached a saturation\r\n\r\npoint  in this respect. Perhaps we should introduce\r\n\r\nsome changes in our national service regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring another matter to the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Minister for Defence.  Under  the\r\n\r\npresent national service regulations, every citizen\r\n\r\non  reaching 21 years of age will have to report to\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang Manpower Base for registration. May  I\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether or not it is true that  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of  rich  men's  sons  have   been\r\n\r\nexempted  from national service? I have heard  some\r\n\r\npeople  say  that the sons of poor people  have  to\r\n\r\nundergo national service and that the sons of  rich\r\n\r\npeople  can  escape it. We should treat all  people\r\n\r\nalike. We should perhaps make a public announcement\r\n\r\nthat that is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment. If Mr Speaker thinks that the topic on\r\n\r\nimmigration  can  be postponed  until  we  come  to\r\n\r\ndebate  it, then I will wait. But I am afraid  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the time comes, there will not be enough time\r\n\r\nto discuss it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were talking on education, I had many\r\n\r\npoints  to raise, but I had gone through only  half\r\n\r\nof  my  questions  when the Moment of  interruption\r\n\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member should wait until we come to the\r\n\r\ndebate on immigration before speaking on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will then wait until we come to the debate on\r\n\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I wish to ask the Minister is\r\n\r\nthis.  When the Japanese invaded Singapore, a great\r\n\r\nnumber  of our people bravely undertook the defence\r\n\r\nof  our country and some sacrificed their lives. At\r\n\r\nthat  time they joined what was known as the  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  Corps.  Many of them were  killed  by  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  in  the course of defending our  country,\r\n\r\nleaving  behind them widows and orphans  and  other\r\n\r\ndependants. All the dependants of the victims  were\r\n\r\ncompensated according to the regulations in  force.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has all this time  been  paying  a\r\n\r\nfixed rate of allowances to the widows and orphans.\r\n\r\nI  wish to ask a question which was also brought up\r\n\r\nin  this  House last week but not pursued in  great\r\n\r\ndetail. I wish to talk on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis matter in greater detail now. These dependants\r\n\r\nwere to receive their allowances on the 27th day of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  calendar month preceding the  Chinese\r\n\r\nNew  Year. At that time traffic congestion  was  at\r\n\r\nits  worst.  As  usual, these people  went  to  the\r\n\r\nsecond floor of Fullerton Building to collect their\r\n\r\nallowances.  The staff there told  them  that  from\r\n\r\nthen onwards their allowances were to be cut almost\r\n\r\nin  half.  For example, if they were receiving  $45\r\n\r\nbefore, they would receive only $19.50 on that day.\r\n\r\nThey  did  not tell the dependants when to  collect\r\n\r\nthe  balance of the money. They only told  them  to\r\n\r\ncollect it at the Ministry of Defence. Some of them\r\n\r\nthen went to the M.I.D., the same afternoon. When they\r\n\r\nreached the M.I.D., it was almost closing time. The\r\n\r\nstaff there told them that they could not make  any\r\n\r\npayment  as it was closing time and requested  them\r\n\r\nto  come again the following day. The following day\r\n\r\nwas   the   28th  day,  according  to  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncalendar,  and the traffic congestion was terrible.\r\n\r\nThese people had to pay about $3 in taxi fare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under Standing Order 43, paragraph\r\n\r\n(8) (a), the Member has already had her 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad that you have\r\n\r\nallowed me to speak, because I wish to touch on the\r\n\r\nquestion of national service. Sir, we all know that\r\n\r\nin  1971,  the  British will be  withdrawing  their\r\n\r\narmed   forces   east  of  Suez,  including   those\r\n\r\nstationed  in Singapore. Therefore, the defence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be our responsibility. In  building\r\n\r\nup  our  defences, our Government has  started  its\r\n\r\nplanning  and  implementation of national  service.\r\n\r\nThis  is,  of  course, beyond  our  criticism.  The\r\n\r\nconcept   of  national  service  has  now  received\r\n\r\nwidespread  support of the majority of our  people.\r\n\r\nBut   we  must  be  cautious  in  implementing  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  details so that our progress  in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding is not affected. We must also ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of our people is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffected. If we can bear in mind these points  when\r\n\r\nimplementing the policy, then I am sure the  people\r\n\r\nwill be willing to go through all sorts of hardship\r\n\r\nand suffering for the sake of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Minister for Defence announced that\r\n\r\nstudents    who   have   completed   pre-university\r\n\r\neducation  and who are 18 years old  will  have  to\r\n\r\nregister  for  national service and  will  have  to\r\n\r\nundergo  national service for three years. I  would\r\n\r\nlike to know whether careful consideration has been\r\n\r\ngiven to the implementation of this policy. I think\r\n\r\nhasty  implementation will  lead  to  a  number  of\r\n\r\nundesirable  consequences. In the first  place,  it\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  bad effect on the education  of  our\r\n\r\nyouths.  Although  the  education  policy  of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment   now  places  emphasis   on   technical\r\n\r\neducation,  we  should  not  overlook  the  general\r\n\r\neducation  policy  of our country,  i.e.,  primary,\r\n\r\nsecondary  and tertiary education. Furthermore,  if\r\n\r\nall  H.S.C. holders are conscripted, the  enrolment\r\n\r\nat  our  institutions of higher  learning  will  be\r\n\r\ndrastically   reduced.  And  as  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang  has  mentioned, these institutions  will\r\n\r\nhave only female students. In Singapore, university\r\n\r\neducation  is  quite a common affair. Every  parent\r\n\r\nwould  like  his or her boy to receive a university\r\n\r\neducation.  Our  country,  which  depends  on   the\r\n\r\nutilisation of human resources, should try to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the talents of our youths. If we  make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for  all  H.S.C. holders  to   undergo\r\n\r\nnational  service for three years and if  they  are\r\n\r\nadmitted  to  the Universities after  this  period,\r\n\r\nthey  will have forgotten a great deal of what they\r\n\r\nhave learnt in school unless the M.I.D. can arrange\r\n\r\nfor  them to attend academic courses when they  are\r\n\r\nundergoing national service. It is only in this way\r\n\r\nthat  the  general education policy of our  country\r\n\r\nwill not be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five institutions of higher learning in\r\n\r\nour country which have trained and educated many of\r\n\r\nour citizens over the decades. If we implement this\r\n\r\nnew  regulation, then these institutions will  find\r\n\r\nthat  their enrolment will be reduced. And in  time\r\n\r\nto come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will find that the professional people who  are\r\n\r\nrequired  by  our  country  will  be  predominantly\r\n\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the adverse effect on the\r\n\r\nphysique  and minds of the students. We  know  that\r\n\r\npre-university students at the most  are  about  18\r\n\r\nyears  old.  Some  of them are not fully  developed\r\n\r\nphysically  and are immature. With  only  a  Higher\r\n\r\nSchool  Certificate, it is difficult  for  them  to\r\n\r\ncompete  in  our society which is full of  talented\r\n\r\nand  capable  people. If they cannot  pursue  their\r\n\r\nuniversity education, then our country will lose  a\r\n\r\nlot  of talent. Therefore, I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nreconsider  the  policy to conscript pre-university\r\n\r\nstudents.  Personally, I feel  that  pre-university\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are  not going for  further  studies\r\n\r\nshould  be enlisted. However, if they achieve  good\r\n\r\nresults    in   the   Higher   School   Certificate\r\n\r\nexaminations  and if they want  to  go  on  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversities,  the  M.I.D, should  defer  enlisting\r\n\r\nthem   until  such  time  as  they  complete  their\r\n\r\nuniversity  education. In this way,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nbetter qualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Defence made a\r\n\r\npress  statement on 24th January this year  on  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  enlisting our youths who have completed\r\n\r\ntheir Higher School Certificate education for full-time national service if they are above the age  of\r\n\r\n18  years.  This is not a wise move from the  socio\r\n\r\neconomic  and  academic points  of  view.  If  this\r\n\r\npolicy of enlistment is implemented, it will create\r\n\r\na   very   serious  gap  of  discontinuity  between\r\n\r\nsecondary  and university education.  Further,  the\r\n\r\npace  of industrialisation and economic development\r\n\r\nof  our  Republic will be slowed down for  lack  of\r\n\r\ngraduates  and  professionals to man the  essential\r\n\r\nposts  in the various fields. Sir, we must remember\r\n\r\nthat only a small percentage of our youths who have\r\n\r\ncompleted pre-university education are accepted for\r\n\r\nadmission into our institutions of higher learning.\r\n\r\nIf  we  introduce  full-time  national  service  in\r\n\r\nbetween pre-university and university education and\r\n\r\nagainst the will of the pre-university boys who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  keen on higher studies, it is likely to  cause\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction among them and their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, after two or three years' full-time\r\n\r\nnational  service,  our  boys  will  find  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult,  if  not impossible, to  continue  their\r\n\r\nstudies  in  the  institutions of higher  learning.\r\n\r\nFurther,  this new policy of enlistment can  dampen\r\n\r\nthe  secondary school boys' spirit and interest  in\r\n\r\nstudy,  because they know very well that they  will\r\n\r\nbe  called  up  upon the completion of  their  pre-university education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new policy also appears to be incompatible\r\n\r\nwith our drive for greater economic growth for\r\n\r\nwhich we require more and more qualified personnel\r\n\r\nin the various fields. What is more important is\r\n\r\nthat if our supply of professionals cannot keep up\r\n\r\nwith the increasing demand, we may have to turn to\r\n\r\nforeign countries for our needs. This is happening\r\n\r\nnow and we certainly do not wish to see the\r\n\r\nsituation worsen. I contend that the new policy of\r\n\r\nenlistment of Higher School Certificate holders is\r\n\r\nnot consistent with our present policy of self-reliance and will prove to be detrimental to the\r\n\r\neconomy of our country in the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Defence said in his press\r\n\r\nstatement  that  arrangements  would  be  made  for\r\n\r\nH.S.C. holders  to attend academic courses  during\r\n\r\ntheir  full-time national service. He further  said\r\n\r\nthat  there  would  be plans  for  those  who  have\r\n\r\nattained  commissioned  officers'  rank,  and  have\r\n\r\nachieved  good results in the academic courses  provided  by  the Singapore Armed Forces during  their\r\n\r\nthree  years  of training, to be considered  for  a\r\n\r\ncredit  of  one  academic year  in  their  accepted\r\n\r\ncourse  of  study. This, of course, is a very  very\r\n\r\ngood  arrangement,  but  I  doubt  whether  it   is\r\n\r\npractical to implement. Sir, military training is a\r\n\r\nfull-time  course by itself and the  trainees  will\r\n\r\nfind  little  time for study after  long  hours  of\r\n\r\nusually strenuous physical training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, probably you are aware that in some\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries  there is  a  military  academy\r\n\r\nwhich  offers its graduates commissioned  officers'\r\n\r\nrank  as  well  as  academic degrees,  usually  the\r\n\r\nBachelor of Science degree. Until we can afford  to\r\n\r\nhave  such  a  military  academy,  we  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied with our own system of national  service.\r\n\r\nIf we do have such a military academy, I am sure it\r\n\r\nneeds  no  compulsion at all to call our youths  to\r\n\r\njoin  the  academy for their military  training  as\r\n\r\nwell  as for academic degrees. But, for the moment,\r\n\r\nlet us not deprive the universities of the cream of\r\n\r\nour youths who are so badly needed for the training\r\n\r\nof  qualified  personnel for our country.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  urge  the Minister for  Defence  not  to\r\n\r\nimplement the new policy of enlisting Higher School\r\n\r\nCertificate holders for full-time national  service\r\n\r\nuntil   they   have   completed  their   university\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend to speak, but\r\n\r\nas  this is a matter touching on defence, which  is\r\n\r\nextremely  important, I have to vent  my  feelings.\r\n\r\nYesterday  I  said that because defence expenditure\r\n\r\nis  too great - of course, I am not objecting  to\r\n\r\nthe  provision  for national defence  -  we  should\r\n\r\nthink  of  some  better methods  to  reduce  it.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that national service should start  in  our\r\n\r\nschools.  Why  should  the  Minister  for   Defence\r\n\r\nconscript youths after they leave school?  This  is\r\n\r\nnot quite a good method. So we should change it and\r\n\r\narrange  for national service for boys  while  they\r\n\r\nare  at school. In other words, give them some sort\r\n\r\nof  military training while they are in school.  In\r\n\r\nthis way, we can save a lot of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a small country, and we are a member of a\r\n\r\nfive-nation defence pact. I am against  this  five-nation defence pact. What kind of strength will  it\r\n\r\nhave?  I  am  afraid that one day our Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence  may have to be our Commander-in-Chief  and\r\n\r\nlead  the  army in defence of our country.  But  we\r\n\r\nhave only a small army and it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  wiped out in one battle.

This is not  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  situation. What kind of  a  five-nation\r\n\r\ndefence  grouping do we have?

How are you going  to\r\n\r\nhave  a defence exercise if it is held in a foreign\r\n\r\nterritory? People may think that you are  going  to\r\n\r\ninvade their country. The defence exercise is going\r\n\r\nto be held on the 1st of April.

Britain and Australia will ask us to be  the\r\n\r\nvanguard  and  they  will  just  queue  up  behind.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will be the first to be killed.  When\r\n\r\nthat  happens, what will happen to our country?  Is\r\n\r\nour  Minister  for Defence willing  to  become  our\r\n\r\nCommander-in-Chief?

If  not,\r\n\r\nlet us abandon\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to take up\r\n\r\nthe   three   points  raised  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang.  The  first  is a question.  He  wonders\r\n\r\nwhether  national  service will  affect  industrial\r\n\r\nprogress.  I  think it must be made very  clear  to\r\n\r\nMembers that the shortage in skilled manpower would\r\n\r\nstill  exist if we had not started building up  the\r\n\r\narmed  forces. I agree that national  service  does\r\n\r\naggravate  the shortage, but it is only  temporary.\r\n\r\nThe   effect  that  national  service  has  on  the\r\n\r\nshortage of skilled labour is very slight,  because\r\n\r\na  man will be doing national service for only  two\r\n\r\nor  three  years, depending upon whether he  is  an\r\n\r\nofficer or a private. At the end of his national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice,   he  will  be  discharged  with   skills\r\n\r\nacquired in the armed forces. In other words, he is\r\n\r\navailable  to  the labour market.  Therefore,  what\r\n\r\nnational  service  has done is to  withhold  labour\r\n\r\nfrom  the  labour market for a period of  only  two\r\n\r\nyears  or  three years. It is a temporary  shortage\r\n\r\nand the effect is not, as the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nimplies,  an  adverse one. In fact, it is  possible\r\n\r\nthat when a Singapore citizen is conscripted at  18\r\n\r\nyears  of age for national service, he has no skill\r\n\r\nat  all.  He  will  acquire some skill  during  his\r\n\r\ntraining.  In other words, he is being trained,  so\r\n\r\nthat  by  the  time he is discharged from  national\r\n\r\nservice,  he  will be a semi-skilled or  a  skilled\r\n\r\nworker.  I  think this point must be made perfectly\r\n\r\nclear  - that the shortage of skilled labour  would\r\n\r\nhave been there even if we had no conscription. The\r\n\r\nshortage, on account of national service,  is  only\r\n\r\ntemporary.   It  is  a  delay, in  making   labour\r\n\r\navailable  to  the private sector. I hope  this  is\r\n\r\nclear to Back-benchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Sembawang must realise\r\n\r\nthat    the    success   we   have   achieved    in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, apart from other factors  -  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  that  we  have  built,   the   good\r\n\r\ninvestment  climate, the skills and energy  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  -  is  also due to the fact  that  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding up our own defence. We are becoming  self-reliant. We are taking steps to make ourselves self-\r\n\r\nreliant, but I would not say that, by ourselves, we\r\n\r\nwould be in a position to defend ourselves. I would\r\n\r\nsay  that  we are taking steps, and because  it  is\r\n\r\nseen  and  known that we are taking steps,  we  are\r\n\r\ncontributing  towards the security of this  region.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  not all in  vain  that  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding up our armed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second proposition of the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  is  that we should consider conscripting\r\n\r\nthe  fair sex. I did say that we would consider it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I have considered it. I am a bit surprised\r\n\r\nthat the usually gallant Member for Sembawang feels\r\n\r\nthat  women  should not play a more important  role\r\n\r\nthan   they  are  playing  in  Parliament.  If   he\r\n\r\nsubscribes to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciple that there should be equality between men\r\n\r\nand  women, I think he should welcome the fair sex\r\n\r\nhere.  If they have the capacity and ability, there\r\n\r\nis  no  reason  why this Parliament should  not  be\r\n\r\ndominated by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says conscription of the males would give the\r\n\r\nfemales  certain advantages. I do not believe  this\r\n\r\nis so, because there are many other jobs for males.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as I can see, nature ordains that  certain\r\n\r\njobs are best done by females and there are certain\r\n\r\njobs  best done by males. In other words, by virtue\r\n\r\nof their sex, there is already an ordained role for\r\n\r\neach  sex,  and there are certain jobs which  women\r\n\r\ncannot do as well as men, no matter how loudly they\r\n\r\nprotest that they are equal! Therefore, the absence\r\n\r\nin  certain  areas of work of the males  for  three\r\n\r\nyears  will not in any way give women an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  also  says that if  we  conscript  the\r\n\r\nmales,  then  in  certain jobs the  women  will  be\r\n\r\nahead. They have the advantage of an earlier start.\r\n\r\nI  do not think he has taken into consideration the\r\n\r\nfact that some time in the lives of women they  get\r\n\r\nmarried,  give birth, and rear children. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that they are females and do give  birth\r\n\r\ndoes  have  an  in-built  disadvantage  as  regards\r\n\r\ncompeting with men in work. So I do not think  that\r\n\r\nthe  conscription of men into national service does\r\n\r\ngive women any advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also asked whether the\r\n\r\nImmigration  (Amendment) Bill has had any  results.\r\n\r\nWe have not implemented this Bill yet because it is\r\n\r\nawaiting  the President's Assent, and therefore  it\r\n\r\nis  too  early for me to forecast what the  results\r\n\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Delta; I think there is\r\n\r\na  misconception in what she said about our role in\r\n\r\ndefence  when the British leave. We can  never,  by\r\n\r\nany  stretch  of the imagination, fill  the  vacuum\r\n\r\nleft by the accelerated British withdrawal. On  our\r\n\r\nown,  we  can never play the role which the British\r\n\r\nhas played here. From the numerical and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial points of view, it is impossible  for  us\r\n\r\nto  fill  that vacuum. The sooner we realise  that,\r\n\r\nthe better it is for us. We hope we will be able to\r\n\r\ncontribute together with those nations of like mind\r\n\r\nin  this  area,  towards preserving the  peace  and\r\n\r\nstability  which all of us desire. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta  suggests  that we can start  training  young\r\n\r\nstudents  in  school. It is not  possible  because,\r\n\r\nfirst  and foremost, they are too young. Physically\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  be  able  to  stand  the  rigorous\r\n\r\ntraining  that  is  required in our  armed  forces.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  as  I  have so often repeated,  time  is\r\n\r\nneeded  to  train  an effective  army.  The  Member\r\n\r\nreminds us of the heroes who sacrificed their lives\r\n\r\nduring  the Japanese invasion. Here is an excellent\r\n\r\nexample  of people who went to war partly  trained.\r\n\r\nThey were annihilated in no time. We would not like\r\n\r\nto  be  placed in such a position if and  when  the\r\n\r\noccasion  arises. It is my duty and  responsibility\r\n\r\nto  see  that all those who go through training  in\r\n\r\nthe  armed forces have the capacity and ability  to\r\n\r\ndefend Singapore if the time comes. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nMember's  proposition that we should give  military\r\n\r\ntraining to school children is out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan says that we will save\r\n\r\nmoney  by  giving military training to children  in\r\n\r\nschool.  I do not understand how that can be  done.\r\n\r\nFor the information of Members, the money spent  is\r\n\r\nnot  so much on training as on the weapons that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to buy. That takes up most of the money spent\r\n\r\nin the M.I.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I correct the Member for Delta on this point?\r\n\r\nAll Singapore male citizens on attaining the age of\r\n\r\n18  and  not 21 years have to report to the Central\r\n\r\nManpower  Base  for national service.  As  for  her\r\n\r\nallegation that the sons of rich people  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to get away with national service. I say that\r\n\r\nis  utter  rubbish. I would like to know  who  they\r\n\r\nare.  I  have heard of this, and have asked  people\r\n\r\nwho  mentioned it, to me, \"Give me their names, and\r\n\r\nI will find out how they escaped the dragnet.\" This\r\n\r\nallegation is utter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrubbish,  because  it is our  policy  to  see  that\r\n\r\neveryone is treated equally, regardless of  whether\r\n\r\nthe  boy's father is a multi-millionaire or a  poor\r\n\r\nman.  It is essential for the success of our scheme\r\n\r\nthat no one is treated differently from the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to her unfinished comment on the trouble\r\n\r\nin  paying  pensioners,  which  arose  out  of  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  the office concerned,  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  her that this was largely because not  enough\r\n\r\nforethought  was  given  by  the  officers  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   The  change  took  place   at   a   very\r\n\r\nunfortunate  period, i.e., just before the  Chinese\r\n\r\nNew  Year.  This is an eye-opener  to  some  of  my\r\n\r\nofficers,  and  they will now  have  to  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  certain factors which normally  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  take into consideration. This will  make\r\n\r\nthem  more careful in future when implementing  any\r\n\r\nchange of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter raised by the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar, I say that this is a very old story. We must\r\n\r\nunderstand  that because we are now an  independent\r\n\r\ncountry,  the  present generation  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  be  resigned  to the fact and  they  must  be\r\n\r\nwilling,  and must understand - that they  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  part of their lives in training  for  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of their country. Once that is understood,\r\n\r\nonce  that is expected of them, a Singaporean  will\r\n\r\nfeel  proud  that he has the opportunity  that  was\r\n\r\ndenied  to  earlier  generations  to  protect   and\r\n\r\nshoulder  arms  for his country. By then  all  this\r\n\r\nlittle  talk  about inconvenience or hardship  will\r\n\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> This point must be understood: if you want to be\r\n\r\na  worthwhile Singaporean, and if you  want  to  be\r\n\r\nproud of your country, it is time you accepted  the\r\n\r\nfact that you have to assign a portion of your life\r\n\r\nto  the  defence of your country. We  have  thought\r\n\r\nvery long over this question: what is the best time\r\n\r\nto  call  up these people? We have had conscription\r\n\r\nfor   slightly  more  than  two  years.  From   our\r\n\r\nexperience and from the experience of those whom we\r\n\r\nknow, we find that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage  of  18  is  the  best age  to  conscript  our\r\n\r\nyouths.  This is the time when we can inculcate  in\r\n\r\nthem   a   sense   of   loyalty,  leadership,   and\r\n\r\ndedication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have drafted graduates from the Universities\r\n\r\ntoo,  but  the amount of trouble that we  had  from\r\n\r\nthem is not commensurate with their number. When we\r\n\r\nfirst  conscripted  them  sometime  in  1968,   the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce sent a  deputation  to\r\n\r\nsee me to give reasons why the graduates should not\r\n\r\nbe  conscripted. As a counter to their argument,  I\r\n\r\nasked,   \"When   do  you  think  they   should   be\r\n\r\nconscripted?\" They said, \"Eighteen years  of  age.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  18  is  the  age when they pass  their  Higher\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate. So when I made the announcement\r\n\r\nsome time ago that we would conscript youths at  18\r\n\r\nyears  of  age, there was a hue and cry  from  this\r\n\r\ngroup.  And I said, \"Give me your reasons why  they\r\n\r\nshould not be conscripted.\" But up till today  they\r\n\r\nhave  neither come to see me nor have they sent  in\r\n\r\nanything  in  writing.  And  I  am  still  waiting.\r\n\r\nBecause if they did come to me, what they could say\r\n\r\nwould  be  contrary to what they had  said  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place. So there you are - a portion  of  the\r\n\r\ntime  of the young male citizens of Singapore  must\r\n\r\nbe  spent in serving the country and to be  trained\r\n\r\nfor  service to the country. It is up  to  us,  who\r\n\r\nhave worked and thought long over this question, to\r\n\r\ndecide what is the best age for national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the allegation that, after\r\n\r\nnational service of three years when they enrol for\r\n\r\nthe  University  they will forget  what  they  have\r\n\r\nlearnt before. That is utter rubbish too. There are\r\n\r\na  large  number of people including  some  Members\r\n\r\nhere,  who have had their education interrupted  by\r\n\r\nthe war. And we are not the only ones; millions  of\r\n\r\npeople  in other countries have had their education\r\n\r\ninterrupted  by the Second World War.  Yet  because\r\n\r\nthey  had  the will to pursue higher studies,  they\r\n\r\nmanaged  to graduate from the University. Half  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  members  here  have  had  their  education\r\n\r\ninterrupted by the war. In fact, I would  say  that\r\n\r\nafter two or three years in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narmy, our boys will be more mature, more sober  and\r\n\r\nmuch  steadier  when they join the University,  and\r\n\r\nthe  University  will be a much  better  place  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the argument that the University will be\r\n\r\nempty  -  I  do not like to use the word  \"rubbish\"\r\n\r\nagain, but I am afraid I cannot find a better  word\r\n\r\nto describe this nonsense - I think the Members who\r\n\r\nadvance this argument have not read what I said.  I\r\n\r\nsaid that among the 18-year olds, those who can win\r\n\r\nscholarships  will  be allowed  to  continue  their\r\n\r\nstudies  in  the University. And among  the  H.S.C.\r\n\r\nstudents  there is quite a large number - about  700\r\n\r\nto  800 - who will not have attained the age of  18\r\n\r\nyears when they pass the H.S.C. These students will\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to go into the University to  continue\r\n\r\ntheir  studies. So your Universities  will  not  be\r\n\r\nempty, but will be filled with them. Moreover,  the\r\n\r\nholding  back  of these 18-year olds  in  the  pre-University classes for higher studies will be  only\r\n\r\nfor  three  years, after which they will  come  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  armed forces. All this misconception  of\r\n\r\nnational service has arisen largely because it  has\r\n\r\njust  been  implemented. There must be a  time  for\r\n\r\nthese boys to fulfil their obligations, after which\r\n\r\nthey  will be churned out in the usual way. So,  in\r\n\r\nactual fact, everything considered, there is only a\r\n\r\nwithholding of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who join the University at the age of\r\n\r\n18  or  those who have the option to join  after  a\r\n\r\nperiod of time because they have passed their  pre-University examination before reaching the  age  of\r\n\r\n18,  national  service  and service  in  the  armed\r\n\r\nforces   is  a  new  obligation.  But  after   this\r\n\r\nexperience,  I can guarantee Members that  in  five\r\n\r\nyears'  time,  they  will say, \"We  wished  we  had\r\n\r\njoined  the Armed Forces at the age of 18 and  then\r\n\r\nproceeded on to the University.\" Mark my  words!  I\r\n\r\nmay not be here in five to ten years' time, but the\r\n\r\nmajority of you will be here to witness it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that partly also answers the queries\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Mountbatten. I did mention\r\n\r\nthe word\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"self-reliance\", but I do not know how he  took  it\r\n\r\nto  mean.  To me, self-reliance means you  rely  on\r\n\r\nyour  own self for everything. We have got to  rely\r\n\r\non our own selves for the defence of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether it is possible to give\r\n\r\nacademic  tuition to pre-University students  while\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing their national service  for  three\r\n\r\nyears  is being gone into by the staff of both  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Science and Technology and my Ministry.\r\n\r\nI  think there is a possibility of doing it, and we\r\n\r\nare  exploring every available avenue to give  pre-University   national  servicemen  some   sort   of\r\n\r\nacademic  training so that they can qualify  for  a\r\n\r\nyear's credit when they join the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Ulu Pandan, his argument on\r\n\r\nour defence capability is fantastic. I am not proud\r\n\r\nof  him,  either  as a Singapore citizen  or  as  a\r\n\r\nMember  of Parliament. What he has suggested  is  a\r\n\r\ncowardly  way out - that because we are too  small,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we cannot stand up against  anybody.  I\r\n\r\nsay  this:  if we have the determination,  we  will\r\n\r\nstand  up  against  the  biggest  country  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.
