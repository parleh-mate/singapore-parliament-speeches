Govindaswamy  and Lai Tha Chai.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government announced that all\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, including employees of  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and aided school teachers, clerical  staff\r\n\r\nand servants could opt for a reduced medical leave\r\n\r\nand   in   return  compensated  with  a   monetary\r\n\r\nallowance or Leave Allow-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nance, everyone was very happy. The civil servants\r\n\r\nwere paid their allowance last year, whereas the\r\n\r\nteachers were paid only at the beginning of this\r\n\r\nyear. It is immaterial as to whether the allowance\r\n\r\nwas actually paid out earlier or later. But what\r\n\r\nis unreasonable and unfair is that the conversion\r\n\r\nto leave allowance for teachers and other teaching\r\n\r\nstaff was back-dated to the 1st of November last\r\n\r\nyear, whereas that for the other civil servants\r\n\r\nwas back-dated to the 1st of January, 1973. We\r\n\r\nknow that the salaries of civil servants in the\r\n\r\nvarious grades vary according to their\r\n\r\nqualifications and experience. Hence, there are\r\n\r\nsalary scales for general Pass degree holders,\r\n\r\nprofessionals and non-professionals, skilled\r\n\r\nworkers and non-skilled workers. There are\r\n\r\ndifferent salary scales for different\r\n\r\nqualifications, and we have no quarrel about this.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the payment of an extra allowance\r\n\r\nwhich is given more or less for the same reason,\r\n\r\nthen all of them should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequally treated. There should not be any\r\n\r\ndiscrimination. For example, take the reduced\r\n\r\nmedical leave allowance. All of us have traded our\r\n\r\nsick leave for a certain sum of money as allowance\r\n\r\nin return. It has nothing to do with academic\r\n\r\nqualifications or experience. Why is it that\r\n\r\nteachers had their medical leave allowance back-dated to only the 1st of October, 1973, whereas\r\n\r\ncivil servants were more generously treated as\r\n\r\nthey had their allowance back-dated to the 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1973? What is the rationale behind this?\r\n\r\nTeachers have complained as to why our Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance should treat them differently. They\r\n\r\nwere treated like step-children by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about two weeks ago when we had a debate on\r\n\r\nthe Budget Statement, quite a number of Members\r\n\r\nspoke at length on the subject of personal relief\r\n\r\nfrom income tax. I do not want to dwell on this\r\n\r\nany more, but just to air my views concerning the\r\n\r\nreply given by the Minister on this subject. In\r\n\r\nhis reply the Minister said that he had carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered the question of raising the amount of\r\n\r\npersonal relief from income tax, but he said that\r\n\r\nif the request was acceded to, it would lead to\r\n\r\nincreased expenditure in the other sectors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he was of the opinion that it was not\r\n\r\nfeasible at this stage to increase the amount of\r\n\r\npersonal relief. The fact that the Minister had\r\n\r\nnow re-assessed this subject shows that the amount\r\n\r\nof personal relief, which was fixed about 20 years\r\n\r\nago, is already out of date and inappropriate in\r\n\r\nthe light of present developments and inflationary\r\n\r\ntrends. If the amount of personal relief is\r\n\r\nincreased, it would result in the reduction of\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to ask the Minister is\r\n\r\nwhether he has considered the possibility of\r\n\r\ngetting those who are able and those who are well-off to bear the burden of taxation. We all know\r\n\r\nthat the general run of wage earners is that they\r\n\r\nare living in difficulties. Their incomes are\r\n\r\nsmall and therefore it is not reasonable to tax\r\n\r\nthem any further. The employers submit the annual\r\n\r\nreturns on the incomes of their employees.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is impossible for them to evade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany payment of taxes. On the other hand, the\r\n\r\nbusiness houses in the private sector could look\r\n\r\nfor loopholes in the Income Tax Act to evade\r\n\r\npayment of taxes. The Minister should plug these\r\n\r\nloopholes and see that there is no evasion of tax\r\n\r\nand should not ask the poor wage earners to pay\r\n\r\nunduly heavy taxes. It can be done unless the\r\n\r\nstaff of the Income Tax Department do not want to\r\n\r\nenforce the relevant provisions of the law. The\r\n\r\nevasion of taxes by businessmen can be stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, your 10 minutes are up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, under\r\n\r\nthis amendment, I just want to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister and commend him for introducing the\r\n\r\nSingapore Allowance for pensioners. However, when\r\n\r\nhe replied to a Question for oral answer on 15th\r\n\r\nMarch, it was pointed out to him that among the\r\n\r\npensioners, those who retired before 1969 had\r\n\r\ntheir pensions computed on the basic wage drawn by\r\n\r\nthem prior to the time of retirement, and that\r\n\r\nthose who retired after 1969 had their pensions\r\n\r\ncalculated on a consolidated wage which included\r\n\r\nthe cost of living allowance. It is, therefore,\r\n\r\nunfair to older pensioners drawing lesser pensions\r\n\r\nthrough no fault of their own. When this point was\r\n\r\nraised a few days ago, the Minister did not reply,\r\n\r\nbut said that it was a separate question\r\n\r\naltogether. The Minister himself being an ex-civil\r\n\r\nservant would appreciate the need for Government\r\n\r\nto look after its old and faithful servants. I\r\n\r\nimplore the Minister to reconsider the case of the\r\n\r\nfew pensioners who retired before 1969 and to pay\r\n\r\nthem pensions computed on their consolidated wage\r\n\r\ninstead of their basic wage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, it has been a\r\n\r\nlong time since chit fund companies were wound up.\r\n\r\nUp to now the public has not been told anything\r\n\r\nabout the results of the winding-up, except for\r\n\r\nthe punishment meted out on the directors. Anxious\r\n\r\ncitizens are waiting to see how much can they\r\n\r\nrecover from their losses. How long have these ex-subscribers got to wait to recover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir losses? At the rate we are going, by the\r\n\r\ntime the payment is made, the amount will be\r\n\r\ndiminished to peanuts. Would the Minister tell us\r\n\r\nwhat action is being taken in this respect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know the present ruling\r\n\r\ngoverning the account of a C.P.F, member who dies\r\n\r\nand who had, on his nomination form, named a\r\n\r\nperson who had since died. Is it true that the\r\n\r\nnomination form of the C.P.F, is similar to a\r\n\r\nwill, and therefore in such a case the family of\r\n\r\nthe deceased nominee could put a claim through the\r\n\r\npublic trustee? Could the Minister enlighten me on\r\n\r\nthis matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic survey of Singapore has been very\r\n\r\nwell planned and written. Figures quoted in the\r\n\r\nannual Budget Statement are apt and they really\r\n\r\nshow the precise situation. I note that the \"oil\r\n\r\ncrisis\" and the consequent economic slow-down in\r\n\r\nthe industrial countries, world-wide inflation,\r\n\r\ninternational trade and the international monetary\r\n\r\nsystem have affected our otherwise booming\r\n\r\neconomy. It is indeed sad to note this fact.\r\n\r\nHowever, much credit goes to the planning of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to off-set these ills and to rectify\r\n\r\ndeficiencies wherever they exist because of these\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil crisis, or what could be termed as our\r\n\r\nown oil financial crisis, is going to be a\r\n\r\npermanent feature of Singapore's life. Anyone who\r\n\r\nbelieves that the oil-producing countries are\r\n\r\ngoing to lower their oil prices to the pre-October\r\n\r\nlevel is living in a fool's paradise. As such, it\r\n\r\nis time we introduced legislation not only to\r\n\r\nconserve our oil supplies, but also to make sure\r\n\r\nthat our foreign exchange is not drained out by\r\n\r\nbuying oil at prohibitive prices. May I ask what\r\n\r\nmeasures have been taken to make sure that\r\n\r\nshopping complexes, business houses and hotels\r\n\r\nreduce their lighting to the barest minimum? Up to-date what other measures has the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\ntaken to deal with this energy crisis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the question of reducing wastage is an\r\n\r\nimportant one. Government should revamp and revive\r\n\r\nall the special campaigns that it used to have\r\n\r\nsome time back. The TV and radio should increase\r\n\r\nthe number of warnings on the conservation of\r\n\r\nenergy and \"save more\" campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget proper, we welcome the statement\r\n\r\nrequiring all Ministries and Departments to cut\r\n\r\ndown wastage and unnecessary expenditures. These\r\n\r\nare two very important aspects of our economic\r\n\r\nlife. The Minister also stated that there is no\r\n\r\nlet-up in the implementation of desirable\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes and projects. I would like\r\n\r\nto know how these proposals are going to be\r\n\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is now publicity in the press and\r\n\r\non the air about inflation, something concrete\r\n\r\nmust be done if our lower and middle income group\r\n\r\ncitizens are to survive. Prices of essential\r\n\r\ncommodities have risen by about 200-300 per cent.\r\n\r\nPrices are still rising. Every day a new price is\r\n\r\nquoted by the shopkeepers and hawkers. When asked,\r\n\r\nsome of them say that the Government has allowed\r\n\r\nthem to raise the prices of goods. Shopkeepers and\r\n\r\nhawkers seem to round up their prices to the\r\n\r\nnearest 5 or 10 cents in any price increase. This\r\n\r\nis because of the lack of I-cent coins. Is there\r\n\r\nany method that can be adopted to prevent the\r\n\r\ncustomers from being cheated because of the hack\r\n\r\nof 1-cent coins? More effective price controls\r\n\r\nmust be substituted. Has the Price Control\r\n\r\nDepartment appointed sufficient inspectors to\r\n\r\ncheck on prices? Shopkeepers and hawkers are\r\n\r\nadopting the \"take it or leave it\" attitude which\r\n\r\nhits the poor below the belt. The people welcome\r\n\r\nstatements followed by action, such as the black-listing of bakeries producing short-weight bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with this there should be more\r\n\r\nNTUC Welcome Supermarkets. These are fast becoming\r\n\r\npopular. The people are heeding the call by the\r\n\r\nTrade Division to boycott shops selling goods at\r\n\r\nexorbitant prices. But there have been cases where\r\n\r\nthe price of an article in the Welcome Supermarket\r\n\r\nwas higher by as much as $2 for the same article\r\n\r\nsold by the shopkeepers outside. A case in point\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis the Thomson Road Market where a tin of cooking\r\n\r\noil was sold for $6 whereas it costs $7.15 at the\r\n\r\nToa Payoh Welcome Supermarket. Why should there be\r\n\r\nsuch a vast difference in price? This will\r\n\r\ndiscourage the consumer from buying at Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\nCan an attempt be made to check the prices in\r\n\r\nWelcome Supermarkets against prices in the other\r\n\r\nshops, so as to make the Supermarket prices\r\n\r\nattractive to customers? This is the time to do\r\n\r\nit, as supermarkets are becoming popular. In this\r\n\r\nway we can easily check profiteering by the\r\n\r\nretailers. I would request the Price Control\r\n\r\nDepartment, CASE and INTRACO to play their very\r\n\r\nimportant role in the control of prices of goods\r\n\r\nin the Welcome Supermarkets, and try to make them\r\n\r\nmore attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, some of the fresh foods like meat,\r\n\r\nfish and vegetables in the markets are as old as\r\n\r\nNoah's Ark. Cannot something be done to have them\r\n\r\nchanged or auctioned to the public, and new stocks\r\n\r\nbrought in? It is better to sell at a cheaper\r\n\r\nprice than to allow them to perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Government has\r\n\r\ntaken the necessary measures, without harming any\r\n\r\nsector of the economy, to diversify the sources of\r\n\r\nour most essential food supplies, and to revive a\r\n\r\nscheme for a rice stockpile. Welcome and SAFE\r\n\r\nSupermarkets should be activated to fight against\r\n\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the tourist boom a decade ago,\r\n\r\nthe Government encouraged people to build hotels.\r\n\r\nWhat has been done to alleviate the plight of\r\n\r\nhotel owners by bringing in more tourists and so\r\n\r\nincrease the occupancy of hotel rooms? Have our\r\n\r\nforeign missions played any significant part in\r\n\r\nthis respect?

What action is the Government taking in\r\n\r\nthis regard? We have, in the past, been\r\n\r\nemphasising on the promotion of our Singapore made\r\n\r\ngoods.

Youth problems of the Republic today are\r\n\r\ndifferent from those of the past. In view of the\r\n\r\nfar-sighted policies of our Government, there is\r\n\r\nan urgent need for an effective youth council to\r\n\r\nbe formed in the Republic, where greater\r\n\r\nparticipation of our youth in more responsible\r\n\r\nactivity can be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested in the past that\r\n\r\ndeserving officers be given merit increments as an\r\n\r\nincentive to work hard.

He wanted to know the\r\n\r\nrationale for this. First of all, I want to make\r\n\r\nit quite clear that there has never been an\r\n\r\nallowance in lieu of medical leave, as such. The\r\n\r\nproposal which Government made to the unions was\r\n\r\nfor the payment of leave allowance in lieu of\r\n\r\nreduced leave. That means reduced vacation leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose and objective of this proposal was\r\n\r\nto solve the growing problem of accumulation of\r\n\r\nvacation leave by employees in the civil service,\r\n\r\nmost of whom have very little likelihood of ever\r\n\r\nbeing able to use up their accumulated leave.\r\n\r\nThere was no such problem with teachers who\r\n\r\nenjoyed a different leave scheme and still enjoy\r\n\r\nit, and who have their own school holidays.\r\n\r\nTeachers were, therefore, excluded from the\r\n\r\nproposal from the beginning. There was, as I said,\r\n\r\nno intention to provide monetary compensation for\r\n\r\nreduction of medical leave alone for any employees\r\n\r\nin the public service. However, in the\r\n\r\nnegotiations with the unions, compensation for\r\n\r\nreduction of medical leave was included as part of\r\n\r\na package settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this settlement, representations were\r\n\r\nalso made by the Education Ministry, by the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Union, and also by the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein (whose services have not apparently been\r\n\r\nentirely appreciated) for the concession of\r\n\r\nmonetary compensation for reduction of medical\r\n\r\nleave alone to be extended to teachers who are\r\n\r\nalso enjoying school holidays. I must stress that\r\n\r\nthis suggestion was not initiated nor desired by\r\n\r\nthe Treasury, and there was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindeed very considerable reluctance of my Ministry\r\n\r\nto accept it. But finally we accepted it with\r\n\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a matter subsequent to and separate\r\n\r\nfrom the proposal for leave allowance in lieu of\r\n\r\nreduced vacation leave, and therefore it was\r\n\r\nthought appropriate that a different effective\r\n\r\ndate for implementation should be used. As the\r\n\r\nscheme for reduced medical leave for teachers was\r\n\r\naccepted by the Teachers' Union sometime in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1973, the effective date was to be 1st\r\n\r\nOctober, 1973, in accordance with the normal\r\n\r\nTreasury practice of adopting the first of the\r\n\r\nmonth following agreement as the date of\r\n\r\nimplementation. In the case of the main scheme for\r\n\r\nthe public service, 1st January, 1973, was adopted\r\n\r\nas the effective date because general agreement on\r\n\r\nthe scheme was reached in September, 1972,\r\n\r\nfollowing consultations between officials of my\r\n\r\nMinistry and those of several trade unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting employees in the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also referred to my\r\n\r\nexplanation, during the debate on the financial\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government, that in considering the\r\n\r\nquestion of giving personal relief I had decided\r\n\r\nthat, other than the tax relief increase for\r\n\r\ndependent parents and grandparents, there should\r\n\r\nbe no concession in the way of personal relief. He\r\n\r\nthought this decision was inappropriate in the\r\n\r\nlight of present developments and that, as the\r\n\r\nrate had been the same for the last 20 years, it\r\n\r\nwas out of date. In this respect, of course, I\r\n\r\nhave to consider not only whether the rate which\r\n\r\nhas obtained over the last 20 years gives the same\r\n\r\nor more revenue, but also whether, in fact, there\r\n\r\nis now very much more expenditure which will have\r\n\r\nto be covered by fresh revenue. So it does mean\r\n\r\nthat if reliefs were given resulting in less\r\n\r\nrevenue, then I would have to consider applying a\r\n\r\ntax in some other way which would make good the\r\n\r\nloss in revenue and which would be sufficient to\r\n\r\ncover the very much greater additional\r\n\r\nexpenditure, since the rate of personal relief was\r\n\r\ndecided 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think a word on the income tax system may\r\n\r\nnot be inappropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere. This system is progressive in its effect,\r\n\r\nthe higher income earner paying a higher rate of\r\n\r\ntax. So from the point of view of imposing\r\n\r\ntaxation, if any method has to be used, this would\r\n\r\nbe as appropriate, if not more appropriate, a\r\n\r\nmethod as any other. The existing reliefs already\r\n\r\nensure that only taxpayers who are in the middle\r\n\r\nand higher income brackets are liable to pay the\r\n\r\ntax. As an example, in 1972 only 126,000 persons,\r\n\r\nor 17 per cent out of a total of 725,000 who were\r\n\r\ngainfully employed, paid any income tax. A\r\n\r\ntaxpayer supporting, say, a wife, two children and\r\n\r\ntwo parents, would therefore be liable to pay tax\r\n\r\nonly if his annual income exceeds $7,000.\r\n\r\nGenerally, therefore, the lower income groups do\r\n\r\nnot pay income tax, and any upward revision of\r\n\r\npersonal relief would benefit only those who can\r\n\r\nafford to make some contribution to Government\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international view of Singapore income\r\n\r\ntaxation is that we are rather generous in our\r\n\r\npersonal reliefs and we would do well to broaden\r\n\r\nthe base of such taxation. In fact, if our\r\n\r\ntaxation were examined further, it may be that\r\n\r\nnext year we shall have to reduce the rate of\r\n\r\npersonal relief rather than increase it.\r\n\r\nPsychologically, it would bring home to the new\r\n\r\ntaxpayers that Government grants, subsidies and\r\n\r\nconcessions, which are being so liberally\r\n\r\nadvocated by Members, can come only out of the\r\n\r\ngenerosity of taxpayers among whom perhaps many of\r\n\r\nthe advocates can be numbered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah asked a question\r\n\r\nregarding the extension of pension benefits to\r\n\r\nofficers who retired before the consolidation of\r\n\r\nsalaries. He would like the present method of\r\n\r\ncomputing pension based on the consolidated salary\r\n\r\nto be also given to those officers who retired\r\n\r\nbefore the setting up of the Salaries Commission.\r\n\r\nI have had representations from pensioners as well\r\n\r\nas the Member for Telok Blangah and I have\r\n\r\nconsidered them, and I will always consider\r\n\r\nrepresentations which are made from time to time.\r\n\r\nBut this is really a very hardy and perennial\r\n\r\nquestion, and I cannot really hold out any hope\r\n\r\nthat Government will extend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe present method of computing pension based on\r\n\r\nconsolidated salary to those officers who retired\r\n\r\nbefore 1-1-69 when pension was computed on the\r\n\r\nbasis of basic salary without taking into account\r\n\r\nthe variable allowances. The exercise to\r\n\r\nconsolidate salaries in 1969 was intended to\r\n\r\nimprove the terms and conditions of service of\r\n\r\nofficers who were then in service, and of others\r\n\r\nwho would be joining the service subsequently. It\r\n\r\nwas not intended to increase the pension of those\r\n\r\npensioners who had already retired from the\r\n\r\nservice before 1969. Officers who retired before\r\n\r\n1969 on non-consolidated salaries are already\r\n\r\nbeing assisted in that they are paid a cost of\r\n\r\nliving allowance and a Singapore allowance if\r\n\r\ntheir pensions are (a) below $257 per month, and\r\n\r\nthey have no dependants, or (b) below $331 per\r\n\r\nmonth, and have dependants to support. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, officers who retired on consolidated\r\n\r\nsalaries are not paid this cost of living\r\n\r\nallowance and Singapore allowance, so that if the\r\n\r\npension for officers who retired before 1969 on\r\n\r\nnon-consolidated salaries were to be recomputed as\r\n\r\nthough they had their salaries consolidated, and\r\n\r\nif they were to give up accordingly the cost of\r\n\r\nliving allowance and Singapore allowance, then\r\n\r\nabout 73 per cent of such pensioners would be\r\n\r\nreceiving less pension. I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah intended to have this\r\n\r\nparticular effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Oh, no!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I come now to the questions of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson. He has touched on a very\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of topics, some of which are\r\n\r\nnot really under my jurisdiction or may only be\r\n\r\npartially so. Nevertheless, I shall try to answer\r\n\r\nhim where I can. First of all, I think he said\r\n\r\nthat the public has not been kept informed of the\r\n\r\nresults of the winding-up of certain chit fund\r\n\r\ncompanies. I think this is incorrect because a\r\n\r\npress release was made on 19th December, 1973,\r\n\r\nannouncing the initial dividend payment for seven\r\n\r\nchit fund companies being wound up by the Official\r\n\r\nReceiver. To-date, five companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave paid dividends. Another two companies\r\n\r\nwill make payments of dividends before the end of\r\n\r\nMay, 1974. The Government is aware that the\r\n\r\nverification of claims for the various chit fund\r\n\r\ncompanies that are wound up since late 1972 has\r\n\r\ntaken considerable time. This is inevitable as the\r\n\r\nprocess of verification depends on the co-operation of the creditors and the substantiation\r\n\r\nof their claims at the Official Receiver's Office.\r\n\r\nUntil each member's account has been verified, it\r\n\r\nis not possible for the Official Receiver to\r\n\r\ndeclare a dividend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also sought some clarification on CPF\r\n\r\nmatters which no doubt my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour, would be better able to answer. But I\r\n\r\nbelieve that when a member of the Fund dies and if\r\n\r\nthe person nominated by him to receive his credit\r\n\r\nbalance had died before the member, the amount\r\n\r\nwill be paid to the public trustee to be disposed\r\n\r\nof in accordance with the law for the time being\r\n\r\nin force. If the nominee of the deceased member\r\n\r\ndies after the demise of the member, the amount\r\n\r\ndue to the nominee will be paid to the estate of\r\n\r\nthe deceased nominee. I hope that clarifies the\r\n\r\npoint raised by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then touched on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's \"Save Energy\" campaign. He must\r\n\r\nalready be aware of the effects of the campaign\r\n\r\nwhich began last November and the result of the\r\n\r\nefforts of the public to restrict consumption of\r\n\r\npetroleum fuel and electricity. We made a list of\r\n\r\nsuggestions to guide the public in the efficient\r\n\r\nuse of fuel and electricity and gave extensive\r\n\r\ncoverage in the local newspapers, radio and\r\n\r\ntelevision to this campaign. During the last few\r\n\r\nmonths, the PUB sent out inspectors all round the\r\n\r\nisland to ensure that there was no unnecessary\r\n\r\nlighting and that advertising lights were switched\r\n\r\noff after 9 p.m. Since the commencement of the\r\n\r\n\"Save Energy\" campaign, the weekly consumption of\r\n\r\nelectricity, as most Members would know, has\r\n\r\ndeclined by an average of 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Essential Supplies Act and the\r\n\r\nRestrictions on the Supply, Distribution and Use\r\n\r\nof Petroleum and Electricity Act enacted last year\r\n\r\ngive the Government legal powers to take action\r\n\r\nagainst any wasteful consumption of energy, as and\r\n\r\nwhen necessary. I think the recent increase in the\r\n\r\ntariff rates for electricity would also act as a\r\n\r\ndeterrent against excessive consumption of fuel\r\n\r\nand electricity. I think the Member also touched\r\n\r\non alternative measures to develop new sources of\r\n\r\nenergy. The PUB is replanning Stage II development\r\n\r\nof Senoko Power Station to incorporate a dual\r\n\r\nfiring system which allows the use of either gas\r\n\r\nor fuel oil. The possibility of burning coal is\r\n\r\nalso being examined. Another possibility, as far\r\n\r\nback as 1971, is that the Government has\r\n\r\nconsidered the introduction of a nuclear-based\r\n\r\npower station in the Republic. Studies involving\r\n\r\nthe siting of a nuclear power station are in\r\n\r\nprogress. Detailed investigations on the\r\n\r\nenvironmental effects of such a plant and the\r\n\r\nnecessity for additional safeguards against\r\n\r\ndangers to nearby areas of high density population\r\n\r\nin Singapore are being carried out with the\r\n\r\nassistance of the International Atomic Energy\r\n\r\nAgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked how we check on\r\n\r\ndevelopment proposals. This is a rather\r\n\r\ncomplicated procedure. Presumably he has in mind\r\n\r\nthe check aimed at ensuring that only desirable\r\n\r\nprojects are allowed to go ahead. Generally, if\r\n\r\nany project falls within the framework of\r\n\r\nGovernment's major policies, it is prima facie a\r\n\r\ndesirable project. My officials examine the\r\n\r\nvarious aspects of the projects, such as their\r\n\r\nscale, location, phasing, alternative aspects to\r\n\r\nachieve the same objectives and so on. When the\r\n\r\nprojects have been properly evaluated, they are\r\n\r\nsubmitted to a Ministerial Committee, called the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Planning Committee, for approval.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the technical details are further\r\n\r\nvetted by the Development Planning Sub-Committee\r\n\r\nto ensure that there is no extravagance in the\r\n\r\nchoice of materials or designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also touched on inflation and\r\n\r\nprice controls. I have already explained in my\r\n\r\nBudget Statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin some detail the action we have taken, and\r\n\r\nI have explained the undesirability of price\r\n\r\ncontrol in general as an anti-inflationary\r\n\r\nmeasure. I have also explained the measures that\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken to dampen the price\r\n\r\nescalation, including action against profiteers\r\n\r\nand the promotion of consumer co-operatives - rather than fixing prices, it is more appropriate\r\n\r\nto disseminate information on prices and stocks to\r\n\r\nconsumers to enable them to differentiate between\r\n\r\nunscrupulous add dependable traders, thereby\r\n\r\nenabling them to protect their own interest. Only\r\n\r\nwhen consumers, armed with this information,\r\n\r\nrefrain from buying from high-priced shops and\r\n\r\nmake selective purchases from shops which sell at\r\n\r\nfair prices can the Government's efforts be\r\n\r\nassured of success. In the long run this is the\r\n\r\nonly way to deal with sellers who round up their\r\n\r\nprices to the next five or ten cents, as\r\n\r\ncomplained by the Member. At the end of 1973,\r\n\r\nthere were 35 million one-cent coins recorded as\r\n\r\nbeing in circulation, and there is really no\r\n\r\nexcuse for sellers not to fix prices to the cent,\r\n\r\nespecially for the lower priced goods where a few\r\n\r\ncents represent a significant percentage of the\r\n\r\nprice. If there is any difficulty in getting one-cent coins, I think the Currency Board is always\r\n\r\nready to issue more coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing machinery in the Department of\r\n\r\nTrade for the dissemination of price and supply\r\n\r\ninformation and the investigation of complaints on\r\n\r\nprofiteering will be consolidated. The Singapore\r\n\r\nManufacturers Association will also be helping in\r\n\r\nthe fight against profiteering by, firstly, doing\r\n\r\ntheir best to print the prices upon their products\r\n\r\nwherever possible and, secondly, keeping the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Trade informed of price increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned that he was aware\r\n\r\nof over-charging by CASE or the Welcome\r\n\r\nSupermarket. Perhaps he should forward his\r\n\r\ninquiries to the Member for Potong Pasir and the\r\n\r\nMember for Boon Teck. However, if I am asked to\r\n\r\nanswer this particular question, I would venture\r\n\r\nto say that for a limited range of goods the\r\n\r\nprices charged in the small retail shops can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccasionally be lower than the prices charged in\r\n\r\nthe NTUC Welcome Supermarket. In the case of\r\n\r\ncooking oil mentioned by the Member for Anson, as\r\n\r\nprices increase some retailers who have stocks\r\n\r\npurchased at the old prices may be able to sell at\r\n\r\nthe old retail prices, while popular organisations\r\n\r\nlike the NTUC Welcome Supermarkets, where the\r\n\r\nturnover is much more rapid, have to pay higher\r\n\r\nprices for new stocks and are, therefore,\r\n\r\ncompelled to charge higher retail prices. In any\r\n\r\ncase, these prices provide a reference to what\r\n\r\ncharges would be fair. The discriminating shopper\r\n\r\nshould, therefore, take advantage of any lower\r\n\r\nprices and buy if he can from shops which sell\r\n\r\nmore cheaply. I do not expect the NTUC Supermarket\r\n\r\nto object to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also spoke on tourist\r\n\r\npromotion. He may recall that in 1973 Singapore\r\n\r\npassed the millionth visitor's mark, and there was\r\n\r\nan increase of 28.9 per cent in the tourist\r\n\r\ntraffic over the previous year. The hotel\r\n\r\noccupancy rate in 1972 was 61 per cent and this\r\n\r\nrose to 67.2 per cent in 1973, despite the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of hotel rooms from 8,358\r\n\r\nin 1972 to 9,413 in 1973. This achievement was\r\n\r\nlargely due to the tourist promotion and publicity\r\n\r\nefforts overseas by the Tourist Promotion Board\r\n\r\nand other bodies such as the Singapore Airlines. A\r\n\r\nmajor portion of the Tourist Promotion Board\r\n\r\nbudget has been expended for this purpose. Our\r\n\r\nforeign missions have always supplemented the\r\n\r\nefforts of the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board\r\n\r\nin promoting Singapore as a tourist centre by the\r\n\r\ndissemination of tourist brochures and\r\n\r\ninformation. However, since tourist promotion is a\r\n\r\nspecialised function, this is done more\r\n\r\nextensively by the overseas offices of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourist Promotion Board which are\r\n\r\nestablished in countries such as the United\r\n\r\nStates, Germany, Japan and Australia, the major\r\n\r\ntourist markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested action for promoting\r\n\r\nsales of locally made goods. The Government has\r\n\r\nalways been conscious of the need for export promotion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Exports Promotion Unit was\r\n\r\ninitially set up in the Economic Development\r\n\r\nDivision to fulfil this function in line with an\r\n\r\nactive trade policy to widen domestic and overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets for manufactured goods. Since 1972 this\r\n\r\nUnit has been transferred to the Department of\r\n\r\nTrade. The Unit maintains a library service to\r\n\r\nprovide both product and area information. A\r\n\r\nnumber of seminars have been organised to help\r\n\r\nmedium and small-sized manufacturers to break into\r\n\r\nthe export market. The Unit through the Commercial\r\n\r\nSecretary stationed in Singapore missions overseas\r\n\r\nalso help traders and manufacturers to get in\r\n\r\ntouch with foreign buyers. At the same time,\r\n\r\nbuyers are actively encouraged to come to\r\n\r\nSingapore. For this purpose the Department of\r\n\r\nTrade maintains a trade register which gives\r\n\r\nrelevant details of firms interested in exporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member concluded his remarks with comments\r\n\r\non staff matters. I am glad that at least one\r\n\r\nMember has remembered the need to give incentives\r\n\r\nto deserving officers. The merit increment scheme\r\n\r\nwas introduced in April, 1973. In June, 1973, a\r\n\r\ntotal of 106 officers were awarded merit\r\n\r\nincrements as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n   88 officers ... 1 increment\r\n\r\n   15 officers ... 2 increments\r\n\r\n   3 officers  ... 3 increments\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, about 30.6 per cent of the officers who were\r\n\r\neligible for consideration under this scheme were\r\n\r\ngiven merit increments. I think that deals with\r\n\r\nthe queries by the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta raised a point on the anti-inflationary monetary policy. I mentioned in my\r\n\r\nBudget Statement that while this anti-inflationary\r\n\r\npolicy would not be relaxed, resources would be\r\n\r\nmade available to facilitate economic growth.\r\n\r\nMembers may wish to know therefore that as a\r\n\r\nresult of the monetary measures implemented\r\n\r\nrecently, the tight liquidity situation in the\r\n\r\ninter-bank money market has eased. Inter-bank\r\n\r\ninterest rates have moved from about 11 per cent\r\n\r\nto a more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasonable level of 9 per cent. With the reduction\r\n\r\nof the special deposit ratio from 5 per cent to\r\n\r\nzero per cent in early March by the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority, a significant sum of $73 million was\r\n\r\nreleased to the banking system to finance\r\n\r\ninvestments and productive activities. It is, of\r\n\r\ncourse, necessary that the funds being released\r\n\r\nare directed towards financing the activities of\r\n\r\nproductive enterprises and not for inflationary\r\n\r\nspending and speculation. The Member for Delta can\r\n\r\ntherefore rest assured that the liquidity\r\n\r\nsituation will not be allowed to inhibit economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think there are two comments and two\r\n\r\ndifferent points of view by the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nand the Member for Potong Pasir. The Member for\r\n\r\nJurong complained that the lifting of the tariff\r\n\r\non frozen chicken has affected the livelihood of\r\n\r\nfarmers. He wants to know whether I will reimpose\r\n\r\nthe tax. The purpose of lifting the tax is to act\r\n\r\nagainst inflation of prices, which we thought had\r\n\r\nperhaps gone too far. And the price of chicken has\r\n\r\nsince come down, and therefore it has to that\r\n\r\nextent achieved our purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir made comments that\r\n\r\nhe hoped that we would lift further taxes in order\r\n\r\nto fight inflation. In every case we consider, of\r\n\r\ncourse, the respective merits of the effect on\r\n\r\ninflation and also the effect on our manufacturers\r\n\r\nas well as our primary producers. And when we\r\n\r\nimpose a tariff, we do so only for very good\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has said in his reply, by way of a\r\n\r\nchallenge, that he might consider the possibility\r\n\r\nof reducing the personal relief for income tax. I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister for Finance this\r\n\r\nquestion. Does he accept the fact that the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the NWC are reasonable? I feel\r\n\r\nthat the answer must be in the affirmative because\r\n\r\nhe has already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccepted the NWC recommendation for the payment of\r\n\r\na $25 special allowance to those whose incomes are\r\n\r\nbelow $1,000. My point is: since the NWC is aware\r\n\r\nof the difficulties of those earning below $1,000\r\n\r\nand even for those who earn as much as $975, then\r\n\r\nif the income of $1,000 is used as a yardstick for\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of a family, it means that the\r\n\r\nfamily will have an income of at least $12,000 per\r\n\r\nannum. Then allowing for deductions for personal\r\n\r\nrelief, reliefs for wife and children, what is the\r\n\r\ntotal amount of relief for a family with an annual\r\n\r\nincome of $12,000? It is my hope that in the next\r\n\r\nfinancial year the Minister for Finance would\r\n\r\nincrease the amount for personal relief instead of\r\n\r\nreducing it. I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Why has there been such a\r\n\r\nphenomenal increase from an appropriation of\r\n\r\n$1,900 for FY 73 to $14,250 for FY 74, more than a\r\n\r\nseven-fold increase? In respect of non-pensionable\r\n\r\nallowances, the increase is almost threefold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similar provisions are also seen for all\r\n\r\nother Ministries, but the increases do not seem\r\n\r\nproportionate, in other words, inconsistent. For\r\n\r\nexample, the CPF/ MPF contribution for the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law and National Development for FY 73\r\n\r\nand FY 74 is almost the same, whereas for the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffairs the CPF/MPF contribution has, in fact,\r\n\r\ndecreased when compared to the previous year. Sir,\r\n\r\nwould the Minister care to clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, there is a fairly simple\r\n\r\nexplanation. Let me deal first with the difference\r\n\r\nin the provision for CPF/MPF contributions. The\r\n\r\nprovision for FY 74 is much larger than that for\r\n\r\nFY 73 because of two factors. First, about 62 per\r\n\r\ncent of the Division III and Division IV officers\r\n\r\nopted to leave the pension scheme to join the CPF\r\n\r\nscheme. Second, the 9 per cent wage supplement\r\n\r\nwhich became payable from July, 1973, involved\r\n\r\nadditional CPF contributions. Both these factors\r\n\r\ncould not be estimated even if they were foreseen\r\n\r\nat the time of preparing the Budget estimates for FY 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for non-pensionable allowances, the provision\r\n\r\nfor  FY  74  is much larger than that  for  FY  73\r\n\r\nbecause  the former includes the 9 per  cent  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement which came into effect from July, 1973.\r\n\r\nAgain   no  fore-knowledge  of  this  factor   was\r\n\r\navailable  at the time of preparing the  estimates\r\n\r\nfor FY 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in respect of these two subheads\r\n\r\nvary   from   subhead   to  subhead   because   of\r\n\r\nestablishment differences. For example, a Ministry\r\n\r\nor department which has a high proportion of super-scale  posts  can  be expected  to  show  a  large\r\n\r\nincrease  in non-pensionable allowances  owing  to\r\n\r\nthe  salary  revision  for  such  posts  in  1973.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a Ministry or department in which  many\r\n\r\nof  the  Divisions III and IV officers have  opted\r\n\r\nout  of the pension scheme for the CPF scheme will\r\n\r\nhave  a  large increase in the provision  for  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Firstly, when  will  the\r\n\r\nJurong Town Hall be ready for occupation, and when\r\n\r\nwill  the  JTC offices move into the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nHall? Will the JTC leave behind an area office  in\r\n\r\nthe  present  neighbourhood when it moves  to  the\r\n\r\nTown Hall? And will it set up area offices in each\r\n\r\nneighbourhood   for   the   convenience   of   the\r\n\r\nresidents? These area offices, in my opinion,  are\r\n\r\na great convenience to the residents of Jurong for\r\n\r\nthe payment of their PUB bills and other charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there have been complaints on the poor\r\n\r\nquality  of  work of the JTC flats.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints are related to wall and ceiling cracks,\r\n\r\nchoking of sewers, failure of the drainage system,\r\n\r\netc.  I  would like to know whether the JTC  would\r\n\r\nexercise    stricter    supervision    over    the\r\n\r\nconstruction of flats to make sure that there  are\r\n\r\nno malpractices by contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, we are aware that the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board maintains its own  markets  and\r\n\r\nhawker  centres within its housing estates.  There\r\n\r\nis  a  Markets and Hawkers Unit to look after  all\r\n\r\nthese matters. I wonder whether the JTC will  also\r\n\r\nset  up its own Markets and Hawkers Division  like\r\n\r\nthe HDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in Sembawang and in other places, the\r\n\r\nJTC  will be setting up satellite towns. When  the\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns are built, will  the  JTC  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  essential facilities such  as  markets,\r\n\r\nshop  houses,  schools  and  other  amenities  are\r\n\r\nprovided  when the flats are ready for occupation?\r\n\r\nIn  this  way,  when the residents move  into  the\r\n\r\nsatellite towns, they will not find that there are\r\n\r\nno facilities for shopping and marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would like the Minister to tell this\r\n\r\nHouse   whether  the  JTC  will  consider   giving\r\n\r\nconcession to Jurong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTown  residents  when  they visit  the  parks  and\r\n\r\ngardens  or  make use of the sports facilities  in\r\n\r\nJurong Town?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, I would like to seek information from\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  whether  the  JTC  will   exercise\r\n\r\nstricter  supervision on the work  of  the  refuse\r\n\r\ncollection  contractor to  ensure  that  there  is\r\n\r\nregular collection of refuse and cleaning  of  the\r\n\r\ngrounds within the precincts of the JTC so  as  to\r\n\r\navoid accumulation of rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, I would like to deal with the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  flats.  There are  now  non-citizens\r\n\r\ntenanting  JTC flats. Some of them  are  asked  to\r\n\r\nquit their present premises and to rent rooms from\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen tenants. In some cases, although\r\n\r\nthe head of the family is not a Singapore citizen,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  his family are Singapore citizens.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the Jurong Town Corporation  will\r\n\r\ngive  sympathetic consideration to those  affected\r\n\r\nfamilies  with  at  least  one  member  who  is  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen to continue occupying the  flat?\r\n\r\nIn  the  case of new applications, will the Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation consider those cases where  only\r\n\r\nthe head of the family is a Singapore citizen,  is\r\n\r\na  worker in Jurong Town, and wishes to settle  in\r\n\r\nJurong  for good? These people who work in  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  are hoping that they will be able to  settle\r\n\r\ndown in Jurong, provided accommodation is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to deal with the question\r\n\r\nof  the  luxury  flats  in  Jurong  Town  for  the\r\n\r\nexecutives. When will such flats be completed, and\r\n\r\nwhen will applications for purchase of these flats\r\n\r\nbe  opened  and  called  for?  What  will  be  the\r\n\r\ncondition  and minimum requirements governing  the\r\n\r\napplication for the purchase of these  flats?  How\r\n\r\nwill these flats be priced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I think I ought to explain\r\n\r\nthat  while  I  am  responsible  for  the  general\r\n\r\nperformance and policy relating to the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation,  I  am  not aware of  the  day-to-day\r\n\r\ndetails  of its operations, nor can I be  expected\r\n\r\nto  go  into them in full detail. Subject to these\r\n\r\ncomments,  I  will  try  my  best  to  answer  the\r\n\r\nquestions which have been raised by the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJurong.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the Jurong Town Corporation  hopes\r\n\r\nto  move its offices to the Jurong Town Hall  next\r\n\r\nmonth. It will maintain an area office in part  of\r\n\r\nits   present  premises  for  the  collection   of\r\n\r\nrentals,  maintenance of flats, and it  will  also\r\n\r\nset    up   similar   area   offices   in    other\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods  that it develops.  The  next  area\r\n\r\noffice  will be set up at Neighbourhood  II,  Boon\r\n\r\nLay Garden in Jurong Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained of poor supervision\r\n\r\nover construction of flats. The JTC, I understand,\r\n\r\ntries to exercise very strict supervision over all\r\n\r\nits   construction  work  through  its   team   of\r\n\r\nengineers, technical officers and particularly the\r\n\r\nclerks-of-works.  If, in fact,  there  are  really\r\n\r\ncases  of  unusually bad workmanship, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong can give the particulars  to  me\r\n\r\nand I will look into this matter further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about JTC setting up a\r\n\r\nHawkers  and Markets Division. The JTC is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  setting  up  a  Hawkers  and  Markets\r\n\r\nDivision to manage all markets and hawker  centres\r\n\r\nin  the  industrial and housing estates under  its\r\n\r\ncontrol.  This will, I assume, include  Sembawang,\r\n\r\nwhich the Member mentioned. This new Division will\r\n\r\nalso control unlicensed hawkers in all JTC areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wanted to know whether the JTC\r\n\r\nwill   ensure  that,  in  planning  and   building\r\n\r\nresidential  premises, other  essential  amenities\r\n\r\nsuch  as  shop  houses, markets  and  schools  are\r\n\r\nprovided at the same time. The answer is that,  in\r\n\r\nthe   planning   and   building   of   residential\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods, the JTC ensures that not only  all\r\n\r\nessential  amenities, such as shops  and  markets,\r\n\r\nare  provided  but  also as far as  possible  that\r\n\r\nthese amenities are completed about the same  time\r\n\r\nthe flats become tenantable. It works closely with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education in providing sites  for\r\n\r\nthe construction of schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether the JTC will consider\r\n\r\ngranting  concession  rates  to  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nresidents  when they visit the various  parks  and\r\n\r\ngardens or use the various sports facilities.  The\r\n\r\nJTC  developed  a  70-acre park land,  beside  the\r\n\r\nJurong   Lake,  consisting  of  undulating  wooded\r\n\r\nareas,  parks  and pavilions for the  use  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  including Jurong Town residents, free  of\r\n\r\ncharge.  The  admission charges for  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nGarden at 40 cents for an adult and 20 cents for a\r\n\r\nchild are already concessionary rates. This garden\r\n\r\nis  not built solely for Jurong residents but also\r\n\r\nfor  the enjoyment of all Singapore residents  and\r\n\r\ntourists.  As such, it is not possible  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  rates for Jurong Town residents. As  for  the\r\n\r\nsporting facilities under JTC control, the charges\r\n\r\nfor  their use are nominal and are about the  same\r\n\r\nas those charged elsewhere in Singapore. It is not\r\n\r\nconsidered  necessary to grant further concessions\r\n\r\nto Jurong Town residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether the JTC supervises the\r\n\r\nwork  of  refuse collection contractor  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat regular collection is done and that the areas\r\n\r\nare  cleaned up after removal. The JTC  contractor\r\n\r\nis  responsible for collecting refuse from  refuse\r\n\r\nchutes  and  transporting it to  the  various  bin\r\n\r\ncentres  where  they are collected by  the  Public\r\n\r\nHealth Division. The JTC has a team of supervisors\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the refuse collection  contractor\r\n\r\ndoes his work regularly and properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question which the Member asked is: will\r\n\r\nthe  JTC  consider  relaxing  its  rule  regarding\r\n\r\nrenting  of flats to allow a family with only  one\r\n\r\nmember  who  is a Singapore citizen to apply?  The\r\n\r\npresent  policy adopted by the JTC for the renting\r\n\r\nof flats is that the applicant must be a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen and the majority of his family must either\r\n\r\nbe  Singapore  citizens  or  permanent  residents.\r\n\r\nSingle  citizens are not eligible for  JTC  flats.\r\n\r\nThis  policy on low-cost housing follows  that  of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB, and it is considered undesirable for JTC\r\n\r\nto  deviate from this policy, thus setting up  two\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, about the luxury type of flats now\r\n\r\nunder  construction, he asked: when will  they  be\r\n\r\ncompleted and open for application, and what  will\r\n\r\nthe  price  be? The two blocks of 20-storey  flats\r\n\r\ncomprising  144 units at Yuan Ching  Road,  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown,  are expected to be completed by the fourth-quarter  of this year. The selling price of  these\r\n\r\nflats will be fixed after work has been completed,\r\n\r\nso  that  a proper costing can be computed.  These\r\n\r\nflats   are  built  to  meet  the  needs  of   top\r\n\r\nexecutives working in Jurong Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his reply to my questions, and I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Dr Ong Leong Boon and Mr L.

The Member for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley spoke on this at length, and I would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to speak on the subject to  complement\r\n\r\nhis intelligent proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley called it the\r\n\r\nConsumer Protection Act. I would like, however, to\r\n\r\ncall  this  piece of legislation, which should  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  as  soon  as  possible,  the  Consumer\r\n\r\nInformation   Act.   I  call   it   the   Consumer\r\n\r\nInformation Act because this Act will ensure  that\r\n\r\nconsumers  are truthfully informed  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nproducts  purchased and because a  Protection  Act\r\n\r\ncould   insinuate  that  consumers  need   to   be\r\n\r\nprotected  against  all traders  when,  in  actual\r\n\r\nfact,  only  some  of  them are  guilty  of  trade\r\n\r\nmalpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act, for example, will require the\r\n\r\nlabelling  of  all packaged goods  truthfully.  It\r\n\r\nwill require a statement of weight of contents  or\r\n\r\nvolume.  It  most  certainly will  curb  deceptive\r\n\r\npackaging  and labelling. There will also  be  the\r\n\r\nnecessity to include the name and address  of  the\r\n\r\npacker  on  the  label,  to  prohibit  false   and\r\n\r\nmisleading labelling, advertising and pricing, and\r\n\r\nmisleading  packaging shapes. The Act should  also\r\n\r\nrequire   quantity  markings  for  packages,   the\r\n\r\ncompulsory use of standard quality units and  that\r\n\r\nadvertisers  furnish the proof in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nclaims  made.  All goods should  also  be  clearly\r\n\r\nmarked  reflecting  the  volume,  weight  or   the\r\n\r\ndimensions  of  length and width,  wherever  these\r\n\r\nconsiderations  apply.  Consumers  will  also   be\r\n\r\nanxious  to  see, indicated, the date  of  use  in\r\n\r\nrespect of commodities of limited life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE)\r\n\r\ndoes  not  regard  legislation as  necessarily  an\r\n\r\nappropriate method of ensuring that consumers  get\r\n\r\na   fair   deal.  CASE  does  not  also   advocate\r\n\r\nlegislation in cases where it feels it can achieve\r\n\r\nthe desired end by agreement between the interests\r\n\r\nconcerned.   CASE   does  not   also   press   for\r\n\r\nlegislation   unless  the  problems   raised   are\r\n\r\nsufficiently serious to warrant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  action.  Unless  a  considerable  number  of\r\n\r\nconsumers  are  affected by  the  conditions  CASE\r\n\r\nconsiders need correcting, legislation is not,  in\r\n\r\nthe view of CASE, appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still a wide field where it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  lay down rules in legislative  form\r\n\r\nnot  only to the benefit of the consumers but also\r\n\r\nfor  the  protection  of the honest  trader.  This\r\n\r\nproposed legislation is an obvious example and  it\r\n\r\nwill   benefit  not  only  purchasers   but   also\r\n\r\nreputable traders, who are in the majority and who\r\n\r\nare  adversely affected by some of the  activities\r\n\r\nof certain dubious entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon.

Why  must the taxpayer  be  made  to\r\n\r\ntravel to separate places to ask for the necessary\r\n\r\nforms?  If these forms had been designed properly,\r\n\r\nthis  unnecessary travel could have been  avoided.\r\n\r\nCould  a  simpler and clearer form be issued  from\r\n\r\nnext  year onwards?

On this basis, the rich pay more, the\r\n\r\npoor pay less or not at all. This is fair enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am just wondering whether the Minister\r\n\r\nwould  consider differentiating those  individuals\r\n\r\nwho  are salaried employees from those who  derive\r\n\r\ntheir  income from capital investments, either  in\r\n\r\nlanded  properties  or other business  operations.\r\n\r\nFor   salaried  employees,  perhaps  the  existing\r\n\r\nprogressive rate of income tax could be made  less\r\n\r\ndrastic  so  as  not  to cause disincentive.

As\r\n\r\nthey advance in life, despite what appears to be a\r\n\r\nvery  attractive pay, in most cases after the  tax\r\n\r\nboys  have finished with them, their net take-home\r\n\r\npay  is  reduced to such an extent that  there  is\r\n\r\nhardly  enough left to save either for a house  or\r\n\r\nfor a rainy day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

The parent-relief requirement,\r\n\r\nhowever,  will be incorporated in the  income  tax\r\n\r\nreturns for future years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax relief for maintenance of gardens is not\r\n\r\nan exemption, but a concession by way of remission\r\n\r\nand  is  subject to approval from  year  to  year.\r\n\r\nBesides, the claim form for garden relief  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  certified  by  an authorised person  and  tax-payers may not want others to know the details  of\r\n\r\ntheir  income  when  they go  to  this  authorised\r\n\r\nperson  for  his  signature on  the  forms.  So  a\r\n\r\nseparate  form for claiming the garden relief  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of the income tax return form has\r\n\r\nbeen made as simple as possible and most taxpayers\r\n\r\nhave  become  quite familiar with it.  Explanatory\r\n\r\nnotes  are  also attached to the forms  to  assist\r\n\r\ntaxpayers in filling up the forms. If any taxpayer\r\n\r\nstill finds difficulty in filling up the forms, he\r\n\r\ncan  contact  the Income Tax Department  which  is\r\n\r\nalways  ready to give information and  assistance.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  record  kept of  forms  incorrectly\r\n\r\nfilled  up  so  that I cannot answer the  Member's\r\n\r\nquestion.  But  I  am  told  that,  judging   from\r\n\r\nexperience,  the majority of forms  received  have\r\n\r\nbeen correctly completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards giving increasing personal reliefs, I\r\n\r\nhave already explained in detail in my answers  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar and other Members, and I\r\n\r\ndo not think I have anything else to add to what I\r\n\r\nhave already stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta did not think very much of\r\n\r\nthe relief for keeping gardens and thought perhaps\r\n\r\nit  should be eliminated because the relief is not\r\n\r\nof  general application. Instead, he wanted relief\r\n\r\nfor  blood donation in the same way as relief  for\r\n\r\ncharitable contributions. I only wish blood donors\r\n\r\nwere  of  such great numbers to be of significance\r\n\r\nthat  this  principle of relief, being of  general\r\n\r\napplication, can also be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplied to relief for blood donation. I think  our\r\n\r\nblood donors are so generous that they do not mind\r\n\r\nforgoing this slight relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Jalan Kayu, he made the\r\n\r\npoint   that  the  salaried  earners   should   be\r\n\r\ndifferentiated  from  people  who  receive   their\r\n\r\nincome  from property and other sources. There  is\r\n\r\nalready this differentiation in the earned  income\r\n\r\nrelief,  although  I admit that the  incomes  from\r\n\r\nprofits,  which are also earned, fall within  this\r\n\r\nrelief. I do not see how we can really distinguish\r\n\r\nthem  and  why  should there  be  any  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween a salaried income worker and a man who  by\r\n\r\nhis  own effort makes a profit on his business.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him  that perhaps the  middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup  feel the burden of income tax most  because\r\n\r\nas they go up the scale, the rates for income tax,\r\n\r\nbeing  progressive, become higher and higher  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they feel that it is very burdensome to\r\n\r\nhave  to pay income tax. Perhaps they can live  in\r\n\r\nthe  hope  that  when they go to the  top  bracket\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no  further progressive  taxation\r\n\r\nbeyond that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, what I am trying to point\r\n\r\nout is that there are certain inequities. With the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  there are all sorts of  loopholes  in\r\n\r\nthe  law through which they can get away, and  yet\r\n\r\ntheir own personal income is subjected to the same\r\n\r\nrate  of tax as a salaried person. It is very easy\r\n\r\nto  differentiate an employed person from  a  non-employed person. There are people who, because  of\r\n\r\nwealth  handed  down to them, just  sit  back  and\r\n\r\ncollect  rents,  and for their  entire  life  need\r\n\r\nnever  sweat  for their income and  yet  they  are\r\n\r\ntaxed at the same rate as you and I, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  lot  of  MPs here. Is that social  justice?\r\n\r\nThis  is the point I am trying to make. It is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult to differentiate them because  there  is\r\n\r\nthe CPF which keeps statistics. All employees have\r\n\r\ngot  CPF  numbers.  I do not  see  why  we  cannot\r\n\r\ndifferentiate them through these numbers  if  they\r\n\r\nare employed. But towkays do not have numbers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that  the income  tax  forms  were\r\n\r\nsimple  and that all of us know how to  fill  them\r\n\r\nin,  I  am  sure he did not mean it. I  have  been\r\n\r\nfilling  in these forms. Those who can afford  it,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the  large business  firms,  which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jalan  Kayu was talking  about,  have\r\n\r\naccountants  and many other agents  who  not  only\r\n\r\nfill  the income tax forms for them but also  help\r\n\r\nthem  to  fill in in such a way that they get  the\r\n\r\nmost  rebates. But for people like us who have  to\r\n\r\nfill  in ourselves, the tax form becomes more  and\r\n\r\nmore  complicated as the years go by.  The  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department now wants us not only to  fill  in\r\n\r\nwhat  we have earned but it wants us to tell  them\r\n\r\nhow  much  they should collect from us. I  do  not\r\n\r\nmind  doing  this  work for them,  but  it  is  so\r\n\r\ncomplicated that I cannot do it. For the past many\r\n\r\nyears, as the Minister has said, I have faithfully\r\n\r\ngone  to the Income Tax Department requesting them\r\n\r\nto  help me fill in these forms. It is being done.\r\n\r\nBut  as  the  years go by I find  that  previously\r\n\r\nwhere we had to wait for perhaps half an hour,  we\r\n\r\nnow have to wait for one hour, and the crowd there\r\n\r\nis  becoming unmanageable. I think there is a need\r\n\r\nfor a simplification of this form. In spite of the\r\n\r\nexplanatory notes, if we read them we become  even\r\n\r\nmore confused. I think it would not be really  too\r\n\r\ndifficult to design a much simpler form, and  this\r\n\r\nis  a  matter which the Inland Revenue  Department\r\n\r\nshould pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I think it is a well-known fact that a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  hawkers in Singapore are  making  good\r\n\r\nprofits.  In  fact,  a good  number  of  them  own\r\n\r\nhouses,  motor cars, and properties. I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  some  of them are also partners  in  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies.  In  view of this,  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to look into this matter.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  fair that workers are required to  reveal\r\n\r\ntheir  income  to  the Income Tax  Department,  on\r\n\r\nwhich  they have to pay income tax, while  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  hawkers who are making good profits  - some  of  them  are earning more than  executives,\r\n\r\nprofessional people or even MPs - do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  have to do so. Perhaps the Minister will look\r\n\r\ninto  it  to ensure that they do contribute  their\r\n\r\nshare of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Why compare them with us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of\r\n\r\nblood  donors, what I advocated was  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple.  It  is  not a question  of  the  blood\r\n\r\ndonors   being  generous.  It  is  a   matter   of\r\n\r\nprinciple. Since we allow charitable contributions\r\n\r\nto  be  deducted from income for tax purposes,  we\r\n\r\nmight as well allow blood donors some sort of  tax\r\n\r\nrelief.  As far as the garden relief is concerned,\r\n\r\nthis tax policy benefits only a small minority  of\r\n\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jalan Kayu's comments - he is  not\r\n\r\nhere now, but perhaps I can still answer them.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there were loopholes which were  taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of by people who were non-salaried, such\r\n\r\nas  towkays and so on. May I assure him that these\r\n\r\nloopholes are being looked into all the time. Some\r\n\r\nMembers   have   even  commented  that   we   have\r\n\r\nrecognised  the  value of the contributions  which\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax staff have made towards closing the\r\n\r\nloopholes and punishing those found to have  taken\r\n\r\nundue advantage of these loopholes, assuming  they\r\n\r\nwere not legal loopholes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has complained\r\n\r\nabout  the  income  tax forms and  the  additional\r\n\r\namount of time it requires to fill in these  forms\r\n\r\neven  with  the  assistance of the Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment. Perhaps he may console himself  to  be\r\n\r\nin   good  company  with  people  like  Dr  Albert\r\n\r\nEinstein who could not fill up his income tax form\r\n\r\ncorrectly.  But  there  is  also  a  very   simple\r\n\r\nexplanation as to why it now takes longer for  him\r\n\r\nto fill his forms, and this may be that his income\r\n\r\nis getting more complicated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould  tax the hawkers. I do not want to  make  a\r\n\r\ngeneral investigation, but I would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite  prepared to consider an investigation  into\r\n\r\ncertain   hawkers   who  are  making   more   than\r\n\r\nprofessional  people only if I could  be  supplied\r\n\r\nwith  a  list  by Members of all such  hawkers  in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective constituencies. I would be happy\r\n\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has pressed again for tax\r\n\r\nrelief for blood donors. If he is serious, perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  can send me a memorandum, as I have suggested,\r\n\r\ngiving  the reasons why they should be  given  tax\r\n\r\nrelief, whether they really want to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  a  fairly  small relief, and at what  rate  we\r\n\r\nshould  compensate these blood  donors  for  their\r\n\r\nblood.  The general principle which the  hospitals\r\n\r\nhave  assumed  is  that  blood  donation  is   not\r\n\r\nsomething  which should be paid for. In  fact,  in\r\n\r\ncertain  countries I believe payment is  made  for\r\n\r\nblood  donations, and this is more direct. But  he\r\n\r\nis  suggesting an indirect method, and perhaps the\r\n\r\nprinciple of no payment for a donation is  a  good\r\n\r\none which I commend for his consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one unique\r\n\r\nfeature of this current Budget session seems to be\r\n\r\nthat  Members of Parliament have been assigned  to\r\n\r\ndo  so many jobs that very soon we do not need the\r\n\r\nCivil Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy, Ho Kah Leong, Ch'ng Jit Koon and Lai Tha Chai.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime this year there was a report in\r\n\r\nthe  newspaper  that two Government aided  schools\r\n\r\nhad merged into one. This newspaper report made me\r\n\r\nfeel  that the Government should go a step further\r\n\r\nby  taking full responsibility for the improvement\r\n\r\nof  accommodation and facilities of aided schools.\r\n\r\nConsideration  should  also  be   given   to   the\r\n\r\nabsorption  of  aided  school  teachers  into  the\r\n\r\npublic  service. This will break the psychological\r\n\r\nbarrier  between  Government  teachers  and   non-Government  teachers.  This is  important  because\r\n\r\nSingapore  depends on its manpower  resources  for\r\n\r\nits development and survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in educational circles, it is quite common\r\n\r\nfor  Government  teachers to  have  a  superiority\r\n\r\ncomplex over non-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment teachers.  As  a  result,  some   good\r\n\r\nteachers from the Government aided schools rush to\r\n\r\napply   for  transfer  or  absorption   into   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  education service in  order  to  raise\r\n\r\ntheir  status and reputation. As a matter of fact,\r\n\r\nit  will not be much of a problem or difficulty to\r\n\r\nabsorb  Government aided school teachers into  the\r\n\r\npublic  service because for the past 20 years  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been paying the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\naided   school  teachers  and  expenses  of  aided\r\n\r\nschools,  including CPF contributions.  So  it  is\r\n\r\njust  a matter of procedure to absorb aided school\r\n\r\nteachers into the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the increased expenditure on aided\r\n\r\nschools,  I  feel that the Government should  also\r\n\r\nhave  a  greater  control over  aided  schools.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the Board of Governors of the  aided\r\n\r\nschools  will be only too happy to agree  to  this\r\n\r\nmove. Furthermore, education is an important life-line  in the survival of a country, and it  should\r\n\r\nby  right  be  the overall responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education. Only in this way  can  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and reform of education be possible on\r\n\r\na comprehensive basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the request of aided school teachers for\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits  after their  retirement  should\r\n\r\nalso be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia Khoon Seong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I am not speaking at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P.

If\r\n\r\nthis  is so, I wonder why secondary schools  still\r\n\r\nhave  a  great shortage of qualified teachers.  At\r\n\r\none  time it was reported that there was an excess\r\n\r\nof  400 teachers in the English stream, and yet  a\r\n\r\ngood  number  of  relief teachers are  still  seen\r\n\r\nmanning  full  classes in secondary schools.

The Minister has said that the problem of\r\n\r\nmass  transfer of teachers has been resolved.  Can\r\n\r\nhe elaborate on it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions were supposed to be a regular annual\r\n\r\nexercise. Nothing has so far been done about this.\r\n\r\nWhy?  In  the  last  Budget session  the  Minister\r\n\r\nremarked  that the promotion exercise for teachers\r\n\r\nwould   be  an  annual  exercise.  For  the  first\r\n\r\nexercise, applications were called for in 1972 and\r\n\r\npromotions  took  place in 1973.  But  since  then\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  no news. Has the  heart-breaking\r\n\r\nexercise  introduced  at  the  beginning  died   a\r\n\r\nnatural  death?  What steps  have  been  taken  to\r\n\r\ncorrect   the  many  errors  made  in  the   first\r\n\r\nexercise?  If  there  is  another  exercise,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry   must  make  sure  that  some   of   the\r\n\r\nprincipals do not bungle up things this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps is the Ministry of Education taking\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that there is an increasing rapport\r\n\r\nbetween principals and teachers? How many teachers\r\n\r\nare drawing salaries in excess of their principals\r\n\r\nand   senior  teachers?  Why  and  how  does  this\r\n\r\nsituation arise? Should not something be  done  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  this anomaly so that teachers  with  much\r\n\r\nmore  salaries than principals and senior teachers\r\n\r\nbe  made  to hold similar positions? This is  only\r\n\r\nlogical. Would such principals and senior teachers\r\n\r\ntreat  these  other  teachers  with  respect   and\r\n\r\ndecorum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe in 1969 the Primary Pilot Project\r\n\r\nwas put on trial in certain primary schools by the\r\n\r\nMinister.  This project has now been  extended  to\r\n\r\nmany  other schools. I wonder whether this project\r\n\r\nis a successful one. Though the specialists say it\r\n\r\nis  successful,  I understand that  many  teachers\r\n\r\nsincerely say it is not so, because the project is\r\n\r\nstill  on  trial  and that the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nbilingualism    clashes   with    this    project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the children take  a  long  time  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  syllabus and they do not  have  any\r\n\r\nwritten  examinations. So later when they reach  a\r\n\r\nhigher  primary  level where  they  have  to  take\r\n\r\nwritten examinations, they will find it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult to pass due to lack of training. Can the\r\n\r\nMinister comment and enlighten me on this subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year when primary school pupils leave for\r\n\r\nentry  into  secondary schools they  are  given  a\r\n\r\nchoice  of two schools. Does the Ministry make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory for the pupils to go to schools nearest\r\n\r\ntheir home? If not, why is this not so? The pupils\r\n\r\ncan  save a lot of money and time if they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to go to schools far away from their  homes.\r\n\r\nThis  will  also  ensure  that  secondary  schools\r\n\r\nreceive  the  same  number of quality  pupils.  At\r\n\r\npresent many pupils with good results land in  the\r\n\r\nso-called good schools. The rest, especially those\r\n\r\nwho pass after two or three attempts, are sent  to\r\n\r\nsome  other  mediocre  schools.  This  is  totally\r\n\r\nunfair  to  the  schools that receive  the  poorer\r\n\r\nquality  of pupils. Not only do the teachers  find\r\n\r\nit  frustrating to teach them, but the pupils  too\r\n\r\ndo  not have the sense of esprit de corps with the\r\n\r\nschool for they too know what category they belong\r\n\r\nto.  Further,  sending pupils to  schools  nearest\r\n\r\ntheir   home  will  eliminate  traffic  congestion\r\n\r\nduring  school  days. I am sure the Minister  will\r\n\r\nagree  with me that this \"class distinction\" among\r\n\r\nschools should be done away with and should not be\r\n\r\nencouraged in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has experienced another laboratory\r\n\r\nblast  in  a secondary school. Could these  blasts\r\n\r\nand  unnecessary  injuries have  been  avoided  if\r\n\r\nproper precautions had been taken? What steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing taken in science laboratories to ensure that\r\n\r\nthis sort of incident is not repeated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps are being taken in schools to\r\n\r\nconduct   fire   drills?  Are   there   sufficient\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  fire hydrants and  fire  hoses  to\r\n\r\nfight fires in schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago it was reported in the press\r\n\r\nthat  some secondary schools had accumulated funds\r\n\r\nto  the  tune of $100,000-plus. There may be  many\r\n\r\nmore  secondary schools accumulating amounts close\r\n\r\nto  the  $100,000  figure. The miscellaneous  fees\r\n\r\nhave   been   collected  from  pupils  and   these\r\n\r\ncontributions are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be used for their benefit. But  there\r\n\r\nare  schools where such funds are not released  by\r\n\r\nthe principals to purchase items sorely needed for\r\n\r\npupils' use. The worst case I have come across  is\r\n\r\nthe   use  of  funds  for  the  purchase  of   art\r\n\r\nmaterials. Many of the schools cannot be  bothered\r\n\r\nabout art. As such they see no need to spend these\r\n\r\nfunds  on  the  purchase  of  materials  for   the\r\n\r\nteaching of art. In fact, in one secondary  school\r\n\r\nthe principal allocated a miserable sum of $25 for\r\n\r\nart  per  term.  This  is a  ridiculous  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  in  our  schools.  Certain  schools  have\r\n\r\nbeautiful art rooms built at great cost,  and  yet\r\n\r\nsome  principals  refuse  to  allocate  sufficient\r\n\r\nfunds for the efficient teaching of this important\r\n\r\nsubject.  This is really a sorry state of affairs.\r\n\r\nI  have  quoted only one example. Funds meant  for\r\n\r\nsports  facilities are not used, and so  also  for\r\n\r\nscience.  Thus  we  see  why  these  schools  have\r\n\r\ninflated bank accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, I believe the financial\r\n\r\nsection  of  the Ministry dictates  the  amount  a\r\n\r\nschool  may spend per month. For example, a school\r\n\r\nwith  2,000  pupils may collect $6,000 per  month,\r\n\r\nyet  it  is not allowed to spend more than  $4,000\r\n\r\nper  month from the miscellaneous fees account.  A\r\n\r\nsaving  of $2,000 lies in the bank only to collect\r\n\r\ninterest, and serves no other purpose. Such  cock-eyed policies must be done away forthwith. Let the\r\n\r\nmoney go back to the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ETV lessons have not been very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  Standards have to be improved.  One\r\n\r\nclassroom lesson has far greater value than an ETV\r\n\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know what is the programme\r\n\r\nof   training   teachers  in  the   Institute   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  It would appear that the Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  similar  in nature  to  the  former\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College. What is the Minister's\r\n\r\nview on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are being taken by the Ministry in\r\n\r\ntheir regular inspection of schools to ensure that\r\n\r\nschools  carry out education policies effectively?\r\n\r\nSome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  are  rarely visited by  anyone  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, and these schools  tend  to\r\n\r\nwallow  in anonymity. Some of the schools deep  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas are never visited by any official\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some schools, the teachers do not check the\r\n\r\ncompositions written by the students. It  is  just\r\n\r\nlike  what  is done in the University,  they  just\r\n\r\ngive  a  lecture,  and that is all.  How  can  the\r\n\r\nstudents  progress in this way? The teachers  just\r\n\r\ngive them notes, and that is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, regarding the word \"million\". The last\r\n\r\ntime   I   brought  this  matter  up,  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary said  that  it  had  been\r\n\r\nreferred to the Ministry of Education. May  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education whether  instructions\r\n\r\nhad  been  given to the Ministry of Culture  about\r\n\r\nthis?  I  know it is bad for me to talk about  the\r\n\r\nword \"million\" again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if you may\r\n\r\nrecall,   in   1973  the  Ministry  of   Education\r\n\r\nincreased the collection of miscellaneous fees  by\r\n\r\n$1  per student. At the same time the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation also announced that the teachers were to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  the 9 per cent wage supplement.  Putting\r\n\r\nthese   two   facts  together,  people   get   the\r\n\r\nimpression that the $1 increase is to pay for  the\r\n\r\n9  per  cent  wage  increase.  But  the  fact  was\r\n\r\ndisclosed  a  few  days ago by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  in  this  House  that  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  had a large balance of some $7  million\r\n\r\nin  the School Fund Account. So the cat is out  of\r\n\r\nthe bag. This increase of $1 in miscellaneous fees\r\n\r\nwas  made because of higher expenditure.  But  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson has already pointed out that  it\r\n\r\nis quite difficult to make use of the money in the\r\n\r\nSchool  Fund  Account. So  I  would  like  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether   it   is  because  of  the  very   strict\r\n\r\nregulation  governing the appropriation  of  money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  School Fund Account or  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of  too  much red tape. I entirely  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Anson that since the fees  are\r\n\r\ncollected from the students, they should  be  used\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to speak\r\n\r\non  school clerks. Although the school clerks draw\r\n\r\nthe same salary as those in the public service, we\r\n\r\nmust  realise that the duties of the school  clerk\r\n\r\nare  more onerous because they have a lot of other\r\n\r\nduties to do. They have to answer telephone calls.\r\n\r\nThey  do typing work, printing, and a lot of other\r\n\r\nthings.   But  their  services  are  not  properly\r\n\r\nrecognised.  They do not have division  of  labour\r\n\r\nlike  other  clerks  in  the  civil  service.  The\r\n\r\nallocation of school clerks is based on the number\r\n\r\nof  students in each school. However big a  school\r\n\r\nmay  be,  one  may  only get two or  three  school\r\n\r\nclerks.  In some small schools, there is none.  In\r\n\r\nother schools they have to share the services of a\r\n\r\nschool clerk. I feel that the school clerk plays a\r\n\r\nvery  important part in the running  of  a  school\r\n\r\nbecause,  like  civil  servants  in  the   British\r\n\r\nsystem,  they are so familiar with the  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  that  they know all  these  at  their\r\n\r\nfinger tips. So they are just like the head  of  a\r\n\r\ndepartment.  As  they  know  all  the  rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations,  they  can advise  the  principal  on\r\n\r\nprocedural  matters.  If  the  school   clerk   is\r\n\r\nefficient  he  will be a tremendous  help  to  the\r\n\r\nschool and to the principal. That being the  case,\r\n\r\nwe  can see that he is a very important person. So\r\n\r\nhis  remuneration  and service  conditions  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  properly adjusted to benefit  him.  That\r\n\r\nwill only be a reasonable gesture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considerable negotiations with the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Union, the Ministry of Education has  at\r\n\r\nlast accepted the proposal that teachers with  ten\r\n\r\nyears'  experience are to be recognised as trained\r\n\r\nteachers.  This  only shows that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation is amenable to public opinion.  It  also\r\n\r\nshows  that the Teachers' Union has done the right\r\n\r\nthing.  But  there are few tens of graduates  from\r\n\r\nsome foreign universities who have been trained at\r\n\r\nthe  TTC  for  one  or  two years.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nentitled to this benefit, and have not been  given\r\n\r\nthe  salary  of graduate teachers. Sir,  since  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  raise the quality of teaching and  solve\r\n\r\nour educational problems, we must give the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers  the  proper remuneration  and  conducive\r\n\r\nworking   conditions.  I  feel  that  the  foreign\r\n\r\ngraduate teachers who have been trained in our TTC\r\n\r\nshould  be  properly  recognised  and  given   the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  graduate teachers' pay  as  had  been\r\n\r\naccorded to an earlier batch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with the question of\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits for aided school teachers.  This\r\n\r\nis only a recent innovation to enable aided school\r\n\r\nteachers  to  enjoy the same medical  benefits  as\r\n\r\nteachers  in  the  Government  schools.  This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  a  very enlightened policy  which  we\r\n\r\nappreciate.  But unfortunately when  a  Government\r\n\r\naided  school teacher retires, he has to surrender\r\n\r\nhis   medical  benefit  entitlement   card.   Sir,\r\n\r\ngenerally  speaking,  when a  man  gets  older  he\r\n\r\nbecomes   weaker  and  so  requires  more  medical\r\n\r\nattention.  But a Government aided school  teacher\r\n\r\nwill not be entitled to medical benefits after his\r\n\r\nretirement. So he has to rely on his meagre sum of\r\n\r\nmoney in the Central Provident Fund to pay for his\r\n\r\nmedical  expenses. This will cause him  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties. Sir, a few days  ago  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance announced  that  pensioners\r\n\r\nwould  be  given a special new Singapore Allowance\r\n\r\nbecause of the rising cost of living, but there is\r\n\r\nno corresponding increase in the CPF contributions\r\n\r\nfor  retired aided school teachers. So this proves\r\n\r\nthat they require medical benefits even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national policy is to build a fair and just\r\n\r\nsociety.  We  recognise  that  civil  servants  or\r\n\r\nGovernment  school teachers do contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nsociety,  but  we  cannot deny that  aided  school\r\n\r\nteachers also make the same contribution. We  have\r\n\r\ndone  a  great  deal  in the promotion  of  multi-racialism and multi-culturalism. We have also been\r\n\r\nactively promoting bilingualism in our educational\r\n\r\nsystem. This is praiseworthy. In pursuance of such\r\n\r\na policy, I understand that this year the exposure\r\n\r\ntime  for  second language in the various language\r\n\r\nstreams  has  been  increased.  Because  of   this\r\n\r\nEnglish   school  teachers  who   had   taken   an\r\n\r\nexamination  in second language are asked  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to teach that second language. Of course,\r\n\r\nadministratively\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  may be quite right.  But  from  the\r\n\r\nEducation  point of view a language  teacher  must\r\n\r\nnot  only know that language but he must  also  be\r\n\r\nproficient in that language. Otherwise he can only\r\n\r\nprepare one lesson ahead of the students, and that\r\n\r\nis  not the right way of doing it, as the students\r\n\r\nwill lose the benefits of proper teaching. I fully\r\n\r\nendorse the implementation of bilingual education,\r\n\r\nbut  I  cannot  agree to this method  of  teaching\r\n\r\nbecause  such teachers took their second  language\r\n\r\nexamination  some  eight or ten  years  ago  as  a\r\n\r\nsingle  subject  and  since then  without  further\r\n\r\nbrushing  up  the  language they  might  have  now\r\n\r\nforgotten  it. Whatever they may remember  now  is\r\n\r\ninadequate for teaching purposes. If there is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  shortage of second language teachers  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools, I would like to  urge  that  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education should set up more  classes\r\n\r\nto  train  such  teachers and,  if  necessary,  to\r\n\r\nborrow  teachers  from Chinese  schools  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  The  retirement age of Chinese  language\r\n\r\nteachers  may  even be extended  by  unifying  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age  at 60, instead of  some  teachers\r\n\r\nretiring at 55 and some at 60 years. In this  way,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  problem of second language  teachers\r\n\r\ncan  be solved. But whatever it is, Sir, it is not\r\n\r\nright  to make use of teachers who happen just  to\r\n\r\nhave  passed a second language as a single subject\r\n\r\nto  teach  that  second language  in  the  English\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is  aware  that the  second  language\r\n\r\ntextbooks  have been changed frequently.  In  some\r\n\r\nschools, the student has bought the first Book  I,\r\n\r\nbut  he  is required to buy Book II of a different\r\n\r\nedition.  This  adds to the burden of  parents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly in the face of  a  rising\r\n\r\ncost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, your time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore is a small island country with no natural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources. The only resource that we have  is  our\r\n\r\nlimited manpower. In order to make full use of our\r\n\r\nmanpower and to nurture every individual to  be  a\r\n\r\nuseful citizen, the Government is allotting  large\r\n\r\nsums  of  money every year for education.  In  the\r\n\r\nestimates  for  the  coming  financial  year,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  greatly increased its  allocation\r\n\r\nfor  this  purpose. I am glad  to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to build four  new  secondary\r\n\r\nschools and eight primary schools in the next  two\r\n\r\nyears.  There  are  also plans  to  build  28  new\r\n\r\nprimary schools and 26 secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure and match the speedy and\r\n\r\nprogressive   development  of  our   economy   and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\npaying  great  attention to the task of  technical\r\n\r\neducation   and   training.  The  Government   has\r\n\r\nallocated  large sums of money for the  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board, the Singapore Polytechnic and  the\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann Technical College. At the same time  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  also  increased  the  votes   for\r\n\r\nindustrial    training   abroad   and   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment scholarship schemes. With  all  these,\r\n\r\nwe  hope  that the votes can be usefully spent  to\r\n\r\nrealise  our  intentions and that  the  industrial\r\n\r\ncircles  will  also sincerely participate  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  efforts in providing  the  technical\r\n\r\neducation needed for our economy, and in  striving\r\n\r\nfor  the development of industrial groundwork  and\r\n\r\ntechnological  skills  of our  new  country.  From\r\n\r\nthese  we  can see that the Government  is  paying\r\n\r\nmuch attention to the education of our people  and\r\n\r\nis  trying  to  help train our  people  to  become\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  so  that they  may  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute towards industrial development  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we know that there are many school\r\n\r\nstudents   who,   because  of  poor   results   in\r\n\r\nexaminations, cannot pursue their studies and have\r\n\r\nbecome   drop-outs.  These  youngsters  have   not\r\n\r\nreached the age for national service and they  are\r\n\r\ntoo  young  to  be suitably employed.  So  without\r\n\r\nanything  to  do at home they roam  about  in  the\r\n\r\nstreets,  visiting the different places, going  to\r\n\r\nshopping centres and coffee shops and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmixing   up   with  bad  elements  in  anti-social\r\n\r\nactivities. Thus, they become a social problem and\r\n\r\nincrease  the  burden  of  our  society.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  suggest that the Government should  try\r\n\r\nits  best  to arrange for these youngsters  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  in  some industrial training  centres  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can learn some kind of skill to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to earn a living and to contribute something\r\n\r\nto  our  society. Of course, there is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nfurther   improve  the  training  facilities   and\r\n\r\ncontents  in  these centres. On  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nparents should also change their attitude and send\r\n\r\ntheir  children  to  such centres  for  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining because in the long-term it would benefit\r\n\r\nthem and the country as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a higher institution of learning is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  link in the educational system  of  any\r\n\r\ncountry  for  the  training of  better  personnel.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  our  college and university  education\r\n\r\nshould   be   in  keeping  with  the   needs   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our country in order  to  educate\r\n\r\nmore  useful citizens to enable them to help build\r\n\r\nour country and contribute to our society. Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  one of our higher institutions  of\r\n\r\nlearning.  It was built in the colonial  days.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  the  purpose was  to  provide  higher\r\n\r\neducation  for Chinese middle school graduates  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya and also to provide  teachers\r\n\r\nfor  Chinese  middle schools. However,  today  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  different. Singapore  and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nhave  become  separate independent  countries.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  years, our Government has been trying  its\r\n\r\nbest   to   promote   industrialisation   and   to\r\n\r\nmodernise.  In order to match our development  and\r\n\r\npractical   needs,  our  educational  system   has\r\n\r\nchanged   basically.  The  Government   has   been\r\n\r\nimplementing   the  policy  of  bilingualism   and\r\n\r\ntechnical education in all schools. The University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and the Singapore  Polytechnic  are\r\n\r\nalso  opening their doors to students from Chinese\r\n\r\nmiddle  schools.  Thus, Nanyang University  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger the only institution of higher learning for\r\n\r\nChinese  school students. Nantah has also provided a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge number of teachers It should adapt itself to\r\n\r\nthe  needs of our society. Otherwise Nantah  would\r\n\r\nbe  wasting  its resources and producing  manpower\r\n\r\nthat  does  not meet the requirements of  our  new\r\n\r\nsociety.   So,  suitable  development   of   human\r\n\r\nresources  should  be the new mission  of  Nantah.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the value of Nantah, and in  order  to\r\n\r\nmake  Nantah  an important link in our educational\r\n\r\nsystem, the Government has positively assisted  in\r\n\r\nits  development and has, in the short  period  of\r\n\r\nnine years since Singapore's independence, granted\r\n\r\nmore  than  $27  million financing  the  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure   of   Nantah.  During   the   period,\r\n\r\ndonations  from  Singapore and  Malaysia  totalled\r\n\r\nonly  $5.05 million, almost 90 per cent  of  which\r\n\r\ncame from supporters in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our two universities are important links in\r\n\r\nour  educational  system. Recent  trends  seem  to\r\n\r\nindicate  that  in  order to  better  develop  our\r\n\r\neducational   resources  to  train   our   limited\r\n\r\nmanpower   resources  to  meet   the   needs   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  our  society  and   to   provide\r\n\r\nuniversity education for more people from  various\r\n\r\nlanguage streams, our two universities have  taken\r\n\r\nseveral  steps of co-operation between them.  This\r\n\r\nis the turning point, and I hope that they will co-operate  on  the basis of quality  and  of  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit,  while at the same time preserving  their\r\n\r\nindividual  characteristics  and  traditions.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  enable the public to better  understand\r\n\r\nthe  co-operation between the two universities,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister for Education a few\r\n\r\nquestions. (1) About the Joint Admission Committee\r\n\r\nof  the two universities, I would like to ask  who\r\n\r\nare  the  members on the Committee  and  what  are\r\n\r\ntheir  functions and duties? Do they  include  the\r\n\r\nselection of new students for all the faculties in\r\n\r\nthe  two  universities? (2) About  the  University\r\n\r\nService Commission, what is the purpose of setting\r\n\r\nit  up, and what are the objectives, functions and\r\n\r\nduties?  Who are the members, and to whom is  this\r\n\r\nCommission  responsible?  (3)  About  new   salary\r\n\r\nscales  and  designations for  teaching  staff  of\r\n\r\nNantah, I would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  say  that Nanyang University had adjusted  the\r\n\r\nsalaries and also the designations of its teaching\r\n\r\nstaff  in  1970. And it is going to  do  the  same\r\n\r\nexercise  again  on  par with  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  would  like to  know  what  is  the\r\n\r\nstandard  or  criterion for this exercise.  Is  it\r\n\r\nbased  on  qualifications, experience  or  present\r\n\r\nsalaries? How many people in Nantah will  be  made\r\n\r\nprofessors, assistant professors, senior lecturers\r\n\r\nand  lecturers after this exercise? (4)  Regarding\r\n\r\nHonours   degree  courses,  will  general   degree\r\n\r\ngraduates  of the two universities, if  qualified,\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged to continue their higher studies in\r\n\r\nthe other University? If so, what will be the time\r\n\r\nneeded for such purpose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sorry, but your time is up,\r\n\r\nMr Ch'ng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  read in today's newspaper about streaking in  a\r\n\r\ncertain area in Singapore. This reminds me of what\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance referred to in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement about birds of passage. I also heard the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister answering the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  in  this House that it  would  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to train our young men through  national\r\n\r\nservice  to be loyal to our country. According  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Kim Seng, these birds of  passage\r\n\r\nwill  in the end leave here and settle abroad.  So\r\n\r\nthis  has caused me to think of a reason  for  all\r\n\r\nthis,  and I have found out that it is all due  to\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to tell you a little\r\n\r\nexperience. About two weeks ago, I had occasion to\r\n\r\nvisit   our   young  intellectuals  in   our   two\r\n\r\nuniversities.   I   found  that   those   studying\r\n\r\naccountancy or medicine in these universities  are\r\n\r\nimbued  with  the  sense  that  if  they  had  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to go abroad, they would certainly  do\r\n\r\nso,  and  leave  behind their  parents,  brothers,\r\n\r\nsisters,  relatives  and  friends  to  live   like\r\n\r\nforeigners  and  to  die as  \"foreign  devils\"  in\r\n\r\nforeign  lands. Why is this so? I learned from  my\r\n\r\nconversations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  them  that they  think  that  in  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping  multi-racial country  like  ours,  the\r\n\r\nlanguages  are too complicated, thoughts  are  too\r\n\r\ndiversified,  and  there is intense  struggle  and\r\n\r\nstrenuous work. Life is therefore very monotonous.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, they felt that if  they  were\r\n\r\nabroad,  they could enjoy better pay and a  better\r\n\r\nlife - they would have shorter hours of work,  and\r\n\r\nthey  could have a longer vacation - so that  with\r\n\r\nwhatever   knowledge  and  experience  they   have\r\n\r\nacquired they could roam the four corners  of  the\r\n\r\nearth  as and when they please. If the elder folks\r\n\r\npassively criticise these youngsters who are  bred\r\n\r\nhere, they would be shirking their responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that from now on the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  would,  in addition  to  the  usual\r\n\r\nadministrative   work,  go  a  step   further   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the leadership that guides the thoughts\r\n\r\nand ideology prevailing in educational circles. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this will affect the career of  thousands\r\n\r\nof  teachers. Our teachers today, as we know,  are\r\n\r\nenjoying a more stable and better environment  for\r\n\r\nteaching. They received better training  in  their\r\n\r\nprofession,  and  are enjoying a  better  material\r\n\r\nlife.  On  the other hand, the younger  generation\r\n\r\ntoday,  who are now taught by these teachers,  are\r\n\r\nwiser than the previous generation. Of course, the\r\n\r\ndifference   is  that  their  learning   is   more\r\n\r\nadvanced, more burdensome and arduous, because  we\r\n\r\nhave   progressed.  We  are  now   stressing   the\r\n\r\nimportance of nurturing talents and not the simple\r\n\r\neducation of a people to be useful workers,  which\r\n\r\nwas  a system we inherited from the previous  era.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our education should now be a  positive\r\n\r\none, aiming at leadership training, and not one of\r\n\r\npassive education. So all this will have to be the\r\n\r\nnew  burden  of our teachers in the  new  era.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  educational circles  there  are  many\r\n\r\nteachers  who  are very faithful and  hardworking;\r\n\r\nduring the day they are busy teaching; during  the\r\n\r\nnight  they  are  busy  correcting  homework,  and\r\n\r\nduring  vacation  or on free days  they  are  busy\r\n\r\ngoing  round  bookshops to look for more  teaching\r\n\r\nmaterials, or visiting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  or  taking  students  to  factories  and\r\n\r\nplaces of interest. All this dedicated educational\r\n\r\nservice  will  influence our youth  and  bring  up\r\n\r\nnation-builders. This kind of behaviour,  compared\r\n\r\nwith that of a small group of rotten and so-called\r\n\r\neducational workers, calls for our admiration  and\r\n\r\nthese faithful teachers deserve better treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a year ago, the Minister for Education\r\n\r\naddressed  an educational gathering. He said  that\r\n\r\nthere were certain black sheep among teachers  and\r\n\r\nsuggested  the  necessity of drafting  a  code  of\r\n\r\nprofessional conduct for teachers. Subsequently he\r\n\r\ntold   the  House  that  there  would  be  another\r\n\r\npromotion   exercise  which  would  benefit   many\r\n\r\nteachers. The Ministry should not give up its role\r\n\r\nof promoting ideological leadership in educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  It should not ask another  body  to\r\n\r\ntake  charge of matters of ideological  education,\r\n\r\nbecause  to  do so would give rise  to  the  false\r\n\r\nimpression  that our Ministry is  not  playing  an\r\n\r\nactive leadership role in the sphere of education,\r\n\r\nas  it would then be no more than a machinery  for\r\n\r\nissuing  circulars. For example, I agree with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong that hardworking and  dedicated\r\n\r\nteachers should be rewarded. They should  also  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  work  with a sense of  security.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar  also  referred  to   the\r\n\r\ndifferences  between Government schools  and  non-Government    schools   in    respect    of    the\r\n\r\nadministration and traditions and also differences\r\n\r\nbetween schools of different language streams. And\r\n\r\nif  we  just talk about the promotion of  teachers\r\n\r\nwithout   paying   attention   to   the   specific\r\n\r\nsurroundings of the school, it will not contribute\r\n\r\nto  the interest or advancement of education or of\r\n\r\nthe   teachers.  It  will  lead  to  psychological\r\n\r\nbarriers  and a low morale among the  teachers.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister for Education would, in addition\r\n\r\nto  paying more visits to the schools, play a more\r\n\r\nactive role in the leadership of thought education\r\n\r\nso that the evil influence from the small group of\r\n\r\nblack sheep will not spread to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother   teachers.  Thus,  the  integrity  of   the\r\n\r\nteachers  may  be  preserved  and  the  cause   of\r\n\r\neducation furthered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, as we all know, education is a  very\r\n\r\nimportant link in nation building. The educational\r\n\r\nsystem  is now being systematically and frequently\r\n\r\nchanged and, as a result, the content of education\r\n\r\nis  improving. This is important in  our  task  of\r\n\r\nnation building. In recent years, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has done a lot for education,  such  as\r\n\r\nincreasing   the  teaching  hours  for   technical\r\n\r\ntraining and consolidating the teaching of  second\r\n\r\nlanguage. All these are very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only like to raise a few questions about which\r\n\r\nall parents are very concerned and which they want\r\n\r\nthe Minister to know. First, is the Minister aware\r\n\r\nthat in the first few months after the opening  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  school year some primary  school  pupils\r\n\r\nwere still short of textbooks? What is the reason?\r\n\r\nIs the Minister aware that these pupils who do not\r\n\r\nhave  textbooks  would suffer a great  setback  in\r\n\r\nregard  to their lessons? Is it not also  a  great\r\n\r\nloss to their parents and to education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, how many graduates from Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  the University of Singapore  have\r\n\r\njoined  the  Institute  of  Education?  And  after\r\n\r\ngraduation,  how  many will be sent  to  teach  in\r\n\r\nmiddle schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, has the Minister received complaints\r\n\r\nabout  textbooks  and  exercise  books  being  too\r\n\r\nexpensive? I myself have received complaints  from\r\n\r\nparents  that  the  prices  of  these  books  have\r\n\r\nincreased  50 per cent or even more compared  with\r\n\r\nthose  of last year, thus causing a greater burden\r\n\r\nto parents in the middle and lower income groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I would like to ask the Minister about\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Training Board. Since its inception\r\n\r\nin   April  last  year,  how  many  students  have\r\n\r\ncompleted  their  training? And  after  graduation\r\n\r\nhave these students been recruited by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  factories  to  do jobs for  which  they  were\r\n\r\ntrained? What was the treatment like? How many  of\r\n\r\nthe graduates have been employed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, since setting up of the Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board, how many tutors have resigned, and\r\n\r\nwhy? Is it because their salary is lower than that\r\n\r\noffered in the private sector? If it is so,  would\r\n\r\nthe Minister consider adjusting their salaries  so\r\n\r\nas to enable them to stay on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nhe  is  aware  that  in  various  schools  in  the\r\n\r\ndifferent   language  streams  the  flag   raising\r\n\r\nceremony, in which the students give their pledge,\r\n\r\nis  not performed with solemnity so much so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  parents pass by such schools they feel  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed.  Sir, in fact, this ceremony  should\r\n\r\nbe   carried  out  in  a  serious  atmosphere   of\r\n\r\nsolemnity and respect so that our students can  be\r\n\r\ninculcated  with  a  deep  sense  of  loyalty  and\r\n\r\npatriotism,  while  they  are  still   young   and\r\n\r\nimpressionable.  I  think  those  are   the   only\r\n\r\nquestions that I want to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  press  that  prices  of  school\r\n\r\ntextbooks  sold in certain book-shops  were  quite\r\n\r\nhigh.  Moreover, at times students could  not  buy\r\n\r\ncertain textbooks because they were not available.\r\n\r\nI understand that school principals have the right\r\n\r\nto  select textbooks for use in their schools.  In\r\n\r\nfact, certain schools change their textbooks  from\r\n\r\ntime to time. Sir, in order to stabilise or reduce\r\n\r\nthe  prices of school textbooks and to  avoid  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of  getting certain textbooks,  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Minister for Education  for  his\r\n\r\nconsideration whether he would utilise $3  million\r\n\r\nout  of the $7 million in the School Supplementary\r\n\r\nFund  to  establish a School Textbook Co-operative\r\n\r\nfor  the bulk purchase of school textbooks and re-sale  to  the  students. Perhaps this co-operative\r\n\r\nmay  also include buying cloth in bulk for  school\r\n\r\nuniforms. This would definitely reduce the  prices\r\n\r\nof textbooks and school uniforms. If this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-operative is to buy school textbooks and  cloth\r\n\r\nfor  the  students, then it should be  called  the\r\n\r\nSchool Textbook and Cloth Co-operative. I am  sure\r\n\r\nall  parents, teachers and students will give full\r\n\r\nsupport  to this co-operative. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education will give his approval to establish\r\n\r\nthis  School  Textbook and Cloth  Co-operative  as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nprofess to know much about education, but I  would\r\n\r\njust  like to speak simply as a parent.  Sir,  for\r\n\r\nthe  past  years  the Ministry  of  Education,  in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the Ministry of Health, have been\r\n\r\nlooking  after the physical health of  our  school\r\n\r\nchildren very well and as parents we ought  to  be\r\n\r\nthankful.   However,   in   our   endeavours   for\r\n\r\nqualitative development in education, the time has\r\n\r\nnow  come  for us to pay closer attention  to  the\r\n\r\nmental health of our school children. Most parents\r\n\r\nwho  have  young  children  at  school  are  often\r\n\r\naggrieved  to find that some teachers -I emphasise\r\n\r\nsome  -  at times demonstrate a complete  lack  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding of child psychology and  would  seem\r\n\r\nto  make  little  or  no  attempt  to  assess  the\r\n\r\nlearning  capacity, both physical and  mental,  of\r\n\r\ntheir  pupils so much so that these poor  children\r\n\r\nare  often overloaded with work and all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nextra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching methods also leave much to he desired.\r\n\r\nIn  an extreme example reported to me recently,  a\r\n\r\nchild was asked to write a word 2,000 times  as  a\r\n\r\npunishment  just because he had copied it  wrongly\r\n\r\nfrom  the  blackboard. It is this sort of attitude\r\n\r\non  the  part  of some teachers that  causes  many\r\n\r\nchildren to develop a dislike or fear of going  to\r\n\r\nschool even at an early stage. And it is one  sure\r\n\r\nway  of  producing  school dropouts  who  in  time\r\n\r\ndevelop into social misfits. In 1971 we were  told\r\n\r\nthere were some 7,000 school drop-outs. This is  a\r\n\r\nstaggering  figure. The 23rd March  issue  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  carried  a  letter  written  by  a\r\n\r\nmother, under the heading \"Inquisitive pupils  who\r\n\r\nfight shy of asking questions\". In the concluding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparagraph of a very touching letter she said,  and\r\n\r\nI quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If children in schools do not feel free to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  a  problem or even query  something  they\r\n\r\nfeel  sure  is  wrong they are being  treated  not\r\n\r\nbetter than robots. Is this education?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  saying so, she has touched a soft chord in the\r\n\r\nheart  of every parent with school-going children.\r\n\r\nQuite  by  coincidence, on the same  day  all  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  reported a speech by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation   on  opening  a  Seminar  on   \"Problem\r\n\r\nchildren and children with problems\". In one  part\r\n\r\nof his speech, the Minister stated and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have upon our shoulders the sacred task of\r\n\r\ndeveloping   the   qualitative   aspect   of   our\r\n\r\nchildren.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another part he said, and again I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We bear the responsibility, jointly with our\r\n\r\nparents and the community at large,.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree that, generally speaking, the\r\n\r\nresponsibility should be a collective one  amongst\r\n\r\nteachers,  parents and the community at large,  in\r\n\r\nthe context of Singapore, I feel strongly that the\r\n\r\nbrunt  should be borne rather more heavily by  the\r\n\r\nschools. I say this because I think in the area of\r\n\r\nparent/child relationship, we have a rather unique\r\n\r\nsituation  not  found in many other countries.  On\r\n\r\naccount   of   the   emphasis  placed   on   equal\r\n\r\nopportunity  in  education, since our  Party  took\r\n\r\nover  the  reins of Government and as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe tremendous success of this policy, we now find\r\n\r\nin our midst a large number of illiterate or semi-literate parents with children going to schools at\r\n\r\ndifferent levels, and because of the plural nature\r\n\r\nof   our  society  we  now  find  Chinese-educated\r\n\r\nparents with children going to English schools and\r\n\r\nvice-versa,   or  Tamil  or  Malay  parents   with\r\n\r\nchildren   receiving  English  or   even   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. This has resulted in a situation  where\r\n\r\nthere are both a generation gap and a cultural gap\r\n\r\nbetween  parents  and children in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nopposing  sets  of value judgments often  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  a proper dialogue between  parents\r\n\r\nand  children.

A\r\n\r\nstudy  of the chart shows the aggravation of peak-hour travel by school children. In most countries,\r\n\r\nthere are only two peak periods. However, the mid-day  peak seems to be peculiar to Singapore. In  a speech made at a dinner held jointly by the  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  and  Henderson constituencies to  celebrate\r\n\r\nthe  election victory on 14th October,  1972,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister stated that it was desirable  that\r\n\r\nprimary  school  children  should  not  travel  to\r\n\r\nschool  beyond  a  two-mile  limit  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  children should not travel beyond a  four-mile  limit.

But I was wrong, and  I  will  humbly\r\n\r\nmake  an  attempt to defend the teachers.  I  must\r\n\r\nthank  the Member for Henderson who has understood\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of  teachers  and  is  an  eloquent\r\n\r\nchampion of the cause of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, I must confess, has got a\r\n\r\nvery  efficient network of intelligence to  enable\r\n\r\nhim  to  find  out what went wrong in the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries. I think he found out about  what  went\r\n\r\nwrong  with the Hawker Inspectorate, the Emergency\r\n\r\nUnit  of  the  Ministry of  Health,  and  also  in\r\n\r\nschools   where   teachers  did   not   mark   the\r\n\r\ncomposition  books. It could be  true  that  there\r\n\r\nwere  one or two teachers who did not fulfil their\r\n\r\nduties.  But one swallow does not make  a  summer.\r\n\r\nOne  teacher  who did not do his work  should  not\r\n\r\ngive the impression that the whole lot of teachers\r\n\r\ndid  not  mark  composition books. The  system  in\r\n\r\nforce  at present, with supervision by headmasters\r\n\r\nand  inspectors,  does not allow teachers  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  get  away  scot-free if they do not  mark  the\r\n\r\nbooks.   Teachers,   at  least  the   overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority of them, definitely have a conscience and\r\n\r\na commitment to fulfil their obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also a little bit surprised at the\r\n\r\nvery  wild  allegation  made  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  that  flag raising ceremonies  are  not\r\n\r\nproperly   conducted.  That   would   imply   that\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers are not conscious  of  the\r\n\r\nseriousness and the solemnity of such occasions. I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  he had attended  such  ceremonies\r\n\r\nbecause,  if he had not, then it is a rather  wild\r\n\r\nallegation. In every day of the 200 school days  a\r\n\r\nyear,  there has got to be a flag raising ceremony\r\n\r\nwhere  thousands  of young children  pledge  their\r\n\r\nloyalty to Singapore. Surely once in a while there\r\n\r\ncould be moments when children become fidgety. But\r\n\r\nthis  does not mean that throughout the  year  the\r\n\r\nflag  raising ceremony is not properly  conducted.\r\n\r\nIn  any situation where human beings are involved,\r\n\r\none  cannot  expect perfection. If, as the  Member\r\n\r\nhas   said,  he  had  witnessed  a  flag   raising\r\n\r\nceremony,  it  was probably done  by  chance.  But\r\n\r\nthere  again it is rather too sweeping an instance\r\n\r\nfor him to generalise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the sentiments of the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  over  his desire to attain  desirable\r\n\r\nobjectives   in  our  context  of  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety of generation gaps, of parents who  desire\r\n\r\nto  have  nothing but the best in the  educational\r\n\r\npursuits  of  their children. I wish to  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat  there  could be a few black sheep,  but  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority are very conscious of  the  various\r\n\r\ndesirable  objectives that should be  attained  in\r\n\r\nthe execution of their tasks as teachers, not only\r\n\r\nin  the  academic or educational  field  but  more\r\n\r\nimportant  still in the attainment of  a  national\r\n\r\nobjective of building a truly Singaporean society,\r\n\r\nmulti-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural  and\r\n\r\nSingapore-orientated  society.   This   is   being\r\n\r\nconsciously carried out by the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards mental health of school children,\r\n\r\nsurely  it is a very important aspect. I  wish  to\r\n\r\ntell  the Member that the Singapore Teachers Union\r\n\r\nconducted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  seminar  in  co-operation  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMental  Health  Association, and  we  had  various\r\n\r\npapers advising teachers on the pitfalls that they\r\n\r\nwould  meet  if they did not handle  the  children\r\n\r\ncarefully,  and that they should be  conscious  of\r\n\r\nthe  importance of mental health of children. This\r\n\r\nhas  been  disseminated to  teachers  without  the\r\n\r\nMinistry doing anything about it. But we did it. I\r\n\r\nam  not  saying that the Ministry does not concern\r\n\r\nitself  with such problems. It probably does.  But\r\n\r\nit  has  got  so many other matters to look  into,\r\n\r\nthat  it probably gives top priority to some other\r\n\r\nthings and less priority to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point I want to put across is that\r\n\r\nteachers on their own, under the leadership of the\r\n\r\nvarious  teachers  unions, are consciously  making\r\n\r\nattempts to fulfil their tasks as nation builders,\r\n\r\nas educators, and as people who fill in the gap as\r\n\r\nparents  when the children are at school. This  is\r\n\r\nseen  to not only by the Singapore Teachers  Union\r\n\r\nbut   also  teachers  unions  led  by  my   fellow\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  this  House  and  other   teachers\r\n\r\nunions. But then, with all the best intentions and\r\n\r\nwith all the best efforts, when one carries out  a\r\n\r\ntask  where human beings are involved, one  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  perfection. With all the  best  intentions\r\n\r\nand  with  all the best efforts of the educational\r\n\r\nauthorities in England, in America, and in various\r\n\r\nother   advanced  countries  in  the  West   where\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of care, attention  and  money\r\n\r\nhave   been  spent  on  education,  yet   hippies,\r\n\r\nstreakers  and  what  have  you  hail  from   such\r\n\r\ncountries.  Is  it because efforts were  not  made\r\n\r\ntowards  achieving desirable objectives  in  their\r\n\r\neducational system? I think nobody could say  with\r\n\r\nconviction  that these countries had  never  spent\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time and energy, money  and  effort,\r\n\r\ntowards     attaining    desirable     educational\r\n\r\nobjectives, and yet such things happen. That  goes\r\n\r\nto prove that in the field of education every time\r\n\r\nan achievement is made, other problems arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I think it must be understood that\r\n\r\nin  the  last  decade or so we have attained  very\r\n\r\nimpressive  objectives  - we  have  brought  about\r\n\r\nintegration,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbilingualism  (and even multi-lingualism  in  some\r\n\r\ncases)  patriotism, loyalty to the country.  These\r\n\r\nare  objectives which other countries took decades\r\n\r\nto  attain.  In Singapore, in one decade  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  them with a greater measure  of  success\r\n\r\nthan   many   other  countries.  These   are   the\r\n\r\nachievements that do not appear in the  press  and\r\n\r\nare  not  publicised. These are  the  achievements\r\n\r\nthat  cannot  be measured tangibly and  are  often\r\n\r\nforgotten.  But the misdeeds of a  few  are  often\r\n\r\npublicised. Therefore, the attention that is drawn\r\n\r\nto  the  misdeeds  and to the failures  is  always\r\n\r\nhighlighted more than the attention drawn  to  the\r\n\r\nsuccesses that we have achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that we\r\n\r\nmust keep on correcting the faults of the few.  We\r\n\r\nmust  make  every  effort towards improvement.  We\r\n\r\nmust   make   every  effort  towards   qualitative\r\n\r\ndevelopment in our educational system, and we must\r\n\r\nnever slacken in all these efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia, I think you have forgotten\r\n\r\nthat you are entitled to 10 minutes only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  will\r\n\r\nanswer them according to the main subject matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many questions on the conditions of\r\n\r\nservice.   The  Member  for  Anson   asked   about\r\n\r\npromotions.  I  did  say that promotions  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried   out   regularly  but   not   necessarily\r\n\r\nannually. It may be shorter than one year. It  may\r\n\r\nbe  longer.  But  we  propose  to  carry  out  one\r\n\r\npromotion exercise at the end of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the point about\r\n\r\nemplacement of holders of foreign degrees  on  the\r\n\r\ngraduate-teachers' scale. This  has  been  debated\r\n\r\nbefore   in  this  House,  and  there  have   been\r\n\r\nprolonged negotiations between the unions and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  I am afraid the position still  remains\r\n\r\nthe same - each case will be considered on its own\r\n\r\nmerit. As regards those teachers who have not been\r\n\r\nemplaced,   they  have  to  satisfy  the   various\r\n\r\nrequirements  before they can be emplaced  on  the\r\n\r\ngraduate-teachers' scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson drew my attention to the\r\n\r\nfact   that  some  teachers  are  drawing   higher\r\n\r\nsalaries than principals and senior teachers. I am\r\n\r\nafraid   this  is  an  inherent  feature  of   the\r\n\r\nrestructured  education service. This  matter  has\r\n\r\nbeen  thrashed out for 1~ years between the  union\r\n\r\nofficials, the Ministry of Education and  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance. This feature has been fully understood\r\n\r\nby all parties as a means to enable flexibility in\r\n\r\nthe deployment of the teaching staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of\r\n\r\nschool  clerks.  As  the  Member  may  recall,   I\r\n\r\nmentioned  it  on  other occasions  that  we  have\r\n\r\ninvited  the Management Services Unit  to  make  a\r\n\r\nstudy of the work-load of clerks in schools.  They\r\n\r\nwill  submit their report soon, and we hope to  be\r\n\r\nable  to make a decision on this. But I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat a clerk is a clerk. He belongs to the General\r\n\r\nClerical Service within the civil service, and  we\r\n\r\njust cannot raise their salary unilaterally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar mentioned something\r\n\r\nwhich  has far-reaching effects. Although  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  say it in so many words, but I think he wants\r\n\r\nto nationalise the entire education service. First\r\n\r\nof  all,  aided schools have their own traditions,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not think they like to be nationalised\r\n\r\nand  become Government schools. Of course,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  prevent  any aided school from  applying  for\r\n\r\nconversion into a Government school, in which case\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not their teachers will  be  absorbed\r\n\r\ninto  the  Government  service  depends  on  their\r\n\r\nqualifications  and  whether  they   satisfy   the\r\n\r\nnecessary requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also queried the difference in conditions of\r\n\r\nservice  between  an aided school  teacher  and  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  school teacher. This  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\ntopics  that  has been discussed year after  year,\r\n\r\nand  I  would  again have to repeat  what  I  said\r\n\r\nbefore.  Aided  school teachers are  aided  school\r\n\r\nteachers.   They   have  certain  benefits   which\r\n\r\nGovernment  school teachers do not enjoy,  as  for\r\n\r\nexample,  CPF. When they resign or are  dismissed,\r\n\r\nthey  still retain their CPF. A Government  school\r\n\r\nteacher,  however,  on resignation  or  dismissal,\r\n\r\nloses all his pension. You cannot have the best of\r\n\r\nboth  worlds.  I  think this also applies  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion of medical benefits for the retired aided\r\n\r\nschool  teachers, which was raised by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong. Again, this is one question  which  I\r\n\r\nhave answered before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson raised the question on\r\n\r\nwhether  there  should be a code  of  conduct  for\r\n\r\nteachers. We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na code of conduct for trainee-teachers at the TTC.\r\n\r\nWe  believe in tackling the problem at  source.  I\r\n\r\nmust  admit  I  am rather touched  by  his  rather\r\n\r\npoetical  speech. We do agree that there  must  be\r\n\r\nsome black-sheep among 20,000 teachers. We try  to\r\n\r\nidentify them. And for the good teachers, we  must\r\n\r\ngive them due recognition. No one disputes that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of\r\n\r\ndeploying English school teachers to teach Chinese\r\n\r\nas  a second language. I would like to correct his\r\n\r\nstatement.  These teachers volunteered,  in  their\r\n\r\npersonal  particulars form, the  information  that\r\n\r\nthey were capable of teaching the second language.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  just that they understand the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage, but that they are capable and  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  teach the second language.  So  we\r\n\r\ndeployed  about  100 teachers  for  this  purpose.\r\n\r\nThirty  of  them changed their mind. They  decided\r\n\r\nthat they cannot teach in that language after all;\r\n\r\nwe  are  making the necessary adjustments  to  see\r\n\r\nthat the students do not suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked whether we could\r\n\r\nforce  children to go to a school in the  vicinity\r\n\r\nof  their houses. For various reasons, I am afraid\r\n\r\nwe  cannot. Fundamentally, they are entitled to  a\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  choice,  and  we  cannot  deny  them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to be very frank, we do not have  enough\r\n\r\nschools  in  densely populated areas.  As  Members\r\n\r\nknow,  we  are  engaged on  a  very  major  school\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme, details of  which  have  just\r\n\r\nbeen   released  a  few  days  ago.  When  it   is\r\n\r\ncompleted,  we  will  be able to  accommodate  the\r\n\r\nwishes  of parents to send their children  to  the\r\n\r\nschool  of their choice as near to their homes  as\r\n\r\npossible.  That  answer, I  believe,  answers  the\r\n\r\nquestion raised by the Member for Aljunied also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Anson and Jurong raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of miscellaneous fees. It is  true  that\r\n\r\nover  the  years  large sums of school  funds  are\r\n\r\naccumulated.  There  are many  schools  with  over\r\n\r\n$50,000 in their account. However, I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer both Members to the Third Report of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic  Accounts Committee to this House presented\r\n\r\non the 2nd of this month:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Your Committee observed that since 1968,\r\n\r\nexpenditure has been on an annual average of  83.9\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the total collections yearly.  Your\r\n\r\nCommittee  appreciate that strict control  appears\r\n\r\nto  have  been exercised by school principals  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education over expenditure.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons for the unspent\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  fees.  First  of  all,  there   are\r\n\r\ncertain  principals who do not consider it prudent\r\n\r\nto  spend  every cent collected from miscellaneous\r\n\r\nfees.  They consider it desirable to have a  small\r\n\r\nbalance  to meet unforeseen expenditure which  has\r\n\r\nto  be  met  from such funds. Secondly, there  are\r\n\r\ncertain schools which deliberately make an  effort\r\n\r\nto  accumulate balances in order to meet  expenses\r\n\r\nfor  special projects. For example, a  school  may\r\n\r\nwant a gymnasium or a bitumen track which costs as\r\n\r\nmuch  as $300,000. So he accumulates this  sum  by\r\n\r\ncareful  saving over the years, without  depriving\r\n\r\nthe  students  of current essential  requirements.\r\n\r\nFor  projects  in  which  the  Ministry  considers\r\n\r\nworthwhile   and  beneficial  to   the   students,\r\n\r\napproval will be given. In fact, approval has been\r\n\r\nconveyed to a few schools for certain requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nIn  the  absence  of the Chairman  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nAccounts  Committee, I feel  I  am  duty-bound  to\r\n\r\nstand  up  and request the Minister  to  read  the\r\n\r\nentire  context  of  the  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Accounts Committee, and not just quoting it\r\n\r\nout of context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I was just coming to the\r\n\r\nthird  point, when I was interrupted.  Perhaps  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member had waited for two seconds,  he  could\r\n\r\nhave saved a few minutes of our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I am going to mention is that the\r\n\r\nSchools Fund Regulations, as they stand now,  have\r\n\r\nbeen too stringent in limiting the scope for which\r\n\r\nfunds may be used and the freedom of principals to\r\n\r\nuse  them.  We are revising these regulations.  We\r\n\r\nare  preparing a \"Revised Schools Fund Manual\"  to\r\n\r\nenable principals to utilise their funds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore freely in the interest of their pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Ministry has also the following\r\n\r\nprojects  which  are too large to  be  handled  by\r\n\r\nschools individually. They have to be met from the\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  fees collected. First  of  all,  we\r\n\r\nintend   to  establish  a  number  of  centralised\r\n\r\nlanguage  laboratories  to  serve  a  cluster   of\r\n\r\nschools,   in  line  with  our  language   policy.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  we  propose to construct and  establish\r\n\r\nvarious  centralised centres for ECA,  which  will\r\n\r\ninclude  facilities such as swimming pools,  where\r\n\r\nthese facilities are not available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these projects in hand and with a\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility and freedom given  to  school\r\n\r\nprincipals to utilise their funds, it is  expected\r\n\r\nvery  soon  that  the collection of  miscellaneous\r\n\r\nfees   may   not  be  sufficient  to   cover   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure   spent  on  students  on   ECA.   The\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous fees may have to be increased again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various points have been raised about textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Education discourages too rapid  a\r\n\r\nchange  of  textbooks, and this  is  the  declared\r\n\r\npolicy; I would like to reiterate this policy.  At\r\n\r\nthe beginning of the year there was a shortage  of\r\n\r\ntextbooks.  We were aware of it, but this  applied\r\n\r\nonly  to a few titles. The position has since been\r\n\r\nrectified.  Of  course, in certain  instances,  it\r\n\r\nseemed to be a deliberate attempt to run down  the\r\n\r\nEducational   Publications   Bureau   by   falsely\r\n\r\nreporting that books published by the EPB were not\r\n\r\navailable,  which is not true.  It  is  true  that\r\n\r\ncertain   textbooks  have  increased   in   price,\r\n\r\nespecially those that are imported. But I have  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  all textbooks published  by  the\r\n\r\nEducational Publications Bureau remain  unchanged,\r\n\r\nand as long as it is feasible we will maintain  it\r\n\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ways of reducing the burden on\r\n\r\nparents  of  the  higher prices of textbooks.  Co-operative  is only one of the various ways.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot quite sure whether it will be as successful as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Ho Swee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged. All the institutions of higher learning\r\n\r\nhave  their co-operatives, and I believe  some  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what to do with them now. We are  toying\r\n\r\nwith  the  idea  of encouraging  a  few  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  with  large enrolments to set  up  a  co-operative  to  buy  books, set  squares,  teaching\r\n\r\nmaterials and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to solve the problem. For\r\n\r\nexample, instead of asking the bookshops to tender\r\n\r\non  the  basis of commissions to be  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nschool, we can ask the bookshops to tender on  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  books, and then allocate the bookstore\r\n\r\nwhich  can sell books at the lowest prices to  the\r\n\r\npupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised the question of fire\r\n\r\nprecautions. We do carry out regular  fire  drills\r\n\r\nin schools to prevent any mishap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been very unfortunate that there has been\r\n\r\nan   explosion  in  a  certain  secondary   school\r\n\r\nrecently.  But  accidents do happen.  We  have  no\r\n\r\nintention to find a scapegoat or go witch-hunting.\r\n\r\nWhat  we are trying to do is to ensure the  safety\r\n\r\nof  children. As a result of the explosion at  the\r\n\r\nAnderson   School,   we   have   drawn   up   very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive precautionary measures  for  schools\r\n\r\nto adopt. We are very pleased to say that had that\r\n\r\nnot been done the recent explosion may have caused\r\n\r\ngreater casualties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that certain schools\r\n\r\nhad  not been inspected for years. I am not  aware\r\n\r\nof any such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards teachers who had not marked their\r\n\r\nclass work or compositions, as pointed out by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Moulmein, there may `have been  a  few\r\n\r\ncases but I do not think we can generalise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assembly, the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he had attended a few assemblies  -  I\r\n\r\nhope  he  himself  stood still instead  of  moving\r\n\r\naround.  Recently the Ministry sent a circular  to\r\n\r\nall principals reminding them of the importance of\r\n\r\nthe  assembly  and  that  it  should  be  properly\r\n\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied mentioned about car\r\n\r\npools,  and  the  success  of  MGS.  Although  MGS\r\n\r\nappears to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolved the problem, I think the problem should not\r\n\r\nexist in the first instance. Not very many schools\r\n\r\nin Singapore have 1,000 cars converging at any one\r\n\r\ngiven time. It should not be so. We are trying  to\r\n\r\nencourage  those  schools in the Central  Business\r\n\r\nDistrict  to  organise car pools. The Ministry  is\r\n\r\nsending  circulars asking principals to  form  car\r\n\r\npools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is not always possible. For example,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  expect  rural schools to form car pools.  The\r\n\r\nchart    circulated    by   the    Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications  must  be  read  in   the   correct\r\n\r\nperspective. It represents the total person  trips\r\n\r\nper  day  throughout the country, not  necessarily\r\n\r\nthose  going  into  the Central Business  District\r\n\r\nwhere the traffic jam is worst. There are very few\r\n\r\nschools in the Central Business District, and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  planning  to  resite  those  schools\r\n\r\nwithin the Central Business District away from the\r\n\r\nCity centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson passed some comments on\r\n\r\nETV.  I think `he is wrong. Our ETV is quite good.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I recall three years ago the Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol, raised a similar question in this  House.\r\n\r\nHe said that ETV should not spend too much time in\r\n\r\nwinning prizes. Our ETV production is of a  fairly\r\n\r\nhigh  standard. The Ministry carries  out  regular\r\n\r\nsurveys to see how frequent does a school use  the\r\n\r\nfacilities provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Henderson that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  sparing no efforts in inculcating  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  proper national values  and  patriotism\r\n\r\namong  our  school  children.  We  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nimportance of doing this at the school  level.  He\r\n\r\ncan  be  rest assured that the Ministry  considers\r\n\r\nthis  as one of its top priorities, although I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think his observations about the attitude  of\r\n\r\nhis  friends  in  the  two  universities  prevail,\r\n\r\notherwise  we  would not have so many professional\r\n\r\nmembers in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also mentioned about the\r\n\r\nTamil word for \"million\". I must apologise for not\r\n\r\nbeing in this Chamber when the answer was given by\r\n\r\nmy colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture.  But  as far as I am aware, the  original\r\n\r\nversion  of  the word \"million\" is being  used  in\r\n\r\nschools. Unfortunately, I am not at all conversant\r\n\r\nin that language, therefore I am in no position to\r\n\r\ncomment on its use over TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar asked about\r\n\r\nimprovements  to  rural schools.  My  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  had on some occasions urged that all  rural\r\n\r\nschools close to each other should try to merge so\r\n\r\nas  to provide better facilities and amenities for\r\n\r\nthe  students. This is the direction we are taking\r\n\r\nand  we are trying to help rural schools to  merge\r\n\r\nto provide better facilities for their pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very flattered that the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  should  quote from my speech. Since  he  has\r\n\r\ndone  so, I presume he must have read the rest  of\r\n\r\nmy  speech and the deliberation at the seminar. So\r\n\r\nthere  is  no need for me to reply to his question\r\n\r\nat  all. Of course, he would have known that in my\r\n\r\nspeech I also made references to an earlier speech\r\n\r\nI  made four months ago regarding what we proposed\r\n\r\nto  do  in that area of social work. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\npresume that answers his question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked a series of\r\n\r\nquestions  on  institutions  of  higher  learning.\r\n\r\nRegarding  the  joint admission exercise,  in  the\r\n\r\npast   the   admission   criteria   of   the   two\r\n\r\nuniversities  differed vastly. In  order  to  have\r\n\r\nbetter   academic  interchange  between  the   two\r\n\r\nuniversities,   we  decided  to  have   a   common\r\n\r\nadmission criterion and procedure. Therefore, from\r\n\r\nthis   year  onwards,  there  will  be  a   common\r\n\r\nadmission  exercise  for courses  common  to  both\r\n\r\nuniversities.   Obviously  if  one   applies   for\r\n\r\nadmission into the Faculty of Medicine,  there  is\r\n\r\nno  point in doing a joint exercise since  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  does not have a medical  faculty.  The\r\n\r\nmembers  on  this  committee are drawn  from  both\r\n\r\nuniversities, the Registrar and the Dean. I do not\r\n\r\nknow the names of the members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked for information on the university\r\n\r\nservice commission, its functions and its terms of\r\n\r\nreference.  As  the  Member is aware,  the  salary\r\n\r\nscales of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  institutions of higher learning, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  universities, were revised  recently.  During\r\n\r\nthe   revisions,  we  made  certain   distinctions\r\n\r\nbetween professional and non-professional academic\r\n\r\nstaff.  For clear-cut cases, like the medical  and\r\n\r\nlegal  professions, accountancy, and so on,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  difficulty  in appraising  the  respective\r\n\r\nlecturers  and putting them on the proper  scales.\r\n\r\nBut  the difficulty exists in the peripheral area.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  should  outstanding  lecturers   in\r\n\r\nEconomics and Business Administration be  emplaced\r\n\r\non  the  professional  scale?  So  the  university\r\n\r\nservice  commission was appointed jointly  by  the\r\n\r\ncouncils of the two universities to consider these\r\n\r\ncases.   The   members   are   drawn   from   both\r\n\r\nuniversities  as  well  as  from  the  professions\r\n\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also raised the point about re-designations\r\n\r\nand   asked   how   many   professors,   associate\r\n\r\nprofessors, etc., were left at Nantah. I am  sorry\r\n\r\nI  do  not  have the exact figures, but I  believe\r\n\r\nthat only a handful of substantive professors  are\r\n\r\nleft  at  the Nanyang University, and as a  result\r\n\r\nNanyang University has started a recruitment drive\r\n\r\nto fill these chairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time we have a common admission criterion\r\n\r\nand the academic structure of the two universities\r\n\r\nharmonised,  we can foresee a greater exchange  of\r\n\r\nstudents  between  the  two universities.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthen   we   could  see  more  students  from   one\r\n\r\nuniversity  taking Honours courses  in  the  other\r\n\r\nuniversity.  But I think it is a bit premature  at\r\n\r\nthis stage to predict what would happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked for information\r\n\r\nabout  how  many graduates from the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Nanyang University  are  being\r\n\r\nadmitted  into  the Institute of Education.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I cannot supply him with the figures  off-hand. He can file a Question and I will supply him\r\n\r\nwith the details. Similarly, this also applies  to\r\n\r\nhis  enquiry  on  the  number of  graduates  being\r\n\r\nturned out by the ITB, how are they employed,  how\r\n\r\nmuch  they  are earning, and how many  staff  have\r\n\r\nresigned. I am sorry I really do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave this sort of information now. I do not have a\r\n\r\ncomputer out here unfortunately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered most of the\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Minister has not  answered  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  raised  by  the Member  for  Henderson.\r\n\r\nSince  the  complaint is also the subject  of  the\r\n\r\nnext  amendment, I will only beg leave to withdraw\r\n\r\nthis amendment after the answer has been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson has said that there was\r\n\r\na  little  act  of  bureaucracy  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nofficers in the Ministry of Education. This is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the true position, Sir. There are a  number\r\n\r\nof  principals who are unhappy over the  arrogance\r\n\r\nof   the  senior  officials  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation,  but  they do not have the  courage  to\r\n\r\nspeak  up  against such arrogance  or  bureaucracy\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  the Member for Henderson  has  said,\r\n\r\nthis   affects   their  rice-bowl   and,   fearing\r\n\r\nvictimisation,  they have to eat the  humble  pie.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, because of my position, I have heard  of\r\n\r\nsuch  complaints from my colleagues in the  course\r\n\r\nof my teaching duties. I would, therefore, like to\r\n\r\nhave  an  answer in this House to the question  of\r\n\r\narrogance on the part of senior officials  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1971 the Ministry of Education announced\r\n\r\nnew regulations for the recruitment of principals.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am not here to speak on the merits or\r\n\r\ndemerits  of  the principals, but I  want  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething with regard to the remarks passed  by  a\r\n\r\nsenior official of the Ministry of Education at  a\r\n\r\ncertain  meeting.  This  official  more  or   less\r\n\r\nchallenged  the principals attending the  meeting,\r\n\r\nsaying  that  if they were not happy because  they\r\n\r\nwere   not  paid  any  charge  allowance  or  post\r\n\r\nallowance  they  could  give  up  their  posts  of\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  go  back  to  teaching.  If  such\r\n\r\narrogant  words  could  be  uttered  by  a  senior\r\n\r\nofficial  in  the  Ministry of  Education,  it  is\r\n\r\ntantamount  to compelling principals  to  rise  in\r\n\r\nrebellion. But some principals among them had  the\r\n\r\nguts to speak out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst the senior official. One of them stood  up\r\n\r\nand  tendered his resignation. But instead he  was\r\n\r\nrequested  to  go  back to school  to  become  the\r\n\r\nprincipal again. Sir, from this incident,  we  can\r\n\r\nsee that we must inculcate in the senior officials\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of Education the  importance  of\r\n\r\ncourtesy  and  tact  in dealing  with  principals,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  they  want to be  harsh  or  hard  in\r\n\r\ndealing with principals, I think they would get  a\r\n\r\nharder  reaction from the principals. If  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  show  courtesy and tact, the principals  will\r\n\r\ngang up together and send a joint petition to  the\r\n\r\nMinister, or even resign en bloc. In fact, it  has\r\n\r\nhappened;  a  principal tendered  his  resignation\r\n\r\nthere   and   then  at  the  meeting.   How   much\r\n\r\nembarrassment was caused to the senior official at\r\n\r\nthat  meeting? So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to look into the attitude  and\r\n\r\npublic  behaviour  of  senior  officials  in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education,  particularly  in   their\r\n\r\ndealings with principals. After all, they are  all\r\n\r\npart  and parcel of the entire educational system.\r\n\r\nThere  should be proper communication and  harmony\r\n\r\nbetween  officials in the Ministry and  principals\r\n\r\nin the schools. They should not employ high-handed\r\n\r\nmeasures and adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards\r\n\r\nprincipals in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised this matter because, although\r\n\r\nit  was brought up by the Member for Henderson, it\r\n\r\nwas  not answered. Therefore, I would like to have\r\n\r\na definite answer from the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nactually  I  did  not speak strongly  against  the\r\n\r\nadministrative staff of the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  emphasised was that the Minister  himself\r\n\r\nand key men in the Education Ministry should think\r\n\r\nout  how  best  to improve `the education  of  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation. What I want to point out  -it\r\n\r\nis  theoretical but an important point -  is  that\r\n\r\nmany  Members of Parliament sitting behind me  had\r\n\r\nsaid  that a small group of teachers had not  been\r\n\r\ndoing their jobs properly. As a matter of fact,  I\r\n\r\ndo not know what the Minister's view\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  on  hearing  that teachers go  to  the  stock\r\n\r\nexchange every day after school hours to speculate\r\n\r\non shares, or telephone the stock brokers for news\r\n\r\non  stocks and shares. I do not know. A few  years\r\n\r\nago,  the ex-Minister for Education mentioned that\r\n\r\na   teacher  should  not  go  to  night-clubs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or in Johore Bahru. I do not know  what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's view is on whether or not teachers\r\n\r\ncan  be  allowed to go to such places. My view  is\r\n\r\nthat  if a teacher is good - the majority of  them\r\n\r\nare  good teachers - he will not have the time  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  such  places.  As a matter  of  fact,  the\r\n\r\nmajority of good teachers in Singapore are  trying\r\n\r\ntheir   best  to  do  something  for  our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.  But  as  far as the  small  group  of\r\n\r\nteachers  is concerned, as the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nhas pointed out, the Minister for Education or his\r\n\r\nofficials should try to find out ways and means to\r\n\r\ncorrect  them. The Minister should  not  just  say\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Education is trying to do its\r\n\r\nbest to help these teachers. Surely they are doing\r\n\r\nvery  well.  But  what I am saying  is  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  do  better.  They should  not  think  that\r\n\r\nbecause they are doing well they can sit down  and\r\n\r\nenjoy  life. The Member for Paya Lebar might  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  you see some key officials in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education will try to play ball\". He might say\r\n\r\nthat; I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to my point which the Minister did\r\n\r\nnot  answer properly. I am quite sure he would  go\r\n\r\nround  quietly  to  all the  schools  in  all  the\r\n\r\nlanguage streams from the primary schools  to  the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools and then to the universities, to\r\n\r\ncheck  on what I had said earlier. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  has also mentioned that point. The Minister\r\n\r\nshould  find  out what is the real situation  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is facing today. He may then have  to\r\n\r\ntake  another year to find a new solution to  help\r\n\r\nnation building!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  was  so flattered merely because  I  had\r\n\r\nquoted  him  that he has missed the wood  for  the\r\n\r\ntrees. I made a few critical remarks and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  share the sentiments of the Member who has just\r\n\r\nspoken before me. One point I made was, and it was\r\n\r\nreported during the course of the seminar, that in\r\n\r\n1971 there were 7,000 school drop-outs. Why do  we\r\n\r\nhave  these  7,000 school drop-outs? What  is  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  doing to find out what is the  cause  of\r\n\r\nthe large number of drop-outs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also talked about emphasis on the mental health\r\n\r\nof  our  school children. The Minister  sought  to\r\n\r\nevade  the  issue.  There was not  a  word  on  my\r\n\r\nreference  to his speeches which he had  made.  He\r\n\r\nseems to be so pleased with his speeches. We  want\r\n\r\nmore  specific answers in this House. What  is  he\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  about  it? And as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHenderson has just said, \"He should not just  say,\r\n\r\n`Just refer to my speech.'\" But if he had listened\r\n\r\nto  me  carefully, he would have noted the remark:\r\n\r\nhow  often  were  his speeches  made  at  seminars\r\n\r\nsubsequently  taken up seriously by  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

It  is now going on for  7  o'clock.  If\r\n\r\nevery  Member who sends in an amendment is allowed\r\n\r\nto  speak twice, or three times, at ten minutes  a\r\n\r\ntime,  what  is  going  to  happen  to  the  later\r\n\r\namendments  that have been submitted?  I  think  a\r\n\r\nlittle judicial recommendation should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. So far, the debate has been\r\n\r\non  general policy, and it is within the bounds of\r\n\r\nStanding Orders for Members to speak. But I  would\r\n\r\nask Members to exercise some control so that those\r\n\r\nMembers who have moved other amendments would have\r\n\r\na chance to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I do not intend to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  argument. But the Minister has  not  answered\r\n\r\ncertain points which I have raised earlier  on.  I\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike to ask him again: what was the criterion used\r\n\r\nfor  the conversion into the new salary scales for\r\n\r\nthe  academic staff in the Nanyang University? Was\r\n\r\nit  based  on  their  academic qualifications  and\r\n\r\nteaching  experience,  or  was  it  based  on  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  that  the staff concerned are  currently\r\n\r\ndrawing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said that after the conversion\r\n\r\nthe number of professors in the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwould  drop and that new professors would have  to\r\n\r\nbe  appointed or recruited. My question is,  among\r\n\r\nthe  present professors in the Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nI  think  most  of  them, if  not  all,  have  the\r\n\r\nrequired  qualifications and experience, otherwise\r\n\r\nthey  would  not  have been allowed  to  teach  in\r\n\r\nNantah. In the circumstances, will they be allowed\r\n\r\nto continue holding the posts of professors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to  make an observation on the  teachers.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the Ministry of Education has  got  to\r\n\r\nreview the holiday scheme for the schools.  I  for\r\n\r\none  cannot  blame the teachers for going  to  the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange or anywhere else. It is because the\r\n\r\nholidays  that are given to them are too long  and\r\n\r\nit  looks  as if they are forced to take them.  In\r\n\r\none year there are four school terms with holidays\r\n\r\nin  between. In March there is one week's holiday,\r\n\r\nin  June, three weeks, and then in September,  one\r\n\r\nweek,  and then the school year ends up with  five\r\n\r\nweeks'  holiday.  So  there  is  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nunproductive  days. I think this  is  the  problem\r\n\r\nthat  we have got to face. We are all humans. When\r\n\r\nwe have got nothing to do, we would be looking for\r\n\r\nsomething to do. This is the problem, and there is\r\n\r\nno  joke about that. I think this is a very  valid\r\n\r\npoint. Most of our very good teachers thought that\r\n\r\nthey are forced to take a holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, could\r\n\r\nI, with your permission, speak now as I have moved\r\n\r\nan  amendment* under Head PA, in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nMain Estimates?\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the total sum to be allocated for Head PA in respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would suggest that the Member\r\n\r\nmight  as  well  wait until the debate  under  the\r\n\r\npresent amendment is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, at the rate this debate is\r\n\r\ngoing on, I would not have a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We still have an hour to go.

I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there are that many teachers who go to  the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange.  Members  will  recall  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has shortened the year-end vacation.  We\r\n\r\nhave  tried  to spread them out evenly  throughout\r\n\r\nthe year. But unfortunately we are handicapped  by\r\n\r\ncertain  restraints, for example, lack of physical\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  conduct  the  PSLE  and  the   GCE\r\n\r\nexaminations.   When   physical   facilities   are\r\n\r\navailable    to    conduct   these    examinations\r\n\r\nseparately,   without  having  to  interrupt   the\r\n\r\nschools'  functions, we should be able  to  spread\r\n\r\nthe holidays out more evenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that I have forgotten to reply to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tiong Bahru about the conversion.  The\r\n\r\nconversion  is  based  on the  existing  salaries.\r\n\r\nThere   is  a  conversion  table  and  we  convert\r\n\r\naccording  to the salaries, because qualifications\r\n\r\nand  experience and other considerations must have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken into account on first appointment.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there is nothing to prevent the  existing\r\n\r\nstaff  from applying for higher posts.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthey have done so and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu said that I was rather\r\n\r\npleased  with  my  own speech. I  am  not.  It  so\r\n\r\nhappened  that  in  my  speech  I  mentioned   the\r\n\r\nmeasures that we were going to take to enlarge the\r\n\r\nsocial  work  unit and to prepare the teachers  to\r\n\r\ncope  with  the different conditions. I  did  make\r\n\r\nreference  earlier  to  the  heavy  load  on   the\r\n\r\nstudents.  That is precisely why we introduce  the\r\n\r\nPPP,  the Primary Pilot Project. The whole project\r\n\r\nis  so constructed that it gives the children  the\r\n\r\nminimum amount of homework to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about the 7,000 school\r\n\r\ndrop-outs. What do we mean by \"drop-out\"? I  think\r\n\r\nthe  figure of 7,000 which he referred to was  the\r\n\r\nfigure  given  in 1971 by a certain local  English\r\n\r\npaper.  It  was  a very well written  article  but\r\n\r\ncompleted  with the wrong headline. I  think  this\r\n\r\narticle  referred to those who twice failed  their\r\n\r\nPrimary School Leaving Examination and were  asked\r\n\r\nto  leave  school. As he may be aware,  the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Board  is  carrying  out  a  very  good\r\n\r\nprogramme known as the Pre-Vocational Class  (PVC)\r\n\r\nto  train  these pupils of 14 to 15  years  for  a\r\n\r\nvocation. At present, about a few thousand of them\r\n\r\nare  in these centres under training by the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Board  to  prepare  them  for  specific\r\n\r\nvocations.  The  courses range  from  construction\r\n\r\ntrade to welding, spraying of motor cars, and  all\r\n\r\nsorts of other trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Henderson that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education never rests on its laurels.\r\n\r\nWe are never satisfied with what we have achieved.\r\n\r\nWe  always  try to aim at a better  and  a  higher\r\n\r\ntarget.  That is what we will do, and will  do  it\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Next year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Even next year, we will still\r\n\r\naim  at  a  higher target even if we have achieved\r\n\r\nwhat  we had set out to do.

I  was  familiar  with  this   incident\r\n\r\nbecause the union saw me on this. I think we  must\r\n\r\nlook at this problem in its true perspective.  The\r\n\r\nsenior  official  made  the  remark  that  if  the\r\n\r\nprincipals  were not prepared to carry  out  their\r\n\r\njobs  they  could step down as school  principals;\r\n\r\nnothing  prevented  them from doing  so  and  they\r\n\r\nwould  lose  nothing. I believe the  long  meeting\r\n\r\nwith  a  large  group  of  school  principals  had\r\n\r\nexasperated him. In fact, this particular  officer\r\n\r\nhad  proved to be one of the most polite  and  the\r\n\r\nleast  aggressive  of all officers.

I am in sympathy  with  what  he\r\n\r\nsaid.  I  feel  that there is a  lack  of  rapport\r\n\r\nbetween officials in the Ministry of Education and\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers in the schools.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe gap between them is widening. I remember a few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  the Minister for Education addressed  a\r\n\r\ngathering of some 25 principals in which  he  said\r\n\r\nthat the gap between the Ministry of Education and\r\n\r\nthe schools should be narrowed. This is proper and\r\n\r\nis an urgent matter to be tackled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some traditional reasons and\r\n\r\ncauses for principals and teachers of school to be\r\n\r\nafraid  of Inspectors of Schools because,  in  the\r\n\r\npast, the Inspectors went to the schools and threw\r\n\r\ntheir  weight around, thinking that they  had  all\r\n\r\nthe power in the world to control the schools, the\r\n\r\nprincipals and the teachers. And they wielded  the\r\n\r\npower  in  order to satisfy their  own  ego.  Sir,\r\n\r\nInspectors  of  Schools  are  given  such  a  name\r\n\r\nbecause we hope that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be  able  to  help the  teachers  in  their\r\n\r\nduties,  instead of throwing their weight  around,\r\n\r\nand  threatening  school teachers  and  principals\r\n\r\nwith  their  power. Henceforth I  hope  that  when\r\n\r\nInspectors  of  Schools visit  the  schools,  they\r\n\r\nwould  go  about in a more friendly  manner,  with\r\n\r\nsincerity, in order to help bridge the gap between\r\n\r\nthem and the teachers and principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to my query the Minister said that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  another promotion  exercise  this\r\n\r\nyear.  This,  of  course, is  good  news  for  the\r\n\r\nteaching    profession.    According     to     my\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  in  the  early   days   when   the\r\n\r\nteachers'   unions  were  negotiating   with   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, there were certain criteria\r\n\r\nfor   promotions,   i.e, in   addition   to   the\r\n\r\nconfidential   reports  put  up  by   the   school\r\n\r\nprincipals, the additional qualifications and  the\r\n\r\nsocial work done by the teachers were also factors\r\n\r\nto  be  considered  for  promotions.  I  think   I\r\n\r\nmentioned   all  this  at  the  last  sitting   of\r\n\r\nParliament,  and  I  hope  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  will  look into this  matter  and  take\r\n\r\nthese  matters  into consideration in  the  second\r\n\r\npromotion exercise to be conducted this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Pre-University classes in the Chinese\r\n\r\nstream  have just started their lessons. According\r\n\r\nto  my  reckoning, it appears that the opening  of\r\n\r\nthese  classes  at  Pre-U level  has  been  rather\r\n\r\nbelated  and the number of students has  dwindled.\r\n\r\nIn  some schools, only one class has been  set  up\r\n\r\ninstead  of  two.  Sir,  before  opening  I  think\r\n\r\ncomprehensive arrangements had been made  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  activities and other facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe  school  for  the whole year.  But  after  the\r\n\r\nopening, there has been a sudden change in respect\r\n\r\nof  the  Pre-U  classes.  This  will  cause  great\r\n\r\ndifficulties  to  the schools and  also  to  those\r\n\r\nstudents   who  have  enrolled  for  these   Pre-U\r\n\r\nclasses. What arrangements are being made to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  interest of these  students  who  have\r\n\r\nenrolled but who have no classes to attend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to raise is the\r\n\r\nquestion of post allowance or charge allowance for\r\n\r\nprincipals. Teachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseem to be losing interest in applying  for\r\n\r\nthe  post  of principals because of the additional\r\n\r\nduties  and the greater responsibility and  burden\r\n\r\nentrusted on principals. This is probably  because\r\n\r\nof  the abolition of the system of paying post  or\r\n\r\ncharge   allowances.  Of  course,  I  agree   that\r\n\r\nteachers  or  those  in  the  teaching  profession\r\n\r\nshould  not  quibble too much  about  dollars  and\r\n\r\ncents.  But teachers are also human beings and  so\r\n\r\nthey   will   also   think  for  themselves.   The\r\n\r\nprincipals  have  more work, more responsibilities\r\n\r\nand longer hours of work. They have even got to be\r\n\r\nschool clerks sometimes or take over classes  when\r\n\r\nnecessary.   During  school  vacations  principals\r\n\r\nstill  have  to  go  back to  the  schools  to  do\r\n\r\nwhatever   there   is  to  be   done.   In   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, who will be interested in the  post\r\n\r\nof  principals or in becoming principals for  that\r\n\r\nmatter?  This  particular  problem  is  of   great\r\n\r\ninterest to us because in some cases teachers  are\r\n\r\npromoted  to  a salary scale higher than  that  of\r\n\r\nprincipals. In such a situation, how do we  expect\r\n\r\nthe principals to be able to supervise the work of\r\n\r\nthe   teachers,  particularly  in  schools   where\r\n\r\nteachers work to rule, so to speak? Sir, I ask for\r\n\r\nthe  restoration of the payment of post or  charge\r\n\r\nallowance for principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since the Member moving the\r\n\r\namendment  has touched on the functions  performed\r\n\r\nby  the  Director of Education, maybe Members  who\r\n\r\nhave,  in  fact, sent in amendments in  regard  to\r\n\r\nsubhead AC 1105 could also speak now and need  not\r\n\r\nthen  move the amendment to that subhead so as  to\r\n\r\nsave time.

Just  now  the\r\n\r\nMinister said that the senior officer had  behaved in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  a manner as I have described was because  in\r\n\r\npursuing his routine work he was harassed by  work\r\n\r\nthat  he  had  misbehaved, and by a  slip  of  the\r\n\r\ntongue he had made such a remark. But there  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese saying that if you are humble enough,  you\r\n\r\nwill  not  bring about such a situation. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the saying means something like  this.  He\r\n\r\nwho  holds  a  high post and is not arrogant  will\r\n\r\nstay  on  the  high  post without  the  danger  of\r\n\r\nfalling  down, and complacency invites harm  while\r\n\r\nhumility begets benefit. Our Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nhas  always  adopted the same attitude in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  matters.  In 1963, when the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\n\"slipped  into  the drain\" because  of  Opposition\r\n\r\nmembers,  he  was still smiling. So we  should  be\r\n\r\nhumble  in  facing all questions and dealing  with\r\n\r\nall  matters.  I  am only trying to  say  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture our senior officers should try to be humble\r\n\r\nso  that their prospects would be bright. If  they\r\n\r\ncould  adopt  such  a humble attitude,  this  will\r\n\r\nbenefit them greatly in their own future and  will\r\n\r\nalso benefit education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Thank you very much, Sir,I\r\n\r\nnever  thought  my time would be  coming.  Let  me\r\n\r\ntouch  on  a  slightly different  theme  from  the\r\n\r\nproblem of teachers. I want to talk about exposure\r\n\r\nto second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no quarrel with the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy on second language. But my criticism is  on\r\n\r\nthe manner in which our second language policy  is\r\n\r\nbeing  implemented.  I agree that  the  additional\r\n\r\nexposure   to   second   language,   thus   almost\r\n\r\nequalising  the exposure time for  the  first  and\r\n\r\nsecond languages, is still new and I believe there\r\n\r\nwill  be teething troubles. How are these teething\r\n\r\ntroubles attended to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only time can tell whether the results of\r\n\r\nsuch  exposure hours mean that students will leave\r\n\r\nschool  competent  in both languages.  Or  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst language going to suffer as a result of  the\r\n\r\nlack  of  time? Would we have our future  citizens\r\n\r\nfluent in two languages, or fluent in neither?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strict adherence to the quota of teachers posted\r\n\r\nto   schools   does  not  allow  for  the   proper\r\n\r\nimplementation of the policy. The magic formula of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of \"x times y upon z\" applied to all\r\n\r\nschools  does not really provide the schools  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  teachers competent in  the  first  and\r\n\r\nsecond  languages  to implement  the  policy.  The\r\n\r\nquota  of teachers must necessarily differ from  a\r\n\r\npurely  English  school to that of  an  integrated\r\n\r\nschool.  And here too the quota will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ndifferent from school to school depending  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber of second languages the school is offering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite rightly, the Ministry has allowed\r\n\r\nprincipals   of   schools  some   flexibility   in\r\n\r\narranging  their  time-tables.  Even  with   these\r\n\r\nflexibilities,  principals  and  senior   teachers\r\n\r\nresponsible for arranging the time-tables find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult   to   implement  the  second   language\r\n\r\nexposure time properly. In fact, there are schools\r\n\r\nwhere, even in lower primary classes, in order  to\r\n\r\nallow  for  a sufficient number of periods  to  be\r\n\r\ntaught  in the two languages as advocated  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  the time-table can only be arranged  in\r\n\r\nsuch a way as to expose a class sometimes to up to\r\n\r\nfive  teachers per day. Can you imagine, Sir, five\r\n\r\ndifferent teachers going to a lower primary  class\r\n\r\nto  teach  the  tiny  tots  in  one  day?  Certain\r\n\r\nsubjects,  for instance, Arithmetic  and  English,\r\n\r\nare  taught by two or three different teachers  in\r\n\r\nthe   same  class.  Sir,  you  need  not   be   an\r\n\r\neducationist to know that this should not be done.\r\n\r\nI  wonder if the Ministry of Education is aware of\r\n\r\nthis  state of affairs. Is the Hon. Minister aware\r\n\r\nthat  certain classes in some primary schools  are\r\n\r\njokingly  named \"international classes\"? In  these\r\n\r\n\"international   classes\"  normally   the   second\r\n\r\nlanguage teacher is the Form Teacher who hops from\r\n\r\nclass  to  class, and the first language  teachers\r\n\r\nbreeze  in  and  breeze  out.  Teachers  who   are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  this state of  affairs  describe\r\n\r\nthem  as chaotic and say that pandemonium prevails\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch classes. Teachers do not know the pupils  and\r\n\r\nthe  pupils  are  bewildered  by  the  number   of\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased to hear from the Minister recently\r\n\r\nthat the inspectorate is to he decentralised. Will\r\n\r\nthe  inspectors,  after  decentralisation,  assist\r\n\r\nschools in getting a sufficient number of required\r\n\r\nteachers  so that the time-tables can be  properly\r\n\r\narranged?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that needs looking into is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  tuckshops in the  schools.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthese  days of rising cost of living we  ought  to\r\n\r\nsee  that the shrinking dollar is stretched to the\r\n\r\nmaximum. One area where the Ministry can  help  is\r\n\r\nto  review the tuckshop rentals so that the  meals\r\n\r\nand   drinks  sold  at  the  tuckshops   are   not\r\n\r\nexpensive. The Ministry should also look into  the\r\n\r\npossibility of supplying mass produced meals to  a\r\n\r\nnumber   of  school  tuckshops  that  are  grouped\r\n\r\ntogether in one area. Such mass prepared meals  in\r\n\r\ncentral   kitchens  could  be  cheaper  and   more\r\n\r\nhygienically prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's policy on family\r\n\r\nplanning.  The  Hon. Minister for Health  gave  at\r\n\r\nleast  one year's warning to people who refuse  to\r\n\r\nkeep  their families small. He has introduced  the\r\n\r\nincreased  accouchement charges  for  mothers  who\r\n\r\nhave more than two children only after a lapse  of\r\n\r\n10  months. He told them to be careful during  the\r\n\r\n10  months. In other words, warning has been given\r\n\r\nthat  those who do not pay heed to it have to  pay\r\n\r\nmore for the luxury of having an additional child.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of Education, in its enthusiasm  to\r\n\r\nsupport the small family concept, clamped down  on\r\n\r\nthe registration of the third child in a school of\r\n\r\nthe  parents' choice, i.e, where elder sisters and\r\n\r\nbrothers are then schooling. In other words, seven\r\n\r\nyears  later  the third child has to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nsins  committed by his parents. Sir,  this  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion  is  misplaced enthusiasm. This enthusiasm\r\n\r\nmust  have  contributed to additional hardship  to\r\n\r\nparents  with more than two children, and  perhaps\r\n\r\nalso contributed to the transport problem as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  children  in  a family had to  be  posted  to\r\n\r\ndifferent schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to\r\n\r\nanswer  the  Member for Telok Blangah  first?  His\r\n\r\nremarks  on the second language and the  increased\r\n\r\nexposure time for second language, and so on,  are\r\n\r\nactually  confined to primary schools where  there\r\n\r\nis no such thing as specialist teachers. All these\r\n\r\nchanges resulting in what we call the block  time-tabling,  are  being carried out  in  the  various\r\n\r\nschools.  What  does block time-tabling  mean?  It\r\n\r\nsimply  means  this: all subjects that  are  being\r\n\r\ntaught in one single language are put together. We\r\n\r\nalso  increase  the exposure time  of  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage to 43 per cent. The advantages are  quite\r\n\r\nobvious.  First  of  all, we  allow  teachers  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of allocating teaching time  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  subjects  within  the  same  block,  i.e.\r\n\r\nsubjects   being  taught  in  the  same  language,\r\n\r\ninstead  of adhering to the very strict time-table\r\n\r\nprescribed.    Secondly,   it    eliminates    the\r\n\r\nundesirable feature at the moment where we turn on\r\n\r\nand  off  a child's interest in any subject  every\r\n\r\nhalf-hour according to the clock. Thirdly, it cuts\r\n\r\nout the unnecessary wastage of curriculum time  as\r\n\r\nteachers are not required to teach single subjects\r\n\r\nat  half-hourly intervals. Fourthly,  the  43  per\r\n\r\ncent  magic  figure we worked out represents  half\r\n\r\nthe teaching load of a single teacher. The purpose\r\n\r\nis  that  each teacher will take two classes,  and\r\n\r\nfor every class the children will be taught by two\r\n\r\nprincipal  teachers for the two  main  blocks  and\r\n\r\nother  teachers for the third block which consists\r\n\r\nof  physical education, music, arts and craft, and\r\n\r\nso  on.  Arising out of the fourth  advantage,  we\r\n\r\nhope    to    cultivate    a    more    meaningful\r\n\r\nstudent/teacher relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately when this system was introduced at\r\n\r\nthe beginning of the year there was some confusion\r\n\r\nand  it backfired. As the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\npointed   out,   these   are  the   \"international\r\n\r\nclasses\",  where  five  teachers  teach  the  same\r\n\r\nsubjects, and so on. This is obviously not in line\r\n\r\nwith  the rationale of the policy. Since then  the\r\n\r\ninspectors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  going round to schools to  assist  the\r\n\r\nprincipals in re-arranging the time-table. We have\r\n\r\nsent out circulars to school principals explaining\r\n\r\nhow this can be done. We invite principals who are\r\n\r\nin  difficulty to contact the Inspectorate so that\r\n\r\nassistance  on  how to arrange  this  block  time-tabling could be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this new approach will result in a fall\r\n\r\nof  standards of either one or both languages only\r\n\r\ntime  will  tell, as the Member for Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nhas also pointed out. Personally, I do not believe\r\n\r\nit  will lead to a fall in standards. We all  know\r\n\r\nthat  every lesson could be a language lesson  and\r\n\r\nwithin  every  language lesson  knowledge  can  be\r\n\r\nimparted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, 1971, that was a few years' ago, we\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  primary pilot project,  the  PPP.\r\n\r\nThis  was  discussed in this House and  was  given\r\n\r\nwide  coverage in the media. I do not want  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  this again lest I will be accused  of  being\r\n\r\ncarried away by my own work. Last year, we invited\r\n\r\nsome  overseas  experts  to  do  an  analysis  and\r\n\r\nevaluation of this particular project. The  object\r\n\r\nwas  to  evaluate  those  children  who  had  gone\r\n\r\nthrough the PPP against those who had not,  taking\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  their social  and  economical\r\n\r\nbackground. The preliminary results indicated that\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  spoken and written  English  of\r\n\r\nthose  children who had undergone the PPP  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  higher.  PPP,  incidentally,  Sir,  is  the\r\n\r\nforerunner of the block time-tabling, which I have\r\n\r\njust mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked questions about tuckshops. We\r\n\r\nhave  reduced  the  rental  of  tuckshops  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of this year. We have also  introduced,\r\n\r\nsince last year, a milk feeding scheme whereby  we\r\n\r\napproached a major dairy to provide milk at a very\r\n\r\nlow  price,  10  cents  per  150  milliliters,  to\r\n\r\nprimary  school children. It has been extended  to\r\n\r\nabout  30,000 students at the moment. We  plan  to\r\n\r\nextend  it  further. At present  our  efforts  are\r\n\r\nconcentrated in densely populated housing  estates\r\n\r\nwhere one-room flat prevails. We are negotiating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith dairy firms to see whether they can provide a\r\n\r\nwholesome meal, milk with different flavours, plus\r\n\r\nsomething more substantial, like a bun or pudding,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  We  are working on this  scheme.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  our  main effort will be concentrated  at\r\n\r\nthe lower income group at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah queried the policy\r\n\r\nof  admission  to primary one. It seems  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education is a bit heartless  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect, but it is not quite so. No one is  denied\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity of choice. What we have done over\r\n\r\nthe  years  was  to  accord privilege  to  certain\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people. This year we have  decided  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw this privilege to a group of people, i.e.\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the fourth and higher order.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that the Ministry of Education has at no time\r\n\r\ngiven this warning that children of the fourth and\r\n\r\nhigher order will not enjoy this privilege. Anyway\r\n\r\nthe  privilege is something earned  and  may  vary\r\n\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to point this out. The\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning  campaign has been  going  on  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  a long time, and  the  poster  for\r\n\r\nfamily  planning,  which is a  silhouette  of  two\r\n\r\nparents  and  two children has been  in  existence\r\n\r\nsince  1966.  It is now used as the  logo  of  the\r\n\r\nFamily Planning Board. Members will recall that in\r\n\r\nthe  1967 National Day Message it was specifically\r\n\r\nmentioned that Singapore wants to encourage people\r\n\r\nto  have  small  families of three or  even  fewer\r\n\r\nchildren. Then the Minister for Health gave a  10-month  warning  in 1968 that accouchement  charges\r\n\r\nfor  children of the fourth and higher order  were\r\n\r\nto be increased in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not really that heartless. We entertained\r\n\r\nhardship cases. Where a child is the last child in\r\n\r\na   family,  we  allow  him  to  enjoy  the   same\r\n\r\nprivilege.  Where  one  of the  parents  has  gone\r\n\r\nthrough sterilisation, we also allow the child  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the same privilege, whether he is the  last\r\n\r\nchild  or not. Having done all these, out  of  the\r\n\r\n47,600  pupils  who  applied  for  admission  into\r\n\r\nprimary one, 93 per cent got a place in schools of\r\n\r\ntheir choice. Of the 3,000 who did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  get a place in schools of their choice,  only\r\n\r\n500 belonged to the fourth child and higher order.\r\n\r\nSo  although we may sound heartless, in hard facts\r\n\r\nand figures we are not that bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked about the promotion\r\n\r\nexercise.  He  will recall that the  Ministry  had\r\n\r\nwritten  to  all the teachers' unions asking  them\r\n\r\nfor  their views about shortlisting and so on.

In Jurong Town, which is\r\n\r\nin  my constituency, the population is increasing.\r\n\r\nPeople  are now moving in to live in Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nII  and  the total population will be about 50,000\r\n\r\nultimately.  At  about this  time  last  year  the\r\n\r\nMinister  said in this House that there  would  be\r\n\r\nplans to build a primary school. However, only now\r\n\r\ndo  we hear that work has just started. So I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister whether he can speed  up\r\n\r\nthe work and when can this school be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is that even if the primary\r\n\r\nschool is completed, it cannot accommodate all the\r\n\r\nstudents from Neighbourhood II. I believe there is\r\n\r\na primary school called the Joo Long School in the\r\n\r\nvicinity.  The school is trying to  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office for permission to extend its premises\r\n\r\nand it was advised to make a request to the Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation. But the Jurong Town Corporation\r\n\r\nin  turn asked the school to apply to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education. So I would like to urge the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education to give favourable consideration  to\r\n\r\nits application for extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  as the hon.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  piling work started about 10 days  ago.  If\r\n\r\nall  goes  well, the school will be ready sometime\r\n\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Joo Long School, the management\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  the  school has enquired  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility of constructing an extension block  of\r\n\r\n10  classrooms. The Ministry of Education welcomes\r\n\r\nthe   provision   of  additional  school   places.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as far as Joo Long School is  concerned,\r\n\r\nit  would be better and in their interest too  if,\r\n\r\nbefore implementing this proposed extension block,\r\n\r\nthey can further consider whether or not the place\r\n\r\nis  due  for  urban renewal, whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  going to build more schools  in  the\r\n\r\narea, and whether or not they have enough land for\r\n\r\nthe building extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, according to the reply given by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, the  primary  school  in\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood II will be completed  next  year.

Can the Hon. Minister inform me of  any\r\n\r\neffective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattempts to solve this problem? I do believe there\r\n\r\nis  a grave need for school social care. This will\r\n\r\nenable  a  child  to derive maximum  benefit  from\r\n\r\neducation, by identifying and trying to help solve\r\n\r\nthe  social problems affecting him and his family.\r\n\r\nOf course, the role of the teacher in this process\r\n\r\nis  of  prime importance, though many teachers  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  are  insufficiently informed  of  the\r\n\r\nworkings of the social services. It is imperative,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   that  teacher-training  should   also\r\n\r\ninclude  the study of the social factors affecting\r\n\r\nchildren's educational progress, and some study of\r\n\r\nthe  social  services. Another possibility  is  to\r\n\r\nemploy  social workers to be attached to  schools.\r\n\r\nWill  the Hon. Minister consider implementing  any\r\n\r\none of these proposals, and elaborate his thinking\r\n\r\nin regard to this rather real problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the\r\n\r\npresent  increasing rate of crime  which  includes\r\n\r\ndrug-taking,  drug-pushing,  and  other   offences\r\n\r\namong  our  youth. Let me quote some figures  from\r\n\r\nthe  Police Department's Annual Reports on  youths\r\n\r\nconvicted   by  Juvenile  courts.   1968   -   444\r\n\r\nconvictions; 1969 - 439 convictions;  1970  -  332\r\n\r\nconvictions; 1971 - 390 convictions;  1972  -  633\r\n\r\nconvictions.  This  reflects to  some  extent  our\r\n\r\npresent  education policies. There are some  areas\r\n\r\nin our education policies that could change to the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  alleviating this problem.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  deal with one area; the area  of  school\r\n\r\nholiday amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, amenities available to\r\n\r\nchildren  during  school  holidays  need   to   be\r\n\r\nextended  and improved. All school playing  fields\r\n\r\nshould be made available to groups of children and\r\n\r\nyoung  people during the school holidays;  various\r\n\r\nrestrictions are now placed upon the use  of  some\r\n\r\nschool  playing fields. No doubt there  should  be\r\n\r\nadequate  supervision. There are also available  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  swimming  pools in  Singapore,  and  a\r\n\r\npolicy that the Ministry could adopt would  be  to\r\n\r\nenable  organised  groups of  school  children  on\r\n\r\nholidays to utilise them.

The\r\n\r\nMinistry  should  look  into  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  its  own  holiday  camps,   properly\r\n\r\norganised and supervised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is clearly a need to improve tremendously\r\n\r\nboth  the  scale  and quality  of  school  holiday\r\n\r\namenities. Such amenities are obviously helpful to\r\n\r\nmany  parents  and  children and  have  particular\r\n\r\nvalue  in  an urbanised area like Singapore  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  very little open space.  This  need  is\r\n\r\nfurther  accentuated by the presence of  high-rise\r\n\r\nhousing  and  heavy  traffic  on  the  roads.   In\r\n\r\naddition properly organised amenities have also an\r\n\r\neducational value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Hon.
