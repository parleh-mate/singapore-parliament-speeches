It has an annual budget approximating\r\n\r\n$1,000 million. It is also common knowledge that  the\r\n\r\nHDB is ruler of more than half the population. As its\r\n\r\nbuilding  statistics  go up,  which  is,  of  course,\r\n\r\ncommendable,  it  becomes  more  and  more  powerful,\r\n\r\n\"ruling\" more and more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople with each passing day. It is expected that  by\r\n\r\n1980,  some 75% of the population will be  living  in\r\n\r\nhigh-rise  flats, for it is an inexorable truth  that\r\n\r\nhigh-rise  living will be a way of life for  most  of\r\n\r\nus,  whether  we  like  it or  not.  Apart  from  the\r\n\r\neffective  leadership,  our political  stability  and\r\n\r\neconomic  progress, the  HDB's  successful   housing\r\n\r\nprogramme  has in many ways reflected the  Republic's\r\n\r\nmultifarious achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out that as a consequence of\r\n\r\nall  this  success  - a consequence  that  is  rather\r\n\r\ndisconcerting there appears to be a deterioration  of\r\n\r\nadministrative  efficiency and effectiveness  in  the\r\n\r\nHDB.   This  is  especially  true  in  planning   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  recreational  facilities  in   housing\r\n\r\nestates   in   New  Towns.  I  say  this   with   all\r\n\r\nseriousness. It is a growing sore point which  should\r\n\r\nbe  checked. A fully developed New Town can  engender\r\n\r\nand stimulate the growth of a crop of urban problems.\r\n\r\nIn   years   to  come,  these  problems  can   assume\r\n\r\ninsurmountable  proportions  unless  there   is   the\r\n\r\nadministrative skill, efficiency and effectiveness to\r\n\r\nstem the tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be true that the Estate Area Office and the\r\n\r\nHDB  Headquarters are monitoring the  situation.  But\r\n\r\nfrom what I have personally experienced over the past\r\n\r\nthree months at Bedok New Town, there is a whole host\r\n\r\nof  shortcomings. I do not mean to say that I am  not\r\n\r\ngetting   the  full  cooperation  of  the   officials\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Far  from  it. My relationship  with  the\r\n\r\nEstate Area Officer and his officials is, at the best\r\n\r\nof  terms. They are even present at my monthly  meet-the-people  sessions or forums  where  they  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer  some of the queries made by the residents  on\r\n\r\nmatters pertaining to HDB policies. My complaints are\r\n\r\nmore in the area of decision-making and prompt action\r\n\r\nin  attending to problems or requests made either  by\r\n\r\nthe  residents or through me. All important  matters,\r\n\r\nSir,  have  to  be  referred to the  Headquarters  in\r\n\r\nMaxwell   Road.   Strange  as  it   may   seem,   but\r\n\r\nnevertheless true, matters and problems pertaining to\r\n\r\nBedok New Town have to be referred to the Area Office\r\n\r\nin  Marine Parade. Why, Sir? Because there is no Area\r\n\r\nOffice in Bedok New Town. This is not so bad. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  New Town that I know, the residents have  to\r\n\r\ntravel  quite  a long distance to pay their  rentals,\r\n\r\netc.  However,  I am glad to hear that  the  plan  to\r\n\r\nconstruct the new Area Office in Bedok New  Town  has\r\n\r\nbeen  finalised and construction will start very soon\r\n\r\nand  it  is  expected to be completed by  early  next\r\n\r\nyear.   My   point  is:  why  is  the  planning   and\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   the   Area   Office   not    done\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  with the moving in  of  residents  to\r\n\r\navoid  unnecessary inconvenience and grumblings  from\r\n\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for almost two years now, the\r\n\r\nchildren  and the youths in Neighbourhood I of  Bedok\r\n\r\nNew   Town   have   no  playground  or   recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities.  They  are thus forced  to  play  in  car\r\n\r\nparks,  in  the estate's by-roads, void  decks,  open\r\n\r\nspaces  between blocks, and at the concrete concourse\r\n\r\nat  the  market and hawker food centre  which  causes\r\n\r\nannoyance  to  the  residents.  Yet  there  are  five\r\n\r\nhectares  of  open  space which is  earmarked  for  a\r\n\r\nminiature  park  and recreational facilities.  It  is\r\n\r\nbeing  planted  with trees and one section  has  been\r\n\r\nfenced  in  with barbed wires. The barbed wires  have\r\n\r\nbeen  removed recently after the residents  had  made\r\n\r\ncomplaints  through  me and direct  to  the  officers\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the rationale behind all this? I know why\r\n\r\nthe  HDB did this. They do not want the children  and\r\n\r\nthe  youngsters to play in it. Could  you  imagine  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  16,000 more than half  of  whom  are\r\n\r\nyoung  people,  without a single place  for  them  to\r\n\r\nplay? I have made some suggestions to the Area Office\r\n\r\nas  to  how the problem of lack of playing facilities\r\n\r\ncould  be  temporarily solved.  I  suggested  to  the\r\n\r\nofficials  concerned to remove some of the  trees  to\r\n\r\nsomewhere else so that the children could play  there\r\n\r\ntemporarily  until the open space was developed.  But\r\n\r\nthey  had  no authority to act as such matters  could\r\n\r\nonly be decided by the top officials at Maxwell Road.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am  happy to inform the House  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State has recently announced in his reply\r\n\r\nto   an   Oral  Question  that  the  development   of\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities for Neighbourhood I would  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  soon  and that it  is  expected  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted by early next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Development Board is naturally\r\n\r\nprimarily  concerned with achieving  targets  to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  the  waiting  period for  applicants.  This  is\r\n\r\naccepted.  But  in  the anxiety to  meet  targets  of\r\n\r\nbuilding flats, a lot of things tend to be overlooked\r\n\r\nin  some areas. In the case of Neighbourhood I  where\r\n\r\nthe  population  is  now  concentrated,  the  general\r\n\r\ncomplaints  that  I  receive from residents  are  the\r\n\r\nconspicuous  absence or lack of playing  grounds  and\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities, whereas  the  residents  of\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade who moved in at the same time  as  the\r\n\r\nBedok  New Town residents are enjoying all  Sorts  of\r\n\r\nfacilities and amenities which are provided not  only\r\n\r\nby  the Housing and Development Board but also by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council and the Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Ministry of National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to avoid such situations which could easily\r\n\r\nlead to misinterpretations and grouses by disgruntled\r\n\r\nresidents,   would   the   Minister   for    National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Communications consider proposing  to\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  to delegate more powers to the Area  Estate\r\n\r\nOfficers  who,  in  fact,  come  directly  under  the\r\n\r\nEstates  Department, which is within the Estates  and\r\n\r\nLand  Division  of  the HDB, so that  they  can  make\r\n\r\ndecisions  that  are urgent and obvious  without  the\r\n\r\ntime-consuming   necessity   of   having   to   refer\r\n\r\neverything to Headquarters at Maxwell Road.  If  this\r\n\r\nis done, Sir, it will cut down a lot of the customary\r\n\r\nred-tape,  bureaucractic  muddle  and  much  of   the\r\n\r\nofficial arrogance that is sometimes experienced.  It\r\n\r\nwill lead to greater efficiency in the management  of\r\n\r\nthe housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new towns like Bedok New Town, which may not be\r\n\r\nvery large in terms of size, are nevertheless densely\r\n\r\npopulated  when  the  flats are fully  occupied,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore concern the lives and livelihood of  people\r\n\r\nfrom  all  walks of life. A fully developed New  Town\r\n\r\ncould house as many as a quarter of a million or more\r\n\r\npeople  in the Republic, and that is no mean  figure,\r\n\r\nconsidering the Republic's total population  of  just\r\n\r\nover two million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to make this special\r\n\r\nrequest  to  the Minister in regard to planning  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment    of   recreational    facilities    in\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood II of Bedok New Town. It might  be  an\r\n\r\nadministrative oversight or bad planning on the part\r\n\r\nof   HDB   that   in  the  case  of   residents   of\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  I  who had to wait almost  two  years\r\n\r\nbefore   they   could  get  their  playgrounds   and\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Haji Sha'ari, your 10 minutes are up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Can I have another one or\r\n\r\ntwo minutes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sorry, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, we have to\r\n\r\nimport  our  livestock,  particularly  cattle,   from\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries.

Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, members of the\r\n\r\npublic  are  so  confused as to which  department  is\r\n\r\nactually  doing  the  day-to-day  work  relating   to\r\n\r\nplanning. The Development Control Division broke  off\r\n\r\nfrom  the Planning Department in 1974 and came  under\r\n\r\nthe wing of the Building Control Division of the PWD.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the public who need advice  in  planning\r\n\r\nmatters  have  close  contact  with  the  Development\r\n\r\nControl  Division rather than the Planning Department\r\n\r\nwhich  only  deals  with the long term  Master  Plan.\r\n\r\nSince   the  Development  Control  Division   is   an\r\n\r\nimportant department in Singapore, dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuildings in the private sector, change of use,  etc.\r\n\r\nits  status should be upgraded as a Department on its\r\n\r\nown directly under the Ministry. Not enough publicity\r\n\r\nhas  been  given to the public as to which department\r\n\r\ndeals  with  Government projects or  those  from  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  and  which department  deals  with\r\n\r\napplications from the private sector. I have had many\r\n\r\nqueries  from  the  public on the confused  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs. Even some professional people do not seem to\r\n\r\nknow  that part of the Planning Department's work  is\r\n\r\ndone  by the Development Control Division, where many\r\n\r\nTown  Planners  are employed. Since  the  Development\r\n\r\nControl  Division is a very important department,  it\r\n\r\nshould be part and parcel of the Planning Department.\r\n\r\nIt  is senseless and illogical to split the two. They\r\n\r\nshould  be  merged  in  the interest  of  expediency,\r\n\r\nefficiency,  prestige and, last but not least,  there\r\n\r\nwill be less confusion among members of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in 1966 the Development Control Division\r\n\r\nwas  taken  out  of the Planning Department  and  put\r\n\r\nunder the Chief Building Surveyor's Department.  That\r\n\r\ncaused  utter confusion. In 1970, it was returned  to\r\n\r\nthe  Planning  Department. In 1974,  the  Development\r\n\r\nControl Division was taken out again and this time it\r\n\r\nwas  put  under the Public Works Department.  Why  is\r\n\r\nthere all this confusion? Would not the staff be also\r\n\r\npuzzled? It is about time things were put right  once\r\n\r\nand for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Control Division's officers and\r\n\r\nplanners are doing a good job by providing the day-to-day  service  to the public on planning problems  and\r\n\r\nadvice. This is the feedback which I got from members\r\n\r\nof  the  public who often approached me  on  planning\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago the former Chief Planner resigned\r\n\r\nfrom  the service and migrated to another country  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  a  post  there. Why is the  post  of  Chief\r\n\r\nPlanner still vacant? Are there no suitably qualified\r\n\r\nlocal town planners with experience to fill the post?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is being done to upgrade the long service staff\r\n\r\nin  this  department who have reached the maximum  of\r\n\r\ntheir salary scale? If something is not done to boost\r\n\r\ntheir  morale and provide incentives, the experienced\r\n\r\nand  dedicated ones may resign and go away  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries, like the former Chief Planner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on urbanisation, I wonder what is the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Building Control Division in  granting\r\n\r\npermits for different lots of land. I have received a\r\n\r\nnumber of complaints that many adjacent lots of  land\r\n\r\nhave  been granted permits with different conditions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the first lot of land is given a permit\r\n\r\nto  put  up  an  eight-storey building,  whereas  the\r\n\r\nadjacent lot is not even permitted to put up  a  six-storey  building.  There seems to  be  some  sort  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  here.  May  I  know   what   is   the\r\n\r\nguideline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have also received complaints from some\r\n\r\npeople  that the Building Control Division  does  not\r\n\r\npermit  some  homes to hold group prayers,  and  they\r\n\r\ngive  a  lot of trouble to the occupants. Why  cannot\r\n\r\nthey  allow  the  people to carry on  their  prayers?\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  they  are  not causing  any  problem  to\r\n\r\nanyone. Could the Minister clarify this point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, on the 21st\r\n\r\nMarch,  1975, in this House under your able guidance,\r\n\r\nI  brought up the matter in regard to the deletion of\r\n\r\ncertain  clauses  from the Sand and Granite  Quarries\r\n\r\nRegulations,  1971,  when the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  took  over  the  enforcement  of   these\r\n\r\nRegulations from the Ministry of Labour and  replaced\r\n\r\nthe  1971  Regulations with the 1974  Regulations.  I\r\n\r\nwanted  to  know  why  this was done  as  it  clearly\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  the  workers'  health   due   to   the\r\n\r\nlessening  of  the  dust  control  measures  and  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  medical checks. Free  silica,  a  dust\r\n\r\npollutant,   emitted  from  granite  quarries,   when\r\n\r\ninhaled,  can  cause a pulmonary disease,  silicosis,\r\n\r\nwhich  is a dreadful disease indeed; it is incurable,\r\n\r\nrendering  the ones inflicted a painful  and  useless\r\n\r\nlife resembling the living dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to my queries on the deletion, the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment said [Hansard, Vol. 34, 21st March, 1975. col. 785]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Potong Pasir referred to\r\n\r\nthe deletion of two important clauses in the Sand and\r\n\r\nGranite Quarries Regulations of 1974. There seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  substance in what he says. I was not aware of the\r\n\r\ndeletion of these two clauses. Perhaps there is  good\r\n\r\nreason, but there does not appear to be. But  I  will\r\n\r\nlook  into  these regulations and reinsert these  two\r\n\r\nclauses if that should be done.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on 24th November, 1976, the Member for Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  queried the deletion of certain  clauses  from\r\n\r\nthe   1971  Regulations  when  the  1974  Regulations\r\n\r\nreplaced  them. The Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nand Communications in reply stated [Hansard, Vol. 35,\r\n\r\n24th November, 1976, cols. 1071 and 1072]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, these Regulations were deleted because in\r\n\r\ndrafting  the  1974 Regulations, the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nhad advised that it would be undesirable to duplicate\r\n\r\nprovisions  which  already  existed  in  some   other\r\n\r\nlegislation. The deleted Regulations are  covered  by\r\n\r\nthe Factories Act. 1973.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the only regulations contained in the\r\n\r\nFactories Act deleted were Regulations 20, 21, 22 and\r\n\r\n23 which I accept, and these were not the regulations\r\n\r\nthat  came  under query by the Member for Toa  Payoh.\r\n\r\nRegulations  11, 12, 13. 16, 17, 18 and  19  are  the\r\n\r\nones  that  must be included in the 1974 Regulations.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the ones pertaining to dust  control  and\r\n\r\nhealth  measures  that, without  which,  could  cause\r\n\r\nhealth problems not only for the workers but also the\r\n\r\npeople  living  around  the quarries,  many  of  them\r\n\r\nsquatters  with no knowledge of the dangers.  Due  to\r\n\r\nthe absence of these clauses dust levels from the HDB\r\n\r\nquarry  in  Mandai, for instance, continue to  remain\r\n\r\nhigh.  It  is about time the Ministry took action  to\r\n\r\nrestore the Regulations to an effective state.

Let me assure him that the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board does not  seek  to  rule  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore but seek to house the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit puzzled by his remarks. He said that\r\n\r\nthere  was no delegation of authority to the officers\r\n\r\nto  make  small  decisions  and  yet  he  found  them\r\n\r\nhelpful, co-operative and prompt in taking action. If\r\n\r\nthere  had been no delegation of authority, the staff\r\n\r\nwould be unable to take prompt action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that we know that the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  is expanding and will soon be managing a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion  of  dwellings  in  Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nkeeping   with   modern  management   methods,   only\r\n\r\nimportant  policy  matters are  decided  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nheadquarters  and, wherever possible, administrative\r\n\r\nand  routine  procedures are delegated to  the  local\r\n\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the planning of new towns. It would be\r\n\r\nideal  if  we  can at the same time provide  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  of  a  town as well  as  housing.  Marine\r\n\r\nParade  has  been  quoted as  an  example  where  the\r\n\r\nresidents  are  able  to enjoy living  in  very  good\r\n\r\nquality  flats  and  at the same time  have  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  available. It is  the  same  with  Bedok.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, Sir, we would like to provide  all\r\n\r\nthe facilities at the same time but perhaps there may\r\n\r\nbe  some technical reasons for being unable to do so.\r\n\r\nOur  first  priority, of course, is  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nhousing,  and  here  I  think  the  Member  is  quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that an assurance has been  given  to  him\r\n\r\nthat   the  recreational  facilities  he  seeks   for\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood I will be completed very soon and  work\r\n\r\nis going on in Neighbourhood II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning for a new town, there are certain basic\r\n\r\nprinciples. The town shall be self-contained. As  far\r\n\r\nas  possible,  it should have a town  centre,  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities, playing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfields,  parking areas. When the plan is being  drawn\r\n\r\nup  the  Housing  Board would normally  consult  with\r\n\r\nother  Government  agencies, such  as  the  PWD, the\r\n\r\nSports  Council and even the bus company so that  all\r\n\r\nthe  necessary amenities could be provided. Also from\r\n\r\ntime to time we get feedbacks from residents, and MPs\r\n\r\ntoo,  about  shortages of certain requirements  or  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  facilities in some of the towns. Where  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  are useful they are adopted.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nsuggestions from MPs are always welcome when  we  are\r\n\r\nplanning   a  new  town.  I  think  that  should   be\r\n\r\nsufficient answer or clarification for the Member for\r\n\r\nBedok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister recently visited Thailand and\r\n\r\nconcluded  an agreement with the Thai Government.  In\r\n\r\nthat  agreement, there  is provision  for  a  cattle\r\n\r\nproject  in  a  joint venture between  the  Marketing\r\n\r\nOrganisation  for  Farmers  of  Thailand  (MOF)   and\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Primary  Industries  Enterprises  (PIE).\r\n\r\nThis   joint   venture  will  enable  our  veterinary\r\n\r\nsurgeons  to participate in the management of  cattle\r\n\r\nrearing  in  Thailand for export  and  it  will  also\r\n\r\nenable  our veterinary surgeons to examine the cattle\r\n\r\nbefore export to Singapore to ensure that they do not\r\n\r\nsuffer from any disease. So this project will give us\r\n\r\nan  additional  supply  of cattle.  Whether  it  will\r\n\r\nreally  help to lower the price of beef or  not  will\r\n\r\ndepend upon a lot of factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one would expect that with more avenues of\r\n\r\nsupply,  prices are likely to fall. But  here,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave said, it depends upon a lot of other things, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  transport  cost and  feed  cost.  But  our\r\n\r\npurpose  here  is, of course, to try to  find  a  new\r\n\r\nsource  of  supply  to Singapore.  If  we  have  more\r\n\r\nsupplies  available, prices would naturally fall.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  MOF and the PIE have  also  formed  a\r\n\r\njoint   company,  the  Sing  Thai  Grains   (Private)\r\n\r\nLimited,   to   promote   the   marketing   of   Thai\r\n\r\nagricultural  produce in Singapore. Of course,  where\r\n\r\nsuitable joint ventures with other countries in  this\r\n\r\nregion  are proposed, they will be welcome.  We  will\r\n\r\njoin  with  other ASEAN countries in promoting  joint\r\n\r\nventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has a very good insight into\r\n\r\nwhat  is going on in the Planning Department  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development. But to put  matters\r\n\r\nstraight,   let  me  first  say  that  the   Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment  is concerned with long-term  and  medium-term  planning. It is concerned with the Master Plan.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, the Planning Department is concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the use of land in Singapore, subdividing  them\r\n\r\ninto zones for certain specific uses. The Development\r\n\r\nControl  Division  is  the enforcing  department.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  it  sees to it that where  a  building\r\n\r\nconstruction  is being undertaken, it should  conform\r\n\r\nto  the  Master Plan or to the plan drawn up  by  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department. These are the different  roles.\r\n\r\nThe  Planning  Department will deal with applications\r\n\r\nfor construction from statutory bodies and Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, whereas the Development Control Division\r\n\r\nwill deal with applications for construction from the\r\n\r\nprivate sector and from the citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little surprised that the Member should\r\n\r\nmention that there is confusion among members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  as  to  the roles these two  departments  are\r\n\r\nplaying.  This arrangement was set up in  1972,  that\r\n\r\nis,  four  years ago, and I do not expect members  of\r\n\r\nthe   public,  especially  the  architects  who   are\r\n\r\nprofessionals in their own right to be confused  over\r\n\r\nthis division of labour. He has said that the BCD  is\r\n\r\nperforming a very important role because it  enforces\r\n\r\nplanning control, In a small island like Singapore it\r\n\r\nis  imperative that there should be careful  use  and\r\n\r\nallocation   of   land,  otherwise   we   will   have\r\n\r\nresidential areas side by side with factories and the\r\n\r\nwhole  place will be polluted. The BCD is playing  an\r\n\r\nimportant role and, as such, he has suggested that it\r\n\r\nshould be upgraded to a department. At the same time,\r\n\r\nhe  has  suggested that it should be a  part  of  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department.  I think  there  is  a  bit  of\r\n\r\nconfusion. But no matter what it is, I think what  he\r\n\r\nis  trying  to stress is the importance  of  planning\r\n\r\ncontrol in Singapore. I fully agree with that because\r\n\r\nit   should  be  the  only  authority  to   see   how\r\n\r\nconstruction should be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a bit worried about opportunities for\r\n\r\npromotion in the department itself. Like most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment departments, there are ample opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  good  officers to be promoted. We  have  a  very\r\n\r\nunbiased  and a very wise body consisting of  private\r\n\r\nmembers  who  sit  on  a promotion  board  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  namely, the Public Service Commission.  As\r\n\r\nhon.  Members know, there is a new Government  policy\r\n\r\nwhereby  good officers are promoted in spite  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there are no posts. They are promoted  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  merit  without having  to  wait  for  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of a post. Therefore, there are  very  good\r\n\r\nopportunities for promotion for very good officers in\r\n\r\nthe   Planning  Department  as  well  as   in   other\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the specific case of the Chief Planner.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Planner was dismissed from service in 1973.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of that, a division took place  between\r\n\r\nthe  Planning  Division and the  Development  Control\r\n\r\nDivision.  At  one time there were  quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nirregularities  and  laxity in enforcing  development\r\n\r\ncontrol. That was one of the reasons why probably the\r\n\r\nChief  Planner was dismissed. Then the Deputy Planner\r\n\r\nleft  us for greener fields abroad. At the moment  we\r\n\r\nhave  an  acting Chief Planner, and when he  will  be\r\n\r\npromoted will depend upon a promotion exercise by the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned about inconsistency in allowing\r\n\r\ndevelopment   between  adjacent  parcels   of   land.\r\n\r\nNormally  it  is  unlikely that there  will  be  much\r\n\r\ndifference  between development allowed  on  adjacent\r\n\r\npieces  of land. But, of course, there must  be  some\r\n\r\ndifference.  The adjacent pieces of land  may  be  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  shape or they may be of irregular  shapes.\r\n\r\nThey  may  be smaller or bigger. But on the whole  it\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the zoning. If they are in an industrial\r\n\r\nzone  and  the  pieces  of land  are  side  by  side,\r\n\r\nplanning  for industrial use is allowed and the  plot\r\n\r\nratio  would almost be the same. I am unable to  tell\r\n\r\nhim why or where the difference is in the example  he\r\n\r\nquoted, unless he gives me more specific details.  If\r\n\r\nhe  really wants to know why it is so, perhaps he can\r\n\r\nget the information by sending in a Question for Oral\r\n\r\nAnswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he wants to know why the Building Control\r\n\r\nDivision gives notice to a congregation of people who\r\n\r\nsay prayers in the morning in a residential area.  As\r\n\r\nI  have said, in a small island like Singapore  where\r\n\r\nthere  is hardly any elbow room, we have to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  about  the  usage of land.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Member would like  to  have  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nwayang  playing every morning next to his  house.  He\r\n\r\nshook his head. He does not like it. Similarly,  when\r\n\r\na  congregation  of people meet every  morning  in  a\r\n\r\nresidential area, they are bound to create some  sort\r\n\r\nof nuisance. Therefore, probably complaints have been\r\n\r\nreceived from neighbours, and that is the reason  why\r\n\r\nnotice has been given to them to stop meeting in  the\r\n\r\nmorning  for  prayers in a residential area.  We  are\r\n\r\nvery careful about illegal use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

There  is  also\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  because  nobody  disturbs  the  other\r\n\r\nhouses  where praying is also being conducted.  There\r\n\r\nare so many other places where there is praying.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs\r\n\r\nNg Kah Ting and Teo Chong Tee).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the last few years I have\r\n\r\nspoken   about   the  favourite  hobby   of   certain\r\n\r\ndepartments, that is the digging of roads. Even today\r\n\r\nwe still find many roads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  dug, filled up, re-dug, filled up, and re-dug,\r\n\r\nso  much  so that some roads seem to be in  perpetual\r\n\r\ndisrepair.  Is the co-ordinating body really  working\r\n\r\nto  make  sure  that  all necessary  excavations  and\r\n\r\nrepairs  are  done at the same time? It also  appears\r\n\r\nthat  when the roads are levelled up, the workmanship\r\n\r\nand  materials  seem to be poor. Very often  we  find\r\n\r\nthat the gravel come loose particularly after a heavy\r\n\r\nrain.  Therefore, the material and workmanship should\r\n\r\nbe  properly checked by the authorities.  Whether  or\r\n\r\nnot they check them, God knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that many traffic circuses at road junctions,\r\n\r\nlike  the ones at Tanglin, MacRitchie, etc, are being\r\n\r\nconverted     into    traffic    light     controlled\r\n\r\nintersections. Why were these circuses constructed in\r\n\r\nthe first place? Do these conversions help in any way\r\n\r\nto alleviate traffic jams?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take MacRitchie circus as an example. The\r\n\r\nremoval  of  the  circus has not solved  the  traffic\r\n\r\njams; worse still, it has become a dangerous accident-prone   area.  Lately,  many  people  were  seriously\r\n\r\ninjured or killed at that place because of accidents.\r\n\r\nWhen  there  was a circus, there were  no  accidents.\r\n\r\nSince  removal of the circus, many accidents occurred\r\n\r\nresulting  in death. Something must be done  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  there  is  proper  planning  before   any\r\n\r\nmodification is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at Keppel Road which is in my constituency,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a railway line which runs across the  road\r\n\r\nnear  the Cold Storage Building. This is an accident-prone  area  as many serious accidents have  occurred\r\n\r\nthere.  If  one takes a look at the fence  along  the\r\n\r\nrailway ground which is beside the road, he will  see\r\n\r\nthat   it   has  been  damaged  because  of   traffic\r\n\r\naccidents. Another area which seriously needs  to  be\r\n\r\nlooked  into  is  the bend along  Kampong  Bahru  and\r\n\r\nKampong  Lama  Road.  This bend  is  so  narrow  that\r\n\r\nvehicles  going up to the Singapore General  Hospital\r\n\r\nare  literally running on the five-foot way meant for\r\n\r\npedestrians. This five-foot way is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally used by school children living in the area.\r\n\r\nMany  serious accidents have occurred in  that  area,\r\n\r\nthe  most  recent one involved an MID  vehicle  which\r\n\r\nrammed into the shop-houses. I think hon. Members may\r\n\r\nremember this accident. I wonder whether any measures\r\n\r\nare  being  taken  to  modify  these  areas  so  that\r\n\r\naccidents  can be minimised. If this is not  done,  I\r\n\r\nwould  request  the  authorities to  look  into  this\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that most of our pedestrian overhead\r\n\r\nbridges  are not properly utilised. It is a waste  of\r\n\r\nmoney. Pedestrians find it inconvenient to use  these\r\n\r\nbridges.  A typical example is the one near  Clifford\r\n\r\nPier. Who is using this bridge? Nobody is using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I use it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This is evident by\r\n\r\nthe  number  of people using the underpass  near  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade  and  also  the underpass  at  the  Merdeka\r\n\r\nBridge leading to the National Stadium. I suggest  we\r\n\r\nshould consider having more underpasses than overhead\r\n\r\nbridges.  It  is  a waste of money. Nobody  uses  the\r\n\r\noverhead bridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, touching on the question of\r\n\r\noverhead  bridges, I wonder whether a  simple  bridge\r\n\r\ncan  be  erected  across  the  railway  grounds  from\r\n\r\nSpottiswoode  Park  to Keppel Road,  because  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  there are many illegal gaps along the  fences\r\n\r\nof  the  railway grounds and people make use  of  the\r\n\r\nrailway  grounds  as a short-cut. I personally  think\r\n\r\nthe  construction of this bridge would  certainly  be\r\n\r\nwelcome by residents who are mainly Port and hospital\r\n\r\nworkers living around Spottiswoode Park, Asia Garden.\r\n\r\nhospital quarters, Everton Park, etc. It is not in my\r\n\r\nconstituency.   It   is  in  the   Prime   Minister's\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain sections of the railway track have\r\n\r\nbecome popular short-cuts for many office and factory\r\n\r\nworkers. This has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  on  for  a  very  long time.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\ndangerous  to  use the railway track as  a  shortcut.\r\n\r\nSometime  ago, a young factory girl was  on  her  way\r\n\r\nhome  from Delta Road to Kampong Bahru after  a  late\r\n\r\nshift  duty.  She was taking a short-cut  across  the\r\n\r\nrailway  track when her foot was caught  between  the\r\n\r\nrailway line. She could not get her foot out in  time\r\n\r\nbefore the night train from Kuala Lumpur ran over her\r\n\r\nand killed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent accidents, why not construct a pedestrian\r\n\r\npath  running parallel to the railway tracks? To  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  illegal  to go through  the  holes  cut\r\n\r\nthrough  the railway fence is tantamount to taking  a\r\n\r\nnegative attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that I have mentioned this, I hope the\r\n\r\nauthorities would take steps to ban the use of  these\r\n\r\npaths which have been in existence for so many years.\r\n\r\nThe  solution would be to construct pedestrian  paths\r\n\r\nbeside the railway lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a wise move on the part of the PWD to\r\n\r\nbuild  concrete footbridges across drains and  canals\r\n\r\nto  facilitate  pedestrian  movement.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nvery  few  of  these crossings have  railings  During\r\n\r\ninclement  weather these footbridges become  slippery\r\n\r\nand  when  there are floods, there is a great  danger\r\n\r\nthat  pedestrians might fall into the flooded  drains\r\n\r\nand canals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year there was a case of a young girl\r\n\r\nwho  was  washed away after falling from the slippery\r\n\r\npath into the flooded drain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the authorities would take steps to\r\n\r\nconstruct  railings  along  all  footbridges   across\r\n\r\ndrains and canals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting is not here. Mr Teo\r\n\r\nChong Tee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\ntwo  points  to  make  in respect  of  this  subhead.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I am inclined to agree with the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson in regard to road digging in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  efforts  to reduce  traffic  congestion\r\n\r\nwill  not  go  very far if the PWD keeps  digging  up\r\n\r\nroads from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough  there is improvement, there is  still  room\r\n\r\nfor  further improvement, as it is still causing much\r\n\r\ninconvenience to motorists. No sooner has a road been\r\n\r\nproperly  resurfaced before it is broken up again  by\r\n\r\nthe  PWD,  the TAS or even the PUB. This  shows  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   no   proper  coordination  among   these\r\n\r\ndepartments  concerned. The  cost  of  this  lack  of\r\n\r\ncoordination  can  be  measured  by  the  amount   of\r\n\r\nprecious   time   lost  due  to  traffic   congestion\r\n\r\nresulting from constant road-digging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I was given to understand that most PWD\r\n\r\narea contractors are reluctant to give quotations for\r\n\r\nsmall  jobs  and,  if  they do,  the  quotations  are\r\n\r\nusually  high.  They usually pass the  jobs  to  sub-contractors. In order to prevent abuses  by  licensed\r\n\r\ncontractors, the PWD should not allow these  licensed\r\n\r\ncontractors to monopolise all Government minor works.\r\n\r\nShould the Government not look into the licensing  of\r\n\r\nsmall-time contractors and make tendering  for  minor\r\n\r\nworks  more  competitive? This will  save  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npublic funds and get improved services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Changi said that\r\n\r\nlicensed  contractors submitted high  quotations  for\r\n\r\nsmall  jobs  and  suggested that perhaps  minor  work\r\n\r\nprojects should be awarded to smaller firms. The fact\r\n\r\nof  the matter is that minor work projects are  being\r\n\r\nawarded  to small firms under the present contracting\r\n\r\nsystem.  To give the Member some figures, the  Roads\r\n\r\nBranch, for example, has been awarding an average  of\r\n\r\n570  contracts per year for the past three  years  to\r\n\r\nsmall firms for minor works and this is valued up  to\r\n\r\n$7,500 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the query of both the Members for Anson\r\n\r\nand Changi on the constant digging and re-digging  of\r\n\r\nroads  and  the  need to maintain proper  roads,  the\r\n\r\nreason for this constant digging is obviously due  to\r\n\r\nthe  stepping  up  of works in the public  sector  in\r\n\r\nrecent  years. Obviously, with this increase  in  the\r\n\r\npublic sector development there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorresponding  increase in the need  to  lay  utility\r\n\r\nservices,  and  a  considerable proportion  of  these\r\n\r\nutilities  are on public roads. One of the  rules  of\r\n\r\nthe    Coordinating   Committee    responsible    for\r\n\r\ncoordinating all these utility services is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  traffic  flow is maintained and  that  adequate\r\n\r\nsafety  precautions are also taken. However, if  more\r\n\r\nthan  one utility department proposes to lay services\r\n\r\nin  any one single road, the Committee will obviously\r\n\r\nhave  to  ensure that only one service be laid  at  a\r\n\r\ntime.  Otherwise  the whole road  would  have  to  be\r\n\r\nclosed   to  traffic.  These  successive  laying   of\r\n\r\nservices is, therefore, unavoidable. It would not  be\r\n\r\npossible, for example, for the PUB and the TAS to  do\r\n\r\nthe services together. So depending on the nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  project, whether it is the laying of  cables  or\r\n\r\nwater  mains,  they have to take turns.  I  can  only\r\n\r\nassure   both  hon.  Members  that  the  Coordinating\r\n\r\nCommittee is trying its level best to coordinate  its\r\n\r\nactivities  and periodically we have  come  out  with\r\n\r\nstatements   to   explain  and  apologise   for   the\r\n\r\ninconvenience caused to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the quality of maintenance of these roads,\r\n\r\nperhaps  I  can  merely say that this is  also  being\r\n\r\nproperly  supervised  as best as  we  can  under  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  digging  and  the  need   to   re-dig\r\n\r\nperiodically. Normally, when a road is  open  to  the\r\n\r\npublic,  only  the first base or what  you  call  the\r\n\r\nasphalt  base  is laid. During this period  when  the\r\n\r\nfirst  base or the asphalt base is laid, the road  is\r\n\r\nopen  to  the  public and surface irregularities  are\r\n\r\nsometimes  noted and have to be rectified because  it\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  settled. Laying of  this  asphalt  base\r\n\r\nrequires  something like six to 12 months  before  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  properly settled. During this period  when\r\n\r\nthe  road  is open to traffic we need to periodically\r\n\r\nre-lay  the  surface.  When it  is  properly  settled\r\n\r\naccording  to  specifications, it  is  reasonable  to\r\n\r\nexpect  that the quality of that surface  would  last\r\n\r\nfrom six to 10 years. Whether or not it lasts six  to\r\n\r\n10 years depends on the intensity of use of the road.\r\n\r\nThat  means it depends on whether it is used by heavy\r\n\r\ncommercial  vehicles or light vehicles, and  it  also\r\n\r\ndepends on the extent and frequency of usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assure both hon. Members, I can say that the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department has set what is called  high\r\n\r\nstandards for the quality of materials to be used and\r\n\r\nthe  workmanship in road construction, and tests  are\r\n\r\nperiodically  being carried out to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ncontractors  comply  with  these  specifications.  In\r\n\r\nfact, as a deterrent, contractors who do not come  up\r\n\r\nwith   the   right  specifications   or   show   poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship  will  be debarred from tendering  future\r\n\r\ncontracts. This is being carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the seven other questions posed by the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. He has questioned the need to  have\r\n\r\na  traffic  circus and then the need subsequently  to\r\n\r\ndemolish    the    circus    because    of    traffic\r\n\r\nconsiderations. He also queried on the accident-prone\r\n\r\nsituation  after  the conversion  of  the  MacRitchie\r\n\r\nCircus.  Perhaps I can summarise and say that traffic\r\n\r\ncircuses were built in the early days when the volume\r\n\r\nof  traffic was extremely low. But traffic conditions\r\n\r\nchange  over a period of time, as we see now and  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of  MacRitchie Circus  to  ensure  proper\r\n\r\ntraffic  flow  is  absolutely necessary.  The  latest\r\n\r\nexample  is the removal of the beautiful fountain  at\r\n\r\nTanglin  Circus.  It  had to be  sacrificed  so  that\r\n\r\ntraffic  flow  in the two directions of Tanglin  Road\r\n\r\nand Grange Road could be more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has questioned that by converting the\r\n\r\nMacRitchie  Circus  back  into  traffic  lights,  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  situation  has  not improved.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  obvious. Because of this conversion  more\r\n\r\ntraffic   flows   in   the   direction   of   Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad/Braddell   Way,  perhaps  to   avoid   the   ALS\r\n\r\nrestriction  in  the morning. We  have  done  surveys\r\n\r\nwhich  show  that the traffic flow has  increased  at\r\n\r\nthis converted traffic lights in MacRitchie area. The\r\n\r\nreason for the higher accident-prone state may be due\r\n\r\nto  speeding  by motorists along Lornie  Road  or  to\r\n\r\nspeeding near the junction of the traffic lights.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  minimise this, the PWD has  put  up  signs\r\n\r\nalong approach roads to Lornie Road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarning  motorists to slow down. We are also  looking\r\n\r\ninto the possibility of reversing the traffic flow at\r\n\r\nthe   entrance  and  exit  of  MacRitchie  Reservoir.\r\n\r\nbecause  the  entrance to MacRitchie  Reservoir  goes\r\n\r\ndirectly out to the traffic light junction.  This  is\r\n\r\nbeing examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question posed by the Member for Anson was\r\n\r\nwhether  steps could be taken to modify Keppel  Road.\r\n\r\nThis is again due to the accident-prone area. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  no  plans  have, been made  to  reduce  this\r\n\r\nsituation  because of the railway-level  crossing  at\r\n\r\nKeppel Road, but the Ministry will look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which he has mentioned is near the bend\r\n\r\nat Kampong Bahru Road and Kampong Lama Road. There is\r\n\r\nalso no proposal to widen the road because both sides\r\n\r\nof  the road are heavily encumbered. However, we will\r\n\r\ntry and improve the bend at this particular junction,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  we will also incorporate  some  warning\r\n\r\nsigns, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member questioned the usefulness of overhead\r\n\r\nbridges and quoted Clifford Pier as an example. I beg\r\n\r\nto  differ  from  him.  I think  the  air-conditioned\r\n\r\noverhead bridge at Clifford Pier is heavily utilised.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  for better use of the underpass  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium  is mainly due  to  soccer  nights.\r\n\r\nExcept  for  those  nights, I  think  it  is  totally\r\n\r\nunused.  He  has  suggested  the  need  to  build  an\r\n\r\nunderpass.  The  obvious reason is that,  all  things\r\n\r\nbeing  equal, the cost of an underpass is  much  more\r\n\r\nexpensive  than  an  overhead  bridge.  Cost  is   an\r\n\r\nimportant factor in influencing the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then brought up the question of having a\r\n\r\nbridge  erected  across Spottiswoode Park  to  Keppel\r\n\r\nRoad.  He  also  suggested that to prevent  accidents\r\n\r\nalong  railway  tracks  simple  pedestrian  paths  be\r\n\r\nconstructed to run parallel with railway tracks.  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  very  straightforward.  These  properties\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the Malaysian Railway Authority,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  difficult to expect them to agree  to  have\r\n\r\nthese  pedestrian bridges constructed across  railway\r\n\r\ntracks. The same answer applies to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis earlier question - usage is minimal, and moreover\r\n\r\nwe  are actually dealing with a foreign authority  in\r\n\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested that there should be\r\n\r\nproper  railings along all foot bridges across drains\r\n\r\nand  canals. The answer is that the PWD does  provide\r\n\r\nrailings  along all bridges across large  drains  and\r\n\r\ncanals, and the railings are omitted only along those\r\n\r\nfootway  slabs that are narrow. However, the Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to look into the need for  safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst  dangerous  conditions  at  all  drains   and\r\n\r\nrailings  will be provided if the conditions  warrant\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Let   me\r\n\r\nillustrate to this House a case in point, hoping that\r\n\r\nit   will   merit  the  attention  of  the   Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constituent of mine started a small electrical\r\n\r\nshop   for  the  repair  of  refrigerators.  He  duly\r\n\r\nregistered  his  business in  1970  and  possessed  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  licence. He took up residence at his  place\r\n\r\nof business in 1960 and his business was flourishing.\r\n\r\nPreviously  he  had  never  received  any  complaints\r\n\r\neither  from  the  landlord or from officers  of  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Division. However,  after  mid-1976\r\n\r\nofficers from the Building Control Division called at\r\n\r\nhis   shop  and  handed  him  some  forms   for   his\r\n\r\ncompletion.  There was a space in the form  requiring\r\n\r\nthe  signature  of  the landlord.  But  the  landlord\r\n\r\nrefused  to  pen  his  signature.  Just  because  the\r\n\r\nlandlord refused to put his signature, the small shop\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion  was  considered  illegal  as  it  had   not\r\n\r\nobtained  the  prior  approval  of  the  landlord  to\r\n\r\ncorroborate  it.  But all these years  the  shop  had\r\n\r\nnever been considered unauthorised or illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was action initiated as a result of an instigation\r\n\r\nreceived   by   officers  of  the  Building   Control\r\n\r\nDivision?   As   far   as  I  know,   there   was   a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding between the landlord  and  the  shop\r\n\r\nproprietor.  If the officers of the Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision   had   taken  action  because   they   were\r\n\r\npressurised by one party, and if the incident I  have\r\n\r\nnarrated is true, there is indeed cause for shame  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the Government. This  line  of  action\r\n\r\nshould  not have been initiated by civil servants  in\r\n\r\nthe first place. Government officials are expected to\r\n\r\nrender  assistance as best as they can  to  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople', who  are often exploited and  oppressed  by\r\n\r\nhaughty  and  arrogant  landlords.  This  is  not  an\r\n\r\nuncommon feature in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang   Serai   has   mentioned   an   unauthorised\r\n\r\nelectrical  shop,  but  there  are  also  many  other\r\n\r\nunauthorised businesses, like motor garages,  as  far\r\n\r\nas  the Building Control Division is concerned. These\r\n\r\nbusinesses have been run for more than five years and\r\n\r\nthey  do meet the needs of the residents in the area.\r\n\r\nBut  now the Building Control Division officials come\r\n\r\nalong  and  say, \"Your business is unauthorised.  You\r\n\r\nhave  to move out.\" Usually these officials are  very\r\n\r\nsympathetic and allow them an extension of  time  and\r\n\r\nalso  tell  them to find alternative sites.  But  for\r\n\r\nmost  businesses, especially the motor garages  which\r\n\r\ncarry  out their business in an open ground near  the\r\n\r\nhomes of the owners, it is very difficult for them to\r\n\r\nfind  an alternative site because they cannot  get  a\r\n\r\nsite  authorised to carry out the business of a motor\r\n\r\nworkshop as all motor workshops are now under control\r\n\r\nand  they  have to be resited at specific places  and\r\n\r\nthese have to be tendered for.

May I suggest that perhaps the Building\r\n\r\nControl   Division,   in   conjunction   with   other\r\n\r\ndepartments, look into this matter  to  see  whether\r\n\r\nthey  could  allow the business, if it  has  been  in\r\n\r\nexistence  for more than five years, on compassionate\r\n\r\ngrounds, to be relocated at another site temporarily,\r\n\r\nif not permanently, until such time that it can get a\r\n\r\nproper place to carry out their business, because the\r\n\r\nowners are usually unable to get a site of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Song (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas many of the dwelling houses  are\r\n\r\nmade  of  wood,  zinc,  or attap.  These  are  called\r\n\r\ntemporary structures because the materials used which\r\n\r\nare mainly of wood, zinc or attap, will corrode after\r\n\r\na  period  of time and will need repairs. But  before\r\n\r\nany  repair work can be done, the occupant has to get\r\n\r\npermission  from the Building Control  Division,  and\r\n\r\nany  offence of unauthorised repair work, will render\r\n\r\nthe structure liable to be demolished. Therefore,  an\r\n\r\napplication  for  permission is very  important,  and\r\n\r\nmust be made according to the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the procedure laid down by this Division is\r\n\r\nvery   cumbersome  and  the  requirements  are   very\r\n\r\nstringent.  The  applicant  must  fill  in   a   very\r\n\r\ncomplicated  application form and  he  must  get  the\r\n\r\nauthorised  signature of the landlord. He  must  also\r\n\r\nhave  a  sketch map showing the locality,  a  drawing\r\n\r\nplan  of the structure indicating the nature  of  the\r\n\r\nrepairs   and   other  things  besides.   All   these\r\n\r\nconditions are very difficult to comply with and  are\r\n\r\nhighly inconvenient to these residents. Sometimes for\r\n\r\npersonal  reasons the landlord would not  consent  to\r\n\r\ngive  his  signature, and therefore  the  application\r\n\r\ncannot be sent to the authority for approval. In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  the  dwelling  houses  have  fallen   into\r\n\r\ndisrepair; like it or not, they must be repaired.  It\r\n\r\nis very urgent and necessary for them to repair these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses.  Therefore,  without the  permission  of  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Division, many of them  are  forced\r\n\r\nwilly-nilly to carry out the repairs themselves, thus\r\n\r\nbreaching the relevant laws. And the Government  also\r\n\r\ndoes  not hesitate to demolish these structures,  and\r\n\r\nconsequently  these  unfortunate people  suffer  even\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these unpleasant things have occurred\r\n\r\nmainly because of the stringent procedures laid  down\r\n\r\nby the Building Control Division. If these procedures\r\n\r\ncan  be simplified so as to enable the people to make\r\n\r\nan application more easily, I believe such unpleasant\r\n\r\nthings  would not have occurred. Therefore,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister  to  consider  whether  he  could\r\n\r\nsimplify   the   procedures   for   processing   such\r\n\r\napplications,  or alternatively to agree  that  where\r\n\r\nthe  repair  of these temporary structures  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed 50% of the structure, then no application need\r\n\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang has succinctly criticised the Building\r\n\r\nControl  Division  about  its  strict  procedure  for\r\n\r\napplication for repairs to buildings. In the past, on\r\n\r\nnumerous  occasions,  Members have  appealed  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned for easier means to  enable  such\r\n\r\napplicants to obtain the required permit to carry out\r\n\r\nminor repairs to their existing buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the Budget last year I made out a\r\n\r\ncase for a more simplified form of procedure so as to\r\n\r\nspeed  up the processing of applications, which would\r\n\r\nenable the applicants to carry out repairs earlier. I\r\n\r\nhave  to  mention that to-date nothing much has  been\r\n\r\ndone to simplify applications for repairs. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  have  to reiterate my point with a recent example.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the Lunar New Year a zinc roofed hut in\r\n\r\nFlorence  Road in my constituency was  damaged  by  a\r\n\r\nfalling  coconut tree. I got a call from one  of  the\r\n\r\noccupants  and  advised  her to  make  the  necessary\r\n\r\nreport not only to the police station but also to the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned. I believe that all  this  was\r\n\r\ndone;  but  up  to  last Sunday when  I  visited  the\r\n\r\nfamily, I was told\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  approval for repairs has still not been  given.\r\n\r\nThe impression I got was that it would take about one\r\n\r\nor  two weeks more. Sir, just imagine a coconut  tree\r\n\r\nfalling  on  to  a building and resting  on  it;  and\r\n\r\nfortunately  the  occupants escaped injury;  and  yet\r\n\r\nthey  have  to live in that house in this  state  for\r\n\r\nmore  than a month now. I would expect the Department\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  be  not  only  sympathetic   in   this\r\n\r\nparticular  case  but  also  to  help  expedite   the\r\n\r\noccupant's application for repairs so that work could\r\n\r\nbe carried out soonest possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask: Why must she wait for so long? We have\r\n\r\nmade pleas in this House to consider this point.  Not\r\n\r\neverybody  knows  where  the  Ministry  of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  is.     Say, from Punggol they  have  to\r\n\r\ncome down all the way to Maxwell Road. They must know\r\n\r\nwhich floor the relevant department is, and there are\r\n\r\n21  floors in that building. Which department  to  go\r\n\r\nto,  who to see, where to inquire, and how to get the\r\n\r\napplication  done? The Member for Bukit  Panjang  has\r\n\r\nmade  out one case, and with four Members listed down\r\n\r\nto speak on this topic, I believe the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  for National Development should look  into\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of  drawing up a  more  simplified  form\r\n\r\nwhereby  applications for minor repairs  to  existing\r\n\r\nbuildings can be approved much sooner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I must inform this House that\r\n\r\nsometimes it may well be that the building inspectors\r\n\r\nhave  been  too  enthusiastic in carrying  out  their\r\n\r\nduties  and  for  minor  infringements  against   the\r\n\r\nbuilding  bye-laws or failure to comply with  certain\r\n\r\nregulations, for  example, an  application  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  a lean-to shed  just  to  hang  out\r\n\r\nclothes  has  been  turned down despite  requests  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  the  retention of  such  structures.  The\r\n\r\nreply simply reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This matter has been duly considered and that it\r\n\r\ndoes not comply with the building requirements. Thus.\r\n\r\nit  is  regretted that the request cannot be  acceded\r\n\r\nto.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This   kind  of  reply  is  very  general.  We   must\r\n\r\nunderstand the plight of these people. In  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas, as Members have pointed out,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  buildings are of a temporary nature. They  hold\r\n\r\ntemporary  permits of $12 each.  So  why  do  we  not\r\n\r\nconsider  this  factor and allow  retention  of  such\r\n\r\nstructures  as well? At the same time,  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl Division's officials concerned should not  be\r\n\r\nover-enthusiastic but be more flexible  in  enforcing\r\n\r\nthe building requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  two hon. Members  who  have  spoken\r\n\r\nbefore me. There is no exaggeration of the fact  that\r\n\r\nto try to get approval for even very minor repairs to\r\n\r\nthese  so-called temporary structures  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  can be a very frustrating experience. In fact,\r\n\r\nin  many  cases two departments are involved  because\r\n\r\nmost  of the land in the rural areas are State  land.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to get approval from the Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision one has first to obtain the approval of  the\r\n\r\nLand Office. So he goes to the Land Office. The delay\r\n\r\nhere  will  be several weeks, if not several  months.\r\n\r\nThen  the  matter is in turn referred to the Building\r\n\r\nControl Division who again delays for several  weeks,\r\n\r\nif not several months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I can quote one particular case. I am not\r\n\r\nmaking  up  the story. My constituent, having  waited\r\n\r\nfor  months, got rather impatient. He came to see  me\r\n\r\nand  brought to my attention the fact that the  delay\r\n\r\nhas  gone on for far too long. So I gave him a letter\r\n\r\naddressed  to  the  Department  concerned.  When   he\r\n\r\npresented  my  letter  there,  he  was  told  by  the\r\n\r\nofficer, \"Well, you saw your MP. I am going  to  make\r\n\r\nmatters  worse for you.\" Sure enough, he has  had  to\r\n\r\nwait longer than someone who has applied much later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, the time has definitely come for  us  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  it positively. Year after year, Members  of\r\n\r\nrural constituencies have been bringing to this House\r\n\r\nthe  same old problem about the delay on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe   Building  Control  Division  and   the   rather\r\n\r\ninflexible attitude of its officers who go  round  to\r\n\r\nsee  whether there is a breach of Building  rules.

If there are incidents of that nature  or\r\n\r\nindications  of unfair tactics being  used  by  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  in  particular the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, to frustrate the good efforts of MPs,  I\r\n\r\nwould   appreciate  if  Members  could   send   their\r\n\r\ncomplaints  direct to me, and I assure  them  that  I\r\n\r\nwill   personally   and  directly   deal   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsible officers. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me perhaps come straight to the query by the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for Geylang Serai. He has  pleaded  for\r\n\r\nsympathetic  consideration from the Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision on the case of an unauthorised usage.  First\r\n\r\nof  all, he should understand that registration of  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  does not mean that a permit to  operate  is\r\n\r\nbeing  given. You can register a company or  whatever\r\n\r\nyou  like, but the place of operation still  requires\r\n\r\nan  official permit. He insinuated that the  Building\r\n\r\nControl Division is being used by one party to  press\r\n\r\nthe  other  party  for action to  be  taken.  Let  me\r\n\r\ncategorically  state here that the Government  cannot\r\n\r\nand  does not encourage the unlawful use of  land  or\r\n\r\npremises  or the unauthorised erection or  occupation\r\n\r\nof  buildings, whether they are on State land  or  on\r\n\r\nprivate  land.  It  is  the present  policy, and  my\r\n\r\nMinister  has earlier explained the need  for  proper\r\n\r\nbuilding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrols  to  ensure  proper usage  of  land  in  the\r\n\r\nrespective zones. If it is necessary to ensure proper\r\n\r\ncontrol  of building development in the whole  island\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  then  I think it  is  necessary  that\r\n\r\napplications for planning permission must be properly\r\n\r\nprocessed,  and one of the requirements is  that  the\r\n\r\nowner of that property must give his consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that in the case of this\r\n\r\nparticular  complainant,  the  requirements  of  that\r\n\r\nparticular  property  may  not  coincide   with   the\r\n\r\ninterest of the owner, depending on the case, or vice\r\n\r\nversa.  This is actually an issue between  the  owner\r\n\r\nand the tenant, and I think the BCD is in no position\r\n\r\nto intervene. I would suggest to the hon. Member that\r\n\r\nperhaps  he  can offer his good services to  the  two\r\n\r\nparties concerned by trying to persuade the owner  to\r\n\r\nagree to a modification in the application for change\r\n\r\nof use, and the Ministry will definitely consider the\r\n\r\napplication according to its own merits. If,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, the hon. Member would rather prefer  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to explain the situation, we would  be  very\r\n\r\nhappy to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Telok Blangah has voiced the\r\n\r\nneed to allow motor garages to operate in areas where\r\n\r\nthey  are needed by the residents. I presume he means\r\n\r\nareas  in  residential zones. He also asked  that  if\r\n\r\nthey have been in existence for five years and above,\r\n\r\nproper  official priority of resettlement  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven.  The  answer is obviously no.  Here  again,  a\r\n\r\nmotor  garage  or workshop that serves  a  particular\r\n\r\nneed  in  a  particular residential zone must  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the  necessary  Building requirements.  And  he\r\n\r\nhimself  has  said  that there is need  for  control.\r\n\r\nThere are proper workshops in HDB estates and perhaps\r\n\r\neven  at  some  alternative areas in JTC  where  such\r\n\r\nbusiness activities can be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he does not mean the business of servicing\r\n\r\nand  lubrication  of  cars,  because  this  is  being\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in petrol stations all over  Singapore,\r\n\r\neven  in  the  Central area. We have  already  got  a\r\n\r\nproblem  of  resettling authorised  premises  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral area - that is, the clearance of all types  of\r\n\r\nrelated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotor  business, not only of motor garages. We cannot\r\n\r\ncope  with  the problem of resettlement. Yet  he  has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  we load ourselves with  illegal  and\r\n\r\nunauthorised usage of land. It is difficult to expect\r\n\r\nthe Government to consider at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the plea of the rural MPs, in particular\r\n\r\nthe  Members  for  Bukit Panjang, Punggol  and  Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu.  I  am  in sympathy with them.  But  I  beg  to\r\n\r\ndisagree when the Member for Punggol said that we are\r\n\r\nnot  doing  anything. I cannot remember exactly,  but\r\n\r\nmaybe  partly because of him or some other MPs; after\r\n\r\nthe  Budget session in March 1976, the Ministry  went\r\n\r\nahead  to modify the application procedure -  correct\r\n\r\nme  if I am wrong. In fact, I would be happy to  take\r\n\r\nup   this   matter  again  if  whatever  I   say   is\r\n\r\ncontradictory  to  what  he thinks  it  is.  I  stand\r\n\r\ncorrected.  According to the BCD's information  given\r\n\r\nto  me,  minor repairs and alterations which  do  not\r\n\r\ninvolve reconstruction or the addition of floor areas\r\n\r\ndo   not  require  planning  permission  or  building\r\n\r\npermit.  In  fact;  a  person can  apply  for  a  \"No\r\n\r\nobjection\" letter. A \"No objection\" letter means just\r\n\r\na  letter  to proceed with the work. It is a  letter,\r\n\r\nnot  a  permit, from the BCD to carry out  any  minor\r\n\r\nrepairs   and  alterations.  In  this  respect,   the\r\n\r\nlandowner's  consent  is also not  required.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  if  the  repairs  and  alterations  are\r\n\r\nextensive and involve rebuilding and additional floor\r\n\r\nareas, then planning permission, building permit  and\r\n\r\nthe landowner's consent will be required. That is the\r\n\r\nprocedure from the information given to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of simplifying procedure. The\r\n\r\nprocedure   in  applying  for  extension  and   minor\r\n\r\nrepairs,  as I have said, has already been simplified\r\n\r\nsince the middle of 1976. As an example, in the past,\r\n\r\nan  applicant has to submit two separate applications\r\n\r\nfor  the same extension and minor repairs: one to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Control Division for  planning  approval\r\n\r\nand the other to the Building Control Division for  a\r\n\r\nbuilding   permit.   But  now  one   application   is\r\n\r\nsufficient.   I   have   also  information   on   the\r\n\r\nsimplification  of procedures, if  hon.  Members  are\r\n\r\ninterested. In the past, generally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeaking,  something like 11 copies of five different\r\n\r\ntypes  of  forms  were required to be submitted.  But\r\n\r\nnow,  the applicant only needs to fill one form,  and\r\n\r\nonly  four copies are necessary. The reason  for  the\r\n\r\nneed to have sketch plans is that it is difficult for\r\n\r\nthe  Building Control Division itself to know exactly\r\n\r\nwhich  particular  plot in the  rural  area  that  is\r\n\r\nreferred to. It could be a stituation where the  site\r\n\r\nconcerned  is  Government land  and  therefore  comes\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of Law. So it is necessary for the\r\n\r\napplicant  to tell us exactly where the  location  is\r\n\r\nwhen  applying  for repairs or minor extensions.  The\r\n\r\nBCD,  being  in the Ministry of National Development.\r\n\r\ntherefore, requests an indication of where  the  site\r\n\r\nis.  But if, on the other hand, where there is a need\r\n\r\nto  coordinate, perhaps I can suggest to the  BCD  to\r\n\r\nlook into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Bukit Panjang has suggested that\r\n\r\nif the repair area is less than 50% of the structure,\r\n\r\nthen  no  permit should be required. I  have  already\r\n\r\nindicated  that,  from what BCD has  told  me,  minor\r\n\r\nrepairs  and  alterations  do  not  require  planning\r\n\r\npermission  or building permit. But I can pursue  the\r\n\r\nmatter  further if he could tell me roughly  what  he\r\n\r\nhas in mind so that I can refer his suggestion to the\r\n\r\nBuilding Control Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point made by the Member for Punggol was about\r\n\r\nthe unnecessary delays in granting approvals. He gave\r\n\r\nan  example of an application to repair a  zinc  roof\r\n\r\nwhich was made during the Chinese New Year season and\r\n\r\nthat  up till now no permit has been given. I  cannot\r\n\r\ngive any excuse on the part of the BCD. But if it  is\r\n\r\na straight-forward and simple application for repairs\r\n\r\nand if the damage is not extensive, I think it should\r\n\r\nnot take a month or so. But, s'.s he has said, if  it\r\n\r\nrequires  another two weeks for approval, I would  be\r\n\r\nhappy  to  look  into it if he wants  to  pursue  the\r\n\r\nmatter further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the comments that the officers are\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  over-enthusiastic and  critical, here\r\n\r\nagain, I think one must appreciate that it depends on\r\n\r\nthe degree of enthusiasm. I share the sentiments made\r\n\r\nby the three rural MPs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken, that if it is for  minor  repairs,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  changing one plank in a wall, and they  are\r\n\r\nmaking  a  big  fuss  about it,  then  by  all  means\r\n\r\ncomplain.  They can complain to the highest authority\r\n\r\nif  they  choose to do so. But, on the other hand,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  believe that all members of the staff in  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Division are of that nature.  There\r\n\r\ncould  be  one  or two members of the staff  who  are\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  uncooperative.  Here  again,  if   the\r\n\r\nMember feels that there is unnecessary impediment  on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the officer, let us know and perhaps  we\r\n\r\ncan give him some good advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore sum up by saying that as far as\r\n\r\nthe simplification of procedures for minor repairs is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it is being done. If it could be  further\r\n\r\nsimplified,  we would be happy to look  into  it.  If\r\n\r\nhon.  Members have good suggestions on how to further\r\n\r\nsimplify   the  procedure,  we  will  welcome   their\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  has  gone to great length to explain  that\r\n\r\nthere  have  been some modifications to simplify  the\r\n\r\napplications  for  repairs.  Whilst  the  application\r\n\r\nformat  might  have  been  simplified,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean  that  delays  do  not   occur.   I\r\n\r\nmentioned  this case in particular to  establish  the\r\n\r\npoint about the delay in approving such applications.\r\n\r\nAll  I am saying is that the Ministry or the Division\r\n\r\nconcerned should look into the question of expediting\r\n\r\nsuch  applications,  that  is  to  say,  they  should\r\n\r\nexpeditiously approve these applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that the\r\n\r\nBCD,  in  particular should expedite the application.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  a  situation as in the case that  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about, that is, a minor repair, then I  agree\r\n\r\nthat there should not be an unnecessary delay. But if\r\n\r\nthe  repairs are of an extensive nature, then I think\r\n\r\nthe minimum requirements of a planning permission and\r\n\r\nbuilding permit must be complied with. And, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  that depends on how many parties are involved.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the delay is on the part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  other Government departments or Ministries,  then\r\n\r\nit  is incorrect for me to suggest that the delay  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  this party or that party. But as far as  the\r\n\r\nBCD  is concerned, if it pleases the hon. Member,  we\r\n\r\ncan,  of course, send them a reminder to suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  applications  should be expeditiously  processed\r\n\r\nbut  with the proviso that there is always a  minimum\r\n\r\nperiod  required. I can tell the BCD to see how  best\r\n\r\nthey  can  further  improve on  what  I  think  is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable period of processing. I have indicated  to\r\n\r\nMembers  just  now a period of one  month.  But  here\r\n\r\nagain  it is not too worthwhile to debate on what  is\r\n\r\nthe  minimum period. We can say that in the few cases\r\n\r\nof  unnecessary delay, I agree that action should  be\r\n\r\ntaken to look into them,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one\r\n\r\nfurther clarification. With your indulgence, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  debate  a little more to  get  the  correct\r\n\r\npicture.  Just now the Senior Minister of  State  has\r\n\r\nstated that if repairs do not amount to more than 50%\r\n\r\nof  the  building  and  if it  is  a  straightforward\r\n\r\napplication, the Building Control Division would have\r\n\r\nno objection. So the onus or the responsibility falls\r\n\r\non  either  the  applicant or the landowner.  But  my\r\n\r\nquestion  is this. If the applicant can get  approval\r\n\r\nto carry out the necessary repairs in the normal way,\r\n\r\nthen  all  these requirements are within the Building\r\n\r\nby-laws. The problem is when the repairs have  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  urgently, then what  has  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl Division got to say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in case of\r\n\r\nurgency, in  particular where an  MP  comes  out  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of a particular application as was suggested\r\n\r\nin  the  case of the damaged zinc roof, I  personally\r\n\r\nsee  no difficulty really. For example, if the damage\r\n\r\nis  directly  to the roof of a bedroom and  it  needs\r\n\r\nimmediate  repair  within  a  few  days,  I  see   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in convincing, perhaps not the  clerk  at\r\n\r\nthe counter, but the head of the Division, that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  immediate approval  for  repairs  be\r\n\r\ngiven. If approval or permit is necessary, and if the\r\n\r\nowner's  signature  is required,  and  so  on,  these\r\n\r\nrequirements  could be processed at a later  date.

In certain aspects we should try\r\n\r\nto   be  self-sufficient  and,  if  possible,  be  an\r\n\r\nexporter. Many pig farmers have been resettled or put\r\n\r\nout  of  business for various reasons, the  commonest\r\n\r\nbeing  environmental pollution. We have some  islands\r\n\r\nwhich  are ideal for poultry and pig-rearing. Why  is\r\n\r\nthere no effort made to develop these islands?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago I suggested growing vegetables on the\r\n\r\nroof  tops  of HDB flats, I was laughed  at  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  one newspaper even ran a cartoon about  it.  I\r\n\r\nfeel the time has come to rejuvenate some thinking in\r\n\r\nthis  field. We are already getting a reduced  supply\r\n\r\nof  fish and vegetables. The other sources for  these\r\n\r\nsupplies are unreliable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydroponics has been developed in Singapore to such\r\n\r\nan  extent that it is feasible to grow vegetables  on\r\n\r\nthe  roof tops of high-rise buildings. This is not  a\r\n\r\nnew  idea.  In  India, it has been carried  out  very\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.  They grow vegetables,  like  brinjals,\r\n\r\ntomatoes and even some kind of padi on rooftops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is being done to control the illegal\r\n\r\nslaughtering of pigs? It is common to find some  pork\r\n\r\nsellers  mixing the meat in the markets in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  cheating going on  in  the  sale  of\r\n\r\nmutton.  Frozen mutton is mixed with fresh mutton  in\r\n\r\nthe markets and sold at higher prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I regret to say that in the last few years, the\r\n\r\nimage of the Primary Production Department in the\r\n\r\neyes of the farmers and fishermen has changed\r\n\r\nfundamentally. Although the PPD has been giving\r\n\r\ntechnical aid in respect of agriculture to the\r\n\r\nfarmers, they do not seem to give any assistance to\r\n\r\nsolve the major and immediate problems of bona fide\r\n\r\nfarmers and fishermen. The result is that there are\r\n\r\ncomplaints and dissatisfaction all round. I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask whether the PPD has taken any steps to\r\n\r\nrender help when the price of agricultural produce\r\n\r\nwas low. And has the PPD helped the farmers to export\r\n\r\ntheir excess produce abroad? What has the PPD done in\r\n\r\nrespect of the promotion of deep-sea fishing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards farmers affected by resettlement,\r\n\r\nthe  PPD's dealings with these people give  cause  to\r\n\r\ndoubt   the   sincerity  of  the  PPD  in   promoting\r\n\r\nagriculture. The frivolous manner that  the  PPD  has\r\n\r\nadopted in judging whether or not a person is a  bona\r\n\r\nfide  farmer or not a farmer has been the root  cause\r\n\r\nof  a lot of dissatisfaction and complaint. Bona fide\r\n\r\nfarmers  have  been  adjudged  non-farmers  and  vice\r\n\r\nversa. Usually in the rural areas many families still\r\n\r\nretain   their  good  Eastern  traditions  by  having\r\n\r\nseveral  generations living together under one  roof,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  common  to see the father  and  the  son\r\n\r\ntilling  the same plot of land, even though  the  son\r\n\r\nhas  his  own  family. When the PPD  comes  round  to\r\n\r\nassess  and  to recommend subsequently the allocation\r\n\r\nof land, they usually recommend a piece of land, even\r\n\r\nthough  a very small one, only to the father, leaving\r\n\r\nthe son out. Is this the way to encourage agriculture\r\n\r\nor to discourage it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rural people have also been troubled by the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  catchment areas and  reservoirs.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the idea is that we should be self-sufficient\r\n\r\nin the supply of water, and nobody can argue with it.\r\n\r\nBut   the   Government,  particularly   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department, should try its best  to  help\r\n\r\nreduce  the inconvenience and the loss to the  people\r\n\r\naffected to the minimum by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving  them whatever assistance they need to  resume\r\n\r\nproduction  as soon as possible. Bigger  pig  farmers\r\n\r\nhave  been resettled in Punggol pig farms. They  have\r\n\r\nto  start  from scratch in very difficult situations.\r\n\r\nSmall  pig farmers have also been asked to stop their\r\n\r\npig  farming  operations, or else they will  have  to\r\n\r\nmove  out.  Can  I ask whether the PPD  has  assisted\r\n\r\nthese pig farmers to change to chicken rearing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time when the PPD gave extensive\r\n\r\npublicity to the development of Sembawang  as  a  pig\r\n\r\nfarming area, and they even invited farm operators to\r\n\r\ncome  forward.  But now we do not hear anything  more\r\n\r\nabout it. I would like to ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\ncan inform this House as to how much public funds has\r\n\r\nbeen  spent on the development of Sembawang as a  pig\r\n\r\nfarming  area? Why has the plan failed? What  is  the\r\n\r\nuse of the land now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PPD is now planning to develop Punggol as a\r\n\r\nnew  pig farming area. This must succeed, and  should\r\n\r\nnot be allowed to fail. Otherwise we shall fall short\r\n\r\nof  the  supply of pork. The first problem I hear  is\r\n\r\nthat  there is an absence of metalled roads  and  the\r\n\r\ndrainage system is also very poor. There is  also  an\r\n\r\ninsufficient  supply of electricity and water.  These\r\n\r\nmatters must be given first priority by the PPD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Report of the Auditor-General for 1975-76 we learn that the PPD is not efficient in handling\r\n\r\naccounting  matters. There have been  short  receipts\r\n\r\nand wrong accounting procedures. A junior officer was\r\n\r\nput in charge of large amounts of money from the sale\r\n\r\nof  agricultural produce. Not only this, the  PPD  is\r\n\r\nalso  a very stubborn department. The Auditor-General\r\n\r\nhad  in  his Reports for 1973-74 and 1974-75  pointed\r\n\r\nout  the  shortcomings of the PPD and had recommended\r\n\r\ncertain  improvement  to its accounting  system.  Yet\r\n\r\nfrom the 1975-76 Auditor-General's Report, it appears\r\n\r\nthat   the  Department  is  still  having  the   same\r\n\r\nproblems,  and  has  disregarded the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General. Is this intransigent  attitude  good\r\n\r\nfor our country?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to raise the\r\n\r\nproblem of the Jurong Abattoir. Recently I received a\r\n\r\nlot  of  complaints chiefly on the management of  the\r\n\r\nAbattoir.  They  have  spent  large  sums  of   money\r\n\r\nfurnishing   the   office  into  one   of   grandiose\r\n\r\nsplendour.  They have also spent a lot  of  money  to\r\n\r\nengage  beautiful female staff. But they do not  want\r\n\r\nto  spend  any money to improve the machinery  or  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  working conditions of the  workers,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  so that now and then, the machines are  out  of\r\n\r\norder,  or  there  is constant shortage  of  butchers\r\n\r\ncausing   a  delay  in  the  slaughtering  of   pigs,\r\n\r\nsometimes  to as late as 6 am, or 7 am, so  that  the\r\n\r\nmeat  could not reach the market in time,  causing  a\r\n\r\nlot  of unnecessary losses.

Member also criticised the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department officials for their  haste  in\r\n\r\nmoving  and  relocating  the  pig  farmers  into  the\r\n\r\ndesignated farming areas, thereby creating a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndifficulties for the farmers. As I have said  before,\r\n\r\nall  these  pig farmers who have been relocated  were\r\n\r\nmerely given pieces of land to develop. In the debate\r\n\r\non  the  President's  Address, I  referred  to  these\r\n\r\nfarmers as pioneers opening up the western frontiers.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  remark is due to the fact that when  such\r\n\r\nlands  were  allocated,  there  were  not  sufficient\r\n\r\nfacilities and services. This is true. Roads are  not\r\n\r\nproperly  made up. Drains are not properly lined  and\r\n\r\nnot  of  the  right size. Even the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  officials,  instead  of  rendering  every\r\n\r\npossible assistance to the pig farmers in Punggol  to\r\n\r\nset  up  their farms on a proper scale, often intrude\r\n\r\ninto the farming activities of the farmers by way  of\r\n\r\ntelling  them  how  and where to  site  certain  farm\r\n\r\nstructures or the general layout of the farms,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  also at the same time telling these farmers that\r\n\r\nthey should not rear less than, say, 600 pigs on  one\r\n\r\nacre of land. If they are given one acre of land, and\r\n\r\ntheir  families  too have to live on  that  piece  of\r\n\r\nland, how much space is left for the farm structures,\r\n\r\nunless it is a flatted farm? In this respect, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Hon. Minister or  his  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  to  look into  the  question  of\r\n\r\noffering  every  possible  assistance  as   well   as\r\n\r\nencouragement to these pig farmers with regard to the\r\n\r\nviability of pig farming industry in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to come back to one small point\r\n\r\nagain  concerning repairs to farm structures. Several\r\n\r\npoultry  farmers have been allowed to  stay  on  this\r\n\r\nland. They have made applications for repairs to  the\r\n\r\nsheds  for  the layers, but these applications  again\r\n\r\ntake  time  to be processed. Sometimes it takes  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  month because these structures are of  wood,\r\n\r\nwiremesh,  zinc,  etc. The poultry  farmers  have  to\r\n\r\nreplace  these layer sheds every one or two years.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Senior  Minister of State  is  very  well\r\n\r\nversed  about the breeding of layers, the  productive\r\n\r\nperiod  of  layers,  and the  time  for  them  to  be\r\n\r\nslaughtered  or  replaced. In  the  meantime,  it  is\r\n\r\nsomewhat  difficult  to  get  new  layers.  In   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  Sir, I would like the Hon. Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  to  assure this House that every  possible\r\n\r\nassistance will be given to the farmers, be they  pig\r\n\r\nfarmers or poultry farmers, that when they apply  for\r\n\r\nrepairs  to  their  farm structures  or  erection  of\r\n\r\ncertain  farm structures, their applications will  be\r\n\r\nexpeditiously approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of fluctuation of prices of farm\r\n\r\nproducts,  it  is  sad  to  note  that  the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department's efforts have been by  way  of\r\n\r\nwords and not deeds. When the price of pigs and  eggs\r\n\r\nfell, there was no proper dialogue or correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween the farmers and the department concerned.  In\r\n\r\nthis   respect,  I  would  like  to  see   a   closer\r\n\r\nrelationship  between the officials  of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department and the pig and poultry farmers\r\n\r\nnot  only  in the matter of farm structures but  also\r\n\r\nthe pricing of their farm products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  response  to the Primary Production Department's\r\n\r\nannouncement  that  farmers should  get  licences  to\r\n\r\ncarry out agricultural activities, has been good. But\r\n\r\nI  have  received  complaints  from  orchid  growers.\r\n\r\nOrchid  growing has not been given any  encouragement\r\n\r\nby  the  PPD. As a result orchid growers  are  rather\r\n\r\nhesitant   in  the  further  development   of   their\r\n\r\nagriculture for the following reasons: firstly, after\r\n\r\npaying  for  a  farmer's  licence  fee,  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department does not give the  farmers  or\r\n\r\norchid   growers  any  substantial  assistance.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the Department does not provide the  orchid\r\n\r\ngrowers   with   Chinese   publications   on   orchid\r\n\r\ncultivation,  growing  of new hybrids,  etc, because\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  publications are in English.  We  must\r\n\r\nrealise that most of these flower growers are Chinese\r\n\r\neducated. This should be taken into account.  In  the\r\n\r\nPPD publications there are too few articles on orchid\r\n\r\ngrowing while there is too little encouragement given\r\n\r\nto  the farmers and orchid growers on developing  the\r\n\r\norchid industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the views on compensation for the\r\n\r\nresettled   farmers  held  by   the   PPD   and   the\r\n\r\nResettlement  office are different and contradictory.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  officials  of the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, compensation is given for wooden supports\r\n\r\nfor potted plants and sun shades for the orchids. But\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement officers say that such items do not\r\n\r\nqualify  for  compensation  because  they  are   only\r\n\r\nsupports for the pots which are removable. There  are\r\n\r\ntwo   conflicting  views  from  the   two   different\r\n\r\ndepartments  on  the  same  subject.  Thus  there  is\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding   among   the   people    resettled,\r\n\r\nresulting in dissatisfaction with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when measuring the land area of the\r\n\r\nflowering   plants,   the   resettlement   assessment\r\n\r\nofficers do not take into account the paths along the\r\n\r\nrows  of flower beds. As a result one acre of  orchid\r\n\r\nplants   can   only  come  to  half   an   acre   for\r\n\r\ncompensation.  This  criterion  is  too   harsh   and\r\n\r\nunreasonable. The compensation payable is inadequate,\r\n\r\neven for removal expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all these complaints, we can come to the\r\n\r\nfollowing conclusions. Firstly, we should develop the\r\n\r\norchid  industry because it is a well  known  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  earner. The volume of export of orchids  in\r\n\r\nrecent years has been growing, and it is earning  for\r\n\r\nus  every  year  quite  a  sizeable  sum  of  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange.  It  is  a  definite  contribution  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  It  is my hope that the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  will  give greater encouragement  to  the\r\n\r\norchid growing industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where flower growers have to be resettled\r\n\r\nthe  rate of compensation should be increased because\r\n\r\nremoval  of flowering plants involve great losses  by\r\n\r\nway of damage. Moreover, on resettlement these flower\r\n\r\ngrowers  have  to start all over again,  thus  facing\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties and uncertain livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if resettled flower growers are to be given\r\n\r\nland  elsewhere,  it is my hope that  the  Department\r\n\r\nconcerned will give a big piece of land to  house  or\r\n\r\nto  resettle all or most of the growers together, as\r\n\r\nin  the  case of the resettlement of pig  farmers  in\r\n\r\nPunggol.  In  this way it could be developed  into  a\r\n\r\ntourist resort to attract foreign visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, where alternative land is not given or not\r\n\r\navailable, the Department concerned should  help  the\r\n\r\nflower  growers to get hawker licences so  that  they\r\n\r\nmay  have  a  new means of livelihood to replace  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of orchid growing which they  have  lost.\r\n\r\nFor  these resettled flower growers, we should  relax\r\n\r\ncertain conditions, e.g, restriction to persons  over\r\n\r\n40  years  of  age,  to bring it  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nthinking of the Senior Minister of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the\r\n\r\nMembers   for  Punggol  and  Jurong.  I   share   the\r\n\r\nsentiments which they have expressed on the  work  of\r\n\r\nthe   Primary  Production  Department.  But  in   all\r\n\r\nfairness  I  would say that technically  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has over the years done  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  good  work in research and introducing a  special\r\n\r\nbreed of pigs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoultry  to  Singapore. To that extent, I think  they\r\n\r\nhave succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, it is not so much a question of whether\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department has done  this  or\r\n\r\nthat  or  has  not done this or that. It  is  more  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  whether  we, the Singapore  Government.\r\n\r\nthink  we  ought  to have a comprehensive  policy  on\r\n\r\nAgriculture, bearing in mind the very limited size of\r\n\r\nSingapore;  whether  we  believe  Agriculture  has  a\r\n\r\nfuture in Singapore. Personally I am inclined  to  be\r\n\r\noptimistic about it. I think it has a future. We only\r\n\r\nhave  to  look back to the last 10 or 15 years.  Time\r\n\r\nand   again   we  have  heard  in  this  House   that\r\n\r\nagriculture is a thing of the past, and  that  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to die. We might just as well let it die.  But\r\n\r\nit  has not died. Not only has it not died, but it is\r\n\r\ndoing even better. If anybody cares to make a survey,\r\n\r\nhe  will be surprised to find out that the number  of\r\n\r\npeople engaged in agriculture today is probably  much\r\n\r\nsmaller in number, and yet we are self-sufficient  in\r\n\r\npork,   chicken  and  eggs,  in  spite  of  a  bigger\r\n\r\npopulation.  What does this mean? It means  that  the\r\n\r\nproductivity rate of our farmers has gone up, despite\r\n\r\nthe  lack of encouragement. Very rightly so,  as  the\r\n\r\nMembers for Punggol and Jurong have pointed out, when\r\n\r\nthe  Department resettles these farmers not  only  do\r\n\r\nthey  not  help  them sufficiently but  are  in  fact\r\n\r\ngiving them a standard lower than what they have been\r\n\r\nused  to. Take, for instance, those farmers in Jurong\r\n\r\nand  Chua Chu Kang. They all have metalled roads  and\r\n\r\nstreet lightings, water and electricity supplies. But\r\n\r\nif  we go and look at the so-called farmways in Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu and Punggol, which have been cleared and waiting\r\n\r\nfor the farmers in Kranji to move in, we will see the\r\n\r\ndifference. They are just mud tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> So was Jurong at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> At the beginning, fair enough.\r\n\r\nBecause  in  those  days they did not  have  metalled\r\n\r\nroads.  They did not have water and electricity.  But\r\n\r\nnow   that   we  have  given  them  metalled   roads,\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  water, are we  suggesting  that  we\r\n\r\ndeprive them of that standard of living? I would have\r\n\r\nthought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  policy of this Government is to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  we go on giving qualitative improvement in  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of our people and not down-grading\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, therefore, rather surprised the other day to\r\n\r\nfind  that one of the farmers, who had taken a  piece\r\n\r\nof land in this so-called farmway and who had applied\r\n\r\nto  have  a few Of these electric poles removed  from\r\n\r\nthe  centre of the land, was asked to pay  a  removal\r\n\r\nfee  of  more than $2,000. This fee of $2,000 is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  referred  to the URSC. I do not  know  whether\r\n\r\nURSC is going to pay for it. Who is going to pay  for\r\n\r\nit?  I  do  not  know. There is a lot of buck-passing\r\n\r\ngoing on. I am not exaggerating, Sir. This is a  very\r\n\r\nserious problem. We resettle an entire community from\r\n\r\none  corner  of Singapore to another. They sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThey  have to put in a lot of hard work. They do  not\r\n\r\nmind.  The  very least we can do is not to make  life\r\n\r\ntoo  difficult for them. The least we can  do  is  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that they are given the same standard  of\r\n\r\nliving, if not a better standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I would like to deal with the\r\n\r\nresettlement  problem last because  the  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nunder heavy fire. I would rather deal with the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson first by saying that what is good for India\r\n\r\nis not necessarily good for Singapore. He has brought\r\n\r\nup  a  number of points. The first point was about  a\r\n\r\ncartoon  on the growing of vegetables on the rooftops\r\n\r\nof  HDB flats. The Primary Production Department  has\r\n\r\nstudied his good suggestion previously on the growing\r\n\r\nof   brinjals  on  rooftops  of  HDB  flats  and  the\r\n\r\nproposition  has  been found to be uneconomical.  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  are  not designed to carry loads.  So  if  the\r\n\r\nMember's suggestion is to be carried out, perhaps the\r\n\r\nstructure  of these buildings has to be modified  and\r\n\r\nthis  means  higher costs. Moreover,  to  accommodate\r\n\r\nfarming  activities on top of a residential block  of\r\n\r\nflats somehow is incompatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also queried why no efforts have been made to\r\n\r\ndevelop  agriculture  or  poultry  industry  in   the\r\n\r\noutlying islands of Singapore. The PPD has considered\r\n\r\nthe usage of the outlying islands for rearing of both\r\n\r\npigs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoultry,  but  to introduce the basic  infrastructure\r\n\r\nfor  pig and poultry rearing large sums of money will\r\n\r\nbe required. Here again, economic factors dissuade us\r\n\r\nfrom developing the outlying islands into pig farming\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also questioned whether Singapore could\r\n\r\nnot  only be self-sufficient in food but also  be  an\r\n\r\nexporter of food. I can merely reiterate what we have\r\n\r\nmentioned  here  before.  We are  self-sufficient  in\r\n\r\npigs,  poultry and eggs. As for exports, he has heard\r\n\r\nthe  complaints  from some of the  rural  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  -  that  there are now  and  then  excess\r\n\r\nsupplies  of  eggs and meat. But as a policy  matter,\r\n\r\nself-sufficiency  in the particular  areas  of  pigs,\r\n\r\npoultry and eggs will be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his observation on illegal slaughtering of\r\n\r\npigs,  the  Primary  Production  Department  has   an\r\n\r\nenforcement  unit.  In fact, it has  intensified  its\r\n\r\nraids  on  illegal  slaughtering  of  pigs.  Just  to\r\n\r\nconvince  him,  342  checks  on  market  stalls  were\r\n\r\ncarried out, and 81 raids were conducted on suspected\r\n\r\nareas  of illegal slaughtering. As a result of  this,\r\n\r\n6 1/2  tons of illegal pork were seized, 40 prosecutions\r\n\r\nwere  carried out, and a total sum of $21,000 in fine\r\n\r\nwas imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his observation on cheating on the sale of\r\n\r\nmutton, frozen mutton is sold in the market at  about\r\n\r\n$1.90 per pound against fresh mutton which is sold at\r\n\r\nabout  $2.40 per pound. The hon. Member did  complain\r\n\r\nof  the  high price of mutton two years ago. At  that\r\n\r\ntime fresh mutton was sold at $2.70 per pound. If the\r\n\r\nbutcher  is cheating the housewife by charging  fresh\r\n\r\nmutton price for frozen mutton, perhaps he can report\r\n\r\nthe matter to CASE for their investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take the comments made by the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang. I somehow feel that he has a fantastic\r\n\r\ninterest  in orchid growing. In fact, he has appealed\r\n\r\nvery strongly to ensure that the orchid industry does\r\n\r\nnot  go  down.  I  have  during  the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address answered some queries  made  by\r\n\r\nsome rural MPs, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular, the Member for Nee Soon. I did  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Primary  Production Department was looking  into\r\n\r\nalternative sites to help resettle some of the orchid\r\n\r\ngrowers. I could also perhaps state here that  if  he\r\n\r\nis  referring to orchid growers who are at the moment\r\n\r\ncultivating orchids within forest reserves, then that\r\n\r\nis  not legal and, in fact, no licence has ever  been\r\n\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his comments that the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has done insufficiently  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\npublication  is concerned, that there  is  inadequate\r\n\r\ncompensation   and   that  there   are   too   strict\r\n\r\nregulations involving assessment, perhaps he does not\r\n\r\nknow   that   the  assessment  of  the   Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  referred  to the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  for approval. In other words,  PPD  being\r\n\r\nthe authority where farming activities are concerned,\r\n\r\nwill  say  which  item, whether it is  the  pot,  the\r\n\r\nflower  or whatever it is, should be compensated.  If\r\n\r\nPPD  gives  that assurance, in most  cases  it  is  a\r\n\r\nformality for the Resettlement Department to approve.\r\n\r\nI cannot see the logic of a non-technical department,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Resettlement Department, telling PPD  or\r\n\r\ndisagreeing   totally  with  PPD  on  the   technical\r\n\r\nassessment.  I am not in a position to argue  whether\r\n\r\nthe  pot  is  for  the  growing  of  orchids  or  for\r\n\r\nsomething else, but I am talking generally  that  the\r\n\r\nPPD  does  the assessment. And if the PPD  gives  its\r\n\r\napproval,  the Resettlement Department, in all  cases\r\n\r\nthat I know of, automatically approves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also made a number of suggestions which I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  he is serious about, for example,  giving\r\n\r\nhawker  licences to orchid growers  who  have  to  be\r\n\r\nresettled.  The  reason is very  simple.  During  the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate on the Ministry of the Environment  we\r\n\r\nhave  indicated that sympathetic consideration  would\r\n\r\nbe  given  to real hardship cases, and so on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. So if these are legal orchid growers, and they\r\n\r\ncome under the resettlement guidelines, then the same\r\n\r\nconsideration will be given to them as that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  resettlement  of  pig  farmers  or  poultry\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has brought up a number of\r\n\r\npoints. He has criticised the PPD for having done  so\r\n\r\nlittle  to  help,  in  particular,  the  farming  and\r\n\r\nfishing  communities. Of course, he is still  unhappy\r\n\r\nover  the question of bona fide farmers, and  implies\r\n\r\nthat the PPD is most unfair in its assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding resettlement by the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation, here again the PPD assists the  HDB  and\r\n\r\nJTC   in   assessing  farming  activities.   I   have\r\n\r\npreviously indicated that it is not done by  just  an\r\n\r\nofficer  of  the  PPD. There is a panel  which  meets\r\n\r\nregularly  to  assess cases. There  are  criteria  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with.  Just to give Members an indication,  I\r\n\r\nhave  here the figures which show that for the period\r\n\r\n1971  to 1976 this panel has actually assessed  2,025\r\n\r\ncases.  If  he  is,  in  fact, complaining  of   the\r\n\r\nprocessing  of these cases to decide whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthey  are  bona  fide farmers, then I have  indicated\r\n\r\njust  now that they meet regularly. They meet  weekly\r\n\r\nor fortnightly depending on the urgency of the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am purposely leaving the other questions on the\r\n\r\nPPD  activities last, and answer some  of  his  other\r\n\r\nqueries  first,  for  example, the  Auditor-General's\r\n\r\nreport  on  improper control of finances at  the  PPD\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry of National Development.  I  can\r\n\r\nmerely  reiterate here that the Department has  noted\r\n\r\nthe  observation of the Auditor-General and, in fact,\r\n\r\nimprovements are being made to correct the weaknesses\r\n\r\nof  the  accounting system. The Ministry has informed\r\n\r\nthe  PPD  to constantly review the accounting system.\r\n\r\nHe wanted some idea on how many officers are involved\r\n\r\nin monetary matters. Actually it involves 86 officers\r\n\r\nfrom   the  public  counter  up  to  the  authorising\r\n\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question on why we resettle farmers from\r\n\r\nSembawang  and Kranji areas to Punggol,  I  think  an\r\n\r\nexplanation  has  been  given before,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\npriority  for  the supply of water is more  important\r\n\r\nthan  the rearing of pigs. That explanation has  been\r\n\r\ngiven   before  and,  in  fact,  to  show  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is serious in its intention to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresettle  those affected in the catchment areas,  the\r\n\r\nSembawang Pig Farm which was a project of the PPD was\r\n\r\naborted  completely  because of this  new  policy  to\r\n\r\nconserve  water. As a result, no money was  spent  at\r\n\r\nall to proceed with this pig farm project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these suggestions that the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has done very little to help the  farmers\r\n\r\nare  to me unfair. I would say that the PPD, like all\r\n\r\nother  departments, has to follow Government  policy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  the fault of the PPD to resettle  people\r\n\r\nfrom  one area, be it in Jurong or Chua Chu Kang,  to\r\n\r\nPunggol. The blame should not be entirely levelled at\r\n\r\nthe PPD, which only follows Government policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the complaint from the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  that in the resettlement from particular\r\n\r\nareas  to  Punggol  where  there  is  at  the  moment\r\n\r\ninadequate  or improper infrastructure,  is  a  valid\r\n\r\nobservation.  But I have already indicated  that,  as\r\n\r\nfar as the new Punggol pig farming area is concerned,\r\n\r\nit will be the pig farming area in Singapore and that\r\n\r\ninfrastructure like drainage, water, electricity  and\r\n\r\nso on, are being provided, but this has to be done on\r\n\r\na  phase-to-phase basis. I have the figures here  and\r\n\r\nif  Members are interested, Phase I has already  been\r\n\r\ncompleted  and all the infrastructural amenities  are\r\n\r\nthere. As I said, I can quote the necessary amount of\r\n\r\nmoney  spent  to lay the necessary infrastructure  as\r\n\r\nfar as electricity, roads and so on are concerned. In\r\n\r\nother  words,  I am saying that ultimately  when  the\r\n\r\nwhole area is developed, the Punggol pig farming area\r\n\r\nwill  be as good, if not better, than the areas where\r\n\r\nthey  have come from, but it takes sometime  for  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to be laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the query of difficulties to obtain a permit\r\n\r\nto  even  repair or erect poultry or pig sites,  here\r\n\r\nagain   the   difficulties  involve   a   number   of\r\n\r\ndepartments. For example, the application form has to\r\n\r\ngo  to the Land Office which is under the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLaw.  If  it  involves  pollution,  it  goes  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment and then,  of  course,\r\n\r\nbuilding  comes under the Building Control  Division.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulty in getting a permit is due to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninability  on the part of the PPD, then I  think  the\r\n\r\nPPD  will try its best to expedite matters. But  here\r\n\r\nagain the difficulty is not just the PPD, It involves\r\n\r\nthree  big  Ministries. For the Ministry of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, while I can say that the PPD can help to\r\n\r\nsend  the  applications on behalf of the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nBCD,  the  farmers may still have to  wait  for  land\r\n\r\nclearance  by the Ministry of Law and clearance  from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> But this is a non-catchment area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I would say that if there is\r\n\r\ndifficulty   in  terms  of  coordinating   with   the\r\n\r\ndifferent Ministries, the PPD can have a go at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to another allegation that the PPD has done\r\n\r\nnothing about fluctuations of produce prices, such as\r\n\r\neggs,  poultry,  and  pigs.  The  PPD  monitors   the\r\n\r\nsituation  constantly. PPD knows when the  prices  of\r\n\r\npigs and eggs go up or down, and it liaises with  the\r\n\r\nLivestock  Association most of the  time.  But,  like\r\n\r\neveryone  else,  when  the  price  of  pigs  goes  up\r\n\r\nsteeply,  every  farmer is happy. But  when  it  goes\r\n\r\ndown,  then  every farmer appeals to the PPD  or  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to do something. Here again,  the  market\r\n\r\nforces  take  care  of this. In going  into  pig  and\r\n\r\npoultry  rearing, one of the basic requirements  that\r\n\r\nany  farmer  or  anybody who goes into  the  business\r\n\r\nshould  know  that when you over-produce  you  get  a\r\n\r\nsituation   of   excess,  and   this   excess   comes\r\n\r\nperiodically. In fact, if the farmer is of  any  good\r\n\r\ncalibre,  he  will  know that  after  several  years,\r\n\r\nnormally there is a cycle of three to four years,  he\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  situation of this nature,  an  excess.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  he is a good businessman,  he  should\r\n\r\nkeep something for a rainy day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the Government should not interfere\r\n\r\nwith  market  forces, unless  the  situation  really\r\n\r\ndemands  it,  because the market forces  will  always\r\n\r\nbalance it. So the PPD is aware of all the situations\r\n\r\nas  far as price movements are concerned. In fact, it\r\n\r\neven  has to monitor the prices of raw materials used\r\n\r\nin making feeds for feeding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchickens  and pigs. So it is unfair to say  that  the\r\n\r\nPPD  is  not coming out to help. The PPD is aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation but, as it should be, it leaves it  to\r\n\r\nmarket forces to take care of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has brought up the question\r\n\r\nof  the  PPD  officers  being unsympathetic  and  not\r\n\r\nwanting to help. Here again. I would say that  I  beg\r\n\r\nto  differ.  I think the PPD officers have  tried  to\r\n\r\nhelp  but  certain  things  which  are  beyond  their\r\n\r\ncontrol  have  been levelled at them and  criticised.\r\n\r\nFor   example,  resettlement  benefits.  Resettlement\r\n\r\nbenefits are arrived at Ministry level. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nenhanced  rate of compensation paid by Government  to\r\n\r\nall  resettlement cases, be it farmers,  residential,\r\n\r\ncommercial,  shop-houses and so on, is decided  by  a\r\n\r\ncommittee.  The Ministry of National Development  has\r\n\r\nto  convince the Ministry of Finance who then  agrees\r\n\r\non  the  rates  of compensation to be  paid  to  each\r\n\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, the last review of compensation rates\r\n\r\nwas made in April 1975. If there is justification for\r\n\r\na re-assessment, the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\ncould suggest it. But once the schedule of rates  has\r\n\r\nbeen  agreed, then the PPD, like any other department\r\n\r\nfor example, the Resettlement Department, JTC and the\r\n\r\nHDB,  has  to  comply with the rates. If  the  Member\r\n\r\ncomplains that there is inadequate compensation, then\r\n\r\nit  is  a different issue from the status of  a  bona\r\n\r\nfide  farmer.  Arguing that he is  not  a  bona  fide\r\n\r\nfarmer  is  a different issue, and I have  given  the\r\n\r\nreasons.  They must comply with certain requirements.\r\n\r\nIf  one  is a bona fide farmer, it means that  he  is\r\n\r\ntotally  dependent  on farming for  a  livelihood.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is difficult for us to decide on this issue\r\n\r\nas  we  are  laymen. But there is a panel of  experts\r\n\r\nwhich   has   the  expertise  to  determine   farming\r\n\r\nactivities. I think it is most unfair to  look  at  a\r\n\r\nfarming family where the son is just helping out  now\r\n\r\nand  then  and  then  conclude  that  he  is  totally\r\n\r\ndependent  on farming for a livelihood. I think  that\r\n\r\nis too simple to be true. But I stand corrected. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  some  rural MPs have appealed on their  behalf\r\n\r\nand until their positions have been reassessed by the\r\n\r\npanel of experts and if it is true that they are bona\r\n\r\nfide  farmers,  then the bona fide  status  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the question on the need for a comprehensive\r\n\r\nagricultural  policy  by  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  This was brought up by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu.  The  Ministry of  National  Development\r\n\r\nbelieves that agriculture has a part to play. But  it\r\n\r\nis  obviously  a limited part. It can only  play  its\r\n\r\npart  in terms of the overall development because  of\r\n\r\nother  priorities. The PPD is the instrument  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development to ensure that there\r\n\r\nis self-sufficiency in pork, meat, and eggs. The very\r\n\r\nfact   that  the  Punggol  farming  area   has   been\r\n\r\ndesignated  as  an  area for  pig  farming  and  that\r\n\r\npoultry  farming  is allowed to be  carried  on  must\r\n\r\nindicate that agriculture has a part to play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few rural MPs\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  carried away by the  assertion  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu that the agricultural policy is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  general policy for  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that is, the policy of the Government  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  and  improve the standard of living  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. He said that we are, in fact, by\r\n\r\nresettling  the farmers, lowering their  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  If Members were to listen carefully  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jalan Kayu, they will find from  his  own\r\n\r\nwords  that, far from lowering the standard of living\r\n\r\nof the farmers, the standard of living of the farmers\r\n\r\nduring  the  last ten years has, largely through  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  the PPD, improved because  they  have\r\n\r\nincreased  their productivity. Now, having  increased\r\n\r\ntheir  productivity, they must be better off.  So  do\r\n\r\nnot be carried away by just one assertion. They ought\r\n\r\nto listen carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State\r\n\r\nhas not replied to my query on the Jurong Abattoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department has no jurisdiction  over  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the  Jurong  Abattoir.  Actually  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Abattoir is under a  Government  company\r\n\r\ncalled the Primary Industries Enterprise (Pte) Ltd. I\r\n\r\nwas   on  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nIndustries  Enterprise until  last  year.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  his  allegation that the management  employs\r\n\r\nbeautiful  girls  on their staff at  the  expense  of\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  at  the  expense  of  the  necessary\r\n\r\nskilled  workmanship. The fact of the matter is  that\r\n\r\nthe  abattoir  operates  six  nights  a  week.  If  I\r\n\r\nremember  correctly, all the six nights are on  shift\r\n\r\nwork. Because of constant usage there is insufficient\r\n\r\ntime for the proper maintenance of machinery. But the\r\n\r\nmanagement  knows  that during certain  periods,  for\r\n\r\nexample, during the Chinese New Year season the usage\r\n\r\nis  greater than usual. Time was set purposely  aside\r\n\r\nto  strip  all the machinery, to repair it  and  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  it is in tip-top condition for continuous\r\n\r\nuse, in particular during the festive seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem of inadequate labourers. The\r\n\r\nabattoir,  in  particular the  slaughtering  section,\r\n\r\noperates from 11.00 p.m. at night to 5.00 a.m. in the\r\n\r\nmorning. This is to ensure the availability of fresh,\r\n\r\nwarm meat for consumers in the early morning. This is\r\n\r\na practice peculiar to Singapore. In other countries,\r\n\r\nthe supply of fresh warm meat has been taken over  by\r\n\r\nfrozen  meat. Because of the nature of the work  from 11.00  p.m. to  5.00 a.m. the difficulty  of  getting\r\n\r\nlabourers to do the work of slaughtering is great.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been told that, on the other hand, the  company\r\n\r\nis trying its best to improve the staffing situation.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  plan to renovate the whole building  as\r\n\r\nwell as the machinery to ensure that efficiency could\r\n\r\nbe maintained at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The development projects\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the Government in Geylang  Serai  are\r\n\r\nprogressing smoothly because every Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nso  affected  has  been rehoused in  HDB  flats, and\r\n\r\nsimilarly  displaced  shopkeepers  are  offered   HDB\r\n\r\nshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of mosques and suraus which are\r\n\r\nalso affected by these development projects; like the\r\n\r\nones  at  Jalan Alsagoff, Jalan Mydin,  Lorong  Engku\r\n\r\nAman and a Madrasah (that is, a religious school)  at\r\n\r\nJalan Pasir. A source of regret to me is that to-date\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  not as yet offered  alternative\r\n\r\nsites  so  that these religious structures  could  be\r\n\r\nrebuilt.

Member\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang Serai has suggested that there is a need\r\n\r\nto  reserve  sites  to  replace  suraus  and  mosques\r\n\r\naffected  by development projects. In the process  of\r\n\r\nurban  renewal, as people move out from old areas  to\r\n\r\nbe  developed, temples, mosques or churches will have\r\n\r\nto  give  way  to  new development. The  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy,  however, is to reserve adequate  sites  for\r\n\r\nreligious  buildings  in the  new  towns  into  which\r\n\r\npeople  are  moving.  In the limited  land  space  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  it is, of course, not possible to  replace\r\n\r\nall  religious buildings on a one-to-one basis.  But,\r\n\r\ndepending on the size of the congregation in each  of\r\n\r\nthese   housing  estates,  adequate  space  will   be\r\n\r\nreserved  for religious buildings. In line with  this\r\n\r\npolicy  one new mosque will be built in each HDB  new\r\n\r\ntown  where the Muslim population is 20,000 or  more,\r\n\r\nThe  relevant religious authorities have been advised\r\n\r\nof this new policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, new mosques are under construction in\r\n\r\nQueenstown, Toa Payoh and Jurong.

When\r\n\r\nthese  mosques  are completed, the  Muslim  community\r\n\r\nwill be able to conduct their religious activities in\r\n\r\nwell-designed  buildings and in better  environmental\r\n\r\nconditions.

At\r\n\r\nthe same time, I proposed that the HDB should set  up\r\n\r\na  special duties unit to deal with special  problems\r\n\r\nraised  by  MPs from time to time. But it was  turned\r\n\r\ndown  by the Senior Minister of State. Sir, I do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to repeat what I had said. But I would like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise   one  point  here,  and   that   is,   the\r\n\r\nadministrative efficiency of the HDB  seems  to  have\r\n\r\nslackened, perhaps due to the rapid expansion and the\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers of flats which have been built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Constituency of Henderson is a HDB estate. On the\r\n\r\none  hand,  we  can see the oldest type  of  one-room\r\n\r\nflats  and, on the other, we can see the latest newly\r\n\r\ndesigned four-room flats. The area of my Constituency\r\n\r\nis very small but there are three HDB Area Offices to\r\n\r\nhandle  the Board's day-to-day affairs in the estate.\r\n\r\nI  have  received a lot of complaints  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime. One complaint I want to cite here is the hawker\r\n\r\nproblem.  Sir, we can see and many MPs who  have  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  in  their  Constituencies know  that  the  HDB\r\n\r\nofficials  have  to  issue summonses  to  the  unruly\r\n\r\nhawkers  so  that  the rules and regulations  can  be\r\n\r\nmaintained  and  strengthened. I am  quite  convinced\r\n\r\nthat  their  actions are legal and they  deserve  our\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lai, this subhead is on\r\n\r\n\"Contributions to the Housing and Development Board\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Yes.

I am talking about the\r\n\r\nadministrative  efficiency of the HDB.  Sir,  let  me\r\n\r\nexplain. From time to time, we can see officials from\r\n\r\ntwo  departments issuing summonses to hawkers  -  one\r\n\r\nfrom  the HDB Maxwell Road office and the other  from\r\n\r\nthe  HDB Area Office. I quote two examples. These two\r\n\r\nexamples  occurred very recently. In the first  case,\r\n\r\none  early  morning at about 8 o'clock, HDB officials\r\n\r\nfrom the Maxwell Road office came down to issue about\r\n\r\n20 summonses to hawkers. The second incident occurred\r\n\r\nonly last week. Officials from the Area Office issued\r\n\r\nsummons  on  one hawker. The summons was  undated.  I\r\n\r\nhave  got a photostat copy here. The summons required\r\n\r\nthe  hawker within three days to do this  and  to  do\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see here that the HDB\r\n\r\nofficials from two departments are issuing summons to\r\n\r\nhawkers  from  time to time. There must be  something\r\n\r\nwrong. Hon. Members and Ministers might be interested\r\n\r\nto  know that in my Constituency, there are not  only\r\n\r\nhawker  centres under the HDB but also hawker centres\r\n\r\nunder  the jurisdiction of the Hawkers Department  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment and the Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation.  But I find that the HDB  hawker  centre\r\n\r\nhas given me the most trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not Justice Pao and neither do I want to see\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's  axe fall on the officials  mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now.  I  do  hope that while  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\ndealing  with  these  officials  with  leniency,  the\r\n\r\nworking  efficiency  of  the HDB  must  be  improved.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the life of more than half of the country's\r\n\r\npopulation will be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among other things, the problems of the aged\r\n\r\nand the young living in the HDB flats and the problem\r\n\r\nof  families with only one breadwinner striving  hard\r\n\r\nto support their dependants, are always worthy of our\r\n\r\nconcern and attention.

This is good news to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, particularly the one-room  flat\r\n\r\ndwellers.  This  is  a  correct decision  because  it\r\n\r\npromotes the hygiene and health of the people. So  we\r\n\r\nexpress  our  full support for the HDB's decision  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter. But since the Housing Board intends  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  living environment  of  flat  dwellers,\r\n\r\ntheir  attention should not be confined to  the  one-room  flats.  They should also pay attention  to  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the existing old housing estates, because\r\n\r\nsuch problems do affect the health and the hygiene of\r\n\r\nthe people living in old housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there have been numerous lift\r\n\r\nbreakdowns  in  the old housing estates.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nserious  problem, because usually in every  block  of\r\n\r\nflats  in  the old housing estates there is only  one\r\n\r\nlift  available. If the lift breaks  down,  then  the\r\n\r\nresidents  have  to climb all the  way  up  to  their\r\n\r\nflats.  This causes great inconvenience, particularly\r\n\r\nto  children and old people who find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nclimb  up  the  steps. Worse still, whenever  a  lift\r\n\r\nbreaks  down,  very  often people  are  known  to  be\r\n\r\ntrapped  inside.  Not  to  mention  other  instances,\r\n\r\nduring  my  door-to-door visits, I had the experience\r\n\r\nof   being  trapped  in  a  lift.  Because  of  these\r\n\r\nbreakdowns, very often I have to climb all the way up\r\n\r\nto  visit my constituents in the flats. This goes  to\r\n\r\nshow  how serious this problem of lift breakdown  is.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, during my meet-the-people sessions  and\r\n\r\nduring  my  house-to-house visits, I receive  various\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  the  public,  many  of  which   are\r\n\r\ncomplaints of lift breakdowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have on their behalf taken up this matter of lift\r\n\r\nbreakdowns with the Area Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned, but the reaction from the various officers\r\n\r\nhas  been  very disappointing. They seem to hold  the\r\n\r\nview  that old lifts must break down just  as  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  natural for old people to fall sick.  So  these\r\n\r\nofficers  do not take a very positive or enthusiastic\r\n\r\ninterest  in  the repair of old lifts. I  think  this\r\n\r\nattitude is very questionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Housing Board has increased the\r\n\r\nconservancy   charges  for  maintenance   and   other\r\n\r\nservices.  The Housing Board only knows how  to  make\r\n\r\nthe flat dwellers pay more by way of such charges but\r\n\r\ndoes  not  seem  to take a serious  interest  in  the\r\n\r\nrepairs  and  the  maintenance  of  lifts  and  other\r\n\r\nfacilities  in old housing estates. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nexasperating situation to the residents. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board will take a serious view of the  matter\r\n\r\nand  positively look into the problem of lifts of old\r\n\r\nflats going out of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, we support the Housing Board in\r\n\r\ntrying to improve the one-room flats because it  will\r\n\r\ngo  a  step further to enhance the health and hygiene\r\n\r\nof  the  people. This reminds me of the  problems  of\r\n\r\nhealth and hygiene in the old housing estates. If  we\r\n\r\nvisit  such old housing estates, we will notice  that\r\n\r\nthe  state of hygiene and cleanliness is not all that\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. There is a vast difference between  the\r\n\r\nstate  of health and hygiene in the old and  the  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates. The Housing Board may  conveniently\r\n\r\nput  the  blame  entirely on  the  residents  of  old\r\n\r\nhousing estates saying these people do not take  much\r\n\r\ntrouble in looking after their own hygiene. In  fact,\r\n\r\nit  is the Housing Board itself that should bear  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  responsibility for it.  The  HDB  officials\r\n\r\nthink  that since these housing estates are  old,  so\r\n\r\nthey  must  be dirtier and so it is not necessary  to\r\n\r\ntake so much trouble to clean up the place. Of course\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  wrong  attitude.  There  should  not  be\r\n\r\ndifferent  standards of care for  different  estates.\r\n\r\nThe HDB should hold the view that because the estates\r\n\r\nare  old,  they  need more attention  in  respect  of\r\n\r\ncleaning services. This is the only, correct attitude\r\n\r\nto   take  in  order  to  improve  the  hygiene   and\r\n\r\ncleanliness of old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing  estates. So I hope the authorities concerned\r\n\r\nwill look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from these two matters, the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  is not providing enough  recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities  for old housing estates. In the  case  of\r\n\r\nnew  housing  estates, the HDB  has  planned  for  a\r\n\r\ncomplete   range  of  facilities  like  supermarkets,\r\n\r\nswimming pools, children's playgrounds, etc.  But  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  old housing estates, the HDB  holds  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  attitude altogether. What I am  trying  to\r\n\r\nsay  is not to ask the Housing Board to provide  the.\r\n\r\nsame facilities to old housing estates as in the case\r\n\r\nof  new housing estates, as we all know that this  is\r\n\r\nimpossible.   But   the  HDB  must  nonetheless   pay\r\n\r\nattention to the recreational needs of people in  the\r\n\r\nold  housing estates, particularly when  there  is  a\r\n\r\nhigher  population density in the old housing estates\r\n\r\nand  therefore  the need for recreational  facilities\r\n\r\nfor old people and children is greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their needs are quite urgent. But unfortunately we\r\n\r\ndo  not see any adequate provision of such facilities\r\n\r\nfor  old  people  and  children in  the  old  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  This also reflects the nonchalant  attitude\r\n\r\nof the HDB towards old housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is my hope that the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard authority will change its attitude towards  the\r\n\r\nold  housing  estates by building and providing  more\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities  for  the  old  people   and\r\n\r\nchildren  in the old housing estates. As  the  saying\r\n\r\ngoes, when it is snowing a gift of coal will be  more\r\n\r\nappreciated  by the needy than a gift of  flowers  to\r\n\r\nthe affluent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, the way in which the HDB\r\n\r\ncompulsorily acquire flats on serious breaches of the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board (Amendment) Act has, in\r\n\r\npractice,  caused hardship and anguish to the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned. A few cases would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nillustrate these difficulties. An unmarried woman,  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen, qualifies for a HDB flat  and  is\r\n\r\ngiven  one.  She  lives in it with  her  parents  and\r\n\r\nsisters, all of whom are permanent residents but with\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizenship. In due time the owner  of  the\r\n\r\nflat  married and moved into the matrimonial home  of\r\n\r\nher husband. Because the husband owned the house, the\r\n\r\nwoman was asked by the HDB to surrender her flat. She\r\n\r\nis  now  unable  to perform her filial  duty  to  her\r\n\r\nparents who must now vacate the flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instance is of a father who qualifies for\r\n\r\na HDB flat but purchased it in the name of his eldest\r\n\r\nson. The father provided the entire purchase price of\r\n\r\nthe flat. In due time the eldest son married and seek\r\n\r\nto  transfer the flat back to the father, so that he,\r\n\r\nthe  son, could apply for his own flat. The HDB could\r\n\r\nnot do it under current policy. There are other cases\r\n\r\nwhere owners have gone on to acquire other commercial\r\n\r\nproperties and to improve themselves. Such owners are\r\n\r\nalso required to surrender the flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the HDB has arbitrarily fixed the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  such commercial properties without  giving\r\n\r\nany  thought  to the hardship caused to  the  owners.\r\n\r\nThere are many other instances to show how inflexible\r\n\r\napplications   of   policies   have    resulted    in\r\n\r\ndispossessed  families. The Urban  Renewal  Authority\r\n\r\nand other authorities are encouraging the development\r\n\r\nof  private  shopping and commercial complexes.  Such\r\n\r\ncomplexes are usually sold by the developers. A buyer\r\n\r\nneed  not  necessarily pay cash for the  purchase  of\r\n\r\nthese  shopping  and commercial complexes.  They  can\r\n\r\nobtain loans through mortgages for such purchases  or\r\n\r\nenter into partnerships. The argument may be that  if\r\n\r\nan  owner  of  a  HDB flat can afford to  purchase  a\r\n\r\ncommercial property, he should be able to purchase  a\r\n\r\nprivate flat or a house. Soon such an argument became\r\n\r\nfar-fetched.  There appears to be some  contradiction\r\n\r\nin  granting exemption to certain cases. For example,\r\n\r\nif  a person owns a shophouse where he carries on his\r\n\r\nbusiness and where it is not possible for him to live\r\n\r\nin  it, he may be granted exemption. There should  be\r\n\r\nno  distinction in granting exemption if a commercial\r\n\r\nproperty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout living quarters is used by the owner for  the\r\n\r\nconduct of his own business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise, Sir, is the need\r\n\r\nfor  the  Housing and Development Board  to  help  to\r\n\r\nimprove the livelihood of tenants of one-room  flats.\r\n\r\nIn  Toa Payoh, for instance, there are several blocks\r\n\r\nof  one-room  flats whose occupants have been  living\r\n\r\nthere  for  more  than 10 years.  Many  of  them  are\r\n\r\nearning  a  subsistence wage. Due to various  reasons\r\n\r\nthey  are unable to afford to purchase a larger  flat\r\n\r\nunder  the  home  ownership  scheme.  Many  of  these\r\n\r\nresidents   have   applied  for  hawker   stalls   to\r\n\r\nsupplement  the family income. Such applications  are\r\n\r\nrejected by the Housing Board on the grounds that one\r\n\r\nor  other members of the family are already employed.\r\n\r\nI  would like to quote an excerpt of a speech by  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister for Labour at the opening of the Sixth\r\n\r\nInternational Metal Workers Federation,  Asian  Youth\r\n\r\nand Women Symposium:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We also want mothers to continue to work, partly to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem of labour shortage and partly  to\r\n\r\nsupplement the family income`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By helping to supplement the family income it will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  improve the standard of living of  families\r\n\r\nliving  in one-room flats. Any additional income  can\r\n\r\nprovide better food as well as better health  to  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group.  For the better  educated,  for\r\n\r\nthose with some vocational experience, it may be easy\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  obtain other forms of employment.  But\r\n\r\nthere are housewives who, for compelling reasons, are\r\n\r\nunable  to work away from their homes, leaving  their\r\n\r\nyoung  children unattended at home. As there  are  so\r\n\r\nmany  vacant hawker stalls in Toa Payoh itself  which\r\n\r\nare not taken up, there should be some flexibility in\r\n\r\nallotting these stalls to the people that I have just\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to raise is on application\r\n\r\nfor   transfer   of   hawker  stalls.   The   Hawkers\r\n\r\nCoordinating and Licensing Committee has decided that\r\n\r\napplications  for  transfer  cannot  be   considered.\r\n\r\nObviously,  this  Committee does not  understand  the\r\n\r\nplight  of  hawkers  at all. For  example, a  hawker\r\n\r\nliving in a one-room flat in Toa Payoh has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurchased  a  three-room flat in Ang Mo  Kio  or  any\r\n\r\nother  estate farther away. He has to travel  a  long\r\n\r\ndistance  to  his stall in Toa Payoh, notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe fact that he has to bring along the paraphernalia\r\n\r\nof  his trade. Another example is poor business. Most\r\n\r\nhawkers are dependent on their trade as a sole  means\r\n\r\nof  earning  a livelihood. Of course, to the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  the easiest solution is to give up the  stall.\r\n\r\nBut  one must consider: what about the livelihood  of\r\n\r\nthe family? May I suggest that some consideration  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  applicants  for  transfers  in  cases   of\r\n\r\nhardship.  They  need  to be  assisted  in  times  of\r\n\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I draw the attention of the House to\r\n\r\nsome  difficulties faced by purchasers and owners  of\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board  flats.  The   first\r\n\r\ndifficulty is on the resale of flats. When  an  owner\r\n\r\nwishes  to  purchase a larger flat, he has to  resell\r\n\r\nhis  existing flat at cost to a buyer selected by the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. The present system  is\r\n\r\nfor the Housing Board to send out letters of offer to\r\n\r\napplicants  on  the  waiting list.  This  can  go  on\r\n\r\nindefinitely, if no suitable buyer is found.  I  have\r\n\r\ncome  across  two cases where one owner has  to  wait\r\n\r\nfive  months and another slightly more than one  year\r\n\r\nbefore  their  old  flats  are  sold  to  the  buyers\r\n\r\nselected  by  the Housing Board. In  such  cases  the\r\n\r\nvendor  has  to pay instalments for two  flats  while\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  a  buyer. May I  suggest  that  a  more\r\n\r\nexpeditious  system  be  introduced  to  reduce   the\r\n\r\nwaiting  period, such as keeping a separate  register\r\n\r\nfor  applicants who wish to opt for the  purchase  of\r\n\r\nresold flats or repossessed flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to raise is on sworn\r\n\r\ndeclarations. At present all applicants  for  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board flats have to obtain  a  sworn\r\n\r\ndeclaration  from  the Supreme Court  or  a  firm  of\r\n\r\nAdvocates  and  Solicitors.  This  has  caused   some\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to the applicants. I  understand  that\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board is looking into the possibility  of\r\n\r\narranging  for  some of their officers to  administer\r\n\r\nsuch declaration at the time when an application  for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  flat is made.

I  merely\r\n\r\nrise to seek some information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for information regarding the\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the Housing Board has in  mind,  for  the\r\n\r\nimprovement of one-room flats, especially those flats\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  \"emergency\" flats. What has  been  the\r\n\r\nrationale  for making a selection of those particular\r\n\r\nareas  where  it  has been publicised  that  the  HDB\r\n\r\nintends  to  begin  improvement work?  What  are  the\r\n\r\ncriteria  that  have been used to make selection  for\r\n\r\npriority  to  be given to certain types of  emergency\r\n\r\nflats  in  certain  areas?  Can  the  House  also  be\r\n\r\ninformed  whether there is any programme to work  out\r\n\r\nthe  timing  when attention will be  given  to  other\r\n\r\nareas  with  one-room flats, after those  with  first\r\n\r\npriority have been attended to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I agree with what has already\r\n\r\nbeen  said  by  the previous hon. Members  about  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board but with over  80,000\r\n\r\napplicants on the waiting list I still feel that they\r\n\r\nhave, in fact, done a good job. Apart from the points\r\n\r\nthat have been brought up, there are still many other\r\n\r\nminor  matters  which  are  not  being  looked   into\r\n\r\nproperly.  Let me cite a few examples. On one  of  my\r\n\r\nvisits  to a block of flats in Telok Blangah, I  came\r\n\r\nacross  iron  rods sticking out from  staircases.  In\r\n\r\nfact, there were five iron rods sticking out in  that\r\n\r\nbuilding  alone. I feel that such things  should  not\r\n\r\nhappen at all, though it is of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminor   nature.  But  during  an  inspection   before\r\n\r\nacceptance,  all  these  minor  faults  should   have\r\n\r\nalready been taken care of. There is no need for  the\r\n\r\nlocal  Member of Parliament to go round  and  make  a\r\n\r\nreport to the Area Office for necessary action to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.  All  these are minor matters that should  not\r\n\r\narise  and  should have been seen to  and  done  with\r\n\r\nbefore the residents move in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my constituents came to see me and asked\r\n\r\nabout  playgrounds, etc. I usually tell  them  to  be\r\n\r\npatient.  I tell them that it is all in the plan  and\r\n\r\nit  is coming up. I always say, \"Move in first.  Once\r\n\r\nthe estate is ready, the playground will be there for\r\n\r\nyou.\" One observant constituent said, \"Look, you just\r\n\r\ngo  and  take  a ride to Telok Blangah  Town  centre.\r\n\r\nThere  are three point-blocks there. Nobody has moved\r\n\r\nin  yet but there is a playground ready for use.  Why\r\n\r\nis  the playground provided in an estate where  there\r\n\r\nare  no residents? Yet in our estate where there  are\r\n\r\nresidents,  no  playground  is  given?\"  It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for me to explain when they point out  such\r\n\r\nmatters  to  me.  The Housing and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nshould  look  into such matters. They should  provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  existing  residents  and   not   for\r\n\r\nresidents who have not moved in yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from what I have said, I think the HDB is\r\n\r\ndoing a good job. I would say that if they could look\r\n\r\ninto these small minor matters, it will not spoil the\r\n\r\ngenerally good work that they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in order to\r\n\r\nenable  our citizens to own their houses, the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board has built flats and sold  them\r\n\r\nat  cheap prices to Singapore citizens. Moreover,  to\r\n\r\nencourage it, eligible citizens are allowed under the\r\n\r\nhome  ownership scheme of the Board to  make  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir CPF contributions to purchase them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nNational  Development in a reply to my  Question  for\r\n\r\nOral  Answer  in this House the other  day,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As at 31st December, 1976, a total of 110,591 units\r\n\r\nof flats have been sold under the \"Home Ownership\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme. Of this, 7,685 units were purchased outright,\r\n\r\nwhile 63,148 units [or 57%] were purchased through the\r\n\r\nowners'  CPF contribution either outright  or  on  an\r\n\r\ninstalment basis.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still about 60,000 applicants on the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list.  According to  the  situation  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  an  applicant will have to  wait  for  three\r\n\r\nyears or more before he can be allotted a flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the current policy of the Board an\r\n\r\napplicant who wishes to purchase a flat must pay  20%\r\n\r\nof  the  price as a down payment. To fulfill  such  a\r\n\r\ncondition  is a problem to people like taxi  drivers,\r\n\r\ncasual  workers,  lorry  drivers  and  most  hawkers,\r\n\r\nbecause they do not have enough savings and they also\r\n\r\ndo   not  pay  CPF  contributions.  So  it  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult  to make the 20% down payment. This  deters\r\n\r\nthem  from  applying for the purchase  of  flats.  In\r\n\r\norder   to   carry  out  the  home-ownership   scheme\r\n\r\nthoroughly.   I  suggest  the  HDB  should   consider\r\n\r\nreducing  the down payment from 20% to 10%  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  these  people who do not pay CPF  contributions\r\n\r\ncan  also  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the  scheme.  Or\r\n\r\nalternatively, the HDB could consider to  allow  them\r\n\r\nto  pay  10% first when they apply for flats  and  on\r\n\r\nallocation, they should pay up the remaining 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that civil servants who want to\r\n\r\nbuy HDB flats do not have to make a down payment, and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are affected by Government's  development\r\n\r\nplan  or renewal scheme are given the same treatment.\r\n\r\nEven  those who are renting the HDB flats  which  are\r\n\r\nlater  offered for sale do not have to  make  a  down\r\n\r\npayment  when they want to purchase the  flats  which\r\n\r\nthey are residing. Since the authority can afford  to\r\n\r\nlook  after the interests of these people  by  giving\r\n\r\nthem  such  consessionary treatment, why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nBoard  also make things easier for those who  do  not\r\n\r\npay CPF contributions to purchase flats?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to criticise the HDB for its\r\n\r\ntender  system  of  allocating  shop  premises.  This\r\n\r\nmatter  has  been raised in this House  a  number  of\r\n\r\ntimes,  and  every  time it  was  hushed  up  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  who  said  that there was  no  better  way.\r\n\r\nAccording to the present system, the shop premises to\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nrented out are put on tender and they are rented  out\r\n\r\nto  those who make the highest bid, without regard to\r\n\r\nwhether  the rentals tendered are so exorbitant  that\r\n\r\nthe  tenderers  may  not be able  to  maintain  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses  thus  incurring arrears or  even  closing\r\n\r\ndown their businesses eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency, there has been such a case\r\n\r\nas  stated.  My  constitutency is a  housing  estate.\r\n\r\nThere  are  no  factories,  big  offices  or  tourist\r\n\r\nresorts. A coffeeshop was leased out by tender  at  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  rental  of  $5,300  to  a  woman.  So   this\r\n\r\nshopkeeper  had to sublet as many parts of  the  shop\r\n\r\npremises  as possible in order to relieve  her  heavy\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden. The result is that there  were  so\r\n\r\nmany  hawker stalls in the shop premises  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  not enough space for tables and chairs. So these\r\n\r\nwere  placed along the corridors, both the front  and\r\n\r\nrear. The shop was opened from early morning right up\r\n\r\nto   2.00   or   3.00  a.m.  The  residents   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood were disturbed by noise from the  shop.\r\n\r\nSo  they lodged complaints to the authorities and the\r\n\r\nHDB had to forbid the shopkeeper to use the corridors\r\n\r\nand to limit the hours of business to 12.00 midnight,\r\n\r\nthus  severely affecting the business of  this  shop.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  the  shopkeeper  has  owed  more  than\r\n\r\n$30,000 in rental to the HDB. I learn that the HDB is\r\n\r\nnow taking legal action to repossess the shop, as she\r\n\r\nis  not  able to pay arrears amounting to  more  than\r\n\r\n$30,000.  The HDB had accepted the highest  bid  from\r\n\r\nher,  and  so allotted the shop to her. As a  result,\r\n\r\nshe now owes the HDB more than $30,000 in rentals.  I\r\n\r\nam not speaking in defence of this shopkeeper because\r\n\r\nshe had not estimated properly before she made such a\r\n\r\ntender.  As  a  result, she now  has  incurred  great\r\n\r\nlosses in the business. I say she has nobody else  to\r\n\r\nblame but herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this matter here because I want to\r\n\r\nmake  this  as an illustration to show my  contention\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  shortcomings in  the  HDB's  tender\r\n\r\nsystem  for  shop  premises. I hope  the  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  will  take  steps to  review  this  tender\r\n\r\nsystem as early as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee:</b> Sir, every year the Government is\r\n\r\nspending large sums of money on national development.\r\n\r\nThe Housing and Development Board is undertaking most\r\n\r\nof  the housing development. Today, when one takes  a\r\n\r\nride   around  Singapore,  one  can  see  HDB   flats\r\n\r\nmushrooming  all  over Singapore. The  HDB  not  only\r\n\r\nbuilds  low-cost flats for the people but also hawker\r\n\r\ncentres,   markets   and  shops   for   hawkers   and\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.  Most  of the development  projects  are\r\n\r\nwell-planned and this has brought satisfaction to the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this cannot be said for the project at\r\n\r\nChangi  Village  which falls within my  constituency.\r\n\r\nMore  than  a year ago the RDB completed  the  Changi\r\n\r\nVillage  Market and Food Centre which has a total  of\r\n\r\n166 stalls, some of which are still vacant today. The\r\n\r\nHDB  also built 92 units of three-room flats  and  46\r\n\r\nshops  besides  the Changi Village  Market  and  Food\r\n\r\nCentre.   I   understand  that  further   development\r\n\r\nprojects by the HDB in this area were shelved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till today, the market is poorly patronised as\r\n\r\nthe  expected growth in population in Changi  Village\r\n\r\ndoes  not  come  about as a consequence.  Demand  for\r\n\r\ntheir  goods  is very lacking. Business at  the  food\r\n\r\ncentre is only slightly better than the market, as it\r\n\r\nis  usually  frequented  by picnickers  and  the  SBS\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the rent for the hawker stalls is low when\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the rent for stalls in other  markets\r\n\r\nand  food  centres,  these  hawkers  still  find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to keep their heads above the  water.  The\r\n\r\nshopkeepers are also in a dilemma. Although they  are\r\n\r\ngranted  concessional rental rising from  $277,  they\r\n\r\nare  also  finding  it, difficult to  meet  as  their\r\n\r\npresent business is solely dependent on the residents\r\n\r\nwho occupy only a handful of the three-room flats  in\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity. In fact, the demand for their services\r\n\r\nfrom these residents is very poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, Sir, all these are the results of\r\n\r\npoor  planning and bad foresight for my  constituency\r\n\r\nby  the  Housing  and  Development  Board.  This  has\r\n\r\nbrought about unnecessary losses not only to most  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhawkers in the Changi Village Market and Food  Centre\r\n\r\nbut  also  to  the  shopkeepers as well  since  their\r\n\r\nbusiness started sometime in early 1976. Undoubtedly,\r\n\r\nthis  has caused discontent among these people  whose\r\n\r\nbusiness has been adversely affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shopkeepers have jointly appealed to me to\r\n\r\npersuade  the  HDB  to  allow them  to  maintain  the\r\n\r\npresent  monthly  rental and defer  the  annual  rent\r\n\r\nincrease  of  10%  until such time  when  either  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourist Promotion Board decides to organise\r\n\r\ntours for tourists through the travel agents to visit\r\n\r\nChangi  Village  or  when  the  Changi  International\r\n\r\nAirport  becomes  operational in mid-1980,  whichever\r\n\r\ncomes  about first. By which time, it is  hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe  demand for their services will greatly  improve.\r\n\r\nAs for the hawkers who have requested for a change of\r\n\r\nstalls to other markets and food centres, I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  HDB's  Area  Office will kindly  consider  their\r\n\r\nrequest  in  view  of  poor business  in  the  Changi\r\n\r\nVillage Market and Food Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  what  immediate  steps  will  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  situation that I have just highlighted,\r\n\r\nshould  the  appeal  and requests by  these  affected\r\n\r\npeople be unacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nraise a point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Thank you, Sir, for your\r\n\r\npermission.

I remember last year at this time\r\n\r\nI also raised this matter here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, the HDB estate is very small and\r\n\r\nthere  are  only about 200 units of flats. Yet  there\r\n\r\nare  about  a few scores of shophouses. The  tendered\r\n\r\nrentals  paid  by coffeeshops ranged from  $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$3,000 p.m. not $5,000, but after two to three months\r\n\r\nthey  closed shop. Many of the other shops also  have\r\n\r\nto  close down one after the other because they could\r\n\r\nnot pay the high rentals. Ta'boleh tahan - they could\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbear  it  any more. I would like to know  whether  in\r\n\r\ndeciding to build any shop premises the HDB has  made\r\n\r\na detailed survey of the surrounding areas to see how\r\n\r\nbig  the population is and how many shop premises are\r\n\r\nalready there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, Jalan Kayu. On both sides of the\r\n\r\nstreet  there  are about at least 200 shophouses.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past, these 200 shops catered for the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  British  forces in the Seletar base.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  place developed into a township. But during 1968\r\n\r\nand  1969, with the withdrawal of the British forces,\r\n\r\ntheir business was badly affected. Some of them moved\r\n\r\nto  other places and some others changed their lines.\r\n\r\nAfter  two or three years, they have adapted  to  the\r\n\r\nnew  situation and their business is picking up.  But\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board started to build  a\r\n\r\nshopping  centre with more shop premises  at  Seletar\r\n\r\nHills  around Jalan Kayu. As a result, the businesses\r\n\r\nof  the  shops both at the shopping centre and  along\r\n\r\nthe two sides of Jalan Kayu are again badly affected.\r\n\r\nThis  is  most incomprehensible! I believe  you  will\r\n\r\nagree  with me when I say that the Housing  Board  is\r\n\r\nmotivated  by the urge to make money when they  carry\r\n\r\nout its projects of building shop premises. There  is\r\n\r\nno   consideration   for  the   livelihood   of   the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers and others. Where there are so many  shop\r\n\r\npremises, yet the HDB would build more shop premises,\r\n\r\n\"It  is  up to you whether you want to bid for $5,000\r\n\r\nor  $6,000 a month for rental. Whether or not you  go\r\n\r\nbankrupt that is your business.\" This is not right. I\r\n\r\nunderstand that in Ang Mo Kio the tendered rental has\r\n\r\ngone  up  to as high as $6,000 a month for one  shop\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this question merits consideration\r\n\r\nbecause  this  will  eventually  affect  the   living\r\n\r\nstandard  of  all of us, the people. The  businessmen\r\n\r\nare  not  fools  and they will pass on the  increased\r\n\r\nburden  to  the consumers. The price for a  plate  of\r\n\r\nkway  teow will be increased from $1 to $2, and  when\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  good it can be sold  at  $4.  You  see?\r\n\r\nConsequently, all these extra costs will be passed on\r\n\r\nto the consumers.

Sir,I fail to see why the onus of  repairs\r\n\r\nshould  be  on the owner-occupier if the defects  are\r\n\r\ndue  to poor construction or arise from poor building\r\n\r\nmaterials used. This policy has to be changed and the\r\n\r\nHDB  owner-occupiers should not be made  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  poor  workmanship or substandard  building\r\n\r\nmaterials.

In the first  place,\r\n\r\nChangi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVillage  was  never  intended to be  developed  as  a\r\n\r\npublic  housing project. What the HDB  has  done  was\r\n\r\nmerely to resettle the temporary shophouses at Changi\r\n\r\nVillage  when business was good during the boom  when\r\n\r\nthe British military forces were around. What the HDB\r\n\r\ndid  was  merely to provide them with better housing,\r\n\r\nhoping that business would be still better. I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  HDB itself did not know that the British  forces\r\n\r\nwere  pulling out so soon. In fact, during the period\r\n\r\nof  resettlement  some of the shopkeepers  which  the\r\n\r\nMember   referred   to   were   offered   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation at Chai Chee New Town but  they  turned\r\n\r\nit  down. They had made a wrong choice. So I think it\r\n\r\nis  unfair to complain. To put the blame on  the  HDB\r\n\r\nfor  bad planning because their business today is bad\r\n\r\nis  unreasonable.  I  can only  sympathise  with  the\r\n\r\nMember  and  hope  that the Tourist  Promotion  Board\r\n\r\nwould  encourage tour groups to go to Changi  Village\r\n\r\nso  that  the  businessmen there will  have  less  to\r\n\r\ncomplain  about. To be fair to the HDB, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  monitoring  the situation, and  I  have  given  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  reply  to the hon.  Member  during  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Presidential Address when he brought up\r\n\r\nthe  question  of the Changi Village shophouses,  the\r\n\r\nvacancies, rentals and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My good friend, the Member for Jalan Kayu, supports\r\n\r\nstrongly  the Member for Tiong Bahru, as far  as  the\r\n\r\ntender system is concerned. First of all, let me  say\r\n\r\nthat when the HDB plans a housing estate it does know\r\n\r\napproximately the number of shophouses in relation to\r\n\r\nthe  number  of residential units that  it  wants  to\r\n\r\nbuild.   Of   course,  consideration  is   given   to\r\n\r\nresettlement  cases. In other words, if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nheavy resettlement programme in the vicinity of Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu or perhaps in Yio Chu Kang, the HDB will try its\r\n\r\nbest to provide a reasonable amount of facilities for\r\n\r\nresettlement cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, there were only two\r\n\r\nresettlement cases. Only two shops were resettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me explain. During the\r\n\r\nplanning stage when the HDB is considering facilities\r\n\r\nfor resettlement cases,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nthe  HDB  is  in  no position to know  whether  those\r\n\r\nfacilities  will  be  taken up  by  the  resettlement\r\n\r\ncases.  In  fact,  this is one  of  the  problems  of\r\n\r\nresettlement. That is why resettlement cannot proceed\r\n\r\nas  fast as it should. Once the shophouses are ready,\r\n\r\nthe  HDB offers them to the resettlement cases  as  a\r\n\r\nfirst  priority.  It is only after  the  resettlement\r\n\r\ncases  have turned down the offer, as in the case  of\r\n\r\nChangi  Village,  that the HDB  offers  them  to  the\r\n\r\npublic. Once it is open to the public, it is  on  the\r\n\r\nopen tender system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the HDB does give some thought to\r\n\r\nthe proportion between shophouse requirements and the\r\n\r\nnumber of housing units built. Here again, it is just\r\n\r\naccidental  that the Jalan Kayu shops at Seletar  Air\r\n\r\nBase or in the Housing Board estates do not have  too\r\n\r\ngood  a  business. This is unfortunate. I think  that\r\n\r\nduring the planning stage the HDB did not foresee the\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal. It is also a fact that it  could\r\n\r\nnot  foresee what a particular shopping complex  will\r\n\r\nturn out to be in, say, two, three or five years from\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the tender system. The HDB is undertaking\r\n\r\npublic  housing  which is highly  subsidised  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It is true that the HDB derives  certain\r\n\r\nrevenue  from the tender system, which  is  used,  in\r\n\r\nturn,  to  help reduce the subsidy that the HDB  gets\r\n\r\nfrom the Government. Whilst I am sympathetic with the\r\n\r\nMember  that  this  tender system is  not  ideal  and\r\n\r\nperhaps even incomplete, from the record of the HDB's\r\n\r\nrental of shops, the majority of the shops are  doing\r\n\r\nreasonably well. I cannot give the exact figure,  but\r\n\r\nI know it because I also happen to be the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe Shop Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To counter the complaint that the rental is as high\r\n\r\nas  $4,000 and $5,000 or even $5,300 p.m., we have an\r\n\r\nactual  case of $7,300 rental in an estate  which  is\r\n\r\nnot  a tourist attraction. But somehow because of its\r\n\r\nlocality  it  is  doing reasonably well  and  it  has\r\n\r\nsurvived  the last two years or so. But  it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat in certain areas the rental tendered could be on\r\n\r\nthe  high side. I think the rental should be left  to\r\n\r\nmarket forces. In other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords,  if  a particular businessman or a  particular\r\n\r\nshopowner chooses to tender at a certain price,  then\r\n\r\nit  is difficult for the HDB to say, \"Well, you  have\r\n\r\ntendered  it too high.\" Each businessman must  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  he  thinks is a reasonable rental and  he  must\r\n\r\nalso  know what are the chances of his survival. From\r\n\r\nmy  experience, I would say that whenever we received\r\n\r\ntenders  for  coffee  shops,  for  example, what  is\r\n\r\nsurprising about a tender of $5,500 is that there are\r\n\r\na  number  of other tenders at around $5,000.  So  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  only  one tender of $5,500  against  other\r\n\r\ntenders  at about $3,000, then I do concede there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  wrong  with that tender  as  far  as  that\r\n\r\nparticular  locality is concerned. But  if  all  five\r\n\r\ntenders  for  a particular shop are at  the  rate  of\r\n\r\napproximately between $5,000 and $5,500, then as  far\r\n\r\nas  the Shop Committee of the HDB is concerned, it is\r\n\r\na  reasonable tender. It reflects the rental rate for\r\n\r\nthat particular area. But to satisfy Members here, if\r\n\r\nthis  tender  system  can be improved,  as  has  been\r\n\r\nsuggested  by other MPs, the HDB will look  into  it.\r\n\r\nBut  in the meantime I think we should carry on  with\r\n\r\nthis system. To be fair to the HDB, there are cases - I do not know whether or not it is in Jalan Kayu, but\r\n\r\ndefinitely in other areas - where payment of  50%  of\r\n\r\nthe  rental  makes  life extremely  difficult  for  a\r\n\r\nparticular resettlement case, a concession which  the\r\n\r\nHDB  or the Shop Committee has allowed, instead of  a\r\n\r\n10% increment every year over the next five years. So\r\n\r\nthe  Shop  Committee has allowed the rental  in  that\r\n\r\nparticular  resettlement case to  remain  at  50%.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that if there is any particular case which\r\n\r\nrequires  urgent attention and the tenant  is  really\r\n\r\nfinding it difficult to maintain his livelihood,  the\r\n\r\nShop  Committee has the discretion to recommend,  for\r\n\r\nresettled  cases a stagnating rent, at  a  particular\r\n\r\nrate for a particular period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with the request of the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru, he  has suggested that the 20%  down  payment\r\n\r\nshould  be  reduced  to 10% or  adjusted  to  10%  on\r\n\r\napplication  and 10% on allocation. I regret  to  say\r\n\r\nthat, as in the purchase of houses in both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  public and private sectors, one has to make  the\r\n\r\ndown payment on application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am sympathetic with the cases of those who\r\n\r\nare  not contributors to the CPF such as taxi drivers\r\n\r\nand  hawkers  who may not be able to  make  the  down\r\n\r\npayment.  I regret to say that in the case of  public\r\n\r\nhousing  where  Government subsidy is  already  high,\r\n\r\nsometimes  the  20% down payment does  not  even  pay\r\n\r\ntowards  the  land cost which is apportioned  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also true that the HDB derives a certain\r\n\r\namount  of  interest  because,  as  the  Member   has\r\n\r\ncorrectly  pointed out, it takes maybe two  or  three\r\n\r\nyears  before an applicant gets a balloted  flat.  So\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  does  derive  interest  from  the  time  of\r\n\r\napplication  up to the balloting date. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ninterest  derived merely helps to reduce the  subsidy\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  gets from Government. I regret to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  or  the  Ministry is  not  agreeable  to  a\r\n\r\nreduction of the 20% down payment nor would it  agree\r\n\r\nto  payment at the balloting date instead of  at  the\r\n\r\ntime of application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah, as he himself has\r\n\r\npointed  out, has brought up very  minor  points.  I\r\n\r\nthink  those minor points could be easily settled  by\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  Area Office. I would like to thank him  for\r\n\r\nhis comment that the HDB is doing a good job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the Member for Katong. As usual, he has\r\n\r\nput very difficult questions for the HDB to reply. He\r\n\r\nwants to know the criteria used for the selection  of\r\n\r\na  programme to improve the one-room emergency flats.\r\n\r\nI  regret to tell him that honestly the priority  is,\r\n\r\nfirst stage is merely to improve the lighting in  the\r\n\r\nemergency  flats. I have indicated to the Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru during Question time last week that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  stage is to provide better lighting along  the\r\n\r\ncorridors  and  then to improve on other  facilities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  staircases, or simply turn on,  the  lights\r\n\r\nduring  the day. The next stage would, therefore,  be\r\n\r\nthe conversion of these units into larger units. But,\r\n\r\nhere  again,  it  depends on  whether  the  residents\r\n\r\nliving in a particular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblock  of  one-room emergency flats  can  afford  the\r\n\r\nbetter  one-room improved flats, which means a higher\r\n\r\nrental. Can they afford to move to a larger flat?  If\r\n\r\nthey cannot, then it would take some time before  any\r\n\r\nrenovation can be carried out on any particular block\r\n\r\nof flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No programme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> My answer to the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nis  that  there is a general programme  depending  on\r\n\r\nsituation and circumstances. In fact, the Member  may\r\n\r\nhave  noted  that during Question time last  week,  I\r\n\r\nsaid that it would take a number of years before  all\r\n\r\nthe emergency flats could be renovated and converted.\r\n\r\nFor  the Member for Katong's constituency, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  high or how low the priority  is.  But  it\r\n\r\nwould take a number of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> That is just what I wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me next answer the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Henderson who has suggested that there  is\r\n\r\na  need  for a special unit in the HDB. If I remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly, last year when I answered this question, I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there was no necessity to have a  special\r\n\r\nunit  because  the Ministry of Home Affairs  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  was  looking  into  the  setting  up  of  Block\r\n\r\ncommittees.  I  was told that the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  has  proceeded with the formation  of  Block\r\n\r\ncommittees consisting of uniformed groups such as the\r\n\r\nVCs  and the police who have been given priority  for\r\n\r\nHDB  flats. So actually there is no need for the  HDB\r\n\r\nto look into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained about the inefficiency of\r\n\r\nthe  administration, and quoted the example  of  both\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  headquarters and the  Area  Office  issuing\r\n\r\nsummonses on hawkers. Well, I do concede here that if\r\n\r\nthis  is so, then it shows a lack of co-operation  on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the Area Office and HQ. In fact,  if  he\r\n\r\ncan  give  me  particulars  of  the  incident,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to investigate. Arising from this,  I  could\r\n\r\ninform the Area Offices and the Estates Management in\r\n\r\nHQ to ensure that such things are not repeated again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Aljunied has brought up a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  points. He complained about  the  regular\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  lifts.  He also said  that  inadequate\r\n\r\nattention   was   given   to  the   maintenance   and\r\n\r\ncleanliness of the old housing estates. He complained\r\n\r\nthat  there is a lack of adequate facilities for  old\r\n\r\npeople  and  children  in the  old  estates.  And  he\r\n\r\ncompared the old estates with the new housing estates\r\n\r\nand  said that there are better facilities in the new\r\n\r\nhousing estates and are better maintained. Let me say\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no distinction in  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  between the old and new estates  because\r\n\r\nthe  residents  are  paying more  or  less  the  same\r\n\r\nconservancy fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I tried to argue out with statistics to\r\n\r\nshow  that there was no let-up in the cleanliness  of\r\n\r\nthe  old  estates  and, in fact, gave  results  of  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  which showed that the cleanliness of the  old\r\n\r\nestates  had improved. This is borne out by a  survey\r\n\r\nconducted  and  reported  by  the  Straits  Times  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1977.  I  think  the  improvement   of   the\r\n\r\ncleanliness  of the old estates must be  due  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  civic awareness of the residents `themselves\r\n\r\nand, I think to claim credit, to the better awareness\r\n\r\nof maintenance by the HDB authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also aware that there is a 24-hour\r\n\r\nessential maintenance unit which has been set  up  to\r\n\r\nattend  to urgent matters. The same is true  for  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of lifts. I am in sympathy with  him  over\r\n\r\nthe  incident when he was caught in a lift  breakdown\r\n\r\nduring  one  of his tours. But I think  that  is  not\r\n\r\npeculiar to his estate. I myself was caught in a lift\r\n\r\nbreakdown when I was touring the new HDB area  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  This is not to give  any  excuse  but,\r\n\r\nbeing an old estate, there must be lifts in the  many\r\n\r\nblocks that the Member has in his constituency  which\r\n\r\nneed  to  be repaired or even replaced by new  lifts.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  could  be just a coincidence that  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  got  into  one of these old lifts,  it  broke\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Not deliberate!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I am implying that it was not\r\n\r\ndeliberately  done. Here again, the lift  maintenance\r\n\r\nunit is supposed to do regular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservicing  and  I  would say that  if  there  is  any\r\n\r\nserious,  abnormal  and frequent breakdowns,  then  I\r\n\r\nwould be happy to look into it myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards facilities, it is true that the older\r\n\r\nestates  are  not provided with the same  facilities,\r\n\r\nsuch as children's playgrounds, when compared to  the\r\n\r\nnew  estates.  I  think the Member is agreeable  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a limitation in what the HDB can do because\r\n\r\nthe  old estates have already been built and it would\r\n\r\nbe  difficult to introduce certain facilities even if\r\n\r\nthe  HDB wants to. For example, if there is no  space\r\n\r\nfor a children's playground, it is just impossible to\r\n\r\nbuild.  What  the HDB can do is to try and  keep  the\r\n\r\nappearance  of the old estate as best as  it  can  by\r\n\r\ngiving  it  a  whitewash  every  now  and  then   and\r\n\r\nmaintaining   its  cleanliness  by   more   efficient\r\n\r\nsupervision over the contractors doing the servicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, a plan. These old estates have\r\n\r\nbeen  built  since the 1960s and I  think  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of time - I do not know when, five years  from\r\n\r\nnow  maybe  -  when  there must be  some  fundamental\r\n\r\nchange.  The  old blocks may have to be knocked  down\r\n\r\nand  replaced with newer blocks or even knocked  down\r\n\r\nmerely  to provide certain facilities. That  I  think\r\n\r\nwill take time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Toa Payoh has brought up a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  points. First of all, let me  handle  the\r\n\r\nmost  difficult ones. He asked me whether I am  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB  is  looking into the  possibility  of\r\n\r\ngetting somebody to handle the sworn declarations.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know. But I think if the HDB has told him so,\r\n\r\nthen it must be so because they do not take the words\r\n\r\nof the MP in vain. Anyway, it is quite easy to make a\r\n\r\nsworn  declaration. It could be made in most  offices\r\n\r\nof Commissioner of Oaths, and I personally do not see\r\n\r\nthe  difficulty  in getting a sworn  statement  made.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I would convey his suggestion to the HDB  and\r\n\r\nif  the HDB has told him so, I tend to agree that  it\r\n\r\nwill be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has suggested a better system for the\r\n\r\nresale  of  flats, and has complained  that  in  some\r\n\r\ncases  the owner of a particular resale flat  has  to\r\n\r\nwait something\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike five or six months. I share his sentiments.  But\r\n\r\nthen  the difficulty that the HDB is facing is  this.\r\n\r\nThose who sell their flats within five years will get\r\n\r\nthe  same  price that they have purchased. But  those\r\n\r\nwho have owned the flats for more than five years can\r\n\r\nsell  at  whatever  price  they  can  fetch  provided\r\n\r\nsomebody is prepared to buy over. Here again, the HDB\r\n\r\nis  faced with the problem of first-come-first-served\r\n\r\nand  is  faced with the problem of fairness.  Let  me\r\n\r\ngive  an example. Let us say in Toa Payoh there is  a\r\n\r\nheavy  demand for flats and there is a long queue  of\r\n\r\npeople  wanting to purchase HDB flats. Mr X wants  to\r\n\r\nsell.  Let us say there are 1,000 people waiting  to\r\n\r\nbuy  a  three-room  flat or a five-room  flat  in  ba\r\n\r\nPayoh.  An  owner  of such a flat wants  to  sell  to\r\n\r\nApplicant No. 1,000 on the queue because that  person\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be  his friend or his relative  or  just\r\n\r\nhappens  to be someone interested to purchase because\r\n\r\nhe has the money and can pay a lump sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I clarify? I am not\r\n\r\nreferring to those owners who have completed the five-year  qualification and can sell their flats  to  any\r\n\r\nbuyer  of  their choice.

I personally feel that  if  the\r\n\r\nMember is referring strictly to those cases with  the\r\n\r\nfive-year qualification, I personally feel  that  the\r\n\r\ncase should be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Good show!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> The Member also suggested that the\r\n\r\nHDB  should be more sympathetic towards those  living\r\n\r\nin one-room flats by giving them stalls in HDB hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.  I  think the question of hawker stalls  has\r\n\r\nbeen  debated quite heatedly during the Head  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment. Members are aware  that\r\n\r\nthe issuing of hawker licences is under the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing  and  Coordinating  Committee,  under   the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nthe  Environment,  and  that  the  HDB  provides  the\r\n\r\nstalls.  I suppose if the Member feels strongly,  the\r\n\r\nHDB  can  make  recommendations to  the  Coordinating\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last week, I have already answered the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  on this point. There are  a  number  of\r\n\r\nstalls  available in his constituency, but  then  the\r\n\r\nCoordinating Committee has over 11,000 street hawkers\r\n\r\nto resettle. Therefore, I regret to say that this has\r\n\r\nto  go through the Coordinating Committee, but if the\r\n\r\nMember feels strongly about these hardship cases this\r\n\r\ncould  be  referred to me for attention. I have  here\r\n\r\nfigures to show that in financial hardship cases  the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Committee has allocated through the  Board\r\n\r\nsomething  like 100 families, and more than  half  of\r\n\r\nthese 100 cases are from one-room flat tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the request for transfer of hawker stalls from\r\n\r\none  particular place to another, the same answer  is\r\n\r\napplicable to the Member for Changi. When business is\r\n\r\nnot  too  well, they blame the HDB, but  when  it  is\r\n\r\ngood, they say \"Well. I did the right choice.\" But if\r\n\r\nthere  is really a strong case such as the family  is\r\n\r\nnow living in Thomson but because he had been given a\r\n\r\nstall  in  Toa  Payoh in the past  and  now  wants  a\r\n\r\ntransfer  back  to  Thomson,  I  think  that   is   a\r\n\r\nreasonable  case for consideration. I see  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the Licensing Coordinating Committee should  not\r\n\r\ngive sympathetic consideration. I would say that each\r\n\r\ncase  should  be  treated on its own merit.  In  this\r\n\r\nparticular  case  which the Member has  mentioned  (I\r\n\r\nhappen   to   be  the  Chairman  of  the   Allocation\r\n\r\nCommittee), I would be prepared to look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more important question brought forward by the\r\n\r\nMember for ba Payoh is his illustration of two  cases\r\n\r\nof  unreasonableness and unsympathetic  consideration\r\n\r\nby the HDB -   throwing out deserved cases of ownership. I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that the HDB operates on the line of policy. Not\r\n\r\nonly has the Member for Toa Payoh, but at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresidential  debates the Member for  Kuo  Chuan  had\r\n\r\nalso  brought  up  four  cases.  In  fact, the  four\r\n\r\nexamples  he  gave look reasonable on paper.  I  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to get a satisfactory explanation  from  the\r\n\r\nHDB  as to why they could not concede. In one of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  cases, the one with permanent residence, appears\r\n\r\nreasonable to me, and I think that can be considered.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  second  case where  the  son  wants  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  the name to the father so that  he  himself\r\n\r\ncan  buy  another  HDB flat, I  would  say  that  his\r\n\r\napplication has been thoroughly thought  out  by  the\r\n\r\nHDB.  The reason given by the HDB is to prevent  this\r\n\r\nman  from taking advantage of having another HDB unit\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is on the list of original householders.\r\n\r\nSo  if  he  wants to buy another HDB  unit,  he  goes\r\n\r\nthrough  the normal routine of registration with  his\r\n\r\nspouse  or whoever he wants, and he goes through  the\r\n\r\npace.  He  should  not  be given  priority.  HDB  has\r\n\r\nthought  of all these possibilities. Where discretion\r\n\r\nand sympathy could be exercised, it has been done.  I\r\n\r\ncan  tell  the  Member that there are many  instances\r\n\r\nwhere the Housing and Development Board has ruled  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  cases that are not strictly according  to\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his statement that the HDB is unreasonable in\r\n\r\nthe purchase of a shophouse by placing a limit on the\r\n\r\nownership  of commercial property and that the  limit\r\n\r\nset is arbitrary as no thought has been given, let me\r\n\r\nassure him that the Allocation Committee, in which  I\r\n\r\nam  also the Chairman, has gone through this question\r\n\r\nthoroughly.  The  limit  that  we  set  is  that   an\r\n\r\napplicant should not own a commercial property with a\r\n\r\nmarket  value of $250,000 or more. That means  if  he\r\n\r\ncan  afford to own property worth one-quarter million\r\n\r\ndollars, it is hard to convince us that he needs  to\r\n\r\nrent  subsidised housing or that he needs to purchase\r\n\r\nsubsidised  housing of, say, $15,000 or $20,000.  If\r\n\r\nhe  can afford to buy a $250,000 commercial property,\r\n\r\nit  is  more  appropriate for him  to  purchase  HUDC\r\n\r\nhousing,  which  is about $60,000.  As  far  as  this\r\n\r\nparticular  ceiling is concerned, plenty  of  thought\r\n\r\nhas been put into it, and it is a reasonable ceiling.\r\n\r\nHow  can one borrow $250,000 if one has no collateral\r\n\r\nto support the loan? I can merely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay that HDB has put in plenty of thought into it and\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling of a quarter million dollars is  a  very\r\n\r\nreasonable limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, in regard to my contribution\r\n\r\nto  the debate on this subject, I would like to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Senior Minister of State would  consider\r\n\r\nlengthening the period of the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nHDB  in  regard to major defects arising  because  of\r\n\r\npoor workmanship or substandard materials?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, as I have indicated, there is\r\n\r\na  standard period.

It  is  agreed\r\n\r\nthat we need to have better and cleaner rooms, better\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and better hawker centres. It  is  true.\r\n\r\nThis  is  necessary. But at the same time it is  also\r\n\r\nimportant  for  HDB  to have a  conscious  policy  of\r\n\r\nfinding   out  whether  there  are  any  sociological\r\n\r\nprinciples  which  can be incorporated  as  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  the HDB administration. For example,  the\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade  community  hall  represents  a   very\r\n\r\nimportant facility which will allow for a dynamic and\r\n\r\nintegrated  community  life.

The  HDB  has  done  many\r\n\r\nsociological  surveys and, in fact, the  results  are\r\n\r\nbeing implemented on a day-to-day basis, and the very\r\n\r\nfact  that he sees the difference between old estates\r\n\r\nand  the new ones such as Marine Parade, and that  he\r\n\r\nhimself  has noticed the flexibility of  the  HDB  in\r\n\r\nimproving on the newer estates, must indicate to  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB  is  fully aware of  the  problem.

The Board has gazetted and placed under its\r\n\r\nprotection  more  than  a dozen  buildings  including\r\n\r\nplaces  of  worship, the Telok Ayer  Market  and  the\r\n\r\nThong  Chai Medical Institution building.  The  Board\r\n\r\nhas  viewed  the possibilities of placing  under  its\r\n\r\nprotection  other monuments including government  and\r\n\r\ncivic  buildings,  buildings  of  public  resort  and\r\n\r\nresidential buildings. All these will serve to remind\r\n\r\nus  of  our  cultural roots and of how our  forebears\r\n\r\nlived  and  worked  and  worshipped  and  contributed\r\n\r\ntowards what Singapore is today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a number of points that I would\r\n\r\nlike to raise about the work of the Board. First, the\r\n\r\nobjects  of  the  Board  as stated  in  the  relevant\r\n\r\nlegislation  seem  to focus the Board's  interest  on\r\n\r\nbuildings  and this has come to be reflected  by  the\r\n\r\nprominent position of architects on the Board. It  is\r\n\r\ngood  that  there should be architects  and  planners\r\n\r\nbecause  in the process of renewal of the  city  such\r\n\r\npeople  are important in helping the preservation  of\r\n\r\nthe  old  amidst the re-building of the  new.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink the Board needs at least one person with a very\r\n\r\nstrong  historical orientation: a historian,  because\r\n\r\nhow we have come together is history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, because of the orientation of the Board to\r\n\r\nmonuments, i.e, buildings, and perhaps because of the\r\n\r\nabsence  of a person on the Board strongly  committed\r\n\r\nto  history, the Board has yet to turn its  attention\r\n\r\nto   important  locations  and  events,  places   and\r\n\r\nhappenings  not  related  to  buildings,  places  and\r\n\r\nhappenings  that  should  be commemorated  for  their\r\n\r\nhistorical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One illustration that comes to mind is that this\r\n\r\nyear  is  the centenary of the planting of the  first\r\n\r\nrubber tree in Singapore. The site is known. I  think\r\n\r\nit is very close to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore. And I think it is worthwhile\r\n\r\nmemorialising the location as rubber has had so  much\r\n\r\nhistorical  and economic connotations for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nrecalling  to mind people who have been brought  from\r\n\r\nIndia  to  work in the plantations in the region  and\r\n\r\nthe   assiduous  industry  of  the  Chinese  workers,\r\n\r\nincluding  women workers and entrepreneurs  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed to the development of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that because of financial\r\n\r\nlimitations   the  Board  has  not   brought   itself\r\n\r\nadequately  to the general notice of the  people.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, it has not been able  to  give  enough\r\n\r\nattention to the third of the four objectives set out\r\n\r\nby  its  legislation, namely,  to  stimulate  public\r\n\r\ninterest  and support. Institutions like the  Science\r\n\r\nCentre, the National Library and the National  Museum\r\n\r\nhave  an adequate capacity for public relations  with\r\n\r\nschools  and  other institutions. It  is  not  enough\r\n\r\nmerely to have a list of buildings and monuments  and\r\n\r\nto  spend money to preserve these places. Thought has\r\n\r\nto be given to bringing such places constantly to the\r\n\r\nmind  of the people especially our young people in  a\r\n\r\nway  that can repeatedly suggest to them how they are\r\n\r\nidentified with one another and with Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the hon.

I am  glad  to\r\n\r\nreport  that  the  Ministry has  given  in  principle\r\n\r\napproval to the interested party and that a site will\r\n\r\nbe set aside to preserve its historical value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his observation that there is a need for a\r\n\r\nhistorian on the Preservation of Monuments  Board,  I\r\n\r\nthink  his  suggestion could be looked into.  At  the\r\n\r\nnext  round of appointments, this could be taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as to his observation that insufficient\r\n\r\nefforts  have  been made to publicise  and  stimulate\r\n\r\ninterest  on  the  need  to  preserve  buildings   or\r\n\r\nlocations of historical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest, I can merely say that the Board is aware of\r\n\r\nthis  need to stimulate public interest and, in fact,\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Board have given talks to the  public\r\n\r\nand  participated  in Radio and TV  programmes.  They\r\n\r\nhave also given talks to selected bodies, such as the\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion Board, the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  as  well as the Urban Redevelopment Authority.\r\n\r\nBut  if  this does not come up to the expectation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member,  would he please bear in mind  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard is an extremely small one and that it has  only\r\n\r\na  secretary and one or two clerical staff.

So  one\r\n\r\nshould not expect too much from members of the Board.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would convey his observation and comments  to\r\n\r\nthe Board accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very gratified that the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State will convey my sentiments to\r\n\r\nthe  Board.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong Leong Boon.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $68 million appropriated for the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and construction of more housing units as\r\n\r\nwell as to provide better and more adequate amenities\r\n\r\nfor  our  people  is a very large sum  of  money.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  the  HDB has attained many fine  achievements\r\n\r\nover the past ten-odd years. At present, over 50%  of\r\n\r\nour   population  are  living  in  HDB  flats.   Such\r\n\r\nachievements are indeed praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are still shortcomings in the\r\n\r\nadministration of the HDB. I would like to raise  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  points  and complaints with  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Firstly,  as regards  application  for  a\r\n\r\nchange of flats, the HDB officers are carrying out  a\r\n\r\ncontradictory  policy.  Take,  for  example,  in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  a  couple with two children,  who  are\r\n\r\nliving in a one-room unit. They now want to change to\r\n\r\na two-room unit because their children have grown up.\r\n\r\nBut their application has been rejected on the ground\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  too few members  in  their  family.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on  the  other  hand,  our  Government   is\r\n\r\nencouraging small families to apply for bigger  flats\r\n\r\nwith more rooms. Is this not a contradictory measure?\r\n\r\nI  think so, because a married couple is eligible  to\r\n\r\napply  for  a 5-room flat. Such instance  shows  that\r\n\r\nsome  of the civil servants do not have a clear  idea\r\n\r\nabout  Government  policy. Such an erroneous  way  of\r\n\r\ndoing things should be put right immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the increasingly higher bids for HDB shop\r\n\r\nunits have resulted in soaring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommodity prices. In some estates, for instance,  the\r\n\r\nbid  for  a  grocery  shop unit was  over  $2,000, a\r\n\r\ntextile  retail shop unit over $3,000, and  a  coffee\r\n\r\ncum eating house shop unit over $7,000. If things  go\r\n\r\non  like this, I am afraid that there will be another\r\n\r\nround  of  inflation. Be it grocery or coffee  eating\r\n\r\nhouse shop, higher bids mean increased cost for  them\r\n\r\nand they will certainly pass the Increased cost on to\r\n\r\nthe  consumers by raising the selling prices of their\r\n\r\ngoods.  The end result is an increased burden on  the\r\n\r\nconsumers. I would like, therefore, to suggest  again\r\n\r\nto  the Minister concerned that in the allocation  of\r\n\r\nshop  units, the HDB should fix the rentals for  them\r\n\r\nand  should there be more than one applicant for  the\r\n\r\nsame  unit, allocation should be decided by  ballot.\r\n\r\nThis  is not only a fair and sensible method but also\r\n\r\na  way to maintain rentals at reasonable levels. With\r\n\r\nreasonable rentals, the goods in these shops  can  be\r\n\r\nsold  at  lower  prices and the general  public  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  immensely;  so will the  livelihood  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  and the economic development of the  country.\r\n\r\nIn  this way, Singapore will be spared the anguish of\r\n\r\nanother  inflation. I think this  suggestion  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  new.  It  is  a  system  which  is   being\r\n\r\npractised in our country. The allocation of HDB flats\r\n\r\nand hawker stalls is all carried out by ballot to the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of  all. As far as I know, shops  with\r\n\r\nhigh  rentals cannot survive for long. Many  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  closed  down because they were operating  at  a\r\n\r\nloss,  Many of them are in arrears of large  sums  of\r\n\r\nrentals. As a result, the HDB has to resort to  legal\r\n\r\naction to recover the payments. This state of affairs\r\n\r\nshows  clearly  the undesirable consequences  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem of unrestricted bidding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem concerns the many HDB flats in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  which have not been  taken  up  after\r\n\r\nallotment and have been left vacant for a long  time.\r\n\r\nThere  are many such vacant flats in my constituency,\r\n\r\nfor  instance. Marsiling (a part of the Woodlands New\r\n\r\nTown), and  I  believe the same  is  true  of  other\r\n\r\nhousing   estates.  Why?  We  have   almost   100,000\r\n\r\napplicants on the waiting lists for HDB flats and, at\r\n\r\nthe same time, the HDB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  so  many  flats unoccupied.  Is  this  not  very\r\n\r\nstrange?  This also represents a loss of  revenue  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government. There is one more problem I wish  to\r\n\r\nbring up about my constituency, Marsiling. I wish  to\r\n\r\nknow how many units of flats and shop-houses will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  the  constituency under  the  HDB  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  this year, and whether any  provision\r\n\r\nhas   been   made  in  future  programmes   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of a library and community  centres  in\r\n\r\nthe  constituency, as these are two essential  social\r\n\r\namenities  in such a big New Town which,  when  fully\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  will be even bigger than the present  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh satellite town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Leong Boon is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has  always complained that the HDB  has  not\r\n\r\nhelped  to alleviate the plight of the large families\r\n\r\nliving  in  one- or two-room flats. However,  in  the\r\n\r\npast, overcrowding was accepted as one of the reasons\r\n\r\nfor  transfer  to a larger flat. But I  think  he  is\r\n\r\naware  of  the  new  policy where the  HDB  will  now\r\n\r\nregister  all applications for transfer provided  the\r\n\r\ntwo-year  period of qualification has  been  complied\r\n\r\nwith,  and  this is not restricted by the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons in the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second query is on the balloting of HDB shops. I\r\n\r\nhave  spent a lot of time just now explaining to hon.\r\n\r\nMembers the rationale behind the tendering system  of\r\n\r\nHDB  shops. It merely suffices me to mention  to  him\r\n\r\nnow   that  the  system  has  proved  to  be  working\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily and that there is no necessity at this\r\n\r\nstage  to change this system. But to satisfy  him  we\r\n\r\ncan  monitor  the situation and, if at a  much  later\r\n\r\nstage a better system is required, we will look  into\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regarding his question of how many dwelling\r\n\r\nunits  and  shop  houses will be constructed  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands New Town, the answer is that 5,231 dwelling\r\n\r\nunits  and  65  shops  will  be  constructed  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands New Town. Another 153 dwelling units and 59\r\n\r\nshops  are  under construction.

I\r\n\r\nwould like to know whether the Minister concerned  is\r\n\r\naware  that when a tender received is too low  for  a\r\n\r\nshophouse, the HDB authority has always reserved  its\r\n\r\nright  to call for a re-tender in order to get higher\r\n\r\nbids.  Is  this done intentionally to cater  for  the\r\n\r\nhigher bidders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have indicated just now\r\n\r\nthat  it  is based on the tender system.  But  as  he\r\n\r\nknows, one of the requirements is that for each  call\r\n\r\nof tenders there is a minimum rental. In other words,\r\n\r\nbefore  anyone can tender for a particular  shop  the\r\n\r\nHDB  tells him that there is a minimum rental of say.\r\n\r\n$500. He must be a bad businessman who expects to get\r\n\r\na  shop  by  tendering at $450, when  the  stipulated\r\n\r\nminimum  is $500 rental. So where there is no demand,\r\n\r\nor when there is only one tender below the stipulated\r\n\r\nminimum  of $500, then it is up to the Shop Committee\r\n\r\nto  decide whether to re-tender it or to let  it  go.\r\n\r\nBut chances are that there will be a second tender to\r\n\r\nsee whether we could attract a higher tender price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> So the intention is to get a\r\n\r\nhigher  bidder!

The  Scheme\r\n\r\nstarted in April 1 975 and is operated jointly by the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department and the Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nBoard. Under the Scheme school leavers are given  two\r\n\r\nyears'  training  in the various construction  trades\r\n\r\nand  are  taught  various skills. For  instance, bar\r\n\r\nbending, carpentry, masonry and painting, are some of\r\n\r\nthe construction trades which are being learnt by the\r\n\r\ntrainees.  Moreover,  trainees  are  also  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to learn different skills on  electrical\r\n\r\nworkshop   practice, mechanical  workshop  practice,\r\n\r\ntraffic   survey,   land   surveying,   road   works,\r\n\r\nhorticulture and landscaping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme is divided into two categories.

This\r\n\r\npractical  training is limited to four  days  a  week\r\n\r\nduring  the first year. The trainees spend the  other\r\n\r\none and a half days in the week at Punggol Vocational\r\n\r\nInstitute for theoretical training. During the second\r\n\r\nyear, the trainees spend five and a half days a  week\r\n\r\nwith the contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category allows the trainees to spend full-time learning various skills in PWD branches.\r\n\r\nTrainees  receive  an allowance  of  $100  per  month\r\n\r\nduring the first year and\r\n\r\n$130  per  month  during the second year.  Since  the\r\n\r\nScheme  started  in 1975, three batches  of  trainees\r\n\r\nhave  been recruited. The total intake for the  three\r\n\r\nbatches  is  207. So far, 25 of them have  terminated\r\n\r\ntheir  training. Another batch of about  90  trainees\r\n\r\nwill be selected for training in April 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, are the trainees bonded by\r\n\r\nthe Government after the period of training?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, they are not bonded by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

I would like the Minister to  tell\r\n\r\nus  since  the  Council  has held  so  many  meetings\r\n\r\nwhether any concrete results have been achieved?  Has\r\n\r\nour  Government concluded any fishing agreements with\r\n\r\nother  Southeast Asian countries? Although  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  an  island  State, our yield in  fishing  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  According  to  statistics,   our   yield\r\n\r\namounts  to  only  about  one-quarter  of  our  total\r\n\r\nconsumption.  In other words, 75% of our  consumption\r\n\r\nof  fish  have to be imported from abroad. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Primary  Production Department had indicated  at\r\n\r\none time that it would go all out to develop deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing so as to enable our fishermen or merchants to\r\n\r\ninvest or to participate in offshore fishing in order\r\n\r\nto  increase our yields in fishing. However. I regret\r\n\r\nto  say  that,  according to  the  Auditor-General's\r\n\r\nReport  for 1975-76, the Fishery Training  Centre  at\r\n\r\nChangi set up jointly by the Singapore Government and\r\n\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme in 1969, had\r\n\r\nclosed down on the 21st June, 1976, after a lapse of a\r\n\r\nfew  years.  Out  of  99 trainees,  only  eight  took\r\n\r\nemployment on board fishing vessels. The others  took\r\n\r\nup other jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether our\r\n\r\nGovernment's attitude towards deep-sea fishing is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to develop this industry or whether it  will\r\n\r\ndiscontinue its policy on deep-sea fishing.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister  to explain  to  this  House  the\r\n\r\nquestions that I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor  giving me the opportunity to say a few words  on\r\n\r\nthis   subject.   I  would  like  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for National Development to\r\n\r\nenlighten  this House as to the purpose of this  10th\r\n\r\nCouncil  Meeting  of  the Southeast  Asian  Fisheries\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Centre  and also  what  benefits  do  we\r\n\r\nderive  as  a  result of attending this 10th  Council\r\n\r\nMeeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I had in this House suggested that\r\n\r\nperhaps we can look towards the ASEAN region  with  a\r\n\r\nview   to  establishing  bilateral  or  multi-lateral\r\n\r\ncooperation with regard to fishing in ASEAN waters. I\r\n\r\nwould  be  grateful, Sir, if the Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  could  enlighten this House as to whether  any\r\n\r\napproach has been made in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, the Southeast Asian\r\n\r\nFisheries  Development Centre (SEAFDC) is a  regional\r\n\r\norganisation established in December 1967  under  the\r\n\r\nauspices  of the Ministerial Conference for  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   of   Southeast  Asia.   The   agreement\r\n\r\nestablishing the Centre was signed by the Governments\r\n\r\nof  Japan,  Malaysia, the Philippines,  Thailand  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  which are member countries of SEAFDC,  The\r\n\r\nCentre's    objective   is   to   promote   fisheries\r\n\r\ndevelopment   in   Southeast  Asia   through   mutual\r\n\r\ncooperation among the member governments and  through\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with international  organisations  and\r\n\r\nother governments. To meet this objective, the Centre\r\n\r\nhas   established  three  departments, namely,   the\r\n\r\nFisheries   Training  Department  in  Thailand,   the\r\n\r\nAquaculture  Department in the  Philippines  and  the\r\n\r\nMarine Fisheries Research Department which is located\r\n\r\nat   Changi  in  Singapore.  A  major  research   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme, improved harvest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnology   of   fish  and  fishery   products   was\r\n\r\nundertaken   by   the   Marine   Fisheries   Research\r\n\r\nDepartment  with  the  cooperation  of  the  Japanese\r\n\r\ngovernment. This programme is of immediate benefit to\r\n\r\nus  as we are largely dependent on imported fish  for\r\n\r\nconsumption.  Singapore  also  participates  in   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of the other two departments  located  in\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines  and  Thailand through  exchange  of\r\n\r\nresearch data and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wants to know why the Fishery\r\n\r\nTraining Centre at Changi was closed down. The answer\r\n\r\nis  quite simple. It is because in Singapore we still\r\n\r\ndo  not  have the deep-sea fishing industry.  So  the\r\n\r\ntrainees   after   graduation   could   hardly   find\r\n\r\nemployment  in  the fishing vessels.  Of  course, we\r\n\r\nencourage  deep-sea  fishing.  This  is  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy. But the initiative must come from the private\r\n\r\nsector.   We   will  give  every  encouragement   and\r\n\r\nassistance  if the private sector is prepared  to  go\r\n\r\ninto deep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Punggol asked whether it is\r\n\r\npossible to have a joint venture on deep-sea  fishing\r\n\r\nbetween the ASEAN countries. As Members are aware, we\r\n\r\nhave  several economic cooperation ventures with  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries underway and perhaps the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  explore  the  possibility of  having  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing  ventures with the other ASEAN  countries  in\r\n\r\nthe near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.\r\n\r\nJust  now  the  Parliamentary Secretary replied  that\r\n\r\nvery  few  of the graduands from the Fishery Training\r\n\r\nCentre  could find employment in the deep-sea fishing\r\n\r\nindustry.  For  the  information  of  the  House, at\r\n\r\nKangkar  in  my Constituency, there is  one  type  of\r\n\r\nfishing  industry  going  on  there.  That  is  otter\r\n\r\ntrawling which involves fishing activities around the\r\n\r\narea  of Horsburgh Lighthouse. We have got about  100\r\n\r\nsuch boats and I do not see that job opportunities in\r\n\r\nthis respect can be found wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, in an oral answer. I have\r\n\r\nalready  given  the reasons for the  closure  of  the\r\n\r\nFishery  Training Centre. In fact, there was  also  a\r\n\r\nquestion  on otter trawling submitted by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol.  The  answer  is  simple.  The  Fishery\r\n\r\nTraining Centre was closed down, as explained  by  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary,  because   there   was   no\r\n\r\nresponse  from people or from the younger  generation\r\n\r\nwho wish to take up fishing as a career, In fact,  if\r\n\r\nI  remember  correctly. I quoted statistics  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  out of so many graduates only four or seven  (I\r\n\r\ncannot  remember  the  exact number)  finally  got  a\r\n\r\nfishing  job. That is a very simple answer. Moreover.\r\n\r\nthe officers of the Primary Production Department are\r\n\r\nfinding  it difficult to interest people to  take  up\r\n\r\nthis  particular  course. I think it  is  because  of\r\n\r\neconomic factors that the Centre was closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
