All  unlicensed  hawkers  plying  in   the\r\n\r\nconcourse  in  the  vicinity  of  the  market  were\r\n\r\nresited and given a place within the market on 18th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1970. Subsequently, through lack of  firm\r\n\r\nenforcement, more unlicensed hawkers have  gathered\r\n\r\nthere.  There are 42 vacant stalls and  pitches  in\r\n\r\nthe  market.  It  is  not possible,  therefore,  to\r\n\r\nresite within the market all the unlicensed hawkers\r\n\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has, however,\r\n\r\nprepared  plans  for  the  construction  of  a  new\r\n\r\nhawkers'  centre at Jalan Tenteram.  Those  hawkers\r\n\r\nwho  cannot be resited in the existing market  will\r\n\r\nbe moved into this new market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two existing staircases within St.\r\n\r\nMichael's Market which already afford access to the\r\n\r\nupper  storey.

These fees are  at  the  moment\r\n\r\nbeing  paid  by the hawkers or stallholders  inside\r\n\r\nthe  market,  and therefore the present  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers,  when  licensed, will not have  an  unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage over those inside the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, in view of the numerous\r\n\r\ncomplaints that I have received regarding the  high\r\n\r\nrentals  of  the market stalls, will  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  lowering them not only  for  the  present\r\n\r\nstallholders  but  also for the unlicensed  hawkers\r\n\r\nwho will be given licences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, sir, as far as I\r\n\r\nam  concerned.  I have not heard of  complaints  of\r\n\r\nhigh  rentals in the market. But I am hearing  this\r\n\r\nfor  the first time in this Chamber from the Member\r\n\r\nfor Whampoa. May I say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the rentals in Government markets are  highly\r\n\r\nsubsidised. They are very reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as St. Michael's Market is concerned, I\r\n\r\nthink the major complaint is the unfair competition\r\n\r\nwhich  the  unlicensed hawkers are  giving  to  the\r\n\r\nstalls  inside the market. I remember my  visit  to\r\n\r\nthe  market  - you will be surprised, Sir,  that  I\r\n\r\nmyself  do  visit markets - during the  last  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean\"  campaign. The stallholders  came\r\n\r\nout  to  see me and their main complaint was,  \"We,\r\n\r\nthe  stallholders  inside the market,  pay  licence\r\n\r\nfees  and  it  is  unfair of  you  to  allow  these\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawkers  in the concourse  outside  the\r\n\r\nmarket to get away without paying any fees at  all.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there  is this unfair competition.\"  In\r\n\r\nfact, that was the major complaint they made to me,\r\n\r\nbut they made no complaint about high rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider allowing the market stallholders\r\n\r\nto  pay  their rentals on a monthly basis, as  they\r\n\r\ndid  some  time  ago? They have to  make  quarterly\r\n\r\npayments  right now, and this constitutes  quite  a\r\n\r\nburden on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, when we introduced these\r\n\r\nquarterly payments for market stallholders  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of last year, there were complaints  and\r\n\r\ngrumblings  about  it.  But these  complaints  have\r\n\r\nstopped  now.  It  is  quite human  for  people  to\r\n\r\ngrumble  when there is some change.

In fact, the market comes\r\n\r\nunder the control of my Ministry, but the concourse\r\n\r\noutside  is  under the control of the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. Anyway, since both of us are  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  side,  the Ministry of  Health  and  the\r\n\r\nMarkets  Department  of  the  Housing  Board   will\r\n\r\njointly decide on the policy. But if the Member has\r\n\r\nproblems, perhaps he can convey them either to  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department or the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard, as we do have liaison with them, and we will\r\n\r\ntake joint action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, when all\r\n\r\nthe  unauthorised hawkers in the concourse  outside\r\n\r\nSt. Michael's Market have been licensed and resited\r\n\r\nin  the  new  market  at Jalan Tenteram,  will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  allow  more unlicensed  hawkers  to  come\r\n\r\nalong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker.

At present  about  120,000\r\n\r\nout of 650,000 working persons are liable to income\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Income Tax Ordinance a taxpayer is\r\n\r\nallowed  personal relief of $2,000 plus  an  earned\r\n\r\nincome relief of 1/5th of his earned income up to a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of $1,000. A relief of $1,000 is given  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of his wife, $750 in respect of his  first\r\n\r\nchild,  $500  each for the second and third  child,\r\n\r\nand  $300  each for the fourth and fifth child.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the taxpayer is allowed deductions on his\r\n\r\nlife     insurance    premiums    and    compulsory\r\n\r\ncontributions   to  the  Central   Provident   Fund\r\n\r\nequivalent to that of the income up to a maximum of\r\n\r\n$4,000.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing reliefs and personal deductions\r\n\r\nconsiderably  reduce the burden of  income  tax.  A\r\n\r\nmarried  taxpayer,  earning $6,000  per  annum  for\r\n\r\nexample, with two children, will have to pay income\r\n\r\ntax  of only $9, and a single person earning $6,000\r\n\r\nper annum will be liable to pay income tax of $144.\r\n\r\nA  married  couple earning $6,000  per  annum,  but\r\n\r\nwithout  children, will have to pay income  tax  of\r\n\r\n$84.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, no reason why taxpayers in\r\n\r\nthis   income  group  should  not  make   a   small\r\n\r\ncontribution  towards  paying  for  the   security,\r\n\r\neducational,   social  and  medical   services   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which are enjoyed by their families  and\r\n\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Monetary Fund Mission, which\r\n\r\nstudied  our tax structure during 1969, has  stated\r\n\r\nthat  our  personal  reliefs  and  deductions   are\r\n\r\ngenerous and could well be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REVISION OF INDUSTRIAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Withdrawal of incentives to foreign investors)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance if it is feasible now for the Government to\r\n\r\nrevise  the  industrial policy by  withdrawing  the\r\n\r\ninvestment incentives to future foreign investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no. Members may be\r\n\r\naware that only last year the Government introduced\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Economic Expansion  Incentives\r\n\r\n(Relief from Income Tax) Act, 1967, which curtailed\r\n\r\nconsiderably  the incentives offered to  industrial\r\n\r\ninvestors.  The  major  changes  provided  in   the\r\n\r\namendment Bill were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A reduction in the period of tax relief for\r\n\r\nexport  enterprises from  15  years  to  eight\r\n\r\nyears  in  the  case  of exports  as  well  as\r\n\r\npioneer  enterprises, and  from  15  years  to\r\n\r\nfive   years   in  the  case  of   non-pioneer\r\n\r\nenterprises.    However,    in     exceptional\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the 15-year  period  is  still\r\n\r\navailable  for very large enterprises  with  a\r\n\r\ncapital  investment of (Singapore) $1  billion\r\n\r\nor  more,  or those with a capital  investment\r\n\r\nof  $150  million of which more than  half  is\r\n\r\nowned by permanent residents of the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The five-year tax relief provided for pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries  is  now confined  only  to  large\r\n\r\nenterprises with fixed capital investments of not\r\n\r\nless than $1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expansion incentives are restricted only to\r\n\r\nthose enterprises which incur additional capital\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  fixed assets of more  than  $10\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Depreciation allowances which were allowed to\r\n\r\nbe  carried forward to the post-pioneer period\r\n\r\nat   accelerated  rates  which,   in   effect,\r\n\r\nextended the pioneer period beyond five  years\r\n\r\nto  six years or seven years are now no longer\r\n\r\nallowed  to  be  carried  forward.

The Government has been very selective in approving incentives.

The  reclamation,\r\n\r\nas   the   Member  for  Punggol  knows,  is   being\r\n\r\nundertaken  in four phases, and the reclaimed  land\r\n\r\nwill be utilised for the development, firstly, of a\r\n\r\nmajor highway to link the heavily congested eastern\r\n\r\npart  of  the republic with the city centre.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom this, the reclaimed land will also be utilised\r\n\r\nfor development of open spaces and parks to provide\r\n\r\nthe   much-needed  recreational  amenities  in  our\r\n\r\nrepublic,  tourist projects such as  the  Aquarama,\r\n\r\nbathing  beaches, hotels, institutional  buildings,\r\n\r\nincluding  schools,  junior colleges,  recuperation\r\n\r\ncentres  and  even  homes for the aged,  commercial\r\n\r\ncentres and residential homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two phases of the scheme which have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed have yielded about 1,135  acres  of\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land.

In the urban renewal programme,  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  a lot. The Government has attracted  many\r\n\r\nlocal  as  well as foreign investors to participate\r\n\r\nin  our  urban  renewal  projects  because  it  has\r\n\r\noffered incentives to the developers. However,  the\r\n\r\nrapid  development  of urban renewal  has  affected\r\n\r\nmany people. Those who have been badly affected are\r\n\r\nsmall  businessmen and they do not have the capital\r\n\r\nto   participate  in  this  big-scale   development. \r\n\r\nTherefore,   I   wish  to  ask  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  whether  the  Government   will   take\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help those who are  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nurban renewal projects. For example, can he tell us\r\n\r\nwhether  he  will allot a piece of  land  to  these\r\n\r\nsmall merchants to do their business, and let  them\r\n\r\nparticipate in these development projects  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  given the opportunity  to  continue\r\n\r\ntheir  business  as  usual? In this  way,  our  own\r\n\r\ncitizens    can   participate   in   our   national\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also because of the rapid development of our\r\n\r\nurban  renewal,  more and more people  have  to  be\r\n\r\nevacuated. But the Housing and Development Board is\r\n\r\nnot  able to cater for the needs of those  who  are\r\n\r\naffected because it cannot build enough shophouses.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the demand always exceeds the supply. As\r\n\r\nfar as I know, some of those who were evacuated and\r\n\r\nwhose shophouses were demolished two or three years\r\n\r\nago,  sometimes even longer, have not been allotted\r\n\r\nsuitable  shophouses  up  to  now.  How  can   they\r\n\r\ncontinue  with their business to earn a living.  It\r\n\r\nis  impossible for them to continue living! This is\r\n\r\nindeed a very serious problem. In our new Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan,  I  hope  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  will\r\n\r\nconsider carefully the question of providing enough\r\n\r\nshophouses to those affected by urban renewal; for\r\n\r\nexample, grocery and coffee shops, restaurants  and\r\n\r\nso   on.  If  we  can  increase  the  building   of\r\n\r\nshophouses in our new Five-year Plan, it will  help\r\n\r\nthose  who have been affected by the urban  renewal\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has considered the proposition  to\r\n\r\noffer  sites to those shopkeepers affected by urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  who  could  join forces  and  collectively\r\n\r\ndevelop  the sites.

The pork sellers in the rural\r\n\r\nareas  are  faced with a big problem. Because  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  travel a long distance to buy  the  meat,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  get up in the early  hours  of  the\r\n\r\nmorning  in order to go all the way to Jurong.  The\r\n\r\nCentral Abattoir is very busy, and the pork sellers\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait a long time before they  can  get  a\r\n\r\nshare of the meat. If we can establish a number  of\r\n\r\nsmall rural abattoirs, it will not be necessary for\r\n\r\nthese  pork sellers to travel such a long distance.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Minister will seriously consider  this\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also said that after\r\n\r\nthree years we find that this scheme does not work,\r\n\r\nand  even the department itself knows that it  does\r\n\r\nnot work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is not that of slaughtering of\r\n\r\npigs but the slaughtering of cows.

Apparently\r\n\r\nit  takes ten hours for the frozen entrails of  the\r\n\r\ncow  to be transported from Jurong to the city, and\r\n\r\nby that time these entrails are not fresh any more.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they cannot be sold to  the  public.

With regard to the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  intensive  farming improvement  schemes\r\n\r\nthat  have  been carried out, where have they  been\r\n\r\ncarried  out,  what  positive  results  have   been\r\n\r\nachieved, and also, in similar respects, what about\r\n\r\nthe  factory  farming pilot scheme? I  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen in sympathy with the farmers, having come from\r\n\r\na  rural  area in which there is plenty of  farming\r\n\r\naround. The Primary Production Department has  come\r\n\r\nup  with  a  very  substantial  figure  of  farming\r\n\r\nproduce in its annual report. I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National Development is  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  inhibitions on the part of  landowners  in\r\n\r\nconnection   with   lands  which   are   zoned   as\r\n\r\nagricultural areas. In other words, lands which are\r\n\r\nzoned   as   agricultural  areas  mean  that   only\r\n\r\nagricultural development can take place. Here again\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  may come up with the statement,  \"We\r\n\r\nmay  have just a few landowners who may prevent the\r\n\r\ntenant farmers from further utilising their land or\r\n\r\nextending  the area of farming.\" Sir, I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to look into this matter, because land\r\n\r\navailability  is scarce and, with  other  forms  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  going on, more and more land  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  up.

But unfortunately  now,\r\n\r\nSir - you may or may not be aware of it - the price\r\n\r\nof eggs has taken a dip. Some Members may not agree\r\n\r\nthat  eggs are not that cheap.

Land is a scarce factor  of\r\n\r\nproduction in our country. Many farmers  have  been\r\n\r\naffected by resettlement and the new area  of  land\r\n\r\nallotted to them is very small. Therefore, we  must\r\n\r\ntry our best to introduce intensive farming methods\r\n\r\nor  the factory farming pilot scheme to remedy  the\r\n\r\ndeficiency of land and the small size of the farms.\r\n\r\nI  believe  that  the  intensive  farm  improvement\r\n\r\nschemes  or the factory farming pilot scheme  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  under active experiment by the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  have  achieved  a   certain\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  success. Can the Minister  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse what progress and achievements have been made\r\n\r\nby  these two schemes? Also, can these two  schemes\r\n\r\nbe  applied  to  the  whole  farming  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intensive farm\r\n\r\nimprovement scheme was initiated in 1968  with  the\r\n\r\nobjective of introducing modern scientific  methods\r\n\r\nof  farming  to  the  farmers so  that  they  could\r\n\r\nintensify  their  activities  and  increase   their\r\n\r\nproductivity.  Under  the  scheme,   research   was\r\n\r\ninitiated to improve the use of horticultural crops\r\n\r\nthrough  the  selection of  a  good  parent  plant,\r\n\r\nthrough  better manurial practices and the  control\r\n\r\nof pests and diseases.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies are being carried out at the\r\n\r\nSembawang Field Experimental Station as well  as  a\r\n\r\ndemonstration  farm at Lim Chu  Kang.  The  results\r\n\r\nobtained from all these studies have been and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be passed on to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmers  through  the Primary Production  Extension\r\n\r\nService  or  through training courses organised  by\r\n\r\nthe department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for land for agriculture, the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department is working closely  with  the\r\n\r\nplanning authority on the future needs of land  for\r\n\r\nagriculture. The Planning Department is at  present\r\n\r\ncompleting  a  study into the overall  planning  of\r\n\r\nland  use for Singapore, including the planning  of\r\n\r\nland  used  for agricultural purposes. However,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  realised  that,  with  the  limited  land\r\n\r\navailable  in  Singapore and with the great  demand\r\n\r\nfor  land  for other purposes, the use of land  for\r\n\r\nagricultural purposes, though not neglected, has to\r\n\r\nbe considered in the context of Singapore's overall\r\n\r\neconomic development. The Government recognises the\r\n\r\nneed  to  optimise  the use of  agricultural  land,\r\n\r\nincluding   private  land  used  for   agriculture.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  has  at present no  power  to  compel\r\n\r\nowners of private land to optimise the use of their\r\n\r\nland  for  agricultural purposes. If the owners  of\r\n\r\nprivate land in areas zoned for agriculture wish to\r\n\r\nmake fuller use of their land, they can always seek\r\n\r\nthe advice of the Primary Production Department  on\r\n\r\nthe  type  of  agriculture which  can  be  suitably\r\n\r\nundertaken on their land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the factory farming scheme which\r\n\r\nhas  been raised by both Members, the proposal  has\r\n\r\nonly   been   approved   in   principle   and   its\r\n\r\nimplementation is expected to be initiated  towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of this year. Whether it is practical  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  multi-storey flatted farms  on  a  large\r\n\r\nscale to farmers in Singapore will depend very much\r\n\r\non  the  results yielded by a pilot  scheme  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced. Whether or not the farmers  will  adopt\r\n\r\nfactory farming methods and how extensively factory\r\n\r\nfarming can be carried out in Singapore will depend\r\n\r\non the results yielded by this pilot project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the surplus of eggs,  their  low\r\n\r\nprice,  and  what good use we will make  from  this\r\n\r\nsurplus of eggs; for example, the building of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  egg-powder  factory in Singapore.

The point is  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsurplus of eggs on the market resulting in a dip in\r\n\r\nthe price. The Minister has just now mentioned that\r\n\r\nit  is  a question of supply and demand.

Members</b>: Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As for the Fishing Training Centre at\r\n\r\nChangi,  which was established with the  assistance\r\n\r\nof  the  United  Nations Development Programme,  it\r\n\r\nruns  two  courses the deck course and  the  engine\r\n\r\ncourse. The deck course is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naimed   at   producing   navigators   and   fishing\r\n\r\ntechnicians,  and  the engine course  is  to  train\r\n\r\nfishing vessel engineers. Out of the first batch of\r\n\r\n24  trainees taken in August last year, 11 were for\r\n\r\nthe  deck course and 13 for the engine course.  The\r\n\r\nsuccess or failure of the centre can best be judged\r\n\r\nfrom  the performance of the trainees, but  as  the\r\n\r\nfirst batch has not yet passed out, it is too early\r\n\r\nto comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During late 1969 and early 1970, prior to the\r\n\r\nrunning of these one-year courses, there were  four\r\n\r\nshort  intensive two to three months'  courses  for\r\n\r\nfishermen.  Out  of  a total of  75  fishermen  who\r\n\r\nattended  these courses, 51 of them  completed  and\r\n\r\npassed the courses. Most of those who completed the\r\n\r\ncourses  were  offered jobs by  commercial  fishing\r\n\r\ncompanies  on  the recommendation  of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department, but unfortunately  some  of\r\n\r\nthem did not remain long in their new job. For  any\r\n\r\nwho have been trained and say that they cannot find\r\n\r\na  job,  the Primary Production Department will  be\r\n\r\npleased to secure places for them on off-shore  and\r\n\r\ndeep-sea  fishing  vessels operating  from  Jurong.\r\n\r\nMost  of  these  vessels are short  of  local  crew\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know from the Minister for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development  how  much  fish  by  way  of\r\n\r\ntonnage and value the Jurong Fishing Port and  Fish\r\n\r\nMarket  handles  each year. As  far  as  Kankar  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I believe I have given the figure of  no\r\n\r\nless  than $7.2 million worth of fish being handled\r\n\r\nat  the little market in Ponggol. Therefore  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  \"fishy business\", as earlier indicated. I mean\r\n\r\nit  is  really fishing business pertaining to  fish\r\n\r\nand  not \"fishy business\" in the sense that you may\r\n\r\nthink of. Anyway, I attach much importance to deep-sea  fishing and offshore fishing. Invariably,  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  at  the Jurong Fishing  Port  and  Fish\r\n\r\nMarket  are inadequate and I welcome the  provision\r\n\r\nof  $200,000  in this respect. If the Minister  can\r\n\r\nenlighten this House on how this provision will  be\r\n\r\nutilised, I shall be most grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the fish market and fishing port\r\n\r\nat  Kankar, I am glad to say that the wisdom of the\r\n\r\nGovernment has prevailed, because, between 1964 and\r\n\r\n1966,  the  Ministry  of National  Development  was\r\n\r\nquite  adamant in removing the little fishing fleet\r\n\r\nfrom   Kankar  to  Jurong.  However,  common  sense\r\n\r\nprevailed  and  today  I can safely  say  that  the\r\n\r\nfishing port at Kankar has developed very fast,  in\r\n\r\nfact too fast. From a fleet of less than 60 fishing\r\n\r\nvessels,  ranging from five tons to 15 tons,  using\r\n\r\nthis  port  during those years,  it  has  now  been\r\n\r\nincreased  to  slightly more than a hundred.  I  am\r\n\r\ntold  that several more are being built.  They  are\r\n\r\nmuch bigger in size, in length and in tonnage.  The\r\n\r\nfishing  port  at Kankar is fast becoming  quite  a\r\n\r\nbusy  place  and  the  facilities  there  will   be\r\n\r\ninadequate in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  his Ministry has  any  plans  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the Kankar fish market. I would also  like\r\n\r\nto  know  what is happening to the latest  petition\r\n\r\nasking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a  jetty that was sent to the Director of  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe know that the Jurong Central Fish Market was set\r\n\r\nup  two  years  ago  with the co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nmerchants  concerned.  At that  time,  very  simple\r\n\r\ntimber   offices   were  built,  as   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department wanted to speed up  matters.\r\n\r\nThe  Department  promised the  merchants  concerned\r\n\r\nthat   after   two  years  the  office   would   be\r\n\r\nreconstructed. Since the merchants co-operated with\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  they  did not  quarrel  with  the\r\n\r\nDepartment about the facilities of the office.  Two\r\n\r\nyears have now elapsed, but there is still no  sign\r\n\r\nof the building of new and spacious offices for the\r\n\r\nfish  merchants in the Jurong Central Fish  Market.\r\n\r\nCan  the Minister say whether there is any plan  in\r\n\r\nhand  to  build  a larger office, or  any  plan  to\r\n\r\nimprove the situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many large holes in the ground of the\r\n\r\nfish  market. Some of them have been repaired,  but\r\n\r\nother  smaller holes have appeared since then.  All\r\n\r\nthe  places in the Jurong Central Fish Market  need\r\n\r\nto  be  washed  in order to keep it in  a  hygienic\r\n\r\ncondition.  We all know that a cemented ground  can\r\n\r\nbe washed easily and can withstand the splashing of\r\n\r\nwater. So when any development is made to this fish\r\n\r\nmarket,  I  hope  the  surrounding  area  will   be\r\n\r\ncemented so that it will facilitate washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the first\r\n\r\nphase  of  the Jurong Fishing Port, the  Government\r\n\r\nprovided basic infrastructures such as the 750-foot\r\n\r\nwalk,  fish  landing equipment, auction market  and\r\n\r\ndistribution facilities. Several sites  within  the\r\n\r\nfishing  port  complex have also been allocated  to\r\n\r\ncommercial companies for the establishment of  cold\r\n\r\nstorage and quick-freezing fishmeal production  and\r\n\r\nice-manufacturing facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fish agents from Ellenborough and Clyde\r\n\r\nTerrace  Markets  in  the city have  shifted  their\r\n\r\noperations   to  Jurong.  Similarly,  all   lorries\r\n\r\ntransporting  fish  from West Malaysia  now  unload\r\n\r\nfish  at  Jurong  instead of at various  places  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these increased activities, a\r\n\r\nprovision  of $200,000 for the Jurong Fishing  Port\r\n\r\nfor  next  year  is made for the extension  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  wharf, improvement and expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nfish   auction  market,  provision  of   additional\r\n\r\nlighting for the wharf, purchase of pumps  to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  sea water for cleaning purposes,  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision of market equipment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a total of about 67,000 tons of fish\r\n\r\nlanded  last year in Singapore, the Jurong  Fishing\r\n\r\nPort   handled   about  49,000  tons,   valued   at\r\n\r\napproximately $39 million.

The  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment erected three blocks of temporary timber\r\n\r\noffices  for  the  use of fish merchants  when  the\r\n\r\nauction market was started. The department did  not\r\n\r\nat  any time undertake to erect permanent buildings\r\n\r\nfor  them. In fact, the department is of  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  they  should erect their own facilities.  The\r\n\r\ncommercial companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengaged in the catching and auctioning of fish have\r\n\r\nconstructed  their  own offices  as  well  as  fish\r\n\r\nprocessing  installations. However, the  department\r\n\r\nis   prepared  to  recommend  to  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation,  which owns the land  at  the  fishing\r\n\r\nport, to lease some land to any fish merchants  who\r\n\r\nmay  wish to construct their own permanent  offices\r\n\r\nor  even  to the Fish Merchants General Association\r\n\r\nfor them to construct offices for their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member also made mention of the\r\n\r\nroads  in  the Jurong Fishing Port. The roads  have\r\n\r\nbeen  badly damaged but they were recently  tarred,\r\n\r\nwork  having been completed in February this  year.\r\n\r\nIt  appears  that, because of the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nlarge number of heavy vehicles going in and out  of\r\n\r\nthe  fishing port, the roads are subject  to  heavy\r\n\r\nwear and tear, and maintenance is not easy and will\r\n\r\nhave to be more frequent if the roads are to be  in\r\n\r\nserviceable condition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for smells, the fishmeal factory belonging to\r\n\r\na  private  company was responsible  to  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany  was responsible for some unpleasant  odour\r\n\r\nat  the  fishing  port. Apparently there  were  two\r\n\r\nmajor sources of smell: (1) from the steam released\r\n\r\ninto  the atmosphere; and (2) from the liquid waste\r\n\r\nwhich  is  discharged  into a roadside  drain.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health has inspected the factory -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> I myself inspected the factory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I beg the Minister's pardon. The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health inspected the factory  and  on\r\n\r\nhis  - I do not know whether to say recommendation,\r\n\r\nadvice  or  threat  the company has  condensed  the\r\n\r\nsteam  instead of releasing it into the atmosphere,\r\n\r\nand  has  also taken steps to discharge the  liquid\r\n\r\nwaste  into  the sewer system instead of  into  the\r\n\r\nopen drain. The position now is satisfactory.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I forget, I must now deal with the points\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Punggol. He has raised  so\r\n\r\nmany points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  I must be forgiven if I forget some of  them.\r\n\r\nAs  to what I am doing at Kankar, for the moment  I\r\n\r\nam  doing  nothing.  We  will  be  considering  the\r\n\r\npetition  for  a jetty. If the funds  do  not  come\r\n\r\nthrough to the Primary Production Department,  then\r\n\r\nan application could be considered by the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural   Services  Committee.  But   it   would   be\r\n\r\ndifficult, as I realise, in a place like Kankar  to\r\n\r\nland fish without a good jetty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis  reply,  that whilst no other plans  are  being\r\n\r\nenvisaged  in Kankar, at least the jetty  is  being\r\n\r\nconsidered. However, I must stress that  since  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department  has  no  plans  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the Kankar Fish Market, the market  itself\r\n\r\nis  in the process of developing more or less. Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (7) *, Mr Teong Eng\r\n\r\nSiong.

Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 73 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there should be a larger reduction in\r\n\r\nthe  vote  because the efficiency of the department\r\n\r\nis  not  so  good.  There are  about  22  items  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure and the total vote is about $2 million,\r\n\r\nwhich is quite a considerable sum of money. We know\r\n\r\nthat   the   Primary   Production   Department   is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the development of our agriculture\r\n\r\nand fisheries. The important question is whether it\r\n\r\nhas any plans to develop agriculture or fisheries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fisheries, we all know that the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong  has said in this House some time  ago  that\r\n\r\nabout  two-thirds of the fish consumed is  imported\r\n\r\nfrom abroad, For this we have to spend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  big  sum of money, amounting to $17 million  per\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister in charge of\r\n\r\nthis   department   some  questions   relating   to\r\n\r\nfisheries. According to the estimates, there is one\r\n\r\nitem  called the Fishing Training Centre. I believe\r\n\r\nthere  is no plan to develop this centre, and  this\r\n\r\nwill  be of no use for the production of more  fish\r\n\r\nfor  local  consumption.  We  may  spend  about  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  every  year  on fisheries,  but  how  much\r\n\r\nbenefit can we get from this expenditure'? Whatever\r\n\r\nplans  there  may be to develop foreshore  fishing,\r\n\r\njetties, or what not, it seems that all these plans\r\n\r\nhave come to nothing. Therefore, I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the department has any plans this year  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  fisheries, that is  to  say,  whether\r\n\r\nthere can be any increase in the production of fish\r\n\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also said that in recent years our agriculture has been declining. So I would like to ask him whether the department has any plans to develop our agriculture. The Member for Punggol has raised the point that\r\n\r\nthe  price  of eggs is too cheap, and the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said that when the price of eggs goes up, some\r\n\r\nMembers complain, and that when it goes down, other\r\n\r\npeople  complain  also.  He  complains  about   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties involved. Of course, when there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreater demand for certain items, the price  should\r\n\r\nbe better, It is my hope, however, that our farmers\r\n\r\nwill  get a better deal so that they may enjoy  and\r\n\r\nhave a share in our minor boom, or shall I say mini-prosperity. So if the price of eggs is too  low,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask whether the Minister  in  charge\r\n\r\ncan consider a campaign to help raise the price  of\r\n\r\neggs  by  holding a \"Eat More Eggs Week\"  campaign,\r\n\r\nbecause  eggs  are very nourishing as they  contain\r\n\r\nvitamins and protein. I think it will be very  good\r\n\r\nfor  our  people in building a rugged  physique.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister can think of some ways  to  help\r\n\r\nour  farmers to remedy the situation and  not  just\r\n\r\nsit down and shake his leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has five minutes more to\r\n\r\ngo before \"guillotine\" time.

Many farmers who have\r\n\r\nbeen  resettled will not be allotted a large  piece\r\n\r\nof land. They will be allotted about one or, at the\r\n\r\nmost, one and a half acres of land. The majority of\r\n\r\nthem get half or three-quarters of an acre of land.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not economical to grow vegetables or  other\r\n\r\nagricultural produce on such a small plot of  land.\r\n\r\nSome  farmers have already changed their  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and  are making use of  their  land  in\r\n\r\nother  ways,  for  example, the  rearing  of  fancy\r\n\r\ntropical  fish. Other farmers have planted orchids.\r\n\r\nIt  seems that the Primary Production Department is\r\n\r\nnot  quite definite about the measures to be  taken\r\n\r\nin this connection. So I want to ask whether it can\r\n\r\ngive  support  to  the farmers by way  of  securing\r\n\r\nforeign  markets  for their agricultural  products.\r\n\r\nThus  they  will  not be exploited by  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nlocal middlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department can provide our farmers  with\r\n\r\ncheap  fertilisers. This is one good  way  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  in  their horticultural production, otherwise\r\n\r\nthey  have to buy expensive fertilisers from  local\r\n\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has\r\n\r\nthree minutes to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  since  I have very little time  in  which  to\r\n\r\nreply,  I  will be brief. There is nothing  new  in\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member  for  Sembawang  has  said.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  have  debated  on  deep-sea  fishing\r\n\r\nbefore. However, perhaps he was not here when  this\r\n\r\nquestion was raised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment is not efficient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  its  work.  I would like him to  consider  this\r\n\r\npoint.  Our farmers are earning an income  of  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  per year. If the department has  not  been\r\n\r\nefficient,  how is it possible for the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nearn so high an income as $100 million per year?  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member for Sembawang should  know  this\r\n\r\nfact very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other question is whether the department can\r\n\r\nprovide the farmers with cheap fertilisers to  help\r\n\r\nthem in their horticultural production. The Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department can recommend certain  types\r\n\r\nof fertilisers to the farmers to use. But it cannot\r\n\r\nsell  such fertilisers to them. It is not a profit-making department.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question is about certain\r\n\r\nfarmers changing their means of livelihood. As  far\r\n\r\nas  I know, there are still many farms in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  need farmers. In fact, there are some  large\r\n\r\nfarms  which are short of staff. I think  that  the\r\n\r\nchange  of livelihood by some farmers in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas is not a serious question.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allocation of land to farmers, our\r\n\r\nland  area  is  limited. Normally we allot  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers affected half an acre to one acre of  land.\r\n\r\nIf  the Member for Jurong has any better method  to\r\n\r\nget  large  areas of land, we can then  allot  more\r\n\r\nland to our farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  withdraw  my amendment,  because  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary has  entirely  ignored  my\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,927,570 for Head 73 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 74 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nNg Kah Ting\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 74 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2) *, Mr Ng Kah\r\n\r\nTing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 74 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 209*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I welcome the big increase in the provision for roadside trees and shrubs, including the landscaping and improvement of open spaces and parks in the republic, I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Law and National Development to the planting of such\r\n\r\nroadside trees and shrubs. Sir, it seems to me that\r\n\r\nthe  Parks  and Trees Division has no  creative  or\r\n\r\nimaginative  ideas  about  planting  the  necessary\r\n\r\ntypes  of  flowering shrubs or  roadside  trees  in\r\n\r\norder  to  create the type of garden city  that  we\r\n\r\nwish to have. I bring this matter up because I  see\r\n\r\nthat  although there has been a lot of planting  of\r\n\r\nroadside  trees and shrubs, there seems  to  be  no\r\n\r\nlandscaping in the work. A lot of trees and  shrubs\r\n\r\nare planted, but what do they represent'? There may\r\n\r\nbe  greenery, yes, but from the point  of  view  of\r\n\r\nbeauty or artistic appreciation, there is none.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parks and Trees Division has also embarked\r\n\r\nupon   a   scheme  whereby  commercial  firms   are\r\n\r\nencouraged to maintain their plots of greenery, and\r\n\r\ntowards  that end flowering shrubs and  trees  have\r\n\r\nbeen  planted in certain areas. I have seen one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  of them, but I do not know whether or not they\r\n\r\nare being regularly maintained. Sir, to spend a sum\r\n\r\nof  no less than $1.2 million requires very careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.  There  must  be  creativeness   and\r\n\r\nimagination in the planting of roadside  trees  and\r\n\r\nshrubs  so that a truly green and beautiful  garden\r\n\r\ncity will come about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Each  complex is in  the  charge  of  a\r\n\r\nhorticultural officer with supporting staff to look\r\n\r\nafter  the  roadside  planting,  including  traffic\r\n\r\nsurfaces,  traffic islands, centre  dividers,  side\r\n\r\ntables and any open spaces near the roadside.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next fiscal year, it is planned to plant\r\n\r\nan average of about 2,500 trees and 8,000 shrubs in\r\n\r\neach complex.

To\r\n\r\nillustrate my point, Sir, there was a big signboard\r\n\r\nat Punggol point which was eventually taken down. I\r\n\r\nasked  for  some  flowering shrubs  to  be  planted\r\n\r\nthere.  However, when I went up there. I could  not\r\n\r\nsee  the shrubs although I was told that there were\r\n\r\nshrubs.  I  looked further. I went down  the  steps\r\n\r\nleading to the jetty and there I found a few  trees\r\n\r\nand shrubs planted. That was not exactly the idea I\r\n\r\nhad in mind. I was not consulted on this matter.

Jalan\r\n\r\nToa Payoh is just a part of the proposed Pan-Island\r\n\r\nExpressway   and,   in   order   to   provide    an\r\n\r\nuninterrupted  flow  of  traffic  along  Jalan  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh,  a  flyover  was constructed.  This  flyover\r\n\r\npermits  free right-turn movements from  Jalan  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  into  Toa  Payoh New Town and  vice  versa.\r\n\r\nSince  the  right-turn traffic  at  this  point  is\r\n\r\nseparated  and  provided for  at  two  levels,  the\r\n\r\naccident risks are reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to accident statistics obtained from\r\n\r\nthe  Accidents Branch, Traffic Police,  only  three\r\n\r\naccidents  have  occurred  near  Jalan  Toa   Payoh\r\n\r\nflyover and 10 accidents near Kim Keat Road  during\r\n\r\nthe period 1st January, 1970, to the 28th February,\r\n\r\n1971.  That is a period of 14 months, According  to\r\n\r\nthe  Accidents Branch, these few accidents were due\r\n\r\nto  carelessness of either the pedestrians  or  the\r\n\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jalan Toa Payoh was constructed largely over\r\n\r\nswamp land. A considerable amount of filling had to\r\n\r\nbe  carried out and hence, over a period of  years,\r\n\r\nthere  has been continuous settlement of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd  this has given rise to unevenness of the  road\r\n\r\nsurface  and  the road breaking up in  some  parts.\r\n\r\nBecause of the continued construction taking  place\r\n\r\nin and around Toa Payoh New Town, permanent repairs\r\n\r\nhave  not  yet  been carried out.

This is a major thoroughfare  from\r\n\r\nthe  city  area to Jurong Town. At the moment,  this\r\n\r\nroad  is  a dual carriageway. In Jurong, there  are\r\n\r\nmore than 200 factories and there are many workers.\r\n\r\nAt  peak hours, the traffic along this road is very\r\n\r\nheavy.  If  there is an accident,  very  often  the\r\n\r\ntraffic jam created is two or three miles long.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  a factory fire, as the Member for  River\r\n\r\nValley  has said, before the fire-engine can arrive\r\n\r\nat  the  scene of the fire, the factory  will  have\r\n\r\nalready  been razed to the ground.

In the early\r\n\r\nyears of Jurong, traffic using the road was limited\r\n\r\nand  therefore only two lanes for traffic going  up\r\n\r\nto  and  two lanes for traffic leaving Jurong  were\r\n\r\nconstructed  with adequate reserve  set  aside  for\r\n\r\nfuture  widening.  With the  rapid  development  in\r\n\r\nJurong,  the  traffic  using Jalan  Ahmad  Ibrahim,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  at present the main arterial  road  from\r\n\r\nJurong  into the city, has increased by  leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds.

Take Punggol Road  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.  Certain  stretches are quite  bumpy,  and\r\n\r\nwhen   complaints  are  made,  the   Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  steps in to patch up some of  the  pot-holes. As a result of this patching up, you get the\r\n\r\nbumps. Sir, I wonder whether the Ministry has plans\r\n\r\nto  resurface  Punggol Road which is in  very  dire\r\n\r\nneed of resurfacing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.45 p. m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I gave the Member\r\n\r\nthe answer when replying to one of his questions in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the widening of Punggol  Road.  I  did\r\n\r\nassure him that repairs would be undertaken to keep\r\n\r\nthe  roads in a satisfactory condition for  use  by\r\n\r\ntraffic,  and  that a feasibility  study  into  the\r\n\r\nwidening  of Punggol Road was being done.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Member that quite a few of our roads  are\r\n\r\nbumpy, as a result of some department digging  them\r\n\r\nup  either  in respect of water mains,  electricity\r\n\r\nmains    or   even   telephone   cables.   It    is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  to  see a nice  new  road  recently\r\n\r\nwidened  and  then,  not even a month  later,  some\r\n\r\ndepartment  comes along and digs it up.  When  they\r\n\r\nfill  it  up, obviously they cannot make it  level.\r\n\r\nThey  will  have  to fill it up  a  little  higher,\r\n\r\notherwise the level sinks. So, as a result, quite a\r\n\r\nfew  of our roads have these bumps which remain for\r\n\r\na very long time until the whole length of the road\r\n\r\nis  resurfaced  completely. There  is  a  Road  Co-ordination   Committee,  comprising   the   service\r\n\r\ndepartments, such as the Singapore Telephone Board,\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Utilities Board and the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment. This is to ensure that there is maximum\r\n\r\ncoordination. In fact, no one now is allowed to dig\r\n\r\nup  a  newly-resurfaced road or a newly built  road\r\n\r\nwithin  a  period  of one year  when  the  work  is\r\n\r\ncompleted, unless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  get the permission of the Director of  Public\r\n\r\nWorks.

The  second  phase,  including  car   park\r\n\r\nfacilities,  is expected to be completed  in  March\r\n\r\n1972.  The implementation of the second phase  will\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  road system for the  Kallang  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex  and will include another car  park  for  a\r\n\r\nthousand  cars. In addition to this, bus bays  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  provided  in  the  car  park  for  a  bus\r\n\r\nterminus.  Half of the old runway from  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nRoad  to  another  road parallel  to  Jalan  Benaan\r\n\r\nKapal, together with a big parking scheme and other\r\n\r\nlink  roads,  will constitute the second  phase  of\r\n\r\nthis  project.

So be it. It\r\n\r\nis not a sin for anyone who has the means to seek a\r\n\r\nmore profitable and gracious living, but let us not\r\n\r\nforget  to look at the other side of the  coin -- the\r\n\r\nless colourful and less glamorous side of the happy\r\n\r\nfacade. Would not the rural people be entitled to a\r\n\r\nbetter deal, if only it means a little slice of the\r\n\r\ncream?  Does  the Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nreally  believe  that  a  mere  miserable  sum   of\r\n\r\n$450,000,  which  is not even 10 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nmonies   to  be  spent  on  parks  and  trees,   is\r\n\r\nsufficient to build or repair the rural and kampong\r\n\r\nroads?  My  constituency alone requires many  times\r\n\r\nmore  than  that. The rural folks  are  simple  and\r\n\r\ntheir  wants  modest.  Whilst  we  enjoy  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has said to be a mild or mini-boom, would not a little more be spent on the  poor\r\n\r\nrural  folks?  Would  we  be  asking  too  much  or\r\n\r\nunreasonably  demanding  too  exorbitantly  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to plough back just that little bit more\r\n\r\nso  as  to make life for the rural people a  little\r\n\r\nbit  easier? May I reiterate that the needs of  the\r\n\r\nrural people are indeed minimal. I would not burden\r\n\r\nthe  House by, relating any further hardship of the\r\n\r\nfarmers  and the fishermen, for my other colleagues\r\n\r\nhave  in the past few days adequately informed this\r\n\r\nHouse.  It  is all very well for the Government  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  is  preoccupied with other  priority\r\n\r\nmatters in restructuring our economy in the face of\r\n\r\nthe  British  pullout,  but  a  somewhat  apathetic\r\n\r\nattitude towards the rural people is something\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat surprises me, because we have said so much and\r\n\r\nclaimed  to  be  able to do so much for  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are roads built several years ago, but they\r\n\r\nwere  constructed  on  the standard  classified  as\r\n\r\n\"kampong  and  rural  roads\", which  means  a  mere\r\n\r\nsurfacing of the track of land without a foundation\r\n\r\nat  all. This method of constructing kampong  roads\r\n\r\nmight  well suit the needs of the people, but after\r\n\r\nseveral heavy rainfalls, the surface of these roads\r\n\r\nis  washed away and potholes appear after  a  short\r\n\r\ntime. The condition of the roads then is not better\r\n\r\nthan what it was before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always an agonising experience for the\r\n\r\nrural folks, like the farmers and even their wives,\r\n\r\nto have to transport heavy loads of farm produce to\r\n\r\nmarket  over these roads, not to mention the little\r\n\r\nchildren who use the roads on their way to  school.\r\n\r\nThe  situation  is  even worse during  the  monsoon\r\n\r\nseason when the farmers and their children have  to\r\n\r\nstruggle to find their way home in a tortuous  way.\r\n\r\nWould   not  the  Government  consider   a   better\r\n\r\nconstruction  method, such as laying  a  foundation\r\n\r\nfor  these  roads so that they can last longer  and\r\n\r\nprovide easy access for the farmers and the country\r\n\r\nfolks?  It  is  easy  for us as  city  dwellers  to\r\n\r\nneglect  this aspect of the rural life as  we  move\r\n\r\naround  the town in cars and other modern modes  of\r\n\r\ntransport   over  one  of  the  best   roads   ever\r\n\r\nconstructed in this part of the world. I  sincerely\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister  to be a  little  generous  and\r\n\r\nsympathetic  towards the rural  people  who,  after\r\n\r\nall,  do contribute in whatever small way they  can\r\n\r\ntowards  the  building of our republic.

In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has all this time been claiming that  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  doing  a  lot for the rural  people,  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact it has been doing more for  the  urban\r\n\r\npeople than the rural people, as pointed out by the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amount of money spent on beautifying our city area exceeds by ten times the sum allotted for the roads in the rural areas. I would like to remind the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary that the rural people also pay taxes. They do not just sit down and enjoy the\r\n\r\nfruits  given  by  the  Government.  So  they   are\r\n\r\nentitled to ask for better roads.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also endorse the view of the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi  when  he  says  that  this  meagre  sum  of\r\n\r\n$450,000  is far from adequate for the construction\r\n\r\nof roads in the rural areas. From my own experience\r\n\r\nover  the  past few years, I know that  unless  the\r\n\r\nroads  in  the rural areas are metalled,  they  are\r\n\r\nuseless  and  the  money spent on  making  them  is\r\n\r\nwasted, because after a monsoon or a heavy downpour\r\n\r\nthey will be badly affected and a lot of money will\r\n\r\nhave  to  go  towards repairing them. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\npropose  that  the Government should allocate  more\r\n\r\nmoney  for  the  rural roads. I am not  asking  too\r\n\r\nmuch, but Government should spend as much money  on\r\n\r\nthem  as they are spending on beautifying the  city\r\n\r\nor  building  more  gardens. At least  they  should\r\n\r\nspend what is necessary for metalling them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of\r\n\r\n$450,000  is  allocated under  this  Head  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  repair of agricultural and kampong  roads.

In actual fact,  it  is  only\r\n\r\n$2.475  million.  He says that  this  provision  is\r\n\r\nadequate  to cover all the outstanding requests  by\r\n\r\nall  the  constituencies. In other words,  what  he\r\n\r\nmeans  possibly is the requests from the  urban  as\r\n\r\nwell as the rural constituencies. But I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  he  realises  that there  are  still  more\r\n\r\nrequests  to come as a result, and therefore,  this\r\n\r\nprovision of $ 2.475 million is grossly inadequate.\r\n\r\nI  note,  with  gratitude, that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance is here with us at this moment, and I would\r\n\r\nurge him to give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nus   some  sympathy.  When  I  say  \"give  us  some\r\n\r\nsympathy\",  I  mean I can safely  speak  for  those\r\n\r\nMembers  who  come from the rural areas,  including\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State for Finance who  comes  from\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang. He is nodding his  head,  too,  in\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point of making requests to the\r\n\r\nUrban  and Rural Services Committee, I think it  is\r\n\r\nhigh  time the U.R.S.C. formulated a new method  by\r\n\r\nwhich  requests  can be considered  as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible  and not through the District  Committees.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, processing requests  through  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Committees invariably causes a lot of time\r\n\r\nbeing used up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I come to my point about the extension\r\n\r\nof  water  supply  as  well as electricity  supply?\r\n\r\nMembers may care to note that an amount of $382,900\r\n\r\nwas  unspent  last year on the extension  of  water\r\n\r\nsupply.  I  am sure the Parliamentary Secretary  is\r\n\r\nfully aware that there are requests that have  been\r\n\r\noutstanding for several years. The reason why these\r\n\r\nrequests have been outstanding for so many years is\r\n\r\nsimply  that they could not be met as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe   costs  involved.  And  the  Urban  and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices  Committee was a bit reluctant to consider\r\n\r\nfavourably these requests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to electricity supply. The provision\r\n\r\nof  $50,000,  I  take  it, is  a  subsidy  for  the\r\n\r\nelectrification  scheme, but I am  disappointed  to\r\n\r\nnote that of late the Electricity Department of the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board  has  not  been  able   to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  various  electrification   schemes,\r\n\r\nthereby causing delays of up to two years. I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary does have a  list,  or\r\n\r\nmaybe  two  lists which have been prepared  by  the\r\n\r\nP.U.B.  Electricity Department indicating how  they\r\n\r\nwill be implementing such electrification schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Members of Parliament for the rural\r\n\r\nareas  know that these requests for electricity  as\r\n\r\nwell  as water supplies, and, for that matter,  the\r\n\r\nmaking  up of agricultural and kampong roads,  have\r\n\r\nbeen made quite some time ago. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"quite some time ago\", as the Member for Changi has\r\n\r\nremarked -means four or five years ago. And some of\r\n\r\nthese requests are still outstanding. The reason is\r\n\r\nquite  simple.  The funds allocated  to  the  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies  are paltry, negligible  sums.  Does\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary mean to say  that  the\r\n\r\nrural  folk should not enjoy the same amenities  as\r\n\r\nthose enjoyed by the city folk? The rural folk, for\r\n\r\nthe  information  of  the Parliamentary  Secretary,\r\n\r\nalso  pay the same rates as those paid by the  city\r\n\r\nfolk  for water and electricity supplies. They  pay\r\n\r\nthe  full  rate not just the domestic  rate  alone,\r\n\r\nespecially the farmers..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In winding up my speech, so as to give the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary sufficient time to reply, I\r\n\r\nwould  urge, should this provision be insufficient,\r\n\r\nthat  the Urban and Rural Services Committee should\r\n\r\nnot  hesitate  to  ask  for  more  money  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance in order to  accede  to  the\r\n\r\nrequests made from the rural constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, there is a revote of\r\n\r\n$382,900  as some water supply projects which  were\r\n\r\napproved during the current financial year have not\r\n\r\nyet  been  completed, and bills have not  yet  been\r\n\r\npresented  for payment. It is expected  that  these\r\n\r\nbills  will  be  received and paid  in  the  coming\r\n\r\nfinancial  year. Priority will be  given  to  water\r\n\r\nsupply  projects which cost less but  benefit  more\r\n\r\npeople.  Projects  which cost $50,000  or  $60,000,\r\n\r\nwhich  means they are big projects, and which  will\r\n\r\nbenefit comparatively less people will be given low\r\n\r\npriority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have two types of water supply projects. One is to lay water sub-mains in areas now served by public stand-pipes, so that the residents can make individual water connections into their houses and later, when water supply is available in the houses, to remove the public stand-pipes. The other type is to lay water mains in\r\n\r\nareas  not  served now with pipe-water.  The  first\r\n\r\ntype of project is usually given priority over  the\r\n\r\nsecond  type  as  it is the policy  to  remove  all\r\n\r\npublic standpipes and prevent wastage of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is \"guillotine\" time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not happy with the reply\r\n\r\nand I wish to take a vote.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 78 having expired, the\r\n\r\nfollowing amendment standing in the names of Mr\r\n\r\nTeong Eng Siong and Mr Ho Kah Leong, was not\r\n\r\nproceeded with:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,475,000 for Head 78 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 81 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 109\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this new provision is for the Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentre  for Hemiplegics and Paraplegics at Mandalay\r\n\r\nRoad,  Tan Tock Seng Hospital. I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health what is the purpose and the\r\n\r\nscope  of  this centre. I notice this is the  first\r\n\r\ntime  that the Government has come into the picture\r\n\r\nin rehabilitating hemiplegics and paraplegics. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  wonder whether the Minister for Health  has  any\r\n\r\nplans  to assist those welfare organisations  which\r\n\r\nlook after such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nproposal  to  establish  a  centre  for  paraplegic\r\n\r\npatients  was under study by my Ministry  early  in\r\n\r\n1969.  At  that time it was envisaged  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhospital  or  paraplegic  centre  for  long-staying\r\n\r\npatients and a sheltered workshop. However, in late\r\n\r\n1969  this proposal was expanded to include medical\r\n\r\nas well as surgical rehabilitation. This called for\r\n\r\na  revision  of the plan and the estimates  of  the\r\n\r\ncost.  The  revision was not finalised  until  July\r\n\r\n1970 and, therefore, it was\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ntoo  late for the proposals to be included  in  the\r\n\r\n1970-71  estimates. That is the reason why  it  has\r\n\r\nappeared   for  the  first  time  in  this   year's\r\n\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the scope of the centre, may I say\r\n\r\nthat at the moment paraplegics and hemiplegics  are\r\n\r\nbeing  admitted  or  treated  at  the  Outram  Road\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital, the Thomson Road General Hospital\r\n\r\nand  the  Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Most of  the  in-patients  invariably remain in the hospital  for  a\r\n\r\nlong  period  of time for the purpose of  receiving\r\n\r\neffective care, and this has resulted in the number\r\n\r\nof  hospital beds being correspondingly reduced for\r\n\r\nuse  by  other  more acute cases for whom  hospital\r\n\r\ntreatment  is particularly needed, If  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncentre  where  such patients can be taken  care  of\r\n\r\nexclusively, it will result in a number of beds  in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals being released for other medical and\r\n\r\nsurgical  cases.  The paraplegics  and  hemiplegics\r\n\r\nwill  also  be able to leave the hospital  earlier,\r\n\r\nsaving two to three months of hospitalisation,  and\r\n\r\nGovernment funds accordingly. Hence, the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  centre is twofold. First, to relieve the acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of  hospital  beds by  discharging  long-staying paraplegic and hemiplegic patients from the\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  the  centre and second,  to  provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for a more positive way for paraplegics\r\n\r\nand  hemiplegics  to rehabilitate  themselves.  The\r\n\r\ncentre  will provide accommodation to cater for  70\r\n\r\nto  80  in-patients  as well as rehabilitation  for\r\n\r\noutpatients and for surgical and medical cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the aid which my Ministry is giving to the\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations concerned with  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of physically disabled persons,  may\r\n\r\nI  say that at the moment my Ministry exempts  from\r\n\r\nhospital  charges  and outpatient  charges  certain\r\n\r\ncategories   of   patients   from   the   following\r\n\r\norganisations:    (1)   the   Spastic    Children's\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Singapore: (2) the Cheshire  Home:\r\n\r\n(3)   the   Singapore  Red  Cross  for  Handicapped\r\n\r\nChildren:  (4)  the Singapore Association  for  the\r\n\r\nBlind;  (5) the Singapore Association for  Retarded\r\n\r\nChildren; and (6) the Singapore Association for the\r\n\r\nDeaf and Dumb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, medico-socio workers from my\r\n\r\nMinistry contribute to the activities of the  first\r\n\r\nfive voluntary organisations which I have mentioned\r\n\r\nabove, and the Society for Aid to the Paralysed, by\r\n\r\nserving  on  their committees at different  levels,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  executive case work, admission to  homes,\r\n\r\nemployment and management.

My\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion is this: I wonder whether the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  is  aware that a good number of the  public\r\n\r\ncleansing   vehicles   need  cleaning   themselves,\r\n\r\nbecause   I  have  come  across  several  of   them\r\n\r\ntravelling along Upper Serangoon Road and not  only\r\n\r\nare  they  dirty looking but a lot of watery  waste\r\n\r\ndrips from them as they pass by on their way to the\r\n\r\nTampines  dumping  ground.  Sir,  there  have  been\r\n\r\ncampaigns  such  as \"Keep Singapore  Clean\",  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean and Green\"; \"Keep Singapore  Clean\r\n\r\nand  Pollution  Free\". Action has also  been  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  people  who do not obey the  law  to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  clean. However, I hope that  before  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health takes any action against the law-breakers it should put its own house in order, that\r\n\r\nis, keep its own vehicles clean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder whether the Minister for Health is\r\n\r\naware that the collection of refuse and garbage  is\r\n\r\nvery  inadequate. There are several bin centres  in\r\n\r\nmy   area  for  which  there  is  only  one   daily\r\n\r\ncollection. But the bin centres will be again  full\r\n\r\nbefore  the next day. I hope that with the purchase\r\n\r\nof  more  public cleansing vehicles, the  situation\r\n\r\nwill be remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of refuse treatment\r\n\r\nand  disposal plants. I note with very deep  regret\r\n\r\nthat  the  token vote of $10 is still a  revote.  I\r\n\r\nshall  be  grateful if the Minister  can  enlighten\r\n\r\nthis House on what this $10 token vote is for.  How\r\n\r\ncan  the  Ministry  conduct any study  into  refuse\r\n\r\ntreatment  and disposal plants with this  $10?  Are\r\n\r\nthere  going  to be refuse treatment  and  disposal\r\n\r\nplants in the republic, and, if so, where are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that the\r\n\r\nprovision  under  subhead 603 has been  reduced  by\r\n\r\n$96,500  for  this year. I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health  whether  this  provision  is\r\n\r\nsufficient to meet the needs of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe public cleansing service. As far as I know, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  lorries  for removing  garbage  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  I  had occasion to observe  privately-owned  lorries hired by the Ministry of  Health  to\r\n\r\nremove garbage. These lorries are not suitable  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose. I have seen garbage spilling on to the\r\n\r\nroad  from  such lorries. Such a state  of  affairs\r\n\r\nwill  not  help to improve the cleanliness  of  our\r\n\r\nroads. On the contrary, our roads will become dirty\r\n\r\nwhen these lorries pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I wish to touch upon is that the\r\n\r\nworkers of the Public Cleansing Department are  not\r\n\r\nsupplied   with  the  necessary  tools,   such   as\r\n\r\nchangkols,  scythes,  knives,  etc, to  clean  the\r\n\r\ndrains  in  the rural areas. I myself have  noticed\r\n\r\nthat the workers engaged in cleaning the drains  in\r\n\r\nthe Geylang Serai area are handicapped for lack  of\r\n\r\ntools  and  so are not able to cut away  the  thick\r\n\r\ngrowth of grass which is choking up the drains. The\r\n\r\nresult  is  that  the drains have  become  breeding\r\n\r\ngrounds  for mosquitoes. This is one of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  there are many mosquitoes in the Geylang Serai\r\n\r\narea. The workers lack the necessary tools to carry\r\n\r\nout  their  work properly.

I  agree  with  the  Member   that   the\r\n\r\nallocation is not sufficient. In fact, we  did  ask\r\n\r\nfor  $2.5  million,  but we were  given  only  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Passing back the buck to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> No, we are not passing the\r\n\r\nbuck  back.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  working on the actual volume  of  refuse  we\r\n\r\nhave collected from the beginning of this year,  we\r\n\r\nestimate that the volume of refuse per day would be\r\n\r\n1,375  tons. We therefore require an additional  37\r\n\r\nrefuse  collectors, 15 covered crane wagons and  15\r\n\r\ncovered tippers with cranes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about refuse\r\n\r\nvehicles  themselves  being  dirty,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health is not keeping its  own  house\r\n\r\nclean,  may I say that, as far as I know - I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol must admit it -nowadays the\r\n\r\nrefuse vehicles are much cleaner than they used  to\r\n\r\nbe.

And\r\n\r\nbecause of the compression, liquid comes out.  This\r\n\r\nis  unavoidable.

But  this\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  avoided,  and  whenever  such  open\r\n\r\nlorries   were   hired  to  carry  refuse,   strict\r\n\r\ninstructions  were given to cover the  refuse  with\r\n\r\ncanvas  so that no refuse could be blown off.

At  the  moment,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a firm of consulting engineers  who  are\r\n\r\ndoing  a  survey  to  ascertain the  most  suitable\r\n\r\nmethod   or  combination  of  methods  for   refuse\r\n\r\ndisposal in Singapore.

It  has\r\n\r\ntaken some time to do this survey, because this  is\r\n\r\nnot  a matter which we can treat in a light-hearted\r\n\r\nmanner,  as  all the factors have to be considered.\r\n\r\nIf  I  may inform the House, one incineration plant\r\n\r\nwhich  can  incinerate 1,000 tons of refuse  a  day\r\n\r\nwill cost something like $20 to $25 million.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need explain the alternative\r\n\r\nmethods of refuse disposal.

As  we\r\n\r\nall  know  and as we can see around a  new  market,\r\n\r\nthere  are  stalls selling cooked food.  Dirty  and\r\n\r\ntorn  tarpaulins  are  used as  roofing  for  these\r\n\r\nstalls  and  they are a very ugly sight, especially\r\n\r\nwhen they are in a new market. Therefore, I am glad\r\n\r\nto  note  that recently the Ministry of Health  has\r\n\r\ntaken   steps  to  put  up  new  hawker  sites   to\r\n\r\naccommodate these hawkers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the wash basins and other facilities provided\r\n\r\nshould be practical for the hawker sites. Otherwise\r\n\r\nthe  money  spent will be wasted. I  can  give  one\r\n\r\nexample,  Sir. In my constituency, in Taman  Jurong\r\n\r\nMarket  I,  the  shelters put up  for  cooked  food\r\n\r\nstalls  are  not large enough to cover the  hawkers\r\n\r\nfrom  the sun or the rain. It is as good as  having\r\n\r\nno  shelter. Because of this, the hawkers  have  to\r\n\r\nuse  their  own canvas and tarpaulins for  shelter.\r\n\r\nThe   wash   basins  provided  are   not   properly\r\n\r\nconstructed  and  inadequate for their  use.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, the hawkers do not make good use of them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about the water supply to the\r\n\r\ndressed poultry sellers. At present, the anti-waste\r\n\r\ntype  of  taps are provided. Whenever they want  to\r\n\r\nuse  water,  they have to press for it. They  would\r\n\r\nrather  have the ordinary taps which can be  turned\r\n\r\non  for  water when they pluck off the feathers  of\r\n\r\nthe  chickens  and ducks. I suggest  that  ordinary\r\n\r\ntaps  be constructed for them instead of anti-waste\r\n\r\ntaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite\r\n\r\nagree  with some of the remarks made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJurong  about the unsightly hawker stalls  and  the\r\n\r\nshelters which they erect. In fact, these  are  the\r\n\r\nstalls  which are situated in the concourse of  the\r\n\r\nmarket; they are not in the market itself.  As  far\r\n\r\nas  the  stalls in the market proper are concerned,\r\n\r\nthey  are  properly  sheltered  and  ventilated.  I\r\n\r\npresume the Member for Jurong is referring  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket  in  his  constituency. This is  the  market\r\n\r\nwhich  I myself visited last year during the  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore Clean and Pollution Free\" Campaign and  I\r\n\r\nknow  the problems that we face in this market.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  hawker  stalls  are  situated  in   the\r\n\r\nconcourse of the market. The concourse of a  market\r\n\r\nis  not  a place for hawker stalls. These makeshift\r\n\r\nmeasures were put up by the hawkers themselves  and\r\n\r\nthey   result   in   unsightly  and  unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nshelters. Under these difficult circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department of the Ministry  is  doing  its\r\n\r\nvery best to provide washing facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that, in view of all these experiences,\r\n\r\nthe  new markets which are built are of an improved\r\n\r\ndesign. If I may explain here, normally when  there\r\n\r\nis a market for market produce, we have a gathering\r\n\r\nof unauthorised hawkers who sell cooked food around\r\n\r\nthe  market. And these are the cooked food  hawkers\r\n\r\nwho  are  resettled in the concourse of the  market\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  built for such a purpose.  But  the\r\n\r\ndesign of the new markets is such that we build not\r\n\r\nonly  market for market produce but also a  section\r\n\r\nfor  cooked  food. And the cooked food  stalls  are\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  such a way that each stall has  its  own\r\n\r\nwashing area with drains leading into the sewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is \"guillotine\" time now, Mr\r\n\r\nChua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, owing to the\r\n\r\nshortage  of time, I have no choice but to withdraw\r\n\r\nmy amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 81 having expired, the\r\n\r\nfollowing amendments, standing in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nNg Kah Ting, were not proceeded with:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 705.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 804.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum $5,572,200 for Head 81 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 91 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nLow Guan Onn -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low is not here.

Since its inception, the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board has been providing  cheap  flats\r\n\r\nfor  our  people. It has achieved  a  lot  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.   In   recent  years   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board has introduced the Home Ownership\r\n\r\nScheme  to provide low-cost housing for the  poorer\r\n\r\npeople.  The  workers can now  make  use  of  their\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund money to make a down-payment\r\n\r\nfor the flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received quite a number of complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the high rentals charged by the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. The complaints come  especially\r\n\r\nfrom  people who are affected by the urban  renewal\r\n\r\nprojects  and who have to move to the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board flats which are  rented  out  at\r\n\r\nhigh rates. Ordinary shops are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrented  out  at  $300-$400 a month, whereas  coffee\r\n\r\nshops  and eating houses are rented out at  between\r\n\r\n$1,500 and $2,000 a month. These high rentals  will\r\n\r\nput  them in great difficulties. Therefore, I  have\r\n\r\ntwo  suggestions to make to the Minister and I hope\r\n\r\nhe  will  consider them. Their implementation  will\r\n\r\nremedy the situation to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the Minister consider the sale of shop\r\n\r\npremises  in the same way as the Government  is\r\n\r\nselling  Housing Board flats to people on  hire\r\n\r\npurchase? In this way, the Government need not ask\r\n\r\nfor loans.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government can thus use the proceeds of\r\n\r\nthe  sales  to  supplement further construction  of\r\n\r\nsuch  shop  premises so that they do  not  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease the rents. This will reduce the burden  of\r\n\r\nthe  renters of the shop premises. Very  often  the\r\n\r\ntraders  cannot cover the rental from the  proceeds\r\n\r\nof  their  trade.  I  hope the Minister  will  give\r\n\r\nconsideration to the two suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I\r\n\r\nintended  to  raise has already been raised  during\r\n\r\nthe  earlier  debate on the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard flats.

This  is with regard to  non-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  Member may be interested to know that, as  far\r\n\r\nas residential flats are concerned, one has to be a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of Singapore in order to qualify, but  for\r\n\r\nshops,  no question of citizenship arises. Citizens\r\n\r\nor  non-citizens affected or not affected by  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  can  tender  for Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats. This will raise some difficulty.  The\r\n\r\nmain  question is whether or not these people  want\r\n\r\nto  buy.

Those\r\n\r\naffected   by  clearance  are  given  concessionary\r\n\r\nrentals  based  on  the  average  tendered  rental,\r\n\r\nstarting  at  70  per cent of the average  tendered\r\n\r\nrental  for  the first year, 80 per  cent  for  the\r\n\r\nsecond  year, 90 per cent for the third  year,  and\r\n\r\nonly  in  the fourth year do they pay the full  one\r\n\r\nhundred  per cent. In other words, they  are  given\r\n\r\nnot  only  priority  of  allocation,  but  also   a\r\n\r\nconcession  on rentals, provided they are  affected\r\n\r\nby some Government clearance schemes. Of course, it\r\n\r\nis  admitted  that  many of  the  cases  are  rent-controlled   premises  and  whatever  concessionary\r\n\r\nrentals offered by the Government at present,  they\r\n\r\nare  still  higher than the rents  they  previously\r\n\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another method by which we are trying to\r\n\r\nhelp  our shopkeepers if they can get together  in\r\n\r\nsufficient  numbers to form a company  and  put  up\r\n\r\ntheir  own  building. The Member will be interested\r\n\r\nto know that the Government has already offered and\r\n\r\nconcluded  one  such transaction with  a  group  of\r\n\r\nshopkeepers affected in Precinct South III, in  the\r\n\r\narea  bounded by Upper Hokien Street, South  Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad, Upper Cross Street and New Bridge Road. These\r\n\r\nshopkeepers have formed themselves into  a  company\r\n\r\njointly  to redevelop a site offered by Government.\r\n\r\nPlans have already been submitted by this group for\r\n\r\nthe  site. This is one way to assist them where  we\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is a second case. Government\r\n\r\nis  also  working  out another  pilot  reallocation\r\n\r\nprogramme,  and  this is in respect of  shopkeepers\r\n\r\naffected  by resettlement around the area known  as\r\n\r\nPrecinct  North  III, bounded by  Victoria  Street,\r\n\r\nArab  Street,  North Bridge Road and Rochore  Road.\r\n\r\nThey are affected by urban renewal. We realise that\r\n\r\nsome shopkeepers have suffered as a result of being\r\n\r\nevicted from rent-controlled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremises   into   Housing  and  Development   Board\r\n\r\npremises,  where  even though we  give  them  these\r\n\r\nconcessions,  they  have to tender  in  competition\r\n\r\nwith  others.  One way is to allow  them  to  build\r\n\r\ntheir  own  premises and we are doing so.  We  have\r\n\r\nconcluded  a deal with one such group.

He was hauled up by  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board official  concerned\r\n\r\nand  was  told, \"Look, you must not do this because\r\n\r\nyour  licence  does  not permit  it.\"  I  tried  to\r\n\r\nintervene  and  said,  \"Look,  why  cannot  you  be\r\n\r\nflexible  about  the  whole  thing?\"  The  official\r\n\r\nreplied, \"Well, this has got to go through such and\r\n\r\nsuch  a  committee and they will probably  turn  it\r\n\r\ndown.

There is a  committee  to\r\n\r\nconsider applications of this nature, but it  would\r\n\r\nbe, in my view, a little oppressive on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board, if  a  man  is\r\n\r\nhaving difficulties with his business and wants  to\r\n\r\nstart  a  side line, to say, \"You cannot do  this.\"\r\n\r\nThe Board can strictly do so under the terms of the\r\n\r\ntenancy  where they tie him up and say,  \"You  will\r\n\r\nonly  use  the  shop  for repairing  watches.\"  The\r\n\r\nmoment  he  branches  into  something  else,   they\r\n\r\nenforce the tenancy agreement and throw him out for\r\n\r\nbreach of some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms.

The explanatory note  in\r\n\r\nthe  memorandum (para. 84 at page 12)  is  somewhat\r\n\r\nunclear where it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A sum of $96.00 million will be provided for the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Singapore.  In   1968,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  approved  two  lines   of   credit\r\n\r\ntotalling  $80.00  million;  however  in  May   and\r\n\r\nDecember 1970, further lines of credit amounting to\r\n\r\n$374.00 million were approved.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Among  other  enterprises, we have  Neptune  Orient\r\n\r\nLines  Ltd, and Jurong Shipbuilders and  the  rest\r\n\r\ncoming  within  the scope of this provision.

He is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  the  information  given   in   the\r\n\r\nmemorandum  is,  of course, merely a  summary.  The\r\n\r\nsums  which  have been provided are in  respect  of\r\n\r\nprojects  which will be examined by the Development\r\n\r\nBank   of   Singapore.  The  position   about   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank  of Singapore is  that  sums  are\r\n\r\nprovided for the Bank, out of which they make loans\r\n\r\nto private industry. The lines of credit which have\r\n\r\nbeen mentioned in the memorandum have been provided\r\n\r\npartly  for  loans to industrial organisations  and\r\n\r\npartly  for real estate financing, and the  various\r\n\r\nlines have different interest rates, depending upon\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  financing. In the case  of  estate\r\n\r\nfinancing,  the interest rate charged is different.\r\n\r\nIt  is  eight per cent as against other lines which\r\n\r\nvary  from  five per cent for special  projects  to\r\n\r\nseven  per cent. The drawings will depend upon  the\r\n\r\nrate  at  which  the  loans  are  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment    Bank   of   Singapore    and    when\r\n\r\ndisbursements  are  required, so  that  the  amount\r\n\r\nwhich is provided here depends really on the amount\r\n\r\nwhich  is  likely to be disbursed. For example,  in\r\n\r\n1970-71 the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount which was disbursed by the Development  Bank\r\n\r\nof Singapore was $61 million, so that, allowing for\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in activity which we expect  as  the\r\n\r\nprojects get larger in size and scope, we  think  a\r\n\r\nprovision of $96 million may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Neptune Orient Lines, the\r\n\r\nprovision  has  been  made  in  order  that   their\r\n\r\nexpansion programme can be carried out.

This  is  merely a down-payment.  The\r\n\r\nintention is that this would be a joint venture.\r\n\r\nThe  ships themselves would cost a total of $30\r\n\r\nmillion each, and each party to the joint venture\r\n\r\nwould have to put up 7\u00bd per cent as down-payment,\r\n\r\ni.e., $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) An 85,000-deadweight-ton tanker, again in a\r\n\r\njoint venture. The ship will cost $20 million, and\r\n\r\nthe down-payment from the Singapore side will be $3\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Neptune Orient Lines will also purchase one\r\n\r\n18,000-dead-weight-ton ship for $1.5 million down-payment, out of a total cost of $10.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A further purchase is a super-tanker of\r\n\r\n220,000   deadweight   tons,   costing    $100\r\n\r\nmillion.  This is again a joint  venture,  and\r\n\r\nthe  down-payment from the Singapore side will\r\n\r\nbe 7.5 per cent or $7.5 million.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) A further purchase is a 35,000-deadweight-ton tanker for $20 million.

The total cost of the\r\n\r\nships will be $21 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All this makes a total of $67.9 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Shipbuilders, a loan of\r\n\r\n$20,795,500 is required. The loan consists of  four\r\n\r\nparts.  There  is  a loan for the  construction  of\r\n\r\nshipyard facilities, $21.45 million. This is mainly\r\n\r\nfor  the purchase of materials for the construction\r\n\r\nof  shipyard facilities. Of this sum, $14.3 million\r\n\r\nwill  come  from the Japanese grant of $25  million\r\n\r\nfor financing part of this loan, which is repayable\r\n\r\nin  24  half-yearly equal instalments over a period\r\n\r\nof  12  years at an interest rate of four per cent.\r\n\r\nThe interest rate will increase to 63 per cent from\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan for the purchase of imported materials,\r\n\r\nequipment and supplies for building vessels will be\r\n\r\n$25  million. Out of this, $21.7 million will  come\r\n\r\nfrom the Exim Bank of Japan, and the total loan  of\r\n\r\n$25   million   is  repayable  in  20   half-yearly\r\n\r\ninstalments over a period of 10 years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a loan for the deferred portion of\r\n\r\nthe selling price of each vessel.

Am  I  correct  in\r\n\r\nassuming  that  if  I submit a  question  for  oral\r\n\r\nanswer on the same basis as I put it to him earlier\r\n\r\non, I will not get an answer in this House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  I  am  not  responsible for  the  day-to-day\r\n\r\noperations  of  the Development Bank of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  will  not  be  able  to  answer  the\r\n\r\nquestion.  I  would suggest that these are  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  the shareholders can place before the  Board\r\n\r\nof  Directors at the annual general meeting of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now answer the other question on Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient  Lines. This is a question of accounting  -\r\n\r\nhow much depreciation is allowed for Neptune Orient\r\n\r\nLines,  that  is,  whether  the  ships  should   be\r\n\r\ndepreciated  over  a period of 15,  17,  20  or  25\r\n\r\nyears.  The accounts of a shipping line are  rather\r\n\r\ncomplex,  but  very interesting.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nshipping  lines  in the United Kingdom,  apparently\r\n\r\nthey  can  depreciate the ships to any extent  they\r\n\r\nplease, in  the case of Neptune Orient  Lines,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a choice of whether we should depreciate  the\r\n\r\nships  over 15, 17, 20 or 25 years. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nquestion whether or not we make a profit depends on\r\n\r\nthe amount of depreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> On commercial lines and\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> As I have said, it varies very\r\n\r\nconsiderably. Some shipping lines do  not  consider\r\n\r\ndepreciation necessary because the ships are  going\r\n\r\nup in value all the time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the accounts of Neptune Orient Lines\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  we  show a slight  loss.  That  is\r\n\r\nbecause the depreciation, if I am correct,  is  for\r\n\r\n17   years,   which   is  very  conservative.   The\r\n\r\ndepreciation  is  for either 15  or  17  years.  We\r\n\r\nthought it better that we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  a  conservative  view  of  this  matter   and\r\n\r\ndepreciate the ships as rapidly as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Jurong Bird Park, we have\r\n\r\nappointed a company with a board of directors.  The\r\n\r\nsuggestion  for  lower fees can be put  before  the\r\n\r\nboard   of  directors,  who  of  course,   may   be\r\n\r\nGovernment's nominees. However, they  have  also  a\r\n\r\nduty  to  see that any company in which  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  appointed as directors should  operate  on  a\r\n\r\nviable basis. I am happy to say that up to now, the\r\n\r\nattendance  at the Jurong Bird Park has  been  very\r\n\r\ngood  and  we  should be able to cover  all  costs,\r\n\r\nincluding  depreciation, if  we  continue  to  have\r\n\r\nvisitors at the same rate as we are having now.  At\r\n\r\nthis  particular stage the present fees  should  be\r\n\r\nmaintained because they seem to be popular  enough.\r\n\r\nThey  are apparently a going rate and satisfy  most\r\n\r\npeople,  because the attendance has not fallen  off\r\n\r\nvery  considerably. There are concession rates  for\r\n\r\nschool children. I would suggest a group concession\r\n\r\nrate  for those people who would like to visit  the\r\n\r\nBird Park but who find the normal fees too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  seek  further elaboration  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance on the projects of  Chartered\r\n\r\nIndustries of Singapore Limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Member's question is, what\r\n\r\nexactly   is  Chartered  Industries  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nLimited  doing?

In  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, the Public Utilities Board would  be\r\n\r\nregarded as an industrial enterprise. Assuming only\r\n\r\nindustrial enterprises, I think the Government  is\r\n\r\nparticipating in some 30 enterprises and in  a  few\r\n\r\nothers  which  are  related to tourism,  e.g.,  the\r\n\r\nInstant  Asia  Cultural Show (Private)  Limited  in\r\n\r\nwhich we also participate in order to help tourism.\r\n\r\nThirty  enterprises  may be considered  industrial,\r\n\r\nand  the total amount of Government equity involved\r\n\r\nin  all  these  enterprises is  approximately  $121\r\n\r\nmillion. The equity varies in amount from $2, where\r\n\r\nwe just form a company and two shares are issued to\r\n\r\nthe   two  subscribing  members,  to  roughly   $49\r\n\r\nmillion.  In percentage terms, we have anything  up\r\n\r\nto 100 per cent participation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of most of these industries has\r\n\r\nso  far  been satisfactory. Some of them  are  very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory   and  there  are  others   which   we\r\n\r\ndesignate \"sick companies\" and we keep a watch over\r\n\r\nthem.  There has been only one failure and  mention\r\n\r\nhas  been made about this in previous debates. This\r\n\r\nis  a  failure as far as the project is  concerned,\r\n\r\nbut  it  was  not  a total loss  and  we  sold  the\r\n\r\nGovernment share in the enterprise. This is related\r\n\r\nto   a  bicycle  factory  which  is  no  longer  in\r\n\r\nproduction  and  which has been converted  to  some\r\n\r\nother   very  good  use  in  which  the   tool-room\r\n\r\nfacilities were a major reason for the entrepreneur\r\n\r\ntaking over the enterprise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On plans to help local industries, I think we\r\n\r\nhave  various organisations of which the Member  is\r\n\r\nalready aware.

The   National\r\n\r\nProductivity Centre is one which helps  in  various\r\n\r\nmanagement  fields. Of course,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nalso  associated with the Institute  of  Management\r\n\r\nand  the  Universities in their  efforts  to  teach\r\n\r\nmanagement   techniques. As   far   as   providing\r\n\r\nmanagement  techniques is concerned, we  have  also\r\n\r\nthe efforts of organisations like the International\r\n\r\nExecutive  Service  Corps and  the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nOrganisation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping industries with marketing, we have the\r\n\r\nExports Promotion Centre. There is also the  Export\r\n\r\nPromotion  Advisory Committee.  There  is  INTRAXCO\r\n\r\n(International Trading Company) which  does  actual\r\n\r\nexport  promotion work. And there are,  of  course,\r\n\r\nGovernment  organisations like the  Trade  Division\r\n\r\nand  our  overseas  embassies and high  commissions\r\n\r\nwhich play advisory roles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers' associations and the Chambers of\r\n\r\nCommerce also help in preparations for trade fairs.\r\n\r\nI think the Member for Whampoa is familiar with the\r\n\r\n\"Jetro Fair\" in Japan to which he will be leading a\r\n\r\nmission in April.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question the Member asked was whether we\r\n\r\nshould  not sell off some of the equity to  private\r\n\r\nholders.  This is something which we will consider.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, in certain cases we have already done so.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in the case of Jurong  Shipyard,  we\r\n\r\nthought  that in order to bring in local  expertise\r\n\r\nin  addition  to  what  we already  have  from  the\r\n\r\nJapanese partner, we would sell some of the  equity\r\n\r\nto  various local entrepreneurs who would also take\r\n\r\npart  in the management or in the direction of  the\r\n\r\nfirm,  so that although we started off with 49  per\r\n\r\ncent,  I  believe our percentage holding of  Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard is now 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases where the companies have gone\r\n\r\npublic,  like  the National Iron and  Steel  Mills,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason why we cannot sell our  shares\r\n\r\nvery  readily. But in this instance the shares  are\r\n\r\nalready mostly in private hands. In other companies\r\n\r\nlike  Keppel Shipyard and Sembawang Shipyard, there\r\n\r\nmay  be some difficulties. For example, in the case\r\n\r\nof  Sembawang Shipyard, we have undertaken  certain\r\n\r\nobligations  in respect of repairs of  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nnaval vessels.

I believe there is  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of manpower at Paya Lebar Police Station.\r\n\r\nVery often petty thefts and robberies are committed\r\n\r\nalong roads like Punggol Road and Tampines Road. It\r\n\r\nis  the shortage of manpower and lack of facilities\r\n\r\nat Paya Lebar Police Station that brings about such\r\n\r\nproblems.  In this respect, I shall be grateful  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs can indicate to this\r\n\r\nHouse whether there are plans for the expansion  of\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  Police Station, or whether  there  are\r\n\r\nplans  for  the  construction of a  new  divisional\r\n\r\npolice headquarters to be sited in any of the eight\r\n\r\nconstituencies. I do not say that it should  be  in\r\n\r\nPunggol, but I did ask a question previously  about\r\n\r\nthe setting up of a police post in Punggol, and  it\r\n\r\nwas  agreed to by the Minister of State of  Defence\r\n\r\nwhen the Police was under the Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Police comes under the portfolio of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs, I shall be grateful\r\n\r\nif  the  Minister  can indicate whether  or  not  a\r\n\r\npolice  post will be set up in Punggol.

In  fact,\r\n\r\nwhen  I  assumed office, this was one of the  first\r\n\r\npolice  stations I personally visited. One  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  things  I  did when I was in  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nafter my visit to this police station, was to  look\r\n\r\ninto the question of renovating it. It has come  to\r\n\r\nlight that the cost of renovation is quite high. At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, I think it would be far better to look\r\n\r\ninto  the  need  of  having a new  police  station,\r\n\r\nproperly  sited, to take care of the  fairly  large\r\n\r\narea    covered    by   this   divisional    police\r\n\r\nheadquarters. I believe it requires,  at  the  very\r\n\r\nleast,  $150,000 just to renovate the place.  If  a\r\n\r\nnew police station is to be built, the cost can  be\r\n\r\nanything  from $150,000 to half a million  dollars.\r\n\r\nSo it is far better to have a new police station.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware that some barracks have been\r\n\r\nconverted  into offices, and I myself have  visited\r\n\r\nthese offices. I think they are inadequate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of manpower is one of the problems\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  is  taking very seriously.  We  have\r\n\r\nconsidered the pros and cons of whether to continue\r\n\r\nwith the present system of police patrol, which  is\r\n\r\nhighly labour intensive, or whether to adopt a more\r\n\r\nmodern  method  of police patrol, which  cuts  down\r\n\r\nmanpower   but  uses  a  high  degree   of   police\r\n\r\ntechnology in the form of more vehicles and  better\r\n\r\nradio  equipment. As I have publicly stated earlier\r\n\r\nthis year, we are going to equip two divisions this\r\n\r\nyear,  and  try out whether this is more economical\r\n\r\nand,   from  the  long-term  point  of  view,  more\r\n\r\neffective.  I  will  go down to Paya  Lebar  Police\r\n\r\nStation  again some time this year,  and  view  the\r\n\r\nwhole  area  in  relation to  this  new  system  of\r\n\r\npolicing. This time, for some very good reasons,  I\r\n\r\nwill  bring  along with me all the  M.P.s  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in that area. I am not quite sure a police\r\n\r\npost  is the answer to the problem, for the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that with this new method of policing,  the\r\n\r\npolice force will have greater mobility. There will\r\n\r\nalso  be greater frequency of patrols. I have  been\r\n\r\nto another rural area, that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Rural West Division, where there is  a  police\r\n\r\npost  and  we put a man there.

Although  my  predecessor,   the\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence, agreed to set up a police post\r\n\r\nin  Punggol, I am not aware of it. I do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  provision  has been made for  such  a  police\r\n\r\npost.  I  will  certainly look into  the  question,\r\n\r\nbearing   in  mind  the  larger  problem  of   more\r\n\r\nefficient use of police manpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Before I withdraw my amendment,\r\n\r\ncan  the Minister for Home Affairs indicate in  the\r\n\r\naffirmative   that   a   new   divisional    police\r\n\r\nheadquarters will come about to serve \"F\" Division,\r\n\r\nwhich  covers the constituencies of Sembawang,  Nee\r\n\r\nSoon,   Jalan   Kayu,  Serangoon   Gardens,   Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon, Punggol, Paya Lebar and certain parts of\r\n\r\nTampines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can\r\n\r\ncertainly assure the Member that \"F\" Division has a\r\n\r\nhigh  degree  of priority, but in relation  to  the\r\n\r\ncompeting  needs  of the other police  stations,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  give an affirmative answer. At the  moment,\r\n\r\nwe  are  trying to work out a rational formula  for\r\n\r\nthe  sizes of the police divisions. How many police\r\n\r\ndivisions  are  we going to need in  future?  Until\r\n\r\nthat  question is clearly settled, I cannot give  a\r\n\r\ndefinite  answer. If I were rash enough to  promise\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol, I would not be honest with\r\n\r\nhim  or with myself, because this is a very complex\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On that note, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs and  I  beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,419,810 for Head 101 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining heads of expenditure\r\n\r\nin respect of which no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment stands on the Order Paper Supplement are\r\n\r\nHeads 76, 77, 92 and 141.
