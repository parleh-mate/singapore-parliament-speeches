When  we  formed  the Government,  one  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that faced us was that we  inherited  a\r\n\r\ncivil  service which, by and large, was incapable  of\r\n\r\nmaking  political judgment. Our local civil  service,\r\n\r\nthough  technically competent, had always been  under\r\n\r\nthe   illusion  that  because  they  should  be  non-\r\n\r\npolitical  in character they must avoid all  interest\r\n\r\nin  political  affairs to the extent  of  even  being\r\n\r\nignorant  of  political  issues.  For  instance,  the\r\n\r\nopinion  has  always been expressed  that,  as  civil\r\n\r\nservants,   they  must  not  indulge  or  dabble   in\r\n\r\npolitics,  as  if politics is a kind of parlour  game\r\n\r\nintended  for the amusement or diversion  of  people.\r\n\r\nThe  way  we look at it is that political affairs  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  parlour game. On the contrary, it  may  be  a\r\n\r\nmatter of life and death whether or not we can  build\r\n\r\nup  a  democratic  system of sufficient  strength  to\r\n\r\nwithstand the stresses that our country has to  meet.\r\n\r\nThis  is not such a simple matter as some Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition may think. It is not sufficient  just\r\n\r\nto say that the civil servants are there to carry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  the policies and instructions of Ministers. When\r\n\r\nthey carry out policies, they necessarily must have a\r\n\r\nwide  sphere  of discretion. It is not  possible  for\r\n\r\nMinisters to give directives in detail to enable  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servant  to meet any possible eventuality.  If\r\n\r\nthe  role of the civil service were just to carry out\r\n\r\ninstructions  in a mechanical way,  that  is,  to  be\r\n\r\nguided purely by the letter of the General Orders  or\r\n\r\nby  such  circulars and directives as may be  issued,\r\n\r\nyou can be sure that the Government would not be able\r\n\r\nto  make  any  impact upon the people. This  lack  of\r\n\r\nexperience or lack of involvement or lack of thinking\r\n\r\non the part of the civil servants on political issues\r\n\r\nhas been detrimental to themselves, because they have\r\n\r\nnot  been  able  to see how they have been  separated\r\n\r\nfrom  the masses, why that is a bad thing and why  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary for them to know what the masses  think\r\n\r\nabout political affairs, their hopes and aspirations,\r\n\r\nso  that  the execution of Government policy  can  be\r\n\r\nmade more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the school principals, it is obvious,\r\n\r\nSir,  that they have a vital role to perform  in  the\r\n\r\ntask of nation-building. They are the key persons who\r\n\r\nwill  mould  the form and content of the thinking  of\r\n\r\nthe  younger generation. And like the civil servants,\r\n\r\nthe  school principals have not given any thought  to\r\n\r\nthe  political issues of the day, nor have they  made\r\n\r\nany   effort  to  understand  the  general  political\r\n\r\nbackground not only, in respect of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya but also the general resurgence\r\n\r\nof  nationalism in Asia in the post-war years.  These\r\n\r\nare  matters  they must appreciate,  and  it  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of the Political Study Centre to run courses\r\n\r\nof   instruction  for  these  groups  of   Government\r\n\r\nemployees.  As I have said, the effect  on  them  has\r\n\r\nbeen very marked and immediate. I myself have gone to\r\n\r\nthe  Political Study Centre after sessions  and  held\r\n\r\ninformal  discussions with civil servants and  school\r\n\r\nprincipals on what they thought of these courses; and\r\n\r\napart  from  a  few diehards who cannot  understand\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is  all about or who cannot appreciate  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for re-thinking of the basic  issues,  the\r\n\r\ngeneral effect has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen, one might almost say, the reconversion to a new\r\n\r\npoint  of view of which they were completely  unaware\r\n\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I entirely\r\n\r\nagree with the Minister that civil servants who  have\r\n\r\nto  carry  out instructions cannot do so  effectively\r\n\r\nunless they know the background to these instructions\r\n\r\nand  the  policies on which they are based.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister a question in  connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  studies and courses held in the  Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre.  I  agree that the students  attending\r\n\r\nthese courses have become more knowledgeable men, but\r\n\r\nwould  the  Minister  state  categorically  that  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  they  have  gained  have  made  them  more\r\n\r\nefficient civil servants, and that the civil  service\r\n\r\nhas become a more efficient service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would say without a doubt that\r\n\r\nthe  answer is yes for this reason, quite apart  from\r\n\r\nthe content of the political instructions. The senior\r\n\r\nofficers who went through these courses - many of  them\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  time - understand now  why  Government\r\n\r\npolicy is what it is, and they are therefore able  to\r\n\r\nexercise  their  own  initiative  in  promoting   our\r\n\r\npolicies  instead  of  being jogged  along  by  their\r\n\r\nMinisters.  But I would be the last person  to  claim\r\n\r\nthat what we have done is all that is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Political Study Centre has run courses for\r\n\r\nall Divisions I and II officers and a large number of\r\n\r\nschool  principals,  we will in  the  next  stage  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  other remaining principals  of  English\r\n\r\nschools and part of the Chinese school principals. We\r\n\r\nalso  intend  to  run  more  advanced  courses   for\r\n\r\nselected officers in Division I. As I have said, this\r\n\r\nis  a  continuing process, and I would say  that  the\r\n\r\nresults  we have achieved have justified our  efforts\r\n\r\nin starting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  speak on the content of the courses that are  made\r\n\r\navailable at the Political Study Centre? While\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreeing with the Minister for Finance that it  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  thing  for our civil servants to know  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on  around  them, not only  in  Singapore  but\r\n\r\nthroughout the world, particularly in South-east Asia\r\n\r\nand  Asia,  and  that  it is  good  to  educate  them\r\n\r\npolitically,  the  question  that  arises  is   this:\r\n\r\nwhether the P.A.P. in power, while seeking to educate\r\n\r\nthem,  should itself, in the course of that political\r\n\r\neducation, seek to gain an advantage. If the Party in\r\n\r\npower  while politically educating the civil servants\r\n\r\ndoes  not  itself seek an advantage,  I  can  see  no\r\n\r\nobjection to that. But I understand that some of  the\r\n\r\nlecturers,  tutors or whoever they  may  be,  perhaps\r\n\r\nwithout  the knowledge of the Minister,  do  adopt  a\r\n\r\nline which quite blatantly praises the Party in power\r\n\r\nand  quite  openly  runs  down  the  other  political\r\n\r\nParties  in  Singapore. I wonder if the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance knows this. If he knows this and he disagrees\r\n\r\nwith  it, will he stop it and give the Opposition  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  this  will not  continue  to  occur?\r\n\r\nPolitical  education  is a  good  thing,  but  to  so\r\n\r\neducate the civil servants as to make them think that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  the  only  Party  worth  supporting,\r\n\r\nwhether  that  is a thing to be done  out  of  public\r\n\r\nfunds is yet another matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, which I indicated to you could\r\n\r\nconveniently  be dealt with this, is sub-head  63  on\r\n\r\npage  273  of  the Estimates. Could the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance tell the House what exactly would the Service\r\n\r\nManual contain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As regards the statement that we\r\n\r\nmight  be  taking party political advantage  of  this\r\n\r\ninstitution,  I can assure the Member  that  that  is\r\n\r\nvery  far  from  our intention. In fact,  if  we  had\r\n\r\nattempted  to make it, shall we say, an  arm  of  the\r\n\r\nParty,  then  we would not have achieved the  success\r\n\r\nthat  we  did. Surely the civil servants  could  have\r\n\r\nseen through this. It could be, mind you, that in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  discussing  the  particular  issues  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Government might have been  examined,\r\n\r\nand it might have been demonstrated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  convincingly to the students that that was  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  and  only policy that could be followed.  In\r\n\r\nthat  instance,  I would say that the lecturers  were\r\n\r\nexplaining the policy of the Government, as  distinct\r\n\r\nfrom praising the excellence of the Party leadership.\r\n\r\nI know there is a subtle difference, but nevertheless\r\n\r\nit  is there. As for running down the Opposition,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park could give me details  as\r\n\r\nto  when that happened and who did it, I will  assure\r\n\r\nhim that steps will be taken to stop it. But I rather\r\n\r\nsuspect  that the Member for Farrer Park  was  either\r\n\r\nspeaking  with  his tongue in his cheek,  or  he  was\r\n\r\nbadly misinformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, that is, the Manual, it is\r\n\r\nnothing   more  than  a  booklet  setting   out   the\r\n\r\nattractions  of  a career in the Civil  Service.  The\r\n\r\nprevious Government published one in, I think,  1956.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now out of date. We are revising this Manual,\r\n\r\nso  that  copies of it can be distributed to schools,\r\n\r\ncolleges,  and so on-places where we want to  recruit\r\n\r\ncivil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, while I entirely agree with the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance that the line is very difficult\r\n\r\nto  draw,  he will also agree with me that there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  instances where one cannot  but  help  think\r\n\r\nthat  that line is being taken. There could be  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  a  line  is difficult to draw. Yet  there  are\r\n\r\nother  instances where one knows quite  well  that  a\r\n\r\ncertain  line  is being taken, not to  put  across  a\r\n\r\ntheory  to the students, but merely to run down  some\r\n\r\nprevious  Minister or ex-Minister, or something  like\r\n\r\nthat. If, in the course of putting across a theory, a\r\n\r\ndiscussion  entailed the merits of a policy  followed\r\n\r\nby  a  former  Chief Minister and the  present  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  that  is all right. But  where  gratuitous\r\n\r\ninsults   are  hurled  at  ex-Ministers  or  ex-Chief\r\n\r\nMinisters, then I think that is going a bit too far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not raising this with my\r\n\r\ntongue  in  my  cheek, but I have  had  it  seriously\r\n\r\nmentioned  to  me  that this was  going  on.

Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am one of the many Ministers  who  go\r\n\r\nto  the Political Study Centre to give lectures,  and\r\n\r\nto  be  lectured to. It is quite true  that,  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge, we drew up the courses and we took great  care\r\n\r\nto  see that they were not primarily intended to  put\r\n\r\nforward  a party point of view, because that  would\r\n\r\nhave  destroyed  the  purpose  of  the  courses.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  last Wednesday. I think, I had to go  there\r\n\r\nand one of the questions often asked was: \"Is it true\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. is anti-English educated?\" In  reply\r\n\r\nto  a  question like that, I asked, \"Why do  you  say\r\n\r\nso?\"  Then  they  quoted  speeches  made  by  certain\r\n\r\npolitical Parties. Naturally when we replied to  such\r\n\r\nthing  we said that that was a very stupid statement.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know  whether that is  taken  as  putting\r\n\r\nforward   propaganda  detrimental  to  a   particular\r\n\r\npolitical  Party. Very often we were  asked,  \"Is  it\r\n\r\ntrue  that the P.A.P. is run by Communists?\"  And  we\r\n\r\nreplied. \"Who said so?\", and certain Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition were quoted. And we said that that  was  a\r\n\r\nvery  stupid remark, in that sense, it could be.  But\r\n\r\nby and large the purpose of these courses, apart from\r\n\r\nimparting  instruction in political theories  and  so\r\n\r\non,  is  to provide the Ministers with an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  get ordinary members of the civil servants to  be\r\n\r\ncritical.  Very  often  they  are  very  critical  of\r\n\r\nGovernment policy. They ask questions like  \"Why  was\r\n\r\nit  done  this  way?\" or they say that they  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  a particular policy, and we try to explain  why\r\n\r\nwe do these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings. To that extent, I think these courses serve a\r\n\r\nbroader   purpose  apart  from  imparting   political\r\n\r\nknowledge - they give civil servants an opportunity to\r\n\r\ndiscuss things with their Ministers; not only  people\r\n\r\nat  higher  levels but in the intermediate levels  as\r\n\r\nwell.  Therefore, they would then feel that they  are\r\n\r\nnot  just  dummies carrying out instructions  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   They  feel  they  have   a   sense   of\r\n\r\nparticipation; that their advice is listened to,  and\r\n\r\nin  a  number  of  cases they have put  forward  very\r\n\r\nfruitful  suggestions  about how  political  problems\r\n\r\nshould  be  approached, and so on.  To  that  extent,\r\n\r\nthese courses are of mutual advantage not only to the\r\n\r\npeople  who  go  there  but  also  to  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I saw the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture speaking there, I seemed to  see\r\n\r\nthe  face of Professor Enright! Why I bring it up  is\r\n\r\nthis:  this is the Political Study Centre  to  inject\r\n\r\npolitical  thought  into  the  civil  servants.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment says that such political activities cannot\r\n\r\nbe  indulged in by aliens.

As  and  when particular  departments  want\r\n\r\nthese materials, be it the Sewerage Department or the\r\n\r\nCity  Transport Centre, these materials are  supplied\r\n\r\nby  the  City Engineer and the vote of the department\r\n\r\nusing these materials is debited. In the case of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  of course, it is different,  because  it\r\n\r\nworks on a cash basis. The whole of the costs of  any\r\n\r\npurchases  would be debited against the vote  of  the\r\n\r\nbuying department. The reason why we have decided  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  this Advance Account is that  a  change  of\r\n\r\nprocedure  in the book-keeping involved  would  be  a\r\n\r\nfairly formidable undertaking, and this is one of the\r\n\r\ncompromises referred to in my speech and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  memorandum whereby the accounting procedures\r\n\r\nof  the  City Council have been maintained, at  least\r\n\r\nfor  this  year.

In 1954, the Organisations  and\r\n\r\nMethods   consultants  employed  by  the   Government\r\n\r\nrecommended  a change in the staffing of the  Customs\r\n\r\nDepartment.  They  thought  that  it  would   be   an\r\n\r\nadvantage to the efficiency of revenue collection  if\r\n\r\nrevenue  officers  were replaced by customs  officers\r\n\r\nwith  higher  qualifications at  the  rate  of  three\r\n\r\nrevenue  officers for one customs officer.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  going on for some time. Eventually it is  aimed\r\n\r\nto  reach a total strength of 304 revenue officers so\r\n\r\nthat  105  revenue officers will be  replaced  by  34\r\n\r\ncustoms  officers. The strength,  at  that  time,  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  officers  was  more than  400.  The  present\r\n\r\nstrength is 325 as a result of the abolition of these\r\n\r\nposts,  which  is  taking  place  gradually  as   the\r\n\r\nincumbents   retire,   or  are   promoted,   or   are\r\n\r\ntransferred,  or  resign  or  die.

To this end, the Property  Tax  Bill\r\n\r\nhas  been  introduced and the property  tax  will  be\r\n\r\nadministered  by  a  branch  of  the  Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment.

The Deputy Commissioner will\r\n\r\nhave  a Chief Assessor and six Assessors to help  him\r\n\r\non the technical side. The setup of this organisation\r\n\r\nis  based  on the recommendations made by a  team  of\r\n\r\nexperts on local government sent to Singapore by  the\r\n\r\nCanadian Government, and takes into account the acute\r\n\r\nshortage of valuers and assessors in Singapore today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am still not\r\n\r\nclear about the duties to be discharged by these  two\r\n\r\npersons.

In the Income Tax, Estate and Stamp  Duties\r\n\r\nBranch,   he   will  continue  to   have   a   Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner who will be in charge of the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOffice  and an Assistant Commissioner to be in charge\r\n\r\nof both the Estate Duty and the Stamp Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other Valuation Branch, there should also be\r\n\r\na   Deputy  Commissioner,  Grade  G.  This  grade  is\r\n\r\nsuggested  so  that  there would  be  parity  in  the\r\n\r\ndeputyship  of the two branches. The duties  of  this\r\n\r\npost  have been carefully considered by the Committee\r\n\r\nand it is considered that his requirements should  be\r\n\r\nadministrative ability and experience since he  would\r\n\r\nbe  assisted in technical matters by both  the  Chief\r\n\r\nValuer  and the Chief Assessor. While it is desirable\r\n\r\nthat  he  should  have  some  knowledge  relating  to\r\n\r\nvaluation and assessment, it is however thought  that\r\n\r\nit  would  not  be necessary to have a professionally\r\n\r\nqualified  man for this purpose. It is considered  by\r\n\r\nthe Committee that both the posts of Chief Valuer and\r\n\r\nChief  Assessor should be on the upper time-scale  so\r\n\r\nas to be in line with their counterparts in the other\r\n\r\nbranch. These posts are technical posts and require a\r\n\r\nhigh standard of qualification and experience and  on\r\n\r\nthat  account  there  are difficulties  envisaged  as\r\n\r\nthese   officers  fetch  a  special  price   in   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances   existing  in  Singapore.

Mr Speaker,  I  intended  no\r\n\r\ninsult or disrespect to these two officers In fact, I\r\n\r\nmade  it quite clear that in their field in Singapore\r\n\r\nthere were none better.

The  only question  I  raised  was\r\n\r\nwhether  they could be of any particular use  to  the\r\n\r\nparticular  Ministries to which they  were  going;  I\r\n\r\nasked  the  Deputy Prime Minister those questions  to\r\n\r\nwhich I thought, Sir, I got no satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  far  as  these  two gentlemen are  concerned,  no\r\n\r\ndisrespect to them was intended by me.

Through   his\r\n\r\nassociation in the Ministry, I could see that he  had\r\n\r\npicked up quite a lot of the work, and he made a very\r\n\r\nintelligent  contribution to the discussions.  So  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  follow  that, because a  man  is  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist  and  because he has not had the  advantages\r\n\r\nthat Mr A. P.

It\r\n\r\nis  a memorandum sent to the workers' organisation to\r\n\r\nseek  their  views. The Minister for Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\nhad,  at  that  time, a Political Secretary  who  is,\r\n\r\nshall  we say, a senior trade unionist. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask him whether this senior trade unionist,  this\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary of his, had been  consulted,  or\r\n\r\nwhether his Ministry had been consulted, before  such\r\n\r\na  memorandum was sent out to the T.U.C.

The stand taken by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour and Law in regard  to  this\r\n\r\nparticular appointment is totally not the same as the\r\n\r\nstand taken by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is completely\r\n\r\nuntrue.

On the\r\n\r\nother  question  as to why it was necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nexchange  of letters between the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.,  it  must  be  remembered  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\npermanent secretariat of the T.U.C., and there are  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  unions associated with the T.U.C. Government\r\n\r\nfound  it  necessary to bring this subject  of  wages\r\n\r\ninto the open, and the only way we could do it was by\r\n\r\nan   exchange   of  letters  between  the   permanent\r\n\r\nsecretariat  and the Government. There  are  so  many\r\n\r\nunions  which  are involved, and the  T.U.C. has  to\r\n\r\nconsult the views of these unions.

That  can\r\n\r\nalways  be  done. It a post is shown in the Estimates\r\n\r\nunder  personal emoluments, it is always  permissible\r\n\r\nfor  a  person to be recruited against that provision\r\n\r\nin a temporary capacity before the appointment is put\r\n\r\nto  the Public Service Commission.

To have a  Political  Secretary\r\n\r\nand  an Industrial Relations Officer is just spending\r\n\r\npublic  funds  without getting  value  for  money.  A\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary should, of course,  be  able  to\r\n\r\nadvise the Minister on industrial relations. There is\r\n\r\nno  need to create an appointment to do a job  which\r\n\r\nshould be done by the Political Secretary, unless, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  Minister now feels  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nchance  or  desire on his part to fill  the  post  of\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that the\r\n\r\nwork  of an Industrial Liaison Officer would be in  a\r\n\r\nmore   limited  field  than  that  of   a   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary.  He would actually be required  to  assist\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  in  the  work of conciliation  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.

An\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Officer  is  not  a  statutory\r\n\r\nofficer  under  the  Industrial Relations  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nbut, I take it, some officer has been created by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  order  to liaise  between  himself  and\r\n\r\neither the disputants in trade disputes or some  such\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Officers but we have conciliation  officers\r\n\r\nin  the  Ministry.

That  was  started  by  the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment when the workers in the Brigade were  paid\r\n\r\nat the rate of $3 a day with free sugar and rice. But\r\n\r\nnow  they are paid only $2 a day with food, and  they\r\n\r\nsleep  outside  where they have extra  activities  at\r\n\r\nnight. What the Minister for Labour has told us  just\r\n\r\nnow  clearly  shows  that these people  are  used  on\r\n\r\nspecific projects of the Government, and if they  are\r\n\r\nspecific  projects and not relief works, surely  they\r\n\r\nmust be paid a more decent wage. This is not the  way\r\n\r\nto get cheap labour, if it is relief work, I agree to\r\n\r\ngiving  them some money and asking them to  till  the\r\n\r\nground. But when they are actually put on projects of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  such as the ones  outlined  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, I submit that a wage of $2 a day with  food\r\n\r\nis   lower  than  what  is  paid  outside,  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not make use of these  people  who\r\n\r\njoin  the Work Brigade to form a sort of slave labour\r\n\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is utter\r\n\r\nbalderdash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

What I wanted to raise  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is that a sum of $3 million had been provided\r\n\r\nunder  sub-head  27 \"Work Brigade Projects\".  What  I\r\n\r\nwould like te know from the Minister is whether there\r\n\r\nhas  been careful budgeting. I mean whether the costs\r\n\r\nhave  been  worked out in detail, both in  regard  to\r\n\r\nlabour  costs and material costs, and the  sum  which\r\n\r\nhas  arisen thereby; or whether this $3 million is  a\r\n\r\ncock-shy, put in there to see if it is enough. If  it\r\n\r\nis  not  enough, we will ask some more; or if  it  is\r\n\r\nmore than enough, it does not matter, there will be a\r\n\r\nsurplus.

That  rather\r\n\r\nsets  the limit to the total strength of the Brigade.\r\n\r\nThe  Organisation and Methods Branch of  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through the organisation of  the  Brigade\r\n\r\nwith great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncare, and they have in the last few months made  far-reaching proposals for strengthening the organisation\r\n\r\nand  the  procedures of this Brigade.

Are they different  from  the\r\n\r\nprojects that he has made? If they are different, why\r\n\r\nshould   it  be?

For  instance, for special construction  work\r\n\r\nwhich  cannot be done by the Brigade, or if  you  are\r\n\r\ndigging  an  irrigation  canal,  then  you   want   a\r\n\r\nfloodgate, which controls the flow of the tide.  That\r\n\r\npart  of  the  work  is rather  skilled,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary that such work be done in the normal way by\r\n\r\nthe P.W.D., i.e. drawing designs, handing out tenders\r\n\r\nfor construction by contractors, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The first question is: would it be\r\n\r\npossible for the Minister to tell us how much of this\r\n\r\n$3  million is for the cost of maintaining  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade throughout the year 1961? The second question\r\n\r\nis:  if the present enrolment of the Work Brigade  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  maintained at this  level  throughout\r\n\r\n1961,  is this sum of money sufficient to keep  them\r\n\r\noccupied throughout the whole year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This money will pay for the\r\n\r\ndaily   allowances,  food,  clothing,   purchase   of\r\n\r\nbuilding  materials to construct camps,  purchase  of\r\n\r\nsimple  tools  for making roads, and  so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. It does not include, as I said, money for more\r\n\r\ncomplicated structures which have to be built in  the\r\n\r\nusual  way.

Sir, because if that is not so and\r\n\r\nif  the  intention of the Government is to provide  a\r\n\r\nnumber of facilities to the State of Singapore and to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  certain projects, then I would submit  to\r\n\r\nthe Government that these projects should be built as\r\n\r\neconomically  as  possible. The question,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  arises  is  this:  if  the  accent  is  on  the\r\n\r\nprojects,  then  I  think the  accent  should  be  on\r\n\r\ngetting  the  job done as economically  as  possible.\r\n\r\nFrom  what the Minister has said, it seems to me that\r\n\r\nif   this  $3  million  takes  into  account  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  like constructing and maintaining  camps\r\n\r\nand all the subsidiary expenditure which is necessary\r\n\r\nto  keep the workers beyond the $2 - housing, beds and\r\n\r\nclothes - the   question  then  arises  whether   these\r\n\r\nprojects are being done as economically as they might\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am advised by my technicians,\r\n\r\nthe  engineers.

As  far  as  I  have  been\r\n\r\nconcerned,  everyone  who joined  after  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nbecame  responsible  for it, was  taken  through  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Exchange.

And I\r\n\r\nsent  them to the Employment Exchange where they were\r\n\r\nregistered, and they were then employed in  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade. The present strength is 1,500. So it is  not\r\n\r\ntrue  to say that one must be a member of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbefore one can get employment in the Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am glad of the assurance of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Law, and I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister's assurance will get across to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because there really is  a  genuine  fear\r\n\r\nthat  unless you are a P.A.P. member or were prepared\r\n\r\nto  say  that you were going to join the  Party,  you\r\n\r\ncould  not get into the Brigade.

And  it  has  been  so\r\n\r\nprovided  in the Industrial Relations Ordinance  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister has the power to appoint, in addition to\r\n\r\nconciliation officers, Industrial Relations Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Industrial Relations Officers\r\n\r\nare  set  out  in  this  legislation.

The  Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission is paid a salary,  and\r\n\r\nhe  is  not  allowed, if he is in any profession,  to\r\n\r\npractise that profession so long as he is Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  P.S.C.  The other members of the Commission  are\r\n\r\npermitted  to  engage in their usual activities,  and\r\n\r\nthey receive a retainer, plus a fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on that analogy, it is proposed\r\n\r\nthat   when  the  services  of  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOfficers  are required, then those services  will  be\r\n\r\npaid  for  by  fees.  There is  a  provision  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance itself which says that the Minister has the\r\n\r\npower  to  appoint persons to be Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOfficers.  These  Industrial Relations  Officers  are\r\n\r\npublic  officers. Mr Speaker, Sir,  this  difficulty\r\n\r\ncould   be   overcome  by  representing  Government's\r\n\r\nproposal to the Public Service Commission, and it  is\r\n\r\npossible  for the Commission to appoint  people,  who\r\n\r\nare  interested  in this work, temporarily  for  this\r\n\r\ntype  of  work.  If the occasion does  arise  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  where officers who have done this work  prove\r\n\r\nthat  they are in every respect equal to it  and  are\r\n\r\ninterested in this type of work, then we may create a\r\n\r\npost in the civil service for this type of work.  But\r\n\r\nwe  are not quite sure at this stage. We feel that at\r\n\r\nthis  stage it would be premature to enter provisions\r\n\r\nfor posts of Industrial Relations Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Minister sought to draw an\r\n\r\nanalogy  between this case and the case  that  exists\r\n\r\nfor payment of fees in the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of the Public Service Commission,  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  works\r\n\r\npermanently and full-time, and he is paid  a  salary.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Commission who assist him are five\r\n\r\nor  six  in  number, and they get a  fee.  The  point\r\n\r\nthere, Mr Speaker, is that they are doing a job  for\r\n\r\nthe  State, and the State pays them fees. That is the\r\n\r\nposition  as  I  understand it in the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission. The position here, as I understand it, is\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Officers per, form services\r\n\r\nonly  for  trade unions who are involved in  a  trade\r\n\r\ndispute,  and  as  a result of the  dispute  have  to\r\n\r\npresent  their case before the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  As  I understand it, these officers  are  not\r\n\r\navailable to the employer. Now, the position we reach\r\n\r\nthen,  Mr  Speaker, is that in a dispute between  an\r\n\r\nemployer  and  an employee, in which the  State  must\r\n\r\nhold  the balance equally between the two, the  State\r\n\r\nis  providing  money for services to the  unions, it\r\n\r\ncould  have  been  a  solicitor;  he  may  not  be  a\r\n\r\nsolicitor; now he is an Industrial Relations Officer.\r\n\r\nSo  the  State,  which  is  supposed  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nbalance,  and  which is supposed to be impartial,  is\r\n\r\nproviding money in order that the trade unions  might\r\n\r\nargue  their case against the employer. The  question\r\n\r\nthen  arises,  is that a desirable position  for  the\r\n\r\nState to take?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Bill  was  under  consideration  by   this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  it was pointed out then that it  was  well\r\n\r\nwithin  the competence and the capacity of  employers\r\n\r\nto engage lawyers, who are not practising lawyers, to\r\n\r\nrepresent   their  interest  before  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  That  is  not possible as far  as  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  are concerned. They have to employ their  own\r\n\r\nofficials  and  they  are not able  to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\nservices of practising lawyers. It must be remembered\r\n\r\nthat the legislation itself does not allow practising\r\n\r\nlawyers  to appear before the Arbitration  Court.  It\r\n\r\nwas  for  that  reason that Government proposed  that\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Officers (they will be recruited\r\n\r\nfrom  the  trade unions and are people in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions who are interested and who have the ability to\r\n\r\ndo  this  type of work before the Arbitration  Court)\r\n\r\nshould  be made available to such unions who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  their  own paid officials to do  this  type  of\r\n\r\nwork. I do not think that it is in any way unfair  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers to so provide. They are able to afford\r\n\r\nthe services of trained legal brains, who are not  in\r\n\r\npractice,  to  assist  them in the  presentation  of\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases.

That was the principle that\r\n\r\nwas debated. Perhaps the Minister made out a case;  I\r\n\r\ndid  not  accept it. But perhaps he made out  a  case\r\n\r\nthat in the existing circumstances in which the trade\r\n\r\nunions  found themselves, some of them needed  advice\r\n\r\nand  help, and therefore in the development stage  it\r\n\r\nwas  essential that a good Government should  provide\r\n\r\nthem  with  assistance. That was a  point  worthy  of\r\n\r\nconsideration.  But where the service  is  not  being\r\n\r\nprovided  by  a  public servant and  where,  in  each\r\n\r\ndispute, a particular individual can be appointed and\r\n\r\npaid  for, it is quite a different matter altogether.\r\n\r\nMr  X  might  be appointed in a certain dispute.  We\r\n\r\nmight find that the same Mr X is being appointed  in\r\n\r\nall  trade  disputes.  This  is  going  to  become  a\r\n\r\nprofession for Mr X to appear in all cases of  trade\r\n\r\nunion  disputes. I know three or four people who  are\r\n\r\nnot  lawyers  in Singapore who do trade  union  cases\r\n\r\nvery  well  indeed. It could possibly  be  that  this\r\n\r\n$15,360 could be earned by one man and not by several\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have myself known of\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists who are in employment outside.

The principle involved here is this, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  Opposition takes the view that the State  is  an\r\n\r\nimpartial observer. If there is a dispute between  an\r\n\r\nemployer  and an employee, it is for the two  parties\r\n\r\nto get together and settle their differences. If they\r\n\r\ncannot,  then  the State says, \"We provide  you  with\r\n\r\nquasi judicial machinery which will enable you to get\r\n\r\njustice.\" We, as the State, should keep well  outside\r\n\r\nit.\" If the trade unions had been financially strong,\r\n\r\nthe State would have said to the employees, \"No. You\r\n\r\npay  for your own appearances in Court; just  as  the\r\n\r\nemployers  do.\" Or if the finances of the  union  had\r\n\r\nbeen  strong, but proper personnel was not  available\r\n\r\nto  the union, again there might have been a case for\r\n\r\nthe  State  employing that personnel and  getting  on\r\n\r\nwith  the  job. So there seemed to be a case  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance when the Bill was debated. So far  as\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  is concerned, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  objection at this stage if  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould engage one or two Industrial Relations Officers\r\n\r\nwho  would  be officers of the State. But  we  rather\r\n\r\nobject  to  these fees being provided  in  this  way,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  enable the Minister to pick  and  choose\r\n\r\nwhoever  he  likes, to represent a particular  union.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, is objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member is shifting\r\n\r\nhis  ground. In the first instance, he said  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  afraid that the whole of this amount of  $15,000\r\n\r\nmight  be paid to an individual. Then one would  have\r\n\r\nthought  that  his objection really  is  that  public\r\n\r\nmoney is spent on fees payable to an individual. Then\r\n\r\nwhen  he  rose in reply he said that he  had  another\r\n\r\nfear,  namely, that trade unions which are relatively\r\n\r\nwell  off  will  be able to enjoy this free  service.\r\n\r\nThat  is another issue. On that, I think the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Labour   and  Law  is  capable  of   exercising\r\n\r\ndiscretion.  But I will leave it to my  colleague  to\r\n\r\nanswer that point. But, as I have said, on his  first\r\n\r\nground,  I  think there are precedents in  Government\r\n\r\npractice  for  the  payment of fees  to  persons  for\r\n\r\nservices performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, I will have to follow on what the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has said, by pointing out that in  the\r\n\r\nlegislation itself, it is provided that the right  to\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in this case belongs,  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance, to the secretary or a paid official of  the\r\n\r\nunion. It is only when such persons are not available\r\n\r\nthat the union can select some other persons who  are\r\n\r\nin  the  union  field to represent  them  before  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court. When that sort of  representation\r\n\r\nis sought, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is only then that the\r\n\r\nquestion of fees arises. I have known from experience\r\n\r\nthat  many trade unionists who are in employment have\r\n\r\nto take leave of absence to appear before a tribunal,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  a court of inquiry or an  industrial\r\n\r\ncourt,  on  a no-pay basis. They are not paid  whilst\r\n\r\nthey represent the interests of the unions before the\r\n\r\ntribunal. It is to compensate such cases that we  are\r\n\r\nproviding for these fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to\r\n\r\nlabour the point. The point I tried to make, briefly,\r\n\r\nwas  this. There are two issues involved in this. The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  the  question of principle - whether  money\r\n\r\nshould  be  utilised  by the  State  for  payment  to\r\n\r\nparticular  persons in order to present the  workers'\r\n\r\ncase.  There is a principle, and that is an  accepted\r\n\r\nright. The House has accepted that principle and that\r\n\r\nis agreed. Then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  further question arises. The principle having been\r\n\r\naccepted, the question is: how is that money which is\r\n\r\nto  be voted going to be spent? The Assembly, in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance,  understood that these  monies  were\r\n\r\ngoing to be spent on a permanent civil servant.  That\r\n\r\nwas  what  the Assembly understood then.  The  debate\r\n\r\nmight  have  taken  an entirely different  turn,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, had not the Minister assured the  House\r\n\r\nthat   these  officers  would  be  officers  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But now there is a slight twist  to  this\r\n\r\nwhen I asked the Minister whether he would assure the\r\n\r\nHouse  that under the Industrial Relations  Ordinance\r\n\r\nthere is authority for him to pay in the way of  fees\r\n\r\nto  Industrial  Relations Officers.  As  I  read  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   Industrial   Relations   Officers   were\r\n\r\nstatutory  officers and, as such, could  be  employed\r\n\r\nand  paid  out of public funds. But if they  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  public  officers, has  the  Government\r\n\r\nauthority  to pay these fees under the existing  law?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, you will remember that  under  the\r\n\r\nProperty Tax Ordinance, a special provision  is  made\r\n\r\nfor  fees to be paid for the members on that  panel.\r\n\r\nBut  I cannot remember any sanction in the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance which will enable the Minister to\r\n\r\npay  fees to an outsider who is not a member  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you do not need\r\n\r\nlegislative sanction to do that. I have just  pointed\r\n\r\nout   that   we  have  a  Public  Service  Commission\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  We have a Chairman on the Commission  who\r\n\r\nis  engaged full-time and who is paid a salary out of\r\n\r\npublic  funds.  As  I  have pointed  out,  the  other\r\n\r\nmembers of the Commission are not civil servants, and\r\n\r\nthey are paid retainers and fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect to\r\n\r\nthe Minister, that is provided for in that particular\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, when this Bill was\r\n\r\nbefore  the Assembly, I did point out to the Assembly\r\n\r\nwhy   these   Industrial  Relations   Officers   were\r\n\r\nrequired.  The  work  of  conciliation  can   involve\r\n\r\nofficials in full-time work. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  four  conciliation officers  working  full-time\r\n\r\nevery day in the Ministry on conciliation work.  This\r\n\r\nsort  of  work  arises only when there  are  disputes\r\n\r\nbefore the Arbitration Court and only when the unions\r\n\r\nwant  it. In very many cases, Sir, the unions appoint\r\n\r\ntheir  own  secretaries to represent them before  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court. I think it will  be  a  waste  of\r\n\r\npublic  money, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we were to create\r\n\r\nposts  now for Industrial Relations Officers when  we\r\n\r\nreally do not know what the future requirements  will\r\n\r\nbe.  As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are\r\n\r\nputting it to the test now, and we are experimenting.\r\n\r\nIf  in  the future we find that there is a volume  of\r\n\r\nwork required to be done, the Government will be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  propose that posts of Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOfficers are created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in this debate it would\r\n\r\nappear  that  my  colleague has  lost  sight  of  the\r\n\r\noverall  picture. It is definitely the  intention  of\r\n\r\nthe Government to buy up the trade unions as much  as\r\n\r\npossible. That is why they have offered them a  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion House. Surely, trade unions in this country, if\r\n\r\nthey  have  that feeling of pride, will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide a house of their own. Now here the Government\r\n\r\nis  going  to  provide fees for Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOfficers who are chosen to represent a union  if  the\r\n\r\nunion itself does not have men of that calibre in its\r\n\r\npay, or as a full officer. The Minister suggests that\r\n\r\nthe  people who are appointed or chosen as Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Officers have sometimes to  forfeit  their\r\n\r\npay  because of their being absent from work. Let  us\r\n\r\ntackle  the problem in its correct perspective,  Sir.\r\n\r\nHow  much  would that amount to even  if  the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned were to be quite a senior man in  the  job?\r\n\r\nIt might only amount to $30 a day. To suggest that  a\r\n\r\ntrade union is not able by itself to find $30, to  be\r\n\r\nfree  from obligations to the Government, to pay  for\r\n\r\nits  own Industrial Relations Officer is to say  that\r\n\r\nthat  union  is very poor and is in need  of  charity\r\n\r\nfrom the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it shows how much out\r\n\r\nof  touch the Member for Cairnhill is with the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  generally.

Of course, there are other larger\r\n\r\norganisations  which  can  afford  to  employ   well-qualified persons to do this type of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by and large, I do not think that the unions\r\n\r\nat  present  can afford to pay for such  services  if\r\n\r\nthey  do not have their own officials to do this type\r\n\r\nof work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other question of Government providing\r\n\r\na  Trade  Union  House for the  workers.

Sir, it is\r\n\r\nmy submission that it is highly desirable to keep the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Law as a separate Ministry  and  not  to\r\n\r\nhave with it other departments of the Government. The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law  must give the impression  to  the\r\n\r\nState of Singapore and to everybody who is interested\r\n\r\nin  the maintenance and upholding of the prestige  of\r\n\r\nthe  law,  that  he  is an independent  and  fearless\r\n\r\nMinister  who  will  uphold  the  law,  whatever  the\r\n\r\nconsequences may be. If that is the correct principle\r\n\r\non which the democratic system, which believes in the\r\n\r\nrule  of  law, should be administered, then  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  principle will be considerably weakened if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law  takes other  departments  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment under his portfolio in which he would tend\r\n\r\nto  get  more interest, which might give him  greater\r\n\r\npolitical  kudos, and therefore would engage  him  in\r\n\r\ngreater public attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nin  his  capacity as Minister for Law has got himself\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  a  number  of controversial  situations\r\n\r\nwhere  he  has  forfeited the confidence  of  certain\r\n\r\nsections  of the public. Whether the actions  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  deserve that is quite another  matter,  but\r\n\r\nthe  factual position is that his pronouncements  and\r\n\r\nhis  behaviour  on  certain occasions  have  operated\r\n\r\ntowards a loss of confidence in certain sect ions  of\r\n\r\nthe public in Singapore. The whole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Singapore, whatever their sectional, political and\r\n\r\neconomic interests may be, are all interested in  the\r\n\r\nlaw, the dignity of the law and the upholding of  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  They want to see that not only justice must  be\r\n\r\ndone  but  seem  to  be done, and that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself must personify the unassailable principle  of\r\n\r\nthe law on which democratic institutions are founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not blame the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  for the present  situation.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate that he has been given a most contentious\r\n\r\nMinistry - the  Ministry  of  Labour -  which  has  been\r\n\r\ncoupled   with  a  Ministry  which  should   maintain\r\n\r\ndignity, calm and poise. As the Minister for  Labour,\r\n\r\nsometimes  he  tends  to lose that  poise,  calm  and\r\n\r\ndignity.  Perhaps  it is not his  fault.  It  is  the\r\n\r\noccasion  that  makes  us behave  in  the  manner  we\r\n\r\nsometimes behave, and perhaps the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nfinds himself obliged to behave in that way. That  is\r\n\r\na  matter which only he himself can say, but I  think\r\n\r\nhe  will  appreciate that, as the Minister  for  Law,\r\n\r\nthat  kind  of  attitude  or pose  is  not  suitable.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I would, in all earnestness,  suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe   Government   that  they   give   very   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration to separating the Ministry of  \"Labour\"\r\n\r\nand  \"Law\". I certainly appreciate that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour  is  a very, very important  Ministry.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  future  of  Singapore  depends  upon  how\r\n\r\nsuccessful  the  Minister for Labour is  in  handling\r\n\r\nlabour matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Coupled with law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And the Minister will also appreciate\r\n\r\nhow  important  it  is that the dignity  of  the  law\r\n\r\nshould  be maintained.

A\r\n\r\ncase  where  a  worker was accused of pilfering  ice-cream,  that there was ministerial intervention,  and\r\n\r\nthat  although the charge was substantiated, the  man\r\n\r\nwas  reinstated in his employment when  the  Minister\r\n\r\nknew  very  well  that be ought  to  be  sacked.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that allegation is completely  untrue.\r\n\r\nThis particular man was accused of having wasted  his\r\n\r\nemployer's  material in the preparation of ice-cream.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no question of theft at all  and  he  was\r\n\r\ndismissed for that reason. On due and proper  inquiry\r\n\r\nby  the  Commissioner, the employer was not  able  to\r\n\r\nestablish  that, and the employer himself  willingly\r\n\r\npaid him severance pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other case of the bakery in\r\n\r\nSembawang,  the Member for Farrer Park said  that  he\r\n\r\nrepresented  the employer. He said that there  was  a\r\n\r\nstrike,   that   there  were  pickets   outside   the\r\n\r\nemployer's  premises and that when the  employer  and\r\n\r\nhis  wife insisted on going back to their homes,  the\r\n\r\nwife of the employer was walloped by a big brute of a\r\n\r\ntrade  unionist. He went to see the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  nothing  could  be done.  He  went  to  see  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary who hung down  his  head  in\r\n\r\nshame.  These were his words. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncourts  of  law are open in Singapore.  Nobody  stops\r\n\r\nanybody  from  going  to  make  a  complaint   to   a\r\n\r\nmagistrate.  Why  bring  this  lady  around  to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry,   to   the   Commissioner,   and   to   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary? The Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nis  a  practising  lawyer. If  there  is  a  case  of\r\n\r\nassault,  all he has to do is to walk down  with  his\r\n\r\nclient to South Bridge Road to the Police Court, make\r\n\r\na  complaint and apply for a summons. That is all  he\r\n\r\nhas to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he mentioned the case of the Stamford Cafe. He\r\n\r\nalleged  then that the workers got out of hand,  that\r\n\r\nthe employer's children were threatened with a knife,\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister took it away from the man's  hand,\r\n\r\nthat  the  man  was  still in  employment,  and  that\r\n\r\nnothing happened. In fact, three days before the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  spoke  in  this  Assembly,  the  worker   was\r\n\r\nprosecuted  at  the  instance  of  the  wife  of  the\r\n\r\nproprietor of that cafe and he was fined.  These  are\r\n\r\nthe  facts,  Mr Speaker, Sir. A few  days  after  he\r\n\r\nspoke  in  this Assembly, the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nhimself  had a complaint when he was representing  an\r\n\r\nemployer.  He had seen the Commissioner and  did  not\r\n\r\nget  satisfaction. He came to see me and we spent two\r\n\r\nlong sessions together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made certain criticisms against a union. He said\r\n\r\nthe  workers were unreasonable in their demands. They\r\n\r\nwere insisting that the course of commercial practice\r\n\r\nshould be interfered with, should be changed - much  to\r\n\r\nhis  dislike.  We  went  into that  fully.  A  Labour\r\n\r\nInspector  was sent down to make a full investigation\r\n\r\ninto  the truth of that matter. The Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  will himself agree that there was no foundation\r\n\r\nthat he made them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the sort of situation\r\n\r\nthat  happens  in Singapore. As soon as  there  is  a\r\n\r\nstrike, Mr Speaker, Sir, the employer wants to  have\r\n\r\na  go  at  his  workers. He wants  to  get  everybody\r\n\r\ninvolved,    the   Police   involved   against    the\r\n\r\nworkers - everybody, including  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. \"Lock them up.\" The  Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor  Labour receives telephone calls. \"We  want  them\r\n\r\nall  locked  up.\" They try to involve the  Police  in\r\n\r\nthese  disputes. The Minister for Home Affairs has  a\r\n\r\nduty to discharge. He has to build up respect for our\r\n\r\nPolice  Force.  It would not do for us  to  get  them\r\n\r\ninvolved in these matters in that way. That  is  all,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir.  And once  the  matter  has  been\r\n\r\nsettled, I get letters saying, \"Use pressure  on  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General. Ask him  to  withdraw  these\r\n\r\nprosecutions.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, that is what happens\r\n\r\nin Singapore regularly. I can mention cases, but I do\r\n\r\nnot wish to waste the time of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few days ago I received a letter in regard\r\n\r\nto the C. K. Tang dispute. There were complaints that\r\n\r\nthe   Police  were  not  discharging  their   duties;\r\n\r\neverything  had  gone  mad;  there  was  the   Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  sitting around doing nothing and  everybody\r\n\r\nwas getting berserk, and so on. \"Why not arrest these\r\n\r\npeople and bring them under control?\", and so on.. A,\r\n\r\nfew  persons  did  go  before the  Police  Court  and\r\n\r\napplied for summonses and summonses were issued.  The\r\n\r\nmoment  the dispute was settled, we received  letters\r\n\r\nfrom the employers. Here is one:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`C. K. Tang Ltd. - in Voluntary Liquidation.' I will\r\n\r\nnot  mention  the  name  of' the  Liquidator  who  is\r\n\r\ninvolved, but this is the letter which he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to my telephone conversation of\r\n\r\nthis morning, I confirm that the relationship between\r\n\r\nthe  strikers and non-strikers of this Company so far\r\n\r\nhas been good, and therefore it is the desire of both\r\n\r\nparties  to  continue keeping this good  relationship\r\n\r\nfor their mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore respectfully suggest that it would be\r\n\r\nmost difficult to expect them now to stand before the\r\n\r\nCourt facing each other as accused and witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above explanation, the shareholders\r\n\r\nand  all employees of the above Company would be most\r\n\r\ngrateful  if  you  would kindly  exercise  your  good\r\n\r\noffices  to intercede on their behalf with the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General   to   drop   the   above    pending\r\n\r\nproceedings,  which have been put down  to  be  heard\r\n\r\nbefore  the Fifth Magistrate's Court on the  9th  and\r\n\r\n12th  December,  1960.  This  act  of  kindness   and\r\n\r\nsympathy  would, be much appreciated by all concerned.\r\n\r\nIf it is the wish of the State Advocate-General that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI should call on him, I shall be glad to do so at any\r\n\r\ntime convenient to him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I conveyed this to the State Advocate-General telling\r\n\r\nhim  that this matter was within his sole discretion.\r\n\r\nAnd he sent him a reply, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to your letter on the above matter\r\n\r\ndated  6th  December addressed to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law which has been forwarded  to  me  for\r\n\r\nreply,  I have to inform you that, after giving  full\r\n\r\nconsideration to the points raised by you and to  the\r\n\r\nfacts   of   the  case,  I  have  decided  that   the\r\n\r\nprosecution   against  the  above-mentioned   accused\r\n\r\npersons should be proceeded with.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I have been the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law, I have been very, very careful to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between  the  legal  functions   of   my\r\n\r\nMinistry and the Labour and Welfare functions. I  can\r\n\r\nassure   the   House   that  I   am   aware   of   my\r\n\r\nresponsibilities in these matters, and  that  I  have\r\n\r\nleft  all legal matters affecting my Ministry in  the\r\n\r\ncompetent  hands  of  the State Advocate-General,  so\r\n\r\nthat there is no danger of any conflict arising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to my general deportment and behaviour as a\r\n\r\nLabour Minister and whether that should or should not\r\n\r\nbe the correct attitude of a Minister for Law, all of\r\n\r\nus are entitled to our own opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the\r\n\r\ndifficulty in which the Minister for Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\nfinds  himself  when  I asked that  he  should  split\r\n\r\nhimself and his Ministry into two, and he is not in a\r\n\r\nposition  to  reply. It is a pity that the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is not present, because he might  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to reply on the Minister's behalf. But I do\r\n\r\nnot  want to be side-tracked into issues which I  did\r\n\r\nnot raise on this particular case. The issue which  I\r\n\r\nraised  was  that in the particular circumstances  in\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore finds itself now, I am suggesting  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government that it will be highly  desirable  to\r\n\r\nkeep the Ministry of Labour and Law apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the State Advocate-General's\r\n\r\npost  was  discussed in this Assembly  on  the  first\r\n\r\noccasion,  you may remember I fought the  point  that\r\n\r\nthe  State  Advocate-General should not be  given  an\r\n\r\nappointment for two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears, but that he should be given the full five-year\r\n\r\nperiod  as  the Constitution allows, for  the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that  I believed then, and I do believe  now,\r\n\r\nthat  the State Advocate-General should be completely\r\n\r\nindependent,  as the Director of Audit is,  and  that\r\n\r\nalthough  he  is a Government officer he should  have\r\n\r\nhis  full term of employment so that he can carry out\r\n\r\nhis   duties   fearlessly,  sometimes  advising   the\r\n\r\nMinister and even against what the Minister wants him\r\n\r\nto advise him on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary to the Minister for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw has resigned, and that the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\nis  being made to act in the position where  he  will\r\n\r\nhave to deal with matters connected with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour.  That  again, Mr Speaker,  is  a  highly\r\n\r\nundesirable   position.  The  State  Advocate-General\r\n\r\nshould  be the State Advocate-General. He should  not\r\n\r\nbecome the Permanent Secretary to any Ministry.  What\r\n\r\nis  his position if he has to advise the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour on a particular point involving Labour? Is  he\r\n\r\ngoing  to  split  his allegiance into  two  or  three\r\n\r\ndifferent  ways? And which way is he  going  to  act?\r\n\r\nThese are principles in which the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law  has got himself involved merely because  he\r\n\r\nheads one Ministry. I would suggest that even if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour and Law is not split,  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  should not have any  administrative\r\n\r\ncontrol   or   any  administrative  say  in   matters\r\n\r\nconnected with the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the retirement of the\r\n\r\nformer Permanent Secretary took place when I was away\r\n\r\nin  Tokyo.  The State Advocate-General has  been,  in\r\n\r\naddition   to   being  State  Advocate-General,   the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary on the Law side of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nHe   is  also  acting  Permanent  Secretary  for  all\r\n\r\nadministrative functions relating to the  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare  side. This is a very temporary  arrangement.\r\n\r\nIt  will  take  time for a suitable  officer  of  the\r\n\r\nadministrative service to be selected  and  appointed\r\n\r\nby the Public Service Commission as a replacement for\r\n\r\nthe last holder of the post\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Permanent  Secretary on the Labour  side  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  It is not an arrangement that is  intended\r\n\r\nto be permanent at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that was raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park is that he felt that because  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General's  appointment  was,  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  for two years only, he was not independent\r\n\r\nand free. I cannot understand how he can believe that\r\n\r\nto  be  so.  The State Advocate-General is completely\r\n\r\nfree  in  the legal side of the work of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nDoes  the Member for Farrer Park suggest that  he  is\r\n\r\nbeing pressured? And if he is being pressured, is  he\r\n\r\nbeing pressured by the Minister for Labour and Law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not suggesting that at all, Sir.\r\n\r\nLet  the Minister not misunderstand me, please. I  am\r\n\r\nnot   suggesting   that  the  present   Minister   is\r\n\r\npressuring  the  State Advocate-General.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying.  Mr  Speaker,  is  that  when  we   set   up\r\n\r\ndemocratic  institutions which are  nicely  balanced,\r\n\r\nthen  it  becomes  important that a proper  sense  of\r\n\r\nvalues should be attached to each post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a Supreme Court Judge, Mr Speaker, Sir, is an\r\n\r\nimportant  man  in  the  State.  Not  only  must   he\r\n\r\nadminister justly, he must seem to administer justly.\r\n\r\nIt  is a very important principle of the law which we\r\n\r\nmust  maintain  in  this  State - that  not  only  must\r\n\r\njustice  be done, but that it must seem to  be  done.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  what is the principle involved  when  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Audit is given a five-year  appointment\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution? The principle is  that  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Audit is in a position to criticise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and its Ministers. Therefore, he  must  be\r\n\r\nin  a  position from which he will be able to  do  it\r\n\r\nfearlessly. Now, could the Government contemplate the\r\n\r\nposition  where  the Director of Audit  is  appointed\r\n\r\nfrom  year to year? What confidence could the  public\r\n\r\nof  Singapore have in the Director of Audit's Report,\r\n\r\nif his appointment is at the pleasure of the Minister\r\n\r\nfrom   year  to  year?  I  think  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that. If he will translate  that  to  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General who must advise each Minister\r\n\r\nfearlessly according to the law and not according  to\r\n\r\nwhat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister wants him to advise, then, I do not say that\r\n\r\nthat  is happening now, but the situation now is such\r\n\r\nthat  everybody might believe that that is  what  can\r\n\r\nhappen.  The position will be that if he has  a  two-year  appointment, there will be many people who will\r\n\r\nsay, \"Oh! it is a two-year appointment, and surely if\r\n\r\nhe  wants another three-year appointment, he  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  say everything he thinks should be  said.\"\r\n\r\nThat  does  not  mean to say that in this  particular\r\n\r\ninstance,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  State  Advocate-General  is not doing his duty fearlessly. I  do  not\r\n\r\nsay that at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that was all discussed\r\n\r\nwhen  the  question of the appointment of  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  was raised in this  House.  It  was\r\n\r\nthen  pointed out that the Government have the  power\r\n\r\nunder the Constitution to appoint the State Advocate-General  for  a  stated period, and that  after  this\r\n\r\ninitial  period it would be up to the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconfirm  him in the appointment. There is no question\r\n\r\nthat,  because these arrangements were followed,  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General is not free in the  discharge\r\n\r\nof  his functions. He gives advice not only to me but\r\n\r\nto  all  the  other Ministers. And he has  been  very\r\n\r\nscrupulously careful to give us what he considers  to\r\n\r\nbe  his  own advice. There has been no pressure  ever\r\n\r\nexercised  either by myself or by any other  Minister\r\n\r\non  the  State Advocate-General. I think that it  was\r\n\r\nvery  unfair of the Member for Farrer Park  to  leave\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  with the impression that  because  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General has  been  appointed  for  an\r\n\r\ninitial  period of two years, he is tempted  to  take\r\n\r\nthe  line  of least resistance and fall in  with  the\r\n\r\nwishes   of   the  Ministers  in  order   to   secure\r\n\r\nconfirmation of his appointment. I think that  was  a\r\n\r\nvery  unfair  imputation to make and I think  it  was\r\n\r\nmost improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I want to make the position quite clear.\r\n\r\nThere  is no personal imputation against the  present\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General.

The Minister said that it is  only\r\n\r\ntemporary-excuse  me,  it is  only  temporary.  I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  to  the Minister that  this  is  such  an\r\n\r\nimportant principle that it should not even  be  only\r\n\r\ntemporary. When that official resigned, I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  have  come  up  with  some  other\r\n\r\nappointment,  making some other person  to  act.  The\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General, Mr Speaker, Sir, is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  most hard-worked officers in Singapore. The  way\r\n\r\nhe produces these Bills is like nobody's business!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the House could\r\n\r\njust recollect the word used: it was \"excuse\". There\r\n\r\nis no excuse. Nobody is trying to talk himself out of\r\n\r\nany  difficult  situation at all. There  is  no  such\r\n\r\nthing as an excuse in this matter,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I arrived from Tokyo I heard\r\n\r\nthat  the Permanent Secretary had retired, and I came\r\n\r\nto  know the next day that the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\nwas acting as the Permanent Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and  Law. It takes time for  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  to  review  the  claims  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  officers  according to their  seniority  and\r\n\r\nmerit  for  appointment  as  a  replacement  to   the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary.

The post\r\n\r\nhas  been  vacant  since October  1959,  and  it  has\r\n\r\nremained vacant since then simply because we have not\r\n\r\nfound a suitable person to fill it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other query by the Member for Tanglin would\r\n\r\nentail  my  repeating  the  statement  made  in   the\r\n\r\nAssembly on 2nd September, 1959, in Hansard, Vol. 11.\r\n\r\nNo.  9,  column 538, where the case for  a  Political\r\n\r\nLiaison  Secretary  was made. The incumbent  left  in\r\n\r\nOctober  1959,  and until such time  as  we  can  get\r\n\r\nsomebody to discharge these functions, obviously this\r\n\r\npost must remain vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the\r\n\r\nHansard  that the Minister for Culture quoted,  which\r\n\r\nis  2nd September, 1959. Vol. 11, No. 9, it seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that  this  is  a very special  post.  First  and\r\n\r\nforemost,  it  draws a salary of  $1,400  as  against\r\n\r\n$1,100  of  the Political Secretary. In that  debate,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  pointed out the special qualifications\r\n\r\nneeded.   In   column   540,   he   gave   the    two\r\n\r\nqualifications:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, one of these posts requires someone\r\n\r\nwith a knowledge not only of the Chinese language but\r\n\r\nalso  of  Chinese trends, thought and  reactions  and\r\n\r\nalso  a  knowledge of (on the purely technical  side)\r\n\r\npublicity methods and organisation.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, Sir, the Minister has not found these\r\n\r\ntwo  qualities in one man. Very probably,  there  are\r\n\r\nmany who have the first quality, but who have not the\r\n\r\nsecond, and vice versa. From what I see, Sir, 1 think\r\n\r\nit is 15 months now and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  has  not been able to find a  man  who  has\r\n\r\nthese  combined qualities. If I may put in my  humble\r\n\r\nobservation, it is not likely that he will  find  one\r\n\r\nin  the foreseeable future, because the knowledge  of\r\n\r\nnot  only  the  Chinese  language  but  also  Chinese\r\n\r\ntrends,  thought and reactions, (meaning the  Chinese\r\n\r\nway  of living, minds and culture), is something that\r\n\r\ncannot  be acquired overnight. If a man who  has  the\r\n\r\ntechnical knowledge cannot acquire that overnight and\r\n\r\nhe  is going to take years, then it is true the other\r\n\r\nway  round  also.  A  person who has  all  the  first\r\n\r\nqualities  cannot get technical knowledge  overnight.\r\n\r\nHe  will take years. That is why I feel that it  will\r\n\r\ntake  years before a man with the first quality could\r\n\r\nbe  trained in the second quality and vice versa.  It\r\n\r\nis  not, of course, like the shortage of doctors.  If\r\n\r\nwe cannot find enough doctors in Singapore, well, let\r\n\r\nus  publicise it throughout the world and  see  which\r\n\r\ncountry  can send us experts. This is not so in  this\r\n\r\ncase.  The  Minister has made it very  clear  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard  that  this is something very, very  special.\r\n\r\nThis  person must be someone who must have  lived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and must have the feel of the way  of  life\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, its culture and its trends of thought.\r\n\r\nThat  is a quality which we cannot get in a technical\r\n\r\nexpert from overseas. I would like to point out  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister, in winding up his speech, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am quite sure that if, as the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier,  the previous  Government  had  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more foresight in this matter and not felt\r\n\r\nits own pulse and mistaken it for the pulse of public\r\n\r\nopinion, it would not be where it is today.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks as if the Minister may not be able to find\r\n\r\nsuch   a  person  within  the  span  of  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment's  life. If they are unable to  find  that\r\n\r\nperson,  I  am just wondering whether they  would  be\r\n\r\nwhere we are today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, when the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  spoke, she hoped that we  would  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to find one. But I can assure her that we  have\r\n\r\nfound,  not  one,  but  quite  a  few  who  have  the\r\n\r\nrequisite  qualifications. They  are  journalists  of\r\n\r\nlong  standing, but unfortunately, for one reason  or\r\n\r\nanother, we could not induce them to take the job. In\r\n\r\nfact, I can assure the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMountbatten that there are quite a number  of  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  capable  of  doing this  job.  When  I  say\r\n\r\n\"special qualifications\", it does not mean a  special\r\n\r\ntype  of  people  or  some rare being.  All  that  we\r\n\r\nrequire is somebody with enough political acumen  and\r\n\r\na  knowledge of Chinese. This is not because it is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  post  but because in my Ministry  I  have  a\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary who is well-versed in Malay  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we need somebody to balance the other side\r\n\r\nto  help us keep in contact with Chinese opinion  and\r\n\r\norganise the publicity services. The co-ordination of\r\n\r\nthem  does not require all that great skill.  If  you\r\n\r\nare  a  journalist  or  a publicity  man,  you  could\r\n\r\ndischarge the job. But unfortunately, as I have said,\r\n\r\nalthough  we did find a number of people,  they  were\r\n\r\nnot prepared, for one reason or another, to take  up\r\n\r\nthe job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if for the\r\n\r\nlast  15  months it has not been found  necessary  to\r\n\r\nfill  this  vacancy and the Ministry of  Culture  has\r\n\r\ngone  on quite actively in its programmes, I  see  no\r\n\r\nreason  why  this  post should be  continued  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  My  opinion, Sir,  is  that  the  present\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary is the one who has almost all\r\n\r\nthe qualifications required for the present post.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  the fact that the Government is pursuing  a\r\n\r\npolicy   of  economy,  it  does  seem  strange   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  should still want to continue  with  this\r\n\r\npost  and be looking for some applicant when  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to carry on so far without this post being\r\n\r\nfilled.  I suggest that, in the interests of economy,\r\n\r\nthe post be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, this Assembly has gone on at\r\n\r\nleast five years without the Member for Tanglin being\r\n\r\npresent  in the Assembly, but it does not mean  that,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we should dispense with the  constituency\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin.  There  are many  posts  in  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  which  have not  been  filled  for  many\r\n\r\nyears, but, nevertheless, people carry on. Similarly,\r\n\r\nwith the case of this Publicity Liaison Secretary, we\r\n\r\nhave  carried on precisely by distributing  the  work\r\n\r\namong  a  number  of  people like  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, the Political Secretary, myself and  other\r\n\r\nofficers  of  the Ministry. To an extent,  it  was  a\r\n\r\nmakeshift arrangement \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the work involved hindered these people from\r\n\r\ncarrying on the other jobs which they have had to do.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have  said before, it means co-ordinating  the\r\n\r\nradio,    information   services,   posters,   films,\r\n\r\npublications,   field   units,   special    campaigns\r\n\r\norganised by various Ministries and so on. Perhaps in\r\n\r\nthe  near future it will include television and other\r\n\r\nactivities.  For example, in a very recent  case,  we\r\n\r\nhad  the family planning campaign. This involved  the\r\n\r\nprinting  of a large number of posters, booklets  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  But what happened was that there was  nobody\r\n\r\nelse  to  co-ordinate this work so that our  Ministry\r\n\r\nhad  committed  itself  to  producing  pamphlets  and\r\n\r\nbooklets  for  some  other  Ministry  without   quite\r\n\r\nrealising  that we could not discharge these  duties.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  little  bit of bad  blood  between  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries. They feel that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  is discriminating in favour of one  Ministry\r\n\r\nor  the other. This is just an instance of how, if we\r\n\r\nhad  an  officer like this, it would at least  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the publicity services speak as far as possible\r\n\r\nwith one voice consistently, unlike, I think, in  the\r\n\r\nprevious regime where you occasionally had three  and\r\n\r\nfour voices emerging from the same outfit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nexplanation  given,  I think the Ministry  should  be\r\n\r\ncalled the Ministry of Culture and Propaganda.

Is this not the truth of the situation: that\r\n\r\nthis  post  was created for a particular person,  and\r\n\r\nthat  was  why  it  was fixed at $1,400  and  not  at\r\n\r\n$1,100,  because he would not accept the  appointment\r\n\r\nat $1,100, because he felt he was superior to all the\r\n\r\nother Political Secretaries? Now that that person has\r\n\r\nleft,  there  is  no possibility of this  post  being\r\n\r\nfilled. I do not think the Government intends to fill\r\n\r\nthis post, so why have the post on the list?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> If the argument of the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park depends on that post not being filled and\r\n\r\nif  in  the next few months I do manage to fill  this\r\n\r\npost,  would he then say that therefore this post  is\r\n\r\njustified? Fortunately, this Government is not  going\r\n\r\nto  fill a post just to satisfy the Opposition. There\r\n\r\nis  necessity  for the post because we consider  this\r\n\r\npost  is  essential to us. We therefore want to  look\r\n\r\naround  for  an individual who can help us  discharge\r\n\r\nthis  function.  If we cannot find  that  individual,\r\n\r\nthen  we  will leave it vacant for as long as  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  and we will carry on as best we  can.  But\r\n\r\nthe  argument that the Member for Farrer Park has put\r\n\r\nforward seems to be that, \"If you can fill this post,\r\n\r\nthen we will have nothing to say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, what I am saying frankly and simply\r\n\r\nis  this. This post is created at this salary to take\r\n\r\nin  a particular gentleman. I think the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture knows whom I refer to. As a result of certain\r\n\r\ndifferences of opinion in the Ministry,  he  has  now\r\n\r\nleft.   He  was  certainly  a  very  versatile   man.\r\n\r\nVersatility was his metier. Now that he is gone, they\r\n\r\ncannot  find  anyone  else, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  find anyone else who will fit in  with  their\r\n\r\nway of thinking and their way of doing things, and  I\r\n\r\ndo not blame them, Sir,It is difficult to find these\r\n\r\nindividuals. They do not grow on trees. The point  we\r\n\r\nare  making is, \"If you thought there was a need  for\r\n\r\nit  then, you voted him $1,400, that was all right as\r\n\r\nfar  as it went. But you are not going to get such  a\r\n\r\ncreature again. Even if you do get him, why  pay  him\r\n\r\n$1,400?

The criticism\r\n\r\nreally  springs from the chronic antipathy  that  the\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite have against Political  Secretaries\r\n\r\nin  general. As indicated in one way or another, they\r\n\r\nare  afraid that if we get good political advice, the\r\n\r\nsituation perhaps in another four or five years  will\r\n\r\nbe  improved,  with perhaps a few more reductions  in\r\n\r\nthe  number  of Members on the other side.  So  their\r\n\r\nobjection is not that this post is not unnecessary as\r\n\r\nit  has not been filled, but that they object to  the\r\n\r\nappointment of Political Secretaries in principle. We\r\n\r\ncannot  stop them from doing that. It is  quite  true\r\n\r\nthat  the post was held by a previous individual  who\r\n\r\nwas  a  very versatile man with great talent. He  was\r\n\r\nnot  only  purely  performing  the  functions  of   a\r\n\r\nPolitical   Secretary  but,  in  addition,   he   was\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  co-ordinating  a   the   publicity\r\n\r\nservices. When he left the post, we tried to fill it.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  as  I said earlier, we found a  number  of\r\n\r\npeople who could fill the job. But one of the reasons\r\n\r\nfor their turning down the post, if I may say so, was\r\n\r\nthat they felt that the Opposition might consider  it\r\n\r\na very highly paid post, or that perhaps, among other\r\n\r\nthings,   the  salary  was  not  attractive   enough.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  to  prevent further  questions  being\r\n\r\nasked   by  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  and   his\r\n\r\ncolleagues, we decided to leave the post  at  $1,400.\r\n\r\nAs I say, if we do find a gentleman to fill the post,\r\n\r\nthen  I  hope  the Members opposite will congratulate\r\n\r\nthe Government for being assiduous in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits search and having got a person quite capable of\r\n\r\nensuring that this Government carries out its work\r\n\r\ncorrectly and properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the sum to be allocated for Head\r\n\r\n47 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-\r\n\r\nhead 1.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 7; Noes, 23; Absent, 21.\r\n\r\n <pre>\r\n\r\n          Ayes.

It  is now known, however, that the  officer\r\n\r\nwill  go on leave prior to retirement at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year  and he has quite a lot of vacation  leave\r\n\r\ndue  to  him. Part of this provision will be utilised\r\n\r\nas expatriation pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of expatriates still in the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  apart from this individual, I think  there\r\n\r\nare  two more: one is in the Engineering Section  and\r\n\r\none  in  the  Programme Section. 1 am not  sure  when\r\n\r\ntheir  terms expire.

This was explained by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Culture in Hansard  of\r\n\r\n21st September, 1960, Vol. 13, No. 9, col. 631.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to say, Mr Speaker, is in\r\n\r\nregard  to the policy of celebrating National Day.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to raise any question, but I would  like\r\n\r\nto  talk  about  the expenditure side.  The  benefits\r\n\r\nderived  from  the sums expended will be commensurate\r\n\r\nwith  the  value derived by the State. The Government\r\n\r\ncannot  deny that the Opposition could not take  part\r\n\r\nin   the   National   Day  celebrations.   Therefore,\r\n\r\ncelebrations were not conducted as they  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  conducted - by all the people of Singapore.  What\r\n\r\nis  objectionable to the Opposition, Mr Speaker, and\r\n\r\nalso to political Parties outside this Chamber is the\r\n\r\nmethod  adopted  by  the  Government  in  celebrating\r\n\r\nNational  Day.  And I dare say in this  Chamber,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that  in the National Day  celebrations  we\r\n\r\nobserved that the decorations were done on Government\r\n\r\nbuildings,  but  what  is  regretted  is   that   the\r\n\r\ncommercial  buildings  paid  no  heed  to   celebrate\r\n\r\nNational Day except maybe if they felt that they were\r\n\r\nunder  pressure  to put up bunting or  to  hoist  the\r\n\r\nNational  Flag. The celebrations were very  different\r\n\r\nfrom  the  celebrations that we used to  see  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  I  feel, Mr Speaker, there must be  something\r\n\r\nbeneath it which resulted in many people refusing  to\r\n\r\ntake an, active part in National Day celebrations.  I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  know,  Mr  Speaker,  whether   the\r\n\r\nproposals for National Day celebrations for 1961 will\r\n\r\nbe the same as had been made by the Government during\r\n\r\nthe past two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that the Member\r\n\r\nfor   the   Southern  islands  seeks  to   revive   a\r\n\r\ncontroversy   which  we  hoped  had  been   forgotten\r\n\r\nbecause,  on the part of Government, it has at  least\r\n\r\ntried not to discuss the matter. On two occasions not\r\n\r\nonly   the  Opposition  Parties  but  various   other\r\n\r\norganisations and groups were invited to  participate\r\n\r\nin  the celebrations. Unfortunately, for reasons best\r\n\r\nknown to themselves, the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided to make an issue out of it on both occasions.\r\n\r\nThe last time, if I remember correctly, a large group\r\n\r\nof  people  came  up  to say that this  National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebration was not an affair of one particular Party\r\n\r\nor   of  the  Government;  we  wanted  everybody   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in it, because, for us at least, this was\r\n\r\none  day  in  the  year when we could demonstrate  to\r\n\r\nourselves   that  regardless  of  different   creeds,\r\n\r\ndifferent political Parties, or any other differences\r\n\r\nthat  you  might have, on this one day we could  come\r\n\r\ntogether  to  celebrate  it  as  a  national   group.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Opposition said that  this  was  a\r\n\r\npolitical stunt by the Government, that it was really\r\n\r\na  P.A.P. affair, and the reason,  they  said,  was,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  you  are  having this procession  and  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  are going to participate and they are  going\r\n\r\nto fly their flag.\" We took the view that on National\r\n\r\nDay P.A.P. members too should celebrate. Though there\r\n\r\nwere different groups, they should celebrate together\r\n\r\nto  the  extent  of showing their identity.  Just  as\r\n\r\nother  cultural organisations and trade unions  which\r\n\r\nbelonged  to different unions showed their  identity.\r\n\r\nThe  idea  was that, although we were all  different,\r\n\r\nthat though we belonged to different trade unions, to\r\n\r\ndifferent  cultural  groups, to  different  political\r\n\r\nParties,  on this occasion we were marching  together\r\n\r\nas  one  united group. Unfortunately, the  Opposition\r\n\r\ndecided  to say, \"No. We say: Celebrate this  without\r\n\r\nshowing  our  identity. Let us march  as  a  nameless\r\n\r\ngroup.\" For that reason, they left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the Member for the Southern Islands said\r\n\r\nthat  many people refused to take an active  part  in\r\n\r\nit, that is no quite true. As far as I know, the only\r\n\r\npeople  who  were invited and who did not  take  part\r\n\r\nwere  Members of the Opposition. The others, everyone\r\n\r\nof  them,  accepted. The people who refused  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in it as a matter of protest, whether right  or\r\n\r\nwrong,  we are not interested in them. They  did  not\r\n\r\ntake  part  in it because they did not want  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in  it, not because the Government  refused  to\r\n\r\nhave them. In fact, we welcomed them. We invited them\r\n\r\nto  come and take part in the discussions leading  to\r\n\r\nthe organisation of National\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay  celebrations.  Therefore, I regret  that  on  an\r\n\r\noccasion like this, they decided to make it a  matter\r\n\r\nof  political controversy. I had hoped that it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be. But if there were any objections, then  they\r\n\r\nshould come out openly and say it. The objection they\r\n\r\nmade  was  \"The  other  groups  should  not  identify\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Everybody should just walk  in  one  big\r\n\r\nmass.\"  None of the other groups objected to  it.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  they were very glad - the Chambers of  Commerce,\r\n\r\ncultural  organisations - to come and show  that  they\r\n\r\nbelonged to this or that group and they were prepared\r\n\r\nto  march together. So that was the reason, Sir,  and\r\n\r\nnot  because the Government was being unfair  or  the\r\n\r\nGovernment refused to have them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am\r\n\r\nconfused when the Minister for Culture explained that\r\n\r\nthe Opposition blindly did not wish to participate in\r\n\r\nthe  National Day celebrations. It has been  stressed\r\n\r\nduring  the  past two occasions that  the  Opposition\r\n\r\ncould  not  see  eye to eye with the methods  adopted\r\n\r\nbecause  they benefited only one side. They benefited\r\n\r\nthe  Party in power, Mr Speaker. We were invited for\r\n\r\ndiscussion merely to accept the resolutions which had\r\n\r\nalready been taken by the Minister for Culture.  This\r\n\r\nis not the way of working together. It is merely like\r\n\r\nexpecting  the  Opposition to follow something  which\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  accept.  The way  to  co-operate,  when\r\n\r\norganising  National Day celebrations, is  to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  the  participants. Whether  the  view\r\n\r\npoints  are accepted by all or not should be thrashed\r\n\r\nout  at  the meetings. The Opposition never  rejected\r\n\r\nblindly  on  this  issue, as in the past  year,  when\r\n\r\n$41,320.80  was spent on decorations, and even  these\r\n\r\ndecorations  were a failure because of the  inclement\r\n\r\nweather. The expenditure was a waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  sought  to  give  the  impression  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition    Parties   were   not   interested    in\r\n\r\nparticipating  in the National Day celebrations.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  you  will remember,  when  the  first\r\n\r\noccasion   arose  to  vote  this  money, that   the\r\n\r\nOpposition voted the money willingly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the basis that it was important that National Day\r\n\r\nshould be celebrated. The point of difference between\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and ourselves is in  the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  this  National Day is sought to be celebrated.\r\n\r\nWe  on  the  Opposition side feel that the Government\r\n\r\nseeks  to give it a party flavour, and we have always\r\n\r\nbeen   against  the  Government  giving  it  a  party\r\n\r\nflavour. It is a National Day. The Head of State, the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara, is present on this occasion,\r\n\r\nand  in the march-past he takes the salute. We on the\r\n\r\nOpposition side feel that it is wrong that  the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara  should be placed  in  a  position\r\n\r\nwhere  he  should be called upon to salute any  party\r\n\r\nflag. The only flag which he should be called upon to\r\n\r\nsalute   is  the  State  flag.  That  is  the   basic\r\n\r\nprinciple. The Opposition Parties say that the manner\r\n\r\nin  which  the  Government seeks  to  celebrate  this\r\n\r\nnational  occasion is not correct, if they will  only\r\n\r\ngive  it  a  national  flavour rather  than  a  party\r\n\r\nflavour,  they  will be completely correct  in  this,\r\n\r\nbecause the State belongs to them and to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, when they say a party flavour,\r\n\r\nwhat  do  they object to and in what way? If  in  the\r\n\r\ncelebration  you  confine it to only  one  party  and\r\n\r\nrefuse  the others, then it has a party flavour.  But\r\n\r\nwhat   we   said  was  that  all  political   parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Assembly were welcome, just as all\r\n\r\ncultural  organisations  were  welcome.  Whatever  we\r\n\r\nmight  say  of  the  political parties - the  political\r\n\r\nparties  of  the Opposition as well as the  political\r\n\r\nparty  of  our side - there are hundreds of individuals\r\n\r\nwho  have  helped and played a part in moulding  this\r\n\r\nnew  State.  Should we be ashamed of our symbol,  and\r\n\r\nshould  we be ashamed of being associated with  them?\r\n\r\nWe  should  not.  That is why we  welcomed  political\r\n\r\nparties  of all shades, who helped to mould this  new\r\n\r\nState, to come forward openly and be proud of what\r\n\r\nthey  had  done, and to show their symbols.  Just  as\r\n\r\ncultural organisations and trade unions belonging  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups came and carried  their  signs  and\r\n\r\nsymbols.  Therefore, I do not, think  there  was  any\r\n\r\nparty flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  we  had  wanted a party flavour,  we  would  have\r\n\r\nexcluded  all  the others, and only  confined  it  to\r\n\r\nourselves. Then the Opposition would have been  quite\r\n\r\njustified  in saying that we were using the  National\r\n\r\nDay  celebrations  to propagate,  or  put  forward  a\r\n\r\nparticular party. All political parties come and join\r\n\r\nus,  so that people can say, \"Here are three or  four\r\n\r\npolitical parties which on this occasion are marching\r\n\r\ntogether, on the same occasion, to celebrate a common\r\n\r\nideal.\" The aim that they have is a National  Day  to\r\n\r\nsymbolise  the  desire  to be a  nation  despite  our\r\n\r\ndifferences in politics; race and religion.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe simple thing, and I do not see any objection. But\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition always insisted that they would  come\r\n\r\nonly  if  none of the political parties  carried  any\r\n\r\nsymbols.  We are not ashamed of our symbols.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  ashamed  of  the people who  have  put  us  into\r\n\r\npower - all the political parties that have put us into\r\n\r\npower.  We are prepared on that day to say, \"This  is\r\n\r\nthe political group in power, and those are the other\r\n\r\npolitical parties which represent the Opposition.\"  I\r\n\r\ndo  not see why we should try and boycott an occasion\r\n\r\nlike this on their insistence that there should be no\r\n\r\nshowing of any symbols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard\r\n\r\nit  repeatedly mentioned that we should build  a  new\r\n\r\nnation.  If on the National Day of the new  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  display different party  symbols  and\r\n\r\nparty  flags, we immediately divide the loyalties  of\r\n\r\nthose  present so that the people and children  begin\r\n\r\nto  think  in terms of, \"Which party do you support?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which party does our father support?\" On that basis,\r\n\r\nhow  can  we produce unity? I know that some  parents\r\n\r\nhave  asked  the heads of schools whether they  could\r\n\r\nkeep  their  children at home when the  schools  have\r\n\r\nagreed  to send certain quotas to participate in  the\r\n\r\nmass  drill or the mass display, because the  parents\r\n\r\nof school children also belong to different political\r\n\r\nparties.  For  that reason, we believe very  strongly\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Government  wants  to  instil  in  our\r\n\r\nchildren  and in the people of Singapore  loyalty  to\r\n\r\none  nation, then there should be no discordant  note\r\n\r\non National Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nassure   the  Minister  for  Culture   that   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  places as much importance on  National\r\n\r\nDay  as  the  Government  itself  does.  When  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the National Flag was being mooted  by\r\n\r\nthe Government, the Government called a meeting of\r\n\r\nall  political  parties. After  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\ndiscussion, agreement was reached. That agreement.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, has helped to make that a truly\r\n\r\nNational  Flag. If the Government had  over-ridden\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Parties and created a flag of their\r\n\r\nown without the consent of the Opposition Partie s- \r\n\r\nand  they  had  every legal  right  to  do  it.  I\r\n\r\nsuppose,  because they have a majority  number  of\r\n\r\nvotes - even if they had carried it through  without\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition consenting, it would not have been\r\n\r\na   truly   National  Flag.  But  better   opinion\r\n\r\nprevailed in the Government, and we were all  able\r\n\r\nto agree on a flag which has now become a national\r\n\r\nsymbol.  All of us accept it loyally, and give  it\r\n\r\nthe  reverence it should be given. Similarly,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when the Government were trying  to\r\n\r\nput forward a plan on the flag, they had their own\r\n\r\npoints  of  view. They departed to  a  very  large\r\n\r\nextent from those points of view, and a compromise\r\n\r\nwas  arrived at. The compromise has helped to make\r\n\r\nit  into  a  National  Flag. The  Government  have\r\n\r\ncertain   ideas  as  to  how  the   National   Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations should be conducted. But National Day\r\n\r\nis  not a day for the Government. It is a day  for\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore,  and  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  composed of P.A.P. people,  S.P.A.\r\n\r\npeople,  the  Workers'  Party,  and  may  be  even\r\n\r\nsupporters of the Member for Hong Lim, and  others\r\n\r\nwho  are independent. But those are the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Does  it  matter  very  much  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  if  they  yield  one  or  two   points\r\n\r\nprovided they can get complete unanimity with  the\r\n\r\nOpposition?  Would  that  not  really   become   a\r\n\r\nNational   Day?  The  point  of  divergence,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it seems to me, is whether the party flag\r\n\r\nshould  be  carried on the shoulders  and  hoisted\r\n\r\nbefore  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. On that  small\r\n\r\nissue, we are breaking down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it is not that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not invite people. The  Government\r\n\r\ninvited not only the Opposition parties but  every\r\n\r\ncultural organisation. In fact, to a great extent,\r\n\r\nthe  National Day celebrations were organised  and\r\n\r\nrun  by  non-Government organisations.  They  were\r\n\r\norganised  by cultural organisations  who  put  up\r\n\r\ntheir own shows. The difference was over this  one\r\n\r\nparticular point. Should a political party on that\r\n\r\nday  show  themselves? If you are P.A.P.,  do  you\r\n\r\nshow  yourselves  that  you  are  members  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.? If you belong to a particular trade union,\r\n\r\ndo  you show that you belong to a particular trade\r\n\r\nunion?  If  you  belong to a  particular  cultural\r\n\r\norganisation,  do you show that you  belong  to  a\r\n\r\nparticular  cultural organisation?  And  everybody\r\n\r\nagreed  they should. The only opposition was  from\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Members. None of the other cultural\r\n\r\norganisations - there were about 80 or  90  of  them\r\n\r\nopposed  it.  Everyone else agreed. Not  only  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  but  other cultural organisations  and\r\n\r\nbodies which were there said that it was perfectly\r\n\r\nright; that on this particular day we should  show\r\n\r\nthat, though we were diverse and we held all sorts\r\n\r\nof  views, here we were marching together  as  one\r\n\r\ngroup.  I think I know why the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\ndid  not want to participate in it and show  their\r\n\r\nparty  symbols,  but  that  is  not  my  business.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  let us not try and make an issue  out  of\r\n\r\nthis  and say that it is because of the particular\r\n\r\nway in which the Government organised the National\r\n\r\nDay  celebrations. As I said, there were about  80\r\n\r\nor  90  different groups. Everyone was  satisfied,\r\n\r\nexcept  the  Opposition parties. So does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat 80 or 90 organisations should give in on this\r\n\r\nparticular issue - that everyone should show  their\r\n\r\nsymbols; - to what group they belonged - whether they\r\n\r\nbelonged  to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Chamber of Commerce, the Indian  Chamber\r\n\r\nof  Commerce, to what religious bodies? They  were\r\n\r\nprobably  parading their symbols and their  flags,\r\n\r\nand  that  was the best way to show to the  people\r\n\r\nthat  whatever diversity there might be,  on  this\r\n\r\nbasic  issue  we were united. Yet the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin says that by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  various political parties showing their colours,\r\n\r\nthe  children  are going to say that they  cannot  be\r\n\r\nloyal  to  a  particular  ideal,  because  there   is\r\n\r\ndivision,  in  which case there is no need  for  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  because  the children can  come  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  democracy  means  so many  political  parties\r\n\r\narguing  things out.\" But our idea is  this - the  fact\r\n\r\nthat different groups and different political parties\r\n\r\ncan  argue and still have loyalty to the basic  ideal\r\n\r\nbears  the  stamp of democracy. In a similar  way,  I\r\n\r\nhope that though we may say these things, whatever  I\r\n\r\nmight have said today, on the next National Day,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  will take a much more liberal  view,  and\r\n\r\nthat   it   does   not   matter  whatever   political\r\n\r\ndifferences  there  are,  they  will   be   able   to\r\n\r\nparticipate.

The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture has said that he  has  invited\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  in Singapore, including  cultural\r\n\r\nbodies  and  other associations. But  what  has  been\r\n\r\nknown  in the past is that political parties  outside\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  have not been invited to  discuss  the\r\n\r\nmanner  of holding the National Day celebrations.

I\r\n\r\nremember that when the Merdeka Mission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  proceeding  to London, there was  no  opposition\r\n\r\nthen  from the Government to the display of  slogans,\r\n\r\nparty  flags  and so on. All sections of people  from\r\n\r\nall  political  parties  in  Singapore  participated.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  when  the Merdeka Mission  returned  from\r\n\r\nLondon,  various political parties displayed  various\r\n\r\nparty  flags with captions such as \"Welcome Home  the\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Mission to London\". The fruit of the Merdeka\r\n\r\nMission was not designed for the particular affection\r\n\r\nof  this  community. Now, we have reached  the  stage\r\n\r\nwhere  we  should have a feeling for the Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich we are now working. Why is it that when sending\r\n\r\noff and welcoming back the Merdeka Mission there were\r\n\r\nno  objections  raised at that time? In  fact,  every\r\n\r\npolitical party had encouraged the display  of  party\r\n\r\nflags  and  slogans.  But it might  be  that  in  the\r\n\r\nNational  Day celebrations, some of those wishing  to\r\n\r\nparticipate might have their party flags  carried  by\r\n\r\n50 to 60 people when other political parties would be\r\n\r\nshouldering  their  party  flag  with  thousands   of\r\n\r\nsupporters.  State politics cannot be  divorced  from\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Politics play an important  part  in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic State. It is proper, however, as has  been\r\n\r\nsaid  by the Hon. the Minister for Culture, that  all\r\n\r\npolitical  parties in Singapore today  should  during\r\n\r\nNational Day demonstrate national unity, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  political  ideology, religion or creed.  But  all\r\n\r\nmust aim at one ideal - a united nation in our State. I\r\n\r\nfeel,  Mr  Speaker,  we should during  National  Day\r\n\r\ndiscard  all divergent views and different  political\r\n\r\nideologies, but we must show to the world that  in  a\r\n\r\nState governed by a political party we are democratic\r\n\r\nand  the political parties play an important part  in\r\n\r\nits  administration. I cannot see any logical  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Opposition could not agree to  the  concept\r\n\r\nthat  all political parties should have the right  to\r\n\r\ndisplay their party flags during the celebration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park said that they were\r\n\r\nsurprised, suspicious or could not understand why the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara should  salute  a  political\r\n\r\nparty flag. I think the Member for Farrer Park should\r\n\r\nremember  that  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  is  not\r\n\r\nsaluting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe flags but that, because hundreds of thousands  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore are giving  respect  to  him,\r\n\r\ntherefore  he must return that salute of  respect.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  only proper that the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  should duly return the salute of the  people.\r\n\r\nAll  this  goes  to show that there is a  possibility\r\n\r\nespecially  with  S.P.A. that  they  are  completely\r\n\r\nlacking in members -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member must\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  I am trying to direct  this  debate.\r\n\r\nThis  debate should be only on principles and not  on\r\n\r\nasides, which can be offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to debate at length as if we are taking\r\n\r\npart  in  a political election. We are debating  this\r\n\r\nmatter with the object of achieving our true aims. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  discuss what is the strength of a  political\r\n\r\nparty   and   its   membership.  But   if   something\r\n\r\nundesirable  emerges as a result of  the  refusal  to\r\n\r\nparticipate by a few sections, it would  not  be  the\r\n\r\nfault  of the Opposition. We will bring home  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  the  manner  in  which  the  Government\r\n\r\ncelebrates the National Day celebrations is wrong. As\r\n\r\nstated by the Member for Farrer Park, during National\r\n\r\nDay  celebrations,  the State flag  should  have  the\r\n\r\nrespect of all people of Singapore and not just a few\r\n\r\nsections of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development related the events\r\n\r\nleading to the welcome organised by the Government on\r\n\r\nthe  return  of  the  Merdeka  Mission.  This  showed\r\n\r\nclearly  the awareness of the Government to  organise\r\n\r\nsuch  a  welcome with complete unanimity because  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in which it was organised was different  from\r\n\r\nthat  organised by the Government today. The previous\r\n\r\nGovernment organised such a celebration by  having  a\r\n\r\nsub-committee  comprised of  all  political  parties.\r\n\r\nThis  Celebration Committee decided that symbols  and\r\n\r\nparty  slogans would be permitted. It might  be  that\r\n\r\nthere  might be members in the Committee who did  not\r\n\r\nagree, but on the principle of majority of votes, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecision was accepted by all those represented in the\r\n\r\nCommittee.  So I hope it is not going  to  be  a  big\r\n\r\nmatter.  But  the  manner in  which  the  Government,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the Minister for Culture,  carried  out\r\n\r\nthe   celebrations  could  not  be  accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to answer\r\n\r\na  point raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development. He did  say  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  victorious Merdeka Mission came back  from\r\n\r\nEngland,  political  flags were  carried  about.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that was an appropriate moment  and  an\r\n\r\noccasion when it should be carried about, because  at\r\n\r\nthat  juncture the Head of State was not involved  in\r\n\r\nit. The basic objection on which we on the Opposition\r\n\r\ntake  our Stand is, if it is National Day and if  the\r\n\r\noccasion merits the hoisting of the National Flag and\r\n\r\nthe presence of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, then such\r\n\r\nan  occasion  is  an  occasion where  party  politics\r\n\r\nshould  not come up. If the Government is anxious  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  that the Parties should take  part  in  the\r\n\r\nNational Day celebrations and in the march-past, then\r\n\r\nwe  from  the  Opposition will put  forward,  in  all\r\n\r\nseriousness, a suggestion to the Government for their\r\n\r\nsincere consideration, that the Parties by all  means\r\n\r\ntake  part,  but we ask that each of the Parties  who\r\n\r\ntake  part carry national flags in their hands rather\r\n\r\nthan party flags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like\r\n\r\nto  say  a  few words on what has been  said  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park just now. It is not surprising\r\n\r\nto  us  and  it  is not wrong if during National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations all the various political parties  carry\r\n\r\ntheir  own  party  slogans. If the political  leaders\r\n\r\ncould  demonstrate their loyalty, this will give  the\r\n\r\nimpression  to  the  people  that  they   have   only\r\n\r\ndifferent  views  and different political  ideologies\r\n\r\nbut  that there is no need to worry that the children\r\n\r\nwill have the impression that various political party\r\n\r\nflags may mean different-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it being 8 p.m. Mr Speaker therefore left the\r\n\r\nChair  of  the  Committee and took the Chair  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto  report  that  the Committee of  Supply  has  made\r\n\r\nprogress on the Main Estimates, and ask leave to  sit\r\n\r\nagain tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"-[Dr\r\n\r\nToh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
