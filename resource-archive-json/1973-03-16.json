It is true that Woodbridge Hospital  has\r\n\r\nexcellent  facilities for the treatment of  mental\r\n\r\npatients.  However, many mental patients  who  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  fit are sent home to stay  with  their\r\n\r\nfamilies. From the medical point of view, this may\r\n\r\nbe  desirable. But from the social point of  view,\r\n\r\nthis  creates  problems for the  families  of  the\r\n\r\nmentally  sick,  especially  those  who  stay   in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  flats.  On account  of  the  close\r\n\r\nproximity of the flats, a mental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatient  who has been discharged from the hospital\r\n\r\nis  easily  identified  by the  residents  and  is\r\n\r\nshunned  and  ridiculed. Such attitudes  not  only\r\n\r\naffect  the  mental well-being of the patient  but\r\n\r\nalso  affect the relationship between  his  family\r\n\r\nand his neighbours. As a result, tremendous strain\r\n\r\nis  imposed  on  the patient's  family.  They  are\r\n\r\ntreated as social outcasts by their misfortune  of\r\n\r\nhaving  mentally  ill persons staying  with  them.\r\n\r\nFamilies  of such patients, and neighbours  alike,\r\n\r\nrequest  for  transfers to  other  flats,  in  one\r\n\r\ninstance,  a  patient  pounded  on  the  doors  of\r\n\r\nneighbouring flats in the middle of the night.  In\r\n\r\nanother  instance,  a patient consistently  abused\r\n\r\nand threatened her neighbours, although she turned\r\n\r\nout to be harmless. There are other instances, but\r\n\r\nit would take too long a time for me to elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital  authorities have been very helpful  when\r\n\r\nsuch cases are referred to them. The patients  are\r\n\r\nreadmitted but discharged again after a period  of\r\n\r\nobservation and treatment. The solution  does  not\r\n\r\nend  there.  What  we need is a place,  preferably\r\n\r\noutside  the  Hospital, where discharged  patients\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken care of or trained to do  something\r\n\r\nuseful, maybe on the lines of the Trafalgar Home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> A person whose sleep is\r\n\r\ninterrupted every few hours is not going to  be  a\r\n\r\nperson with good judgment in emergency cases.  Are\r\n\r\nour  citizens, who are sick in hospital,  made  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  at  the  hands of doctors,  who  have  had\r\n\r\ninsufficient rest? Surely it is inhuman to make  a\r\n\r\nperson  work  under such tiring circumstances.  No\r\n\r\nwonder,  despite  all the incentives  in  pay  and\r\n\r\npromotion  prospects, there  is  a  high  rate  of\r\n\r\nresignation among doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also ask the Minister why the Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad  General Hospital does not deal with compound\r\n\r\nfracture  cases?  Recently, a person  in  a  chase\r\n\r\nafter some boys, fractured an arm and was taken to\r\n\r\nthe Thomson Road General Hospital. The authorities\r\n\r\nmade  the poor man wait for more than two hours  I\r\n\r\nmean two hours - before advising him to go to  the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road  General Hospital as  there  were  no\r\n\r\nfacilities available at that hospital.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nmake  boast  of our hospital service  if  we  have\r\n\r\ncases  like this. I wonder how many citizens  have\r\n\r\nbeen   made   to  suffer  unnecessarily   by   the\r\n\r\nauthorities of this particular hospital. According\r\n\r\nto  the  numerous complaints in the newspapers,  I\r\n\r\nguess  there  must have been many cases.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister do something about this matter and remedy\r\n\r\nthe situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know how long does the\r\n\r\nemergency ward in the Outram Road General Hospital\r\n\r\ntake  to deal with emergency cases. Recently there\r\n\r\nwas an old lady suffering from a heart attack. She\r\n\r\nwas  taken  to the hospital by an ambulance  at  8\r\n\r\na.m, and was put in one corner unattended till  10\r\n\r\na.m.  I  wonder why the hospital authorities  take\r\n\r\nsuch a long time to deal with emergency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases.   Either  the  doctors  cannot  cope   with\r\n\r\nemergency  cases or something is  wrong  with  the\r\n\r\nsection.  Can the Minister do something to  remedy\r\n\r\nthe  situation  at  the  Emergency  Ward?  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  only one case, but I am sure there  are\r\n\r\nmany  other  similar cases which might  have  cost\r\n\r\nsome lives as a result of such delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise, Sir, is a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  I  received from a  patient  that  some\r\n\r\nhospital  nurses,  who  attend  to  patients,  are\r\n\r\nunable  to make out the prescriptions of medicines\r\n\r\nwritten  in the case-history of patients which  is\r\n\r\nkept beside the patient. The complaint was that  a\r\n\r\nnurse, in going through a case-history, was  heard\r\n\r\nto  have told another nurse that she presumed  the\r\n\r\nmedicine  should be this and that.  This  sort  of\r\n\r\npresumption  is not a playful matter  because  the\r\n\r\nmedicine given to the patients could be the  wrong\r\n\r\none  and  might cause mishaps eventually. Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister    look    into   this    complaint    of\r\n\r\n\"presumptions\" by nurses and see that they do  not\r\n\r\ndiscuss  such matters in front of patients,  which\r\n\r\nmay  cause  worry to the patients who are  on  the\r\n\r\nsick bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave just heard some complaints about the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health as well as the medical practitioners.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  pretend to answer for any of these.  Sir,\r\n\r\nhalf   a  year  ago  during  the  debate  on   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address  in  this  House,  I   raised\r\n\r\ncertain issues about health and hospitals. At this\r\n\r\nsitting of Parliament, allow me to bring to  light\r\n\r\nagain these problems facing the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nand  the  good  health of our citizens  today  and\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with pride, Sir, to note, if not with\r\n\r\nassurance,  that the standard of health  care  and\r\n\r\nthe facilities available in Singapore is today the\r\n\r\nbest  in  Southeast Asia. The Minister for  Health\r\n\r\nhas  recently announced plans for the construction\r\n\r\nof  new hospitals in the years to come. This, I am\r\n\r\nsure  will further boost the Republic as a  health\r\n\r\ncentre in this part of the world. Already an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasing number of patients have come here  from\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries  to  seek  expert  medical\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in the salary revision exercise for\r\n\r\nsenior  Division I officers, additional incentives\r\n\r\nwere  given  to consultant medical specialists  to\r\n\r\nremain in service. This is a positive step to slow\r\n\r\ndown  the  drain of the specialists into the  more\r\n\r\nattractive  and  more  lucrative  private  sector.\r\n\r\nHowever,  salary  and service conditions  for  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of institutional doctors, dentists,\r\n\r\npharmacists,  nurses  and other  ancillary  staff,\r\n\r\nremain  much the same. It seems imperative  to  me\r\n\r\nthat corrective adjustments in terms of salary and\r\n\r\nservice  conditions must be  made  if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nprevent the present trend, short of an exodus,  of\r\n\r\nmoving  into  the private sector. A hospital  with\r\n\r\ntop  specialists  but  inadequately  supported  by\r\n\r\njunior specialists and doctors is no good hospital\r\n\r\nat  all.  In  other words, it is like  a  military\r\n\r\nestablishment with generals and no army.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  more  disturbing  is  the  shocking  and\r\n\r\nescalating  trend  today  for  fewer   and   fewer\r\n\r\nstudents  from  our schools to enter  the  medical\r\n\r\nschools   and  elect  medicine  for  a   life-time\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in Singapore today on science and\r\n\r\ntechnology is necessary and unquestionable at this\r\n\r\nstage  of  national  development.  However,   this\r\n\r\nemphasis  has  unfortunately taken  its  toll  and\r\n\r\namputated, quite inadvertently, one of  the  limbs\r\n\r\nof   essential  services,  i.e, the  medical  and\r\n\r\nassociated services. Singapore today has a  doctor\r\n\r\npopulation   of  approximately  1,500   registered\r\n\r\npractitioners.  This  gives  a  doctor  population\r\n\r\nratio   of   1:1,300  or  1:1,400.  Many   Western\r\n\r\ncountries  have attained the figure of 1:500,  and\r\n\r\nthey  still continue to face a shortage of doctors\r\n\r\nand its related problems. If I were to proceed  in\r\n\r\nmy  analysis  and take the figure of  1:750  as  a\r\n\r\ndesirable  ratio to work on - I have  chosen  this\r\n\r\nfigure  in  view of the enhanced living  standards\r\n\r\nand   sophistication  and,   again,   the   rising\r\n\r\nexpectations of the people -- we are  today  short\r\n\r\nof at least 1,000 doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing for this shortage, and the exercise of\r\n\r\nnatural deaths and unnatural accidents, we need at\r\n\r\nleast between 100 and 120 new doctors annually  to\r\n\r\njoin  the ranks of the medical profession.  Do  we\r\n\r\nhave these many doctors graduating every year?  As\r\n\r\nit   is,   Government  medical  institutions   are\r\n\r\nunderstaffed.  What  with  projected   plans   for\r\n\r\nsetting  up  new  hospitals? I  have  chosen  this\r\n\r\nsitting  of  Parliament to highlight this  serious\r\n\r\nand,  I  think, potentially catastrophic  problem.\r\n\r\nSir,  if  I  may  submit figures to illustrate  my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the medical school today, from Year 5 to Year 1, the number of medical students divided into citizens and non-citizens are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                  Singapore     Non-\r\n\r\n                   citizens   citizens\r\n\r\n     Year 5           87         30\r\n\r\n     Year 4           69         27\r\n\r\n     Year 3           54         55\r\n\r\n     Year 2           54         58\r\n\r\n     Year 1           38         87\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>You  will  notice  that for the non-citizens,  the\r\n\r\nratio  is  completely reversed.  To  analyse  this\r\n\r\nfigure,  let  us  take  the final  and  first-year\r\n\r\nstudents  ratio.  Final year, 30 non-citizens,  87\r\n\r\nSingaporeans. First year, exactly the reverse,  87\r\n\r\nnon-citizens and 38 Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Dental Faculty, a greater disparity is shown:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                  Singapore     Non-\r\n\r\n                   citizens   citizens\r\n\r\nFinal year            14         20\r\n\r\nThird year             3         35\r\n\r\nSecond year            3         32\r\n\r\nFirst year             8         37\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>For the School of Pharmacy, the figures are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                  Singapore     Non-\r\n\r\n                   citizens   citizens\r\n\r\nFinal year            10         10\r\n\r\nSecond year            6         17\r\n\r\nFirst year             7         19\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, in the medical school, the number\r\n\r\nof Singapore students has dropped from 74 per cent\r\n\r\nto  a  low  of 30 per cent. In the Dental Faculty,\r\n\r\nonly   28   out  of  152  students  are  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. In the School of Pharmacy, only  23  out\r\n\r\nof 69, that is 1:3, are citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need dental surgeons very badly. We  need\r\n\r\npharmacists very badly, and we are also  short  of\r\n\r\ndoctors. The various professional bodies can, I am\r\n\r\nsure,  provide  more  detailed  analyses  if   the\r\n\r\nfigures  I  have just given are not sufficient  to\r\n\r\nwake  the authorities concerned. To my mind, there\r\n\r\nare four approaches to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Ministry of Education, in streaming\r\n\r\nstudents  in the late secondary and pre-university\r\n\r\nclasses,  must  advise students or allow  them  to\r\n\r\nchoose   subjects  that  will  give  them  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility.  There should be  room  for  them  to\r\n\r\nchoose  in  gaining admissions to  the  university\r\n\r\nbetween  Science,  Engineering,  or  Medical   and\r\n\r\nassociated schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A question of motivation. Parents and\r\n\r\nstudents  must  be made fully aware  of  good  job\r\n\r\nprospects   and  also  of  the  present   manpower\r\n\r\nshortage  problem in the Health Ministry,  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals and related professions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A greater incentive must be provided in terms\r\n\r\nof salary and service conditions. Of course, pride\r\n\r\nand  interest  in the profession,  dedication  and\r\n\r\nmobility   of  the  career  must  also  be   major\r\n\r\nconsiderations in electing careers for our  school\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The question of recruitment of non-citizens\r\n\r\ninto  our medical institutions. Over the past  few\r\n\r\nyears  an  increasing number of non-citizens  have\r\n\r\nbeen recruited into our expanding medical service.\r\n\r\nThe non-citizens in this year's medical graduating\r\n\r\nclass  have all      been issued with forms asking\r\n\r\nthem  to apply houseman's jobs in Singapore.  With\r\n\r\nthe figures I have given, I guess we shall have to\r\n\r\ndo  the same next year, the year following and the\r\n\r\nyear following. However, past experience has shown\r\n\r\nthat  many, if not most, of these new doctors have\r\n\r\ntaken  up  appointment  as housemen  only  to  get\r\n\r\nthemselves  fully  registered  in  Singapore.  And\r\n\r\nthen,  using  Singapore as a stepping stone,  they\r\n\r\nleave   for  Australia,  the  United  States,   or\r\n\r\nEngland, or back to where they have come  from.  I\r\n\r\nmust admit that some stayed behind, but the number\r\n\r\nis small. Further, we have recruited an increasing\r\n\r\nnumber of specialists from the Indian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsub-continent states to help us run  our  existing\r\n\r\nservice. I do not wish at this stage to enter into\r\n\r\na  discussion  as  to the merits  or  demerits  of\r\n\r\nrecruiting foreigners into our essential services.\r\n\r\nUnless steps are taken to get our own citizens  to\r\n\r\nrun the store, I can well imagine that with time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Ong, you have already\r\n\r\nspoken  for ten minutes. May I remind hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat  the  guillotine time for this Head  is  3.00\r\n\r\np.m. Mr Chua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first answer\r\n\r\nthe last speaker, i.e, the Member for Kim Seng.  I\r\n\r\nhave  very little to quarrel with what he has just\r\n\r\nsaid.  With regard to shortage of doctors,  if  he\r\n\r\nhad, in fact, followed some of my speeches made as\r\n\r\nfar back as 18 months ago, he would have heard  me\r\n\r\nsay  that  because of our expanding  programme  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  for the medical specialities  and  so\r\n\r\non, we would be short of doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards recruitment of - doctors, since we are\r\n\r\nshort of doctors, we cannot he very discriminating\r\n\r\nas  to  whether they are citizens or non-citizens.\r\n\r\nIf  we have our own citizens among them, they will\r\n\r\nbe   given  first  choice.  If  we  have  not  got\r\n\r\napplications  from our citizens, we  recruit  non-citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the intake of students\r\n\r\nin  the medical school. We have done our very best\r\n\r\nto  encourage  students to  go  into  the  medical\r\n\r\nschool  and,  after graduation, to come  into  our\r\n\r\nservice.  One of the steps which the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  has done was to have a traineeship  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  ordinary  doctors  can  at  the  shortest\r\n\r\npossible   time  qualify  themselves   to   become\r\n\r\nspecialists.  That, in itself, has  been  quite  a\r\n\r\ngreat attraction to many medical officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of conditions of service and pay of\r\n\r\nordinary  doctors and nurses, may I say  that,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  nurses  are  concerned,  a  decision  was\r\n\r\nrecently handed down by the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt.  In fact, the Court made  awards  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  salaries of nurses quite substantially\r\n\r\nand  it  even  elevated the divisional  status  of\r\n\r\nnurses. Therefore, I would say that the terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of service and pay of the  nurses  are\r\n\r\nnow  on par with the other services which have got\r\n\r\nsalary  revisions. The' other point about ordinary\r\n\r\ndoctors  is a matter which, I think, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance did indicate that as far as the lower\r\n\r\nechelon  of  the  civil service  is  concerned,  a\r\n\r\nrevision  of their salaries will take place.  That\r\n\r\nis a matter which squarely rests with the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nconcerns  mental cases which have been  discharged\r\n\r\nfrom  Woodbridge Hospital. I fully sympathise with\r\n\r\nthe  plight  of some of the families who  have  to\r\n\r\ntake back their relatives who have been discharged\r\n\r\nfrom the Woodbridge Hospital. May I say this:  the\r\n\r\nmodern  trend  in  psychiatric care  is  to  admit\r\n\r\nmentally-ill patients into a psychiatric  hospital\r\n\r\nonly if they require active psychiatric treatment.\r\n\r\nAs  far as possible, patients should be treated as\r\n\r\noutpatients  so  that  they will  not  lose  their\r\n\r\nconnection  with their families and the community.\r\n\r\nThis  method  of treatment is not only  economical\r\n\r\nbut    it   also   prevents   the   patient   from\r\n\r\ndeteriorating as a result of prolonged stay in  an\r\n\r\ninstitution. Outpatient management does in certain\r\n\r\ninstances  result in a social problem to  families\r\n\r\nand  neighbours,  especially if  they  stay  in  a\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flat, as stated by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh. The solution is to develop psychiatric\r\n\r\nday-centres, and it is intended to include this in\r\n\r\nthe  future development of the Outram Road General\r\n\r\nHospital.  Such day-centres sometimes referred  to\r\n\r\nas  day  hospitals are, in fact, identical to  the\r\n\r\ncreche  that  we  see  in our  community.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  a  half-way home  i  being  set  up  in\r\n\r\nSembawang - perhaps the Member for Sembawang  will\r\n\r\ntake  note of this -  for mental patients who  are\r\n\r\nabout  to  be discharged from Woodbridge Hospital.\r\n\r\nThis half-way home is to rehabilitate them and  to\r\n\r\nreadjust them back to normal life with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir families, so that they will not be a problem\r\n\r\nto  their  families  when they  eventually  return\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned the case of a\r\n\r\npatient  who went to Thomson Road General Hospital\r\n\r\nbut  could not get himself treated for a  compound\r\n\r\nfracture. May I correct the misapprehension of the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson? He thinks that all hospitals can\r\n\r\ndeal  with complicated cases. In fact, if you have\r\n\r\na compound fracture, it is an orthopaedic case. It\r\n\r\nis  a  case for the specialist. As far as  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad  General Hospital is concerned, it is not  as\r\n\r\nbig a hospital as Outram Road General Hospital. It\r\n\r\nhas  less  than 400 beds, and it is therefore  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  provide  every  speciality  in  that\r\n\r\nparticular  hospital. Orthopaedic surgery  is  one\r\n\r\nspeciality  which  cannot  be  provided  in   the\r\n\r\nThomson Road General Hospital. Therefore, if there\r\n\r\nis  a  case of complicated fracture, it has to  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the Orthopaedic Unit of  the  Outram\r\n\r\nRoad General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case in question, which the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nbrought up, is this: when the patient came  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  Thomson  Road General Hospital,  the  surgeon\r\n\r\nthere wanted to deal with the case on an emergency\r\n\r\nbasis. At the same time the surgeon did explain to\r\n\r\nthe  patient that it would be better  if  he  were\r\n\r\ntreated in the Orthopaedic Unit of the Outram Road\r\n\r\nGeneral   Hospital.  The  father  of  the  patient\r\n\r\nconcerned was quite happy to go to the Outram Road\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital, instead of being treated  first\r\n\r\non a preliminary basis in the Thomson Road General\r\n\r\nHospital. Of course, in that event he had to  wait\r\n\r\nbecause   the  orthopaedic  surgeon  had   to   be\r\n\r\ncontacted.  In fact, the orthopaedic  surgeon  was\r\n\r\neventually contacted, and the patient was sent  to\r\n\r\nthe Outram. Road General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is guillotine time.

(*See footnote, cols. 935-6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity, on behalf of my constituents, to make\r\n\r\na  request  to  the authorities in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road General Hospital. This request  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  people  who live in Hospital quarters.  They\r\n\r\nare  Grade III Medical and Health servants  living\r\n\r\nin the quarters at Outram Road. These low-salaried\r\n\r\nstaff  occupy quarters at a low rent, which  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  reasonable move of the Government.  But  the\r\n\r\nproblem  is that these quarters are too  old,  and\r\n\r\nthe facilities are too basic and inadequate. Those\r\n\r\nwho live there have to share a communal kitchen, a\r\n\r\ncommunal  toilet and also a communal bathroom  for\r\n\r\ntheir showers. There are many other inconveniences\r\n\r\nin  these quarters. Very often they quarrel  among\r\n\r\nthemselves   over  the  use  of   these   communal\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that if one occupant unfortunately passes away, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  dismissed from the service for one  reason  or\r\n\r\nanother, or retires when he reaches the age,  then\r\n\r\nhis family cannot continue to occupy the quarters.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, we all know that  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  it  is  not  easy to look  for  alternative\r\n\r\nhousing.  If a person applies for a Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat,  he will have to wait for a few years before\r\n\r\nhe  gets  his chance. But we know that the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board  does  give  priority   to\r\n\r\ncertain applicants under special circumstances. In\r\n\r\nany case, at very short notice, it is not easy  to\r\n\r\nlook for a place to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accommodation is one of the most important things\r\n\r\nin   life.   Under   the  present   circumstances,\r\n\r\ntherefore, these people whom I have mentioned have\r\n\r\nthis  request to make. They would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned to make  arrangements  with\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board  so that they  can  move  into\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats. From my investigations, among\r\n\r\nthese  people  who  live in  these  quarters,  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of them have already applied  either  to\r\n\r\nbuy  or  to  rent  Housing Board  flats.  But  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board will not give priority to them.  So\r\n\r\nthey  are requesting the authorities concerned  to\r\n\r\nliaise  with  the  Housing  Board  in  order  that\r\n\r\npriority  can  be given to their applications  for\r\n\r\nflats,  so that the Government could demolish  the\r\n\r\nold  quarters  and  use the land  for  some  other\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, these quarters, which the\r\n\r\nMember for Tiong Bahru referred to, were built  by\r\n\r\nthe  former  Singapore Improvement Trust  for  the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road General Hospital.

The Police Department comes  under\r\n\r\nthis Ministry, and therefore it has the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduty  and responsibility to maintain law and order\r\n\r\nin  our society. In recent years, the Police  have\r\n\r\nimproved  their  efficiency and relationship  with\r\n\r\nthe  people. This is something which deserves  our\r\n\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few questions to raise here. In\r\n\r\nrecent  years the corrosive influence  of  Western\r\n\r\ncountries, particularly the hippy sub-culture from\r\n\r\nabroad, has caused certain undesirable effects  on\r\n\r\nour  youths. One of the bad influences is that our\r\n\r\nyoung  people  are now sporting  long  hair  as  a\r\n\r\nfashion. They would grow their hair down to  their\r\n\r\nshoulders. Some of them sport a rather long beard,\r\n\r\neven  though  they  are  very  young.  They  adorn\r\n\r\nthemselves with all kinds of fancy clothes.  Their\r\n\r\nbehaviour really poses a social problem. The craze\r\n\r\nfor  long  hair has become more prevalent  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety. It is now one of the many social problems\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  to face. It is also  one  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems which parents have to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give an example. I have a friend who\r\n\r\nhas a son between 18 and 19 years of age. This boy\r\n\r\nkeeps very long hair and is causing a lot of worry\r\n\r\nto his mother, who has a tender heart. She used to\r\n\r\ngive  him  advice now and again, but  without  any\r\n\r\nresult.  This angered her very much. She  told  me\r\n\r\nthat  she  hoped the Government would take  action\r\n\r\nagainst the practice of keeping long hair, and she\r\n\r\neven  hoped that the Police would cut off the long\r\n\r\nhair of these youths. I feel that this is a social\r\n\r\nproblem  which  many parents are  facing.  Parents\r\n\r\nusually  do  not like long hair. It  is  only  the\r\n\r\nyoung  people  who sport long hair  as  a  fashion\r\n\r\nnowadays.  We  have also found  out  that  certain\r\n\r\nGovernment servants, for example, office boys, are\r\n\r\nnow  keeping  long hair. They even  sport  a  long\r\n\r\nheard.  This is really too much. Even  on  the  TV\r\n\r\nrecently, in a singing contest programme, many  of\r\n\r\nthe  participants  had long  hair  down  to  their\r\n\r\nshoulders. They also behaved in a wild manner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  caused  many of us to shake  our  heads.  I\r\n\r\nremember sometime ago the RTS took strict measures\r\n\r\nto prohibit people with long hair from taking part\r\n\r\nin  any  competition. I do not  know  why  it  has\r\n\r\nrelaxed this ruling. Is it because the authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  have  forgotten about the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy against long hair?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a young and dynamic state. We\r\n\r\nshould therefore maintain a good social vogue  and\r\n\r\ntradition. We should teach our citizens to behave,\r\n\r\nwear  tidy clothes and maintain a good appearance.\r\n\r\nI  would,  therefore, like the  Minister  to  take\r\n\r\naction  to  prevent any undesirable practice  from\r\n\r\ngaining a strong hold on our young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Ministry of Home Affairs had\r\n\r\nissued  an  order  that  all  Government  servants\r\n\r\nshould  give the cold shoulder to any  youth  with\r\n\r\nlong   hair,   should  he  come  to  a  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  on any matter. People with  long  hair\r\n\r\nwere  placed at the end of the queue. But it seems\r\n\r\nthat this ruling has now been forgotten. The civil\r\n\r\nservants  do  not impose this ruling when  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  members of the public who keep long hair.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  will pay  attention  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  is  the question of the  recruitment  of\r\n\r\npolicemen. According to my understanding,  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Police recruitment exercise  most  of  the\r\n\r\napplicants came from Malaysia. A large  number  of\r\n\r\nour  local citizens did not come forward  to  join\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Force. This is not a good  sign.  The\r\n\r\nPolice have the important task of maintaining  law\r\n\r\nand  order in our country. The Police Force should\r\n\r\nconsist of people who are loyal to our country and\r\n\r\nfaithful  to  our citizens. They should  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to protect the lives and property of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore, I am of the  opinion  that  an\r\n\r\nimportant establishment, such as the Police Force,\r\n\r\nshould be filled by our local citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now why is it that our local citizens are not\r\n\r\ninterested  in  joining the Police  Force?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause the pay of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice Force is very low? What I know is that  the\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  for  the Police  Force  have  been\r\n\r\nrevised to some extent. Is it because the work  is\r\n\r\ntoo laborious? If it is, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  look  into  the  matter and to  take  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise is that if our\r\n\r\nmale  citizens do not want to become policemen,  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether we can recruit more women into  our\r\n\r\nPolice Force. We have found that recently quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  our traffic police are women.  I  find\r\n\r\nthat they are quite efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House have repeatedly brought up the subject\r\n\r\nof road accidents which have been increasing at an\r\n\r\nalarming  rate. Apparently measures taken  by  the\r\n\r\nrelevant   authorities   have   not   been    very\r\n\r\nsuccessful. In 1972, 3,982 vehicles were  involved\r\n\r\nin  serious and fatal accidents. Along  the  Jalan\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh expressway, for instance, in 1970 there\r\n\r\nwere  55  accidents, one fatal. Between  1971  and\r\n\r\n1972,  for over a period of 12 months, the  number\r\n\r\nof   accidents   increased  to  97,   with   seven\r\n\r\nfatalities. One more case died a few months ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that the traffic police\r\n\r\nhad conducted a survey on this stretch of the road\r\n\r\nand  had  made  recommendations  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\naccidents,  including the provision of  pedestrian\r\n\r\ncrossings. I wonder whether a thorough survey  has\r\n\r\nbeen made in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  are  aware of  the  following  facts.\r\n\r\nFirst,  trishaws,  cyclists  and  pedestrians  are\r\n\r\nprohibited  from using the flyover at  Toa  Payoh.\r\n\r\nTherefore, such road users, from the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nof  St.  Michael's Estate and Balestier Road,  are\r\n\r\ncompelled to make a crossing over this stretch  of\r\n\r\nroad, approximately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100  yards from each side of the junction  of  Kim\r\n\r\nKeat  Road and Jalan Toa Payoh, in order to  avoid\r\n\r\ntravelling  a  distance  of  two  miles  from  the\r\n\r\nThomson  Road  approach. Secondly, such  crossings\r\n\r\nare  usually  made during peak hours and  at  dusk\r\n\r\nbetween 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. when visibility is\r\n\r\nvery  poor.  I would suggest that to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation the traffic police should look into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  providing a safer passage  for  this\r\n\r\ngroup of road users by putting up Slow signs  near\r\n\r\nthis  stretch  of the road. There should  also  be\r\n\r\nspecial  lighting at the junction,  and  increased\r\n\r\nvigilance  by the traffic police to apprehend  the\r\n\r\nspeedsters  and  also  to  confine  vehicles  with\r\n\r\nrestricted speeds to specific lanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The authorities  are\r\n\r\nnow  issuing permits for street processions, which\r\n\r\nare  somewhat restricted. I wonder why the  Police\r\n\r\nshould deem fit to reject some of the applications\r\n\r\nfor  permits for street procession without  giving\r\n\r\nany reasonable explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to make an appeal in this Chamber on\r\n\r\nthis matter because the street procession is a vow\r\n\r\nthat  some religious groups have made, and it  has\r\n\r\nsince been a tradition. Therefore, where religious\r\n\r\nmatters  arc  concerned, I feel that the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  consider relaxing the rules for the  issue\r\n\r\nof  such  permits. If it is a question of security\r\n\r\nmeasures that these permits have not been granted,\r\n\r\nthen  I would call upon the Minister to send  more\r\n\r\nsecurity officers to the procession to see that it\r\n\r\nis being carried out peacefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Almost every regulation imposed  by\r\n\r\nthe  traffic police is conspicuously more honoured\r\n\r\nin  its  breach than in its observance.  There  is\r\n\r\nscant regard for speed limits. Lorries, which  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to go at 20 miles per hour,  more  often\r\n\r\nthan  not travel at about double that speed, fully\r\n\r\nloaded. Cars generally go at least about 10  miles\r\n\r\nper hour faster than they are supposed to go. This\r\n\r\noccurs  in  many accident prone areas. In  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency,  at a particularly  notorious  bend,\r\n\r\nthe   traffic  police  have  caused  many  clearly\r\n\r\nvisible signs to be displayed, urging motorists to\r\n\r\nslow  down to 20 miles per hour. As far as I  have\r\n\r\nobserved, only pedestrians pay attention  to  this\r\n\r\nsign.  And  there  are also vehicles  that  travel\r\n\r\nslowly  in  the wrong lane -going along a  40-mile\r\n\r\nper  hour highway at about 15 or 20 miles per hour\r\n\r\n-causing  obstruction and inducing other motorists\r\n\r\nto  weave  in and out. Forming up correctly  at  a\r\n\r\njunction before making a right-turn is a procedure\r\n\r\nwhich  only  a few motorists are aware of.  Double\r\n\r\nwhite  lines  are  appreciated  possibly  for  the\r\n\r\nmeticulous way the P.W.D, has drawn them!  Traffic\r\n\r\nlights are ignored even when they have turned red.\r\n\r\nPedestrians do not use overhead bridges.  I  could\r\n\r\ngo  on  with this litany, Sir, but I think I  have\r\n\r\nmade my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the rule of the bully that\r\n\r\nprevails  on  the road. It is the regime  of  one-upsmanship. It is \"big fish eat little fish\", with\r\n\r\ncement-mixer trucks, buses, heavy vehicles playing\r\n\r\nthe  role  of the bold, had baron on the  highway,\r\n\r\nand pedestrians being assigned to the lowest order\r\n\r\nof  life,  with the weak and old among this  breed\r\n\r\nbeing regularly assassinated. In the circumstances\r\n\r\nof  what  I have outlined, Sir, I feel a  profound\r\n\r\npity  for  our Traffic Police Chief.  He  must  be\r\n\r\nfeeling  like the Dutch boy in the story, who  had\r\n\r\nhis  finger  in a hole in a dyke. He was  doing  a\r\n\r\nheroic job but with quite inadequate resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> What about the Safety First Council?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> The least said about that, the\r\n\r\nsoonest mended, Sir,I am told that the number  of\r\n\r\nbookings  for traffic offences is phenomenal.  Yet\r\n\r\noffences  seem to continue to increase.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  being swamped by a flood of vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\nTo  add  to  the  dismay of  our  vehicle  control\r\n\r\nauthorities,  we  have  today  large   number   of\r\n\r\nvehicles,  not  bearing Singapore  number  plates,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  able  to  defy  our  regulations  with\r\n\r\nimpunity.    Obviously,   Sir,   a   comprehensive\r\n\r\nretooling  of  the  way  we  enforce  our  traffic\r\n\r\nregulations is called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few suggestions to make:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) There should be more mobile enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers; equipped with radio communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) These officers should be trained to educate\r\n\r\nas well as book drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Where education is concerned, it is the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of all Government and statutory  bodies\r\n\r\nto act in this regard in a concerted way. Just as\r\n\r\na  matter  of one example, when senior Government\r\n\r\nofficers drive around, they could be on the look-out  for  infractions on the part of vehicles  in\r\n\r\ntheir Ministries. In the case of the Police,  all\r\n\r\npolice  patrols  and  not merely  traffic  police\r\n\r\nshould  take notice of traffic offences and  help\r\n\r\neducate  or  book  offenders.  In  the  case   of\r\n\r\nselective  enforcement operations, it  may  be  a\r\n\r\ngood idea to give wide publicity to the nature of\r\n\r\nthe   offence   that  will  come  under   special\r\n\r\nenforcement  action.  This  is  to  give   notice\r\n\r\nbeforehand.  Wide publicity and  the  mass  media\r\n\r\nshould  be  more  extensively  used  to  acquaint\r\n\r\npeople  with a particular regulation  each  time.\r\n\r\nThis  educational process should he a  continuing\r\n\r\none,  and should not be carried out only for  the\r\n\r\nduration   of  a  campaign,  whoever   may   have\r\n\r\norganised it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The penalties for traffic offences should be\r\n\r\nreviewed. There should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater   use  of  licence  suspension  and   even\r\n\r\nrevocation  of licence where danger  to  life  has\r\n\r\nbeen  evident. In the case of severe  injuries  or\r\n\r\ndeath  resulting  from a clearly culpable  action,\r\n\r\nimprisonment  is  called for. Owners  of  vehicles\r\n\r\nshould also, to a carefully considered extent,  be\r\n\r\nheld liable for the way their employees drive.  In\r\n\r\nany case, owners should be taught to realise their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  exercising  discipline   over\r\n\r\ntheir employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government should take an extremely serious\r\n\r\nview  of  the sad state of our traffic conditions,\r\n\r\nit is not only because hundreds of lives are being\r\n\r\nlost  every year, and thousands are being injured,\r\n\r\nand  tens of thousands of accidents are occurring,\r\n\r\nbut  because fundamentally all this shows a  scant\r\n\r\nhuman  regard of one citizen for another. This  is\r\n\r\npart  of a social malaise, like drug-taking, crime\r\n\r\nand  delinquency. The Minister for  Home  Affairs,\r\n\r\nand  also  in  his  capacity as the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth,  will  doubtless agree that  if  the  body\r\n\r\npolitic   is   showing  signs  of   sickness   and\r\n\r\ntherapeutic measures are inadequate, then a  major\r\n\r\noperation is called for. In this, it is the entire\r\n\r\nGovernment   that   should  participate   in   the\r\n\r\nexercise, and not merely one or two Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  fantastic  increase  in  the  number   of\r\n\r\nvehicles  on  our  roads during the  last  decade.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  is  a  continuous  widening   and\r\n\r\nimprovement  of our road system to cope  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease in traffic, yet our traffic police  force\r\n\r\nhas not kept pace with this increase. As a result,\r\n\r\nit   is  a  common  sight  daily  to  see  drivers\r\n\r\nviolating every traffic rule on the roads. Matters\r\n\r\nare  being made worse by our bus and lorry drivers\r\n\r\nwho  seem  to think that they are the untouchables\r\n\r\nin the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the strength of the traffic police be\r\n\r\nincreased   before  we  experience  a   disorderly\r\n\r\nsociety giving vent to its feelings on the  roads?\r\n\r\nThe  road  seems  to be a place for  irresponsible\r\n\r\nbehaviour  on  the  part  of  our  young   drivers\r\n\r\nparticularly. There seems to be an alarming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease   in  the  number  of  traffic   offences\r\n\r\nnowadays.   The  very  small  force   of   traffic\r\n\r\npolicemen is not able to cope with the increase in\r\n\r\ntraffic.  Offences of beating the  traffic  lights\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact, ignoring the lights, seem to  take\r\n\r\nplace too often. It is time that the ordinary beat\r\n\r\npoliceman was given the right to book offenders on\r\n\r\nthe  spot.  On  this point, may I suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister that ordinary policemen be posted at  the\r\n\r\nusual congested areas during the peak periods?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, drug addiction is becoming quite prevalent\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.

Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore still need education in many matters\r\n\r\nwhich   involve   their  morals,  especially   our\r\n\r\nteenagers. Most of our youths have been influenced\r\n\r\nby  fashions and cultures from the West.  Whatever\r\n\r\nfashion  and culture that come from the  West  are\r\n\r\nconsidered modern fashion and culture. But  if  we\r\n\r\nscrutinise and analyse most of these fashions  and\r\n\r\ncultures,  we find that they belong to  the  stone\r\n\r\nage, and our youths imitate these fashions without\r\n\r\nconsidering whether they are good or bad. If I  am\r\n\r\nnot  mistaken,  Sir, the Minister of  Defence  has\r\n\r\ncondemned the youths who imitate Western  fashions\r\n\r\nas  WOGs, or Western-oriented gentlemen, the steel\r\n\r\nguitar  music  as outrageous, and the  youths  who\r\n\r\nsport long hair as hippies. I agree with the views\r\n\r\nof the Minister of Defence. But what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  the  gentlemen who wear neckties and  those\r\n\r\nwho  play golf? Are they also WOGs? What I regret,\r\n\r\nSir,  is the attitude of the Government in respect\r\n\r\nof  these  matters. The authorities concerned  are\r\n\r\nnot  firm  in  dealing with them. On one  previous\r\n\r\noccasion,  the Police and Immigration took  action\r\n\r\nagainst youths who sport long hair, but there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  follow-up. The Ministry of  Finance  has\r\n\r\nissued  circulars  to Government  departments  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies  to  take action  against  their\r\n\r\nstaff  who  sport long hair, and to  serve  people\r\n\r\nwith   long   hair   last.   Nevertheless,   these\r\n\r\ninstructions  are  not  followed,  and  there  are\r\n\r\nsenior officers who still sport long hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of WOG society, although the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence has condemned these  youths,\r\n\r\nthe  Trade  Division still allows  the  import  of\r\n\r\nnylon stockings and records with outrageous music.\r\n\r\nIf   the  Government  is  sincere  and  wishes  to\r\n\r\neradicate  the  symptoms  which  will  affect  our\r\n\r\nyouths, it should be firm in its stand and  should\r\n\r\nnot  hesitate to take action to ban the import  of\r\n\r\nsilk and nylon stockings and \"bad\" records. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, Sir, if the Government depends on  the\r\n\r\nrevenue from the import of these articles, then do\r\n\r\nnot  condemn the people who admire these fashions.\r\n\r\nIn  my  opinion, a more effective way to eradicate\r\n\r\nthese  fashions  is  to hold campaigns,  like  the\r\n\r\n\"Keep  Singapore  Clean  Campaign\",  \"Garden  City\r\n\r\nCampaign\"   and  similar  campaigns   which   have\r\n\r\nreceived good response in the past. Similarly,  if\r\n\r\nwe organise campaigns along these lines, I am sure\r\n\r\nthe results will be beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that the Police hold\r\n\r\nan anti-vandalism campaign in Singapore because  I\r\n\r\nfind  that at the moment, our society is  not  yet\r\n\r\nappreciative  of public property.  Many  lifts  in\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats are vandalised. Some lifts are\r\n\r\ndisfigured  with  scribbles and obscene  pictures.\r\n\r\nSome  people urinate in the lifts and commit  many\r\n\r\nothers  acts  of  vandalism. Bus shelters,  public\r\n\r\ntelephones and vehicles are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspared.   The   Government  has  to  provide   bus\r\n\r\nshelters, and the Singapore Telephone Board has to\r\n\r\nprovide public telephones. But because of acts  of\r\n\r\nvandalism  by  a small section of the  population,\r\n\r\nmany  people suffer because they cannot use  these\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  times  of emergency.  The  STB  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  provide as many public  telephones  as\r\n\r\npossible  in the urban and rural areas.  But  with\r\n\r\nincreased  acts of vandalism on public telephones,\r\n\r\nthe   efforts   of  the  STB  to  maintain   these\r\n\r\ntelephones  have not been fruitful. Every  time  a\r\n\r\ntelephone   is   repaired,  it   would   only   be\r\n\r\nserviceable  for  one or two weeks  at  the  most.\r\n\r\nAfter  that,  these people with low  morals  would\r\n\r\ncommit  the act of vandalism. Therefore,  the  STB\r\n\r\nhas   experienced   losses  in  repairing   public\r\n\r\ntelephones. So I hope that in launching this anti-vandalism  campaign, the Police  can  educate  our\r\n\r\nsociety  to  appreciate  public  property  and  to\r\n\r\nimpose heavy penalties on those who commit acts of\r\n\r\nvandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to take the point  about  traffic,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  brought up by  the  Members  for\r\n\r\nKatong, Toa Payoh and Anson. I entirely agree with\r\n\r\nthem  that  the traffic situation in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  a serious problem, especially  with  the\r\n\r\nincreasing number of road accidents. However,  may\r\n\r\n1 point out the prevention of traffic accidents is\r\n\r\nnot the sole responsibility of the traffic police,\r\n\r\nit   also   concerns  departments  in  the   other\r\n\r\nMinistries. Therefore, the traffic police maintain\r\n\r\nclose  liaison with the PWD and the ROV to improve\r\n\r\ntraffic  facilities, such as devising  schemes  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  vehicular and pedestrian movements  on\r\n\r\nthe road, and introducing necessary legislation to\r\n\r\nenhance  road safety. In fact, they have  recently\r\n\r\nformed    art   Accident   Prevention    Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting    of    representatives    of    these\r\n\r\ndepartments. A selective enforcement squad  within\r\n\r\nthe traffic police was formed in October, 1972, to\r\n\r\ncarry  out more effectively the selective  enforce\r\n\r\nment policy in respect of specific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffences. Besides, the traffic police initiate  as\r\n\r\nwell   as  participate  actively  in  road  safety\r\n\r\ncampaigns, which are always extensively publicised\r\n\r\nthrough  the mass media. Towards the end  of  last\r\n\r\nyear  the  traffic police launched a  road  safety\r\n\r\ncampaign to educate motorcyclists, scooterists and\r\n\r\ntrishaw-riders. In February this year, as  Members\r\n\r\nare aware, the traffic police also participated in\r\n\r\nthe Road Safety Campaign organised by the National\r\n\r\nSafety    First   Council   and   the   Automobile\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to convictions, may I say that in all\r\n\r\nconvictions in respect of prevalent offences,  the\r\n\r\ntraffic police urge for deterrent sentences. In  a\r\n\r\nrecent  case, a driver was jailed for  six  months\r\n\r\nand  disqualified from driving for five years  for\r\n\r\ncausing  death along Mountbatten Road in  October,\r\n\r\n1972.  Perhaps  that  road is  within  the  Katong\r\n\r\nconstituency. This conviction and disqualification\r\n\r\nwas  widely publicised by the press and  the  RTS.\r\n\r\nThe   traffic   police  recognise   that   traffic\r\n\r\neducation  is  an integral part of Police  traffic\r\n\r\nsupervision  and  make  every  effort,   including\r\n\r\nenlisting  the  assistance of the mass  media,  to\r\n\r\neducate  the  public  on  road  safety.  In   this\r\n\r\nconnection, we are thinking of launching a nation-wide   \"Keep  our  Singapore  Roads  Accident-Free\r\n\r\nCampaign\"  in 1974, along the lines of  the  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean Campaign\". However, in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure the success of such a campaign, we have  to\r\n\r\nput our own house in order first. We are therefore\r\n\r\nreorganising the Traffic Police Department and are\r\n\r\nalso looking into, as suggested by the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong, the traffic legislation with a view to up-dating them so that at the end of the Campaign  we\r\n\r\nwill be in a position to strictly enforce the law.\r\n\r\nIt  will not be possible to achieve success unless\r\n\r\nthis  nation-wide  campaign  succeeds  in  getting\r\n\r\neverybody  to  participate in  it,  not  only  the\r\n\r\nmotorists  but also the pedestrians as well,  just\r\n\r\nas  everybody  was involved in the Keep  Singapore\r\n\r\nClean Campaign. I hope we might be able to get the\r\n\r\nMember for Katong, who is very interested in  this\r\n\r\nsubject, to help us in organising this nation-wide\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, I will help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Of course, the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong  has  experience in this sort  of  campaign\r\n\r\nwhile he was a member of the Safety First Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> The experience will be put to good use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> On the specific point referred\r\n\r\nto  by the Member for Toa Payoh concerning traffic\r\n\r\naccidents in the Toa Payoh constituency, may I say\r\n\r\nthat  the Accident Prevention Committee,  which  I\r\n\r\nreferred  to  just  now, had already  studied  and\r\n\r\nanalysed  the traffic situation in Toa Payoh,  and\r\n\r\nit has taken the following remedial actions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nine of the 27 openings in-between road\r\n\r\ndividers have been closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Traffic lights have been installed at road\r\n\r\njunctions in Toa Payoh East and Lorong 6, Lorong 1\r\n\r\nand  Lorong 2, and Lorong 2 and Toa Payoh Central.\r\n\r\nAn  all-red period has been incorporated into  the\r\n\r\nabove traffic light system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Pedestrian crossing lights will be installed\r\n\r\nalong Lorong 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Installation of pedestrian crossing lights\r\n\r\nat  Lorong 6, near Poi Ching School and  Pei  Chun\r\n\r\nPublic School, is under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is a list of all these remedies, but  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  waste  the time  of  the  House  by\r\n\r\nenumerating them.

May I say that there is  a\r\n\r\nstanding  instruction, contained in  I.M.  No.  2,\r\n\r\nsaying that Government officers must at all  times\r\n\r\nwear   clothing  and  hair  style  that  give   an\r\n\r\nappearance  of  neatness  and  decorum,  and  that\r\n\r\noutlandish or flashy clothings and unduly long and\r\n\r\nunkempt hair styles should be avoided. My Ministry\r\n\r\nhas,  by circular, reminded all its staff of  this\r\n\r\nstanding   instruction  and  requested  heads   of\r\n\r\ndepartments to enforce the rules strictly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, my Ministry has also set up an\r\n\r\nAction Committee, chaired by a very senior officer\r\n\r\nof  my  Ministry,  comprising  representatives  of\r\n\r\nother  Ministries  and  statutory  bodies  to  co-ordinate  action to implement the  anti-long  hair\r\n\r\npolicy.   The   Ministry  of  Finance   which   is\r\n\r\nrepresented  on  this Committee,  in  consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  Public Service Commission,  is  looking\r\n\r\ninto  the question of suitable penalties for civil\r\n\r\nservants   who   contravene  the  instruction   on\r\n\r\nclothing   and   hair  style.  The   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation,  I  understand, has also  directed  all\r\n\r\nschools to ensure that male pupils keep their hair\r\n\r\nshort  and  neat. Assurances of co-operation  also\r\n\r\nhave been received from the institutions of higher\r\n\r\nlearning anti from representatives of the Chambers\r\n\r\nof Commerce. The Ministry of Labour is also paying\r\n\r\ndue  attention to the longhaired males  who  apply\r\n\r\nfor   work   permits.   So  is   the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment,  in  the  case  of  applications   for\r\n\r\nimmigration clearance. Foreigners with long  hair,\r\n\r\nwishing  to  enter  Singapore  on  a  visit,   are\r\n\r\nrequired  to cut their hair short before they  are\r\n\r\nallowed  in at the various check points. Returning\r\n\r\nSingapore  students  with long  unkempt  hair  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  surrender  their  passport  to   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  officers on arrival. Their  passports\r\n\r\nwill be returned to them after they have cut their\r\n\r\nhair  short. Persons with long unkempt  hair  also\r\n\r\nstand the risk of being checked by the Police,  as\r\n\r\nthey  invariably look suspicious. The question  of\r\n\r\nhow  to deal with long-haired performers in  night\r\n\r\nclubs   and  places  of  entertainment  is   under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with the Tourist Promotion  Board  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture. The mass media is also co-operating  not  only by giving less  publicity  to\r\n\r\nlong-haired  characters and their  activities  but\r\n\r\nalso  giving due prominence to speeches by Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament, like some of our Members here, and\r\n\r\nother  responsible persons critical of long  hair.\r\n\r\nThe  National  Sports  Promotion  Board  has  also\r\n\r\nissued  a circular to sports bodies drawing  their\r\n\r\nattention to the anti-long\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhair  rule  and  requesting their co-operation  in\r\n\r\nimplementing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Action Committee, which I have just\r\n\r\nmentioned,  is also discussing as to what  further\r\n\r\neffective action can be taken to discourage  males\r\n\r\nfrom  drifting towards the hedonistic way of  life\r\n\r\nrepresented by long hair and hippism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come to the Member for Anson and his\r\n\r\nreligious  procession? As a rule,  religious  foot\r\n\r\nprocessions  in  the streets are not  allowed.  An\r\n\r\nexception to this rule is Thaipusam kavadis, which\r\n\r\nare  not similar to other foot processions in that\r\n\r\nthey  comprise  individuals who proceed  from  one\r\n\r\ntemple  to  another  in fulfilment  of  individual\r\n\r\nvows. In issuing permit for kavadis, the following\r\n\r\nconditions are imposed: that kavadi carriers  must\r\n\r\nproceed  singly  or in small groups,  and  by  the\r\n\r\nshortest  route to the designated temple.  Permits\r\n\r\nmay  be granted for religious foot processions  to\r\n\r\nbe  held  within the grounds of churches, temples,\r\n\r\nmosques  and suraus. In the case of Kiew  Ong  Yah\r\n\r\nand other religious processions involving deities,\r\n\r\npermits are granted for processions but these  are\r\n\r\nsubject to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Only vehicular processions are allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Distances travelled must be the shortest\r\n\r\npossible route from point to point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) No music, gongs, drums or cymbals shall be\r\n\r\nplayed en route.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The procession will be restricted to small\r\n\r\ngroups in vehicles, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) There shall be no stoppage en route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There   have   been  applications  for   religious\r\n\r\nprocessions  which involve pulling a chariot  with\r\n\r\nbullocks.  This was in connection with processions\r\n\r\non  Lord Krishna's Birthday. As these animals were\r\n\r\nbanned from the streets of Singapore - Members may\r\n\r\nremember  the Cattle Act that we had  passed  some\r\n\r\nyears ago - organisers should consider the use  of\r\n\r\na motorised chariot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Sembawang spoke about\r\n\r\nthe  recruitment of non-citizens into  our  Police\r\n\r\nForce.

It has always been the  aim  to\r\n\r\nfill  all  vacancies  in  the  Police  Force  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens. Unfortunately, in our  recent\r\n\r\nrecruitment  drives, the response  from  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   has  been  poor.  There   are   various\r\n\r\ncontributory factors, one of which is the  raising\r\n\r\nof  the  minimum qualifications for entry. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment   the  qualifications  are  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nCambridge GCE Examination with a minimum of  three\r\n\r\nOrdinary levels, whereas previously a Secondary II\r\n\r\ncertificate  would suffice. Moreover, many  others\r\n\r\nwho have the necessary qualifications are enlisted\r\n\r\ninto full-time national service on leaving school.\r\n\r\nThose   who  have  completed  full-time   national\r\n\r\nservice  prefer  to take up jobs  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  Therefore, this recruitment of foreigners\r\n\r\nis an interim measure which will cease immediately\r\n\r\nwhen   the   response  from  local   citizens   is\r\n\r\nsufficiently  good to cope with the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, something about what the Member for\r\n\r\nKampung  Kembangan has said - WOGs  and  anti-WOGs\r\n\r\ncampaign.  Although  we  can  organise   a   \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore Roads Accident-Free Campaign\"  or  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore Clean Campaign\", I do not think  we  can\r\n\r\norganise an \"Anti-Nylon Stockings Campaign\".

One\r\n\r\nis  the Police Week open house and exhibitions and\r\n\r\ncrime  prevention for festive seasons. The  Police\r\n\r\nWeek for 1972 was held at the Singapore Conference\r\n\r\nHall  concourse and at various community  centres.\r\n\r\nThis year, the Police Week\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  held  at the Victoria Memorial  Hall  in\r\n\r\nJune.

These  open   houses   and\r\n\r\nexhibitions are held over a period of  three  days\r\n\r\nat  different times at the Headquarters station of\r\n\r\nthe  eight  land  divisions.  To-date,  five  open\r\n\r\nhouses  and exhibitions have been held.  The  next\r\n\r\none  will be held at the Beach Road Police Station\r\n\r\nfrom  30th  March  to 1st April, 1973.  The  crime\r\n\r\nprevention campaign for festive seasons for  1972-73  was conducted from 1st November, 1972 to  28th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1973. The purpose of this campaign is to\r\n\r\nplan,  co-ordinate, and implement counter-measures\r\n\r\nto  combat  crime, including vandalism,  theft  of\r\n\r\nmotor-cars  and  motor-car  parts,   in   a   more\r\n\r\nconcerted  and  aggressive manner.  These  various\r\n\r\ncampaigns,  public warnings and  crime  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  be  taken by the public  are  widely\r\n\r\npublicised  through the mass media.  In  addition,\r\n\r\npictorial  and  graphic exhibits labelled  with  a\r\n\r\ndistinct crime prevention message in each case are\r\n\r\nalso displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This  is in regard to the recruitment  of\r\n\r\npolicemen. Not many of our male citizens have come\r\n\r\nforward  because  many of  them  have  to  go  for\r\n\r\nnational  service. Since the number is  small,  he\r\n\r\nhas  to recruit non-citizens. May I put forward  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion?  If we have fewer male policemen,  can\r\n\r\nwe  not recruit more females?

The\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps was thus formed. At  its  maximum\r\n\r\nstrength,  the  number exceeded 10,000.  Recently,\r\n\r\nonly a few thousand members of the Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nare  left.  But  now  that we  have  the  National\r\n\r\nService  Vigilante Corps, every year a  number  of\r\n\r\nnew  recruits are taken into the Vigilante  Corps.\r\n\r\nAfter  a  period  of fairly strict training,  they\r\n\r\nbecome members of the Vigilante Corps. My question\r\n\r\nis this. To-date, how many of these members are in\r\n\r\nthe  National  Service Vigilante Corps,  and  what\r\n\r\nsort  of  work have they been doing? My  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  these members should be treated in the  same\r\n\r\nway  as  the volunteers. In other words, we should\r\n\r\nsend them to various areas for patrol duties,  and\r\n\r\nto assist the Police in the maintenance of law and\r\n\r\norder.  This  will  enable  the  members  of   the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps to gain more experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to raise is this.\r\n\r\nThe Vigilante Corps is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolunteer organisation. Each member is given  only\r\n\r\ntwo  sets  of uniforms. After a year or so,  these\r\n\r\nuniforms  become  tattered  and  torn.   But   the\r\n\r\nheadquarters   does  not  issue  them   with   new\r\n\r\nuniforms.  So  when they go out to  perform  their\r\n\r\nduties, they have to wear faded uniforms. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister if he  would  consider\r\n\r\nissuing  a  new  set of uniforms annually  to  the\r\n\r\nvolunteer members of the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is the\r\n\r\ntransport allowance for the group leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps.  These  group  leaders  have  to\r\n\r\ntravel  a  few  times  a  week  to  check  on  the\r\n\r\nperformance of duties by other members. They  have\r\n\r\nto spend on petrol and transport, but they are not\r\n\r\ngiven  any transport allowance. This has become  a\r\n\r\nburden to the Vigilante Corps leaders. So I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to consider giving  them  some\r\n\r\ntransport  allowance so that they  can  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir duties without being out of pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wonder if the Minister will consider\r\n\r\nrecruiting volunteers. As far as I know, there are\r\n\r\nmany  people who would like to join the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  so  as  to be able to contribute  something\r\n\r\ntowards  the  society. I think if we should  admit\r\n\r\nthem,  we  will  inculcate a sense of  duty  among\r\n\r\nthese people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I correct\r\n\r\none statement by the Member for Sembawang which  I\r\n\r\nthink  is  incorrect?

However,  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCorps  are  often  called to augment  the  regular\r\n\r\nPolice  Force in crowd control, e.g. National  Day\r\n\r\nParade, Chingay procession, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the training of National Service\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps  members, may I  say  that  after\r\n\r\nhaving   completed  the  first  year  of  service,\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps members will proceed to  the  next\r\n\r\nphase of training. They will be deployed for three\r\n\r\nyears'  service, but at the same  time  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to attend training once a week for  three\r\n\r\nhours. At the training centre, the men spend  half\r\n\r\nthe  time in civil defence services, such as fire-fighting,  first-aid, rescue and fire  drill.  The\r\n\r\nother  half  of  the  time  is  utilised  in   the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  one of three skills,  i.e, sports,\r\n\r\nmarine  or  cultural. Deployment  units  are  also\r\n\r\nrequired  to conduct an annual hike and  overnight\r\n\r\ncamp.  A one-week unit in-camp is conducted during\r\n\r\nthe first year of deployment training, and another\r\n\r\nweek for a civil defence residential course in the\r\n\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to uniforms, may I say that if we have\r\n\r\nthe  finance we would, of course, be very glad  to\r\n\r\nissue new uniforms. But I do not think that  if  a\r\n\r\nCorps  member  puts  on  an  old  uniform,  he  is\r\n\r\ndiscouraged.  In fact, one of the qualities  which\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  promote  among our  Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nmembers  is  thrift. Therefore, a good example  of\r\n\r\nthrift is to put on a uniform which is not new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to transport allowance, I have looked\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter.  I doubt  whether  I  am  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to give transport allowance  because  if\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Vigilante  Corps  get  transport\r\n\r\nallowance,  I  am  sure  members  of  the  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary will also claim transport  allowance.\r\n\r\nThere will be no end to the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to encouraging more volunteers to\r\n\r\njoin  the  Vigilante  Corps, of  course,  we  will\r\n\r\nalways encourage that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  did  not  get  my figures  wrong.

The  scenario  which\r\n\r\nforms  the  background  to  our  drug  problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Drug production on a large scale is taking\r\n\r\nplace  in  South-east Asia in countries  close  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Singapore stands squarely on the supply route\r\n\r\nfrom producer to large-scale consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Problems in certain surrounding countries may\r\n\r\nwell have their spill over here. For example, Hong\r\n\r\nKong, the Philippines and Australia are reportedly\r\n\r\nexperiencing  rapid increases in the incidence  of\r\n\r\ndrug-taking, including the so-called hard drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be surprised if the Director of our\r\n\r\nCentral Narcotics Bureau feels that it is a matter\r\n\r\nof time before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour young people are hit by a similar epidemic, if\r\n\r\nmore vigorous measures are not taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to the situation in Singapore. It can be\r\n\r\nexpected  that the Misuse of Drugs  Act  with  its\r\n\r\nsevere  penalties  will cause those  suspected  of\r\n\r\ntrafficking  in  or taking drugs to  claim  trial,\r\n\r\nwhen   apprehended,  rather  than  submit  without\r\n\r\nresistance  to such penalties as are  provided  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  law.  This will mean that a  significant\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the  Narcotics  Officers  and  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Narcotics Officers will be tied  up  in\r\n\r\ncourt and in allied administrative procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is not too clear as to what\r\n\r\ncategories of people take drugs. But young  people\r\n\r\nfrom  well educated and affluent family background\r\n\r\nas well as those from the lower income groups have\r\n\r\nbeen  involved. What is significant is that  drop-outs  are more exposed to the temptation  to  drug\r\n\r\nabuse.  The  circumstances are compounded  by  the\r\n\r\nfact  that both parents and teachers do  not  have\r\n\r\nvery  clear  ideas about drugs, the conditions  of\r\n\r\ntheir abuse, causes of addiction, and so on.  They\r\n\r\nknow  that  the devil is around, but  they  cannot\r\n\r\nrecognise   him  early  enough.  It  would   seem,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   that   a  concerted   and   organised\r\n\r\neducational  programme has to be directed  towards\r\n\r\nteachers  and parents so that they will be  better\r\n\r\nequipped  to  combat this problem in  co-operation\r\n\r\nwith  the authorities and other relevant voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations. This again means that  the  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau, which bears the  brunt  of  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  for  education  in   the   anti-narcotics  field,  will have  to  have  additional\r\n\r\nmanpower of various categories. This position  may\r\n\r\nbe   further  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers  are well organised,  resorting  to  a\r\n\r\nvariety of sophisticated equipment and strategy in\r\n\r\ntheir  operations. I understand  that  flexibility\r\n\r\nand  adaptability  are their particular  hallmark,\r\n\r\nand  we,  therefore,  need more  manpower,  better\r\n\r\ntrained and well equipped to deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum total of what I am trying to say, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is that the strength of the  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics Bureau, increased as it has been in  our\r\n\r\npresent  Estimates,  does not  go  far  enough.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  restrain  from remarking  that  the  first\r\n\r\ntarget  of  educational measures  by  the  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau  should  be  directed   to   the\r\n\r\nrelevant  officials  in the Finance  Ministry,  so\r\n\r\nthat these housekeepers may understand the problem\r\n\r\nmore  ably  and thereby sympathetically  give  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Narcotics  Bureau the personnel  to  ably\r\n\r\ndeal with drug trafficking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  entirely agree with the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nwith what he has spoken about the problem of drug-taking in Singapore, and the steps which should be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  combat  this menace.  We  know  that  a\r\n\r\nsignificant number of our youths are taking drugs.\r\n\r\nIn   1971,  200  people  were  arrested  for  drug\r\n\r\noffences.  In  1972, 444 people were arrested  for\r\n\r\ndrug  offences.  This  shows  that  there  was  an\r\n\r\nincrease of more than a hundred per cent from 1971\r\n\r\nto 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the United States of America and\r\n\r\nin  many  Western  countries  drug  addiction  has\r\n\r\npervaded all strata of society. In these countries\r\n\r\nall traditional values have been thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do  not wish to see a similar  tragedy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  must take action  now  before  the\r\n\r\nsituation  reaches the point of  no  return.  Drug\r\n\r\naddiction among our youths brings with it a number\r\n\r\nof  other problems. Although drug addiction can be\r\n\r\ncaused  by  poor environment, another contributing\r\n\r\nfactor  is the external influence of hippies  from\r\n\r\nabroad.   We   must  tackle  this   problem   very\r\n\r\nvigorously.  We  cannot allow this  phenomenon  to\r\n\r\ncontinue, or the end-result will be disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House last month I asked the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned if it was possible to conduct  an  anti-drug  campaign  so that everyone in  our  society,\r\n\r\nespecially parents and teachers, would take action\r\n\r\nagainst  drug-taking. Just now I heard the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Katong say that educational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  should  be  taken.  The  schools\r\n\r\nshould do something about drug-taking. I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider this matter.  If  for  any\r\n\r\nreason  we  cannot conduct a nation-wide anti-drug\r\n\r\ncampaign,  I  wonder  whether  we  can  conduct  a\r\n\r\npublicity  campaign against drugs in our  schools.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way,  at least 50,000 to 60,000  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  will appreciate the problem and  dangers\r\n\r\nof drug-taking. We know that the majority of drug-takers   are  youths.  Therefore,  the   anti-drug\r\n\r\ncampaign  should  be  directed  against  them.  We\r\n\r\nshould  start our campaign in the schools so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  recognise  the  ill-effects  of  drug-taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two further questions to raise. First,\r\n\r\nsince  the  setting  up of the  Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau, what sort of work has been done? What  new\r\n\r\nplans  are  afoot  for  the  elimination  of  drug\r\n\r\naddiction? Secondly, how many people have  so  far\r\n\r\nbeen  arrested for offences associated with  drug-taking?  What is the Minister going  to  do  about\r\n\r\nthese people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse know very well the problem of drug addiction\r\n\r\nin  our schools, especially in the English stream.\r\n\r\nI  was approached by many parents for help in this\r\n\r\nrespect.   We  have  talked  a  lot   about   drug\r\n\r\naddiction,  how it has come into our  society  and\r\n\r\nthe  price we have got to pay for urbanisation.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  high time that we sought  a  highly\r\n\r\npositive  measure to fight this evil. As  a  large\r\n\r\npercentage of our youths are still schooling, they\r\n\r\ncould  seek  the  help of school  teachers.  Their\r\n\r\nparents should also encourage them to come forward\r\n\r\nand  give  information  to the  Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, principals and teachers are reluctant to\r\n\r\ncome  forward and give information. It is  because\r\n\r\nwhen a drug-taking case is reported by any school,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education will ask the  principal\r\n\r\nor  the teacher to submit reports after reports to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry. What is worse is that the school  is\r\n\r\nblack-marked by the Ministry, and life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  made very unpleasant for the principal and the\r\n\r\nteacher.  Sir, I would like to suggest that  every\r\n\r\nencouragement  should be given to  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  to  bring to the notice  of  the  proper\r\n\r\nauthorities of any case of drug-taking. When  they\r\n\r\ndo  so,  they  should  be highly  commended.  They\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  black-marked or their  life  made\r\n\r\nmiserable. If we encourage information,  we  would\r\n\r\nbe able to get better results in our fight against\r\n\r\nthe problem of drug abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to suggest to the Director\r\n\r\nof  the  Central Narcotics Bureau that when  drug-pushers  or traffickers are arrested, they  should\r\n\r\nbe  made to take the drug themselves for some time\r\n\r\nand then to stop giving them the drug. They should\r\n\r\nbe  made to suffer. This is to show them how  they\r\n\r\nmake other people suffer. Sir, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health and Home Affairs and the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation will take note of my suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many Members\r\n\r\nhave spoken about the Central Narcotics Bureau.  I\r\n\r\nhave a few points to raise. Sir, drug addiction is\r\n\r\nbecoming  quite  prevalent in Singapore.  We  have\r\n\r\nestablished the Central Narcotics Bureau to  fight\r\n\r\nthis menace. Although it has done an excellent job\r\n\r\nso  far,  I  would  suggest  that  the  Bureau  be\r\n\r\nexpanded immediately and officers be placed at all\r\n\r\nentry points of drug traffickers. At present,  the\r\n\r\nsmall  Bureau is tied down with work and  soon  it\r\n\r\nmay  not be able to cope with the increase in  the\r\n\r\nincidence  of drug abuse. I wonder whether  a  few\r\n\r\nprison officers can be seconded to the Bureau  and\r\n\r\nbe  given the power to arrest drug traffickers and\r\n\r\naddicts  because  they are in a position  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  situation through information  gathered\r\n\r\nfrom  drug  addicted  prisoners.  In  addition,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that to fight drug addiction,  we  should\r\n\r\nset  up an effective national youth council  whose\r\n\r\nsole  function will be to help people who are drug\r\n\r\naddicts.   At   present,  there   are   inadequate\r\n\r\nfacilities to help drug addicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first\r\n\r\ndeal with the points brought up by the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong?  May I say that talks on drug  abuse  have\r\n\r\nbeen presented to parent groups and student groups\r\n\r\nat   service   clubs,   religious   organisations,\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres,  tertiary  institutions,   and\r\n\r\nschools.  Many  parents, brothers and  sisters  of\r\n\r\ndrug  abusers  have come to the Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau  to seek help for their loved ones who  are\r\n\r\ndrug    abusers.   Those   concerned   have   been\r\n\r\neffectively   counselled.  The   Singapore   Anti-Narcotics  Association has been gearing itself  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  counselling and assistance service  to\r\n\r\ndrug  abusers  and to educate the  public  on  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of  drug  abuse. The Association  is  now\r\n\r\nconsidering  organising a counselling  course  for\r\n\r\nvolunteers  comprising members of the public.  The\r\n\r\nAssociation welcomes all the help it can get  from\r\n\r\nthe rest of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong suggested that the Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau  should have more  officers.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  welcome  that suggestion.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that, in the nature of things, we  have\r\n\r\nto  start  from a small beginning and we  hope  to\r\n\r\nenlarge the Bureau eventually. The point is not so\r\n\r\nmuch having so many posts but having the bodies to\r\n\r\nfill  the posts. At the moment, many of the  posts\r\n\r\nhave  been filled by way of secondments  from  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force and the Customs. We will try our very\r\n\r\nbest  to get the Police and the Customs to  second\r\n\r\nmore men to the Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang warns to know how much\r\n\r\nhas  been  achieved since the setting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Narcotics  Bureau. May  I  say  that  the\r\n\r\nBureau  was  set up in mid-November 1971  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  drug trafficking and drug abuse? In the year\r\n\r\n1972,  the  Enforcement  Section  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau carried out an  average  of  264\r\n\r\nraids   each   month.   It   also   carried    out\r\n\r\ninvestigations  into  complaints  and  information\r\n\r\ngiven  by the public, which amounted to an average\r\n\r\nof  30  complaints  monthly. In co-operation  with\r\n\r\noverseas  enforcement agencies,  the  Bureau  also\r\n\r\nundertakes investigations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto   international  drug  trafficking.   Several\r\n\r\nsuccesses have been obtained in this area of work.\r\n\r\nIn  the  year  1972,  the  Bureau  effected  2,634\r\n\r\narrests.  These  include  111  persons  who   were\r\n\r\nconvicted for major drug offences. These were  the\r\n\r\ntraffickers, distributors, pedlars of the  various\r\n\r\ndangerous drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publicity section of the Bureau provided\r\n\r\nspeakers  for talks on no less than 36  occasions.\r\n\r\nThe  talks were presented to school teachers, army\r\n\r\npersonnel,  doctors, nurses, University  students,\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres,  service   clubs,   religious\r\n\r\norganisations   and  schools.  It  also   provided\r\n\r\nexhibits for various organisations. It is  now  in\r\n\r\nthe    process   of   preparing   pamphlets    for\r\n\r\ndistribution. These pamphlets will only deal  with\r\n\r\ndrug abuse locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau is also acting in an advisory capacity\r\n\r\nto the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, which\r\n\r\nis  a  voluntary  organisation geared  to  provide\r\n\r\ncounselling and assistance services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  that we should organise a  campaign  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  drug  abuse,  may  I  say  that   many\r\n\r\norganisations   have  organised  exhibitions   and\r\n\r\ncampaigns   against   drug  abuse.   The   Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau has provided exhibits and  acted\r\n\r\nin  an  advisory  capacity to these organisations.\r\n\r\nThe  Bureau  intends to organise a joint  campaign\r\n\r\nwith the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association this\r\n\r\nyear.   However,   the  Bureau  feels   that   the\r\n\r\nprevention of drug abuse should be done on a long-term  basis  by developing attitudes against  drug\r\n\r\nabuse. Campaigns by themselves have limited  uses.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  agree with the suggestion  that  we\r\n\r\nshould try to have more anti-drug education in the\r\n\r\nschools.  I  believe  this will  be  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point made by the Member for Changi with\r\n\r\nregard  to principals and teachers being reluctant\r\n\r\nto  report  cases  of drug abuse  in  the  schools\r\n\r\nbecause  it  would mean involving themselves  with\r\n\r\nmuch  paper  work with the Ministry of  Education,\r\n\r\nand the school being black-marked, if this is true\r\n\r\nI sympathise with them. I assure the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember that I would use my good offices to get the\r\n\r\nassurance  of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation, that such things do not happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nsuggested  expanding the Central Narcotics  Bureau\r\n\r\nby getting the secondment of prison officers.

They are\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The outpatient and school clinics will accept\r\n\r\npersons  who  may  be brought in directly  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice or other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The drug-dependence clinic at Outram Road\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital is a referral  centre  and  will\r\n\r\ndeal   with  cases  which  need  more  specialised\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Alexandra Hospital is in the process of\r\n\r\nestablishing  a  ward  for  addicts  who   require\r\n\r\nhospital care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Opium Treatment Centre at St. John's\r\n\r\nIsland  caters for addicts of all types of  drugs.\r\n\r\nThis   is   an  isolation  centre  which  provides\r\n\r\ndiversional  activities such as carpentry,  rattan\r\n\r\nwork,  tailoring, horticulture, fish-rearing,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.

I do not say that all of them  should\r\n\r\nbe  prison officers, but I feel that at least  two\r\n\r\nor three prison officers should be seconded to the\r\n\r\nBureau to track down the drug traffickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nagree  with  the Member for Anson that  we  should\r\n\r\nsecond  prison  officers to the Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau.

Govindaswamy and Tuan Haji Mohd.  Ariff Bin Suradi.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of citizenship is still a\r\n\r\nmatter  of serious importance to many people,  and\r\n\r\nhas  become  a problem to them. Some  people  have\r\n\r\napplied  for more than three times, and yet  their\r\n\r\napplications have been turned down.  Thus  it  has\r\n\r\ncaused  great inconvenience and disappointment  to\r\n\r\nthem.  At  a time when we were faced with economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties, it was quite excusable  to  restrict\r\n\r\nthe granting of citizenship to applicants. But now\r\n\r\nthat we have greatly improved our economy, we  can\r\n\r\nafford  to relax our restrictions and regulations.\r\n\r\nIn my \"Meet the People\" session every week, I used\r\n\r\nto receive complaints about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications  for citizenship having  been  turned\r\n\r\ndown. Some complained that they have waited two or\r\n\r\nthree  years  without any result. I give  my  full\r\n\r\nsympathy to all these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time when our economy is highly developed\r\n\r\nand  we are faced with a shortage of labour, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  any valid reason to refuse to relax  our\r\n\r\nregulations  on the granting of citizenship.  Even\r\n\r\nwith  all the attendant problems that go with  it,\r\n\r\nfor   instance,  housing,  education,  social  and\r\n\r\nmedical  care, I do not think these are sufficient\r\n\r\nreasons  to  justify the refusal  of  citizenship.\r\n\r\nBecause  these  problems, if they  can  be  called\r\n\r\nproblems  at all, are ever present in  our  social\r\n\r\nlife;  they do not count very much in the granting\r\n\r\nof citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the applicants for citizenship have\r\n\r\nstayed  in Singapore for quite some time. Most  of\r\n\r\nthem have children and even grand-children who are\r\n\r\nenjoying the rights of citizenship, medical  care,\r\n\r\neducation  and other things. So giving citizenship\r\n\r\nto  these  applicants would not cost us  any  more\r\n\r\neconomic loss or burden, because all of them  have\r\n\r\ntheir  own proper jobs with good income. They  are\r\n\r\nable to provide for their households.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of housing, even if we do not\r\n\r\ngrant citizenship to them, we are still faced with\r\n\r\nthis  social  problem. In the past years  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen building at the rate of 20,000 units of flats\r\n\r\nper  year. Now we intend to increase the  rate  to\r\n\r\n30,000  units a year, and there are 60,000  people\r\n\r\non  the  waiting  list. So  if  this  new  lot  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  is  added  on to the  waiting  list  for\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  flats,  it would  not  affect  the\r\n\r\npriority at all because the Board has a policy  of\r\n\r\nfirst  come first served. So even if they were  to\r\n\r\nwait  for  their turn, they would not  impose  any\r\n\r\nmore difficulty on us in respect of housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these matters should not be an excuse for\r\n\r\nrefusing  to give citizenship to these applicants.\r\n\r\nOn   behalf   of  the  applicants  who   are   not\r\n\r\nsuccessful, I make an appeal for the relaxation of\r\n\r\nthe   restrictions  imposed  on  these  applicants\r\n\r\nbecause many of them have relatives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho are citizens. For instance, we all  know\r\n\r\nthat  the spouse of an applicant, whether  husband\r\n\r\nor wife, is usually a citizen and the children are\r\n\r\ncitizens. The Minister can look up the Citizenship\r\n\r\nRegulations. Though these applicants  may  not  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful  so  far  in  their  applications   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship, however, their husbands or wives,  or\r\n\r\nparents,  or  children, may be citizens.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  appeal  to the Minister  to  relax  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions   in  respect  of  applications   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship on these grounds in order to alleviate\r\n\r\nany difficulty on their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is  not a right but a privilege,  and\r\n\r\nthe  law  changes from time to time, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  existing situation of the country.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the conditions at the moment  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  granting of citizenship. There  are  so  many\r\n\r\nstateless  persons in Singapore who are  \"floating\r\n\r\ncharacters\",  i.e, they are neither  citizens  nor\r\n\r\nare  they  ever  likely to become citizens.  These\r\n\r\npoor persons, because of their status, cannot  get\r\n\r\njobs.  They  can neither apply for a flat  nor  go\r\n\r\nacross  the causeway to visit their relatives  and\r\n\r\nfriends.   Why  cannot  we  issue  them   with   a\r\n\r\ncertificate of identity so that they can at  least\r\n\r\ngo across the causeway in case of emergency!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when both the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Sembawang and Anson talk  of  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are now permanent residents but unable to get\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  may  I say that  most  of  them  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for their own plight. They could  have\r\n\r\nacquired  Singapore citizenship years ago  without\r\n\r\nany  difficulty, because in those days  conditions\r\n\r\nfor  the granting of citizenship were much easier.\r\n\r\nBut  they  would  rather keep their  options  open\r\n\r\nthen,  and  as  such have elected  to  take  their\r\n\r\nchances. If things in Singapore are not as good as\r\n\r\nthey  are  today,  I am sure there  will  be  less\r\n\r\ndemand for Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the citizenship policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is concerned, it is always kept  under\r\n\r\nconstant review. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  matter  of  policy, many of the applicants  are\r\n\r\nkept  under consideration so that, when conditions\r\n\r\nchange or when circumstances make it possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to allow more  people  to  become\r\n\r\ncitizens,   they  may  be  favourably  considered.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  delay  in finalising the  applications\r\n\r\nmeans  a  source of hope. However, the  Member  is\r\n\r\nassured  that there is no delay. Once a  decision,\r\n\r\non  an  application is made, action  is  taken  to\r\n\r\nnotify the applicant of the result immediately  it\r\n\r\nis known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Sembawang and Anson said that\r\n\r\ncircumstances  have  changed. Maybe  circumstances\r\n\r\nwith  regard to employment and so on have changed,\r\n\r\nbut one big problem at the moment is housing. That\r\n\r\nhas  not  changed. The Member for  Sembawang  said\r\n\r\nthat there is a waiting list of 60,000. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson will know much more because he  is  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Allocations Committee. If we  were\r\n\r\nto  grant  citizenship to more people,  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen?  The  present waiting list of 60,000  will\r\n\r\ncome  up  to  80,000 or even more.  But  then  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang - it was quite clever of  him\r\n\r\nto  put  it this way -said that the priority  will\r\n\r\nnot change because it is based on first come first\r\n\r\nserved.  He  has  forgotten  one  crucial   point,\r\n\r\nbecause   sometime  ago  I  did  announce   in   a\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Statement in this  Chamber  that  the\r\n\r\nallocation  for  housing as from the  1st  August,\r\n\r\n1973,  will  no  longer be on a first  come  first\r\n\r\nserved  basis, but it will be on a priority  basis\r\n\r\nbased  on  the concept of a two-child  family.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  those applicants with two  children\r\n\r\nwill  have a higher priority after the 1st August,\r\n\r\n1973.  That nullifies the point made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang. I hope the Chairman of the Housing\r\n\r\nAllocations Committee will also bear that in mind.\r\n\r\nThe  point is that Members may not be aware of the\r\n\r\nfact  that when this happens, then some  of  their\r\n\r\nvoters who are citizens may have a lower priority.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would  like  them to think  very  carefully\r\n\r\nbefore they advance these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npropositions because they might get themselves  in\r\n\r\nhot   water   when   they   go   back   to   their\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the point brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson that some non-citizens cannot get work, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that is true, because they can  always\r\n\r\nget a work permit now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his point that a blue identity card\r\n\r\nholder,  who  is a permanent resident,  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered for a certificate of identity so as  to\r\n\r\nenable  him to travel across the causeway,  may  I\r\n\r\ntell  him  this: if that person produces  evidence\r\n\r\nthat he is a stateless person and also that he  is\r\n\r\nin  urgent need to travel across the causeway,  he\r\n\r\nwill be granted a certificate of identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, some of\r\n\r\nthe  points given by the Minister in his reply are\r\n\r\nquite  reasonable, but others are  not  quite  so.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  one  good point he has made is  that  his\r\n\r\ndepartment is constantly reviewing the  matter  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and  that  there  is  hope  that  the\r\n\r\napplications  may  be favourably  considered.  But\r\n\r\nwhen he brought up other matters, such as housing,\r\n\r\nthese  are not reasonable excuses because even  if\r\n\r\nyou  do not grant citizenship to these applicants,\r\n\r\nthe  citizens  who are already  on  the  list  for\r\n\r\nhousing units will still have to wait for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that applicants with\r\n\r\nsmaller  families will be given  priority.  So  in\r\n\r\nthis   case,  there  is  no  priority  for   local\r\n\r\ncitizens.  This  is  not a good  practice  because\r\n\r\nafter the applicants with small families have been\r\n\r\ngiven   housing  units,  they  can  produce   more\r\n\r\nchildren,  and so expand their families.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  very good method to adopt. Their  families\r\n\r\nwill  definitely  become  bigger  because  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  they practise family planning in order  to\r\n\r\nget priority in the allocation of a flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $72,981,970 for Head 1301 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,276,560 for Head 1301 ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1302 --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Since there are so many points of  easy\r\n\r\nentry   into   Singapore,  are  there   sufficient\r\n\r\nprecautions  to  stop  this  traffic  of   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we have numerous requests from people\r\n\r\nto  have their stay in Singapore extended for more\r\n\r\nthan  six months, can we not charge a nominal  fee\r\n\r\nfor endorsing the extension? This privilege should\r\n\r\nalso be given to those people who have gone abroad\r\n\r\nwith  good  reasons. This will  be  an  additional\r\n\r\nsource of revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, may I ask what steps are being\r\n\r\ntaken   in   respect   of  Malaysians   who   have\r\n\r\noverstayed? It seems that they can enter Singapore\r\n\r\nquite  easily  and  stay on  indefinitely  without\r\n\r\nbeing  found  out. I suggest that we  introduce  a\r\n\r\ncard-system  similar to the  one  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities across the causeway. At present, I  am\r\n\r\nsure   there   are  many  persons  who   are   now\r\n\r\noverstaying  here in Singapore, and this  makes  a\r\n\r\nmockery of the passports issued to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this problem\r\n\r\nof  illegal  immigration is largely  presented  by\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  entering  Singapore  by  sea.\r\n\r\nIllegal immigrants enter Singapore in small craft,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  motorised  boats,  sampans,  or  sailing\r\n\r\nboats.  It is believed that the majority  of  them\r\n\r\nare  brought  in  by  organised  syndicates  which\r\n\r\nhandle  the illegal trafficking of people  between\r\n\r\nSingapore    and   the   neighbouring   countries.\r\n\r\nInterrogation  of arrested illegal immigrants  and\r\n\r\ntheir   traffickers  has  revealed   the   various\r\n\r\npurposes of illegal entry, chief of which is  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of them have come to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nseek employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the distance involved is short and the\r\n\r\nSingapore coastline is accessible to small  craft,\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  illegal entry is  a  difficult  task.\r\n\r\nWithin  the resources available, concerted  action\r\n\r\nhas  been,  and is being, taken by the Police  and\r\n\r\nImmigration Department against illegal  entry  and\r\n\r\nstay. The Marine Police patrolling the territorial\r\n\r\nwaters  of Singapore are on the lookout for  small\r\n\r\nvessels which sneak in illegally. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force,  on beat or other duty,  carry  out\r\n\r\nfrequent  checks  to detect those  who  manage  to\r\n\r\nenter  illegally. Surprise checks  and  raids  are\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  the  Immigration  Department  on\r\n\r\ninformation  received.  In  addition,   Divisional\r\n\r\nPolice  mount  occasional surprise checks  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious worksites all over the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such concerted action throughout each year has\r\n\r\nresulted   in   arrests  of  over  1,500   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants   last  year.  It  is,  however,   Snot\r\n\r\npossible   to   say  exactly  how   many   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants enter Singapore every year, or how many\r\n\r\nremain here illegally. When illegal immigrants are\r\n\r\narrested,  they  are  detained,  prosecuted,  and,\r\n\r\nwherever   possible,  removed  out  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTraffickers  of  illegal immigrants  are  severely\r\n\r\ndealt  with.  The courts are asked to  pass  heavy\r\n\r\nsentences  on  them, and to order the confiscation\r\n\r\nof their boats and equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal immigrants manage to enter Singapore by\r\n\r\nlanding  at  unauthorised  landing  spots.  It  is\r\n\r\nrecognised that, in spite of the efforts  so  far,\r\n\r\nmany   illegal  immigrants  do  manage  to   enter\r\n\r\nSingapore easily and remain undetected until  much\r\n\r\nlater. As an effort to stop or greatly reduce  the\r\n\r\ninflow  of  illegal  persons  by  sea,  a  special\r\n\r\nintelligence  unit  is  being  set   up   in   the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department. The function of this  unit\r\n\r\nis  to  penetrate  into the organised  syndicates,\r\n\r\nambush  traffickers or craft at the landing spots,\r\n\r\nand  expose  the  local harbourers.

I think the  number\r\n\r\nmust  be  enough to create staffing problems  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  described  as critical.  May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned, why has this  situation  been\r\n\r\nallowed  to deteriorate to such an extent?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  working  conditions  that   have\r\n\r\naggravated  these resignations?  The  warders  and\r\n\r\nofficers,  who are supposed to guard some  of  our\r\n\r\nmost  dangerous  criminals,  are  not  even  armed\r\n\r\nproperly.   As  such,  some  criminals   who   are\r\n\r\ndesperate  might think of beating  up  warders  in\r\n\r\ntheir  attempt to get away. Probably this  may  be\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why  there are so many  resignaations\r\n\r\namong our warders. To make matters worse, the  pay\r\n\r\nis  too  small  and  is not in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities attached to the job. I understand\r\n\r\nthe Prisons Department is going to be reorganised.\r\n\r\nIf  such is the case, I suggest that a revision of\r\n\r\npay  for the Prisons staff be considered so as  to\r\n\r\npromote better morale among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not\r\n\r\ncorrect to say that Prison officers are resigning\r\n\r\nbecause they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot provided with fire-arms.

To do otherwise  is\r\n\r\nnot    conducive    to    good    officer/prisoner\r\n\r\nrelationship,   which   is   the   foundation   of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.  However,  officers  on  custodial\r\n\r\nduties,  such as guards posted on watch-towers  or\r\n\r\nescorting prisoners to hospitals or the courts are\r\n\r\nfully armed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Prison officers of warder rank\r\n\r\nresigned  perhaps  because of working  conditions,\r\n\r\nespecially   in  maximum  security   prison.   The\r\n\r\nunfavourable  conditions  are  aggravated   by   a\r\n\r\nconsistently high rate of turnover and  a  serious\r\n\r\nshortage  of  manpower over the last  five  years.\r\n\r\nAgainst   our   present  background  of   enormous\r\n\r\neconomic expansion and industrial activities,  and\r\n\r\nconsequently  abundant  employment  opportunities,\r\n\r\nthe  salaries  offered to the Prison officers  are\r\n\r\nperhaps  not  sufficient  enough  to  attract   an\r\n\r\nadequate  inflow of recruits.

In\r\n\r\nspite of the unavoidable limitations pertaining to\r\n\r\noperating  within the prison complex, the  revenue\r\n\r\nderived  and  savings accrued to  Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen  consistently increasing year after year.

It  is responsible for formulating  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial policy. In  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  the Ministry of Finance has done  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal towards the development of our industries and\r\n\r\nof  our  external trade. As a result  we  are  now\r\n\r\nenjoying  the  fruits of economic  prosperity.  We\r\n\r\nhave  achieved a very high GNP growth rate  of  13\r\n\r\nper  cent  last year, and our average  per  capita\r\n\r\nincome  is  increasing year by year. In 1971,  our\r\n\r\nper  capita income was $3,321 and in 1972  it  was\r\n\r\n$3,687.  This  is indeed a gratifying achievement.\r\n\r\nHowever,   the   constant   upheavals    in    the\r\n\r\ninternational  monetary system have  affected  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  For  example, there is now  inflationary\r\n\r\ntendencies in our country, resulting in  a  rising\r\n\r\nlevel  of  prices. This makes life more  and  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  our  people.  May  I  quote   some\r\n\r\nexamples?  The price of rice used to be  35  cents\r\n\r\nper  kati.  Now, it is 55 cents per kati.  Chinese\r\n\r\ncabbage used to sell at 20 cents per kati, but  it\r\n\r\nis  now 60 to 80 cents per kati. Sugar, flour, and\r\n\r\nmany   other   commodities  have  also   shown   a\r\n\r\ntremendous increase in price. There is  a  general\r\n\r\nincrease in price levels, and this indeed  worries\r\n\r\neverybody. Has the Ministry of Finance  any  plans\r\n\r\nto counter this trend? Has the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\ncarried  out the necessary investigations to  find\r\n\r\nout  the  reason for these rising prices? Are  the\r\n\r\nprice  increases justifiable? The Ministry  should\r\n\r\ntake  immediate steps to stop prices  from  rising\r\n\r\nany  further  in order to stabilise  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to raise is the\r\n\r\nquestion of trade deficits. Our trade deficit  has\r\n\r\nbeen  on the increase over the last few years.  In\r\n\r\n1971, the deficit was $3,200 million. In 1972,  it\r\n\r\nwas $3,400 million. Although the Minister has told\r\n\r\nus that this trade deficit will be offset by other\r\n\r\ninvisible sources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof income, such as services, in the long run, this\r\n\r\nsituation will be abnormal. Of course, this  trade\r\n\r\ndeficit is not like cancer. It can be compared  to\r\n\r\ngastric  trouble  in  the stomach  which  gives  a\r\n\r\nperson  frequent pain. We must, therefore, try  to\r\n\r\ndo  our  best  to  remedy the situation.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  would like to ask the  Minister  what\r\n\r\neffective  measures are there to reduce our  trade\r\n\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that a few years ago we set up INTRACO, a\r\n\r\njoint  venture  between  the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector. Its main object is to  assist  in\r\n\r\nthe development of trade with Communist countries.\r\n\r\nThe  increase  in  trade with Communist  countries\r\n\r\nwill  be  to our mutual benefit. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  what has been done to promote external trade\r\n\r\nsince  the establishment of INTRACO. What progress\r\n\r\nhas  been achieved? What is the increase in  trade\r\n\r\nbefore and after the setting up of INTRACO?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to raise is the\r\n\r\nsalary  increases for Divisions  II,  III  and  IV\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers.  I asked  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   this  question  on  16th   of   February\r\n\r\n[Hansard, Vol. 32, col. 401], and he told me  that\r\n\r\nhe   would   consider   the  recommendations   and\r\n\r\nguidelines of the National Wages Council, and that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  had  been doing a restructuring  of\r\n\r\nsalary  scales for these grades of officers.  This\r\n\r\nshows that this matter is receiving attention.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  is  good news  to  these  officers.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nhe  could  give  the House more  specific  details\r\n\r\nregarding  the salary increases for Divisions  II,\r\n\r\nIII and IV officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is on the decrease of capital\r\n\r\ninvestment  in the shipbuilding industry.  In  his\r\n\r\nBudget  statement the Minister revealed  that  the\r\n\r\ninvestments   in  shipbuilding  and  shiprepairing\r\n\r\ndropped  from  $142.2 million  in  1971  to  $66.9\r\n\r\nmillion  last  year. This is quite  a  substantial\r\n\r\nreduction.  What is the reason for this reduction?\r\n\r\nIs  it because of the non-availability of suitable\r\n\r\nsites  for shipbuilding? I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\ncarry out the necessary investigations and take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremedial measures so that our country will  become\r\n\r\nthe  centre for shipbuilding and shiprepairing  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But, at the same time,  let  us  not\r\n\r\nforget  the middle and lower income groups in  the\r\n\r\ncivil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, where will these top\r\n\r\ncivil  servants be without the help of  the  lower\r\n\r\ngrades  of civil servants? Surely the lower grades\r\n\r\nof  civil  servants are as essential to the  civil\r\n\r\nservice. As such, they too deserve an equal number\r\n\r\nof  increments. After all, the actual work is done\r\n\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also point out the plight of the middle and\r\n\r\nlower grades of workers in the Government service?\r\n\r\nThe cost of living is rising continuously, not  by\r\n\r\nleaps and bounds but enough to cause a pinch  into\r\n\r\nthe workers' earnings. To a certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextent,  these are the workers who arc  neglected,\r\n\r\nand  they  find it extremely difficult to  stretch\r\n\r\nthe dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the reduction of leave scheme,\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants are compensated  financially.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of some statutory boards, although\r\n\r\nthe  officers  are  considered  to  be  Government\r\n\r\nservants,  they  are not accorded the  same  leave\r\n\r\nscheme.  A compensation, similar to that  accorded\r\n\r\nto  Government servants, should be paid  to  those\r\n\r\nofficers in the statutory boards for loss of leave\r\n\r\nduring the past years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in CPF contribution from 10 per\r\n\r\ncent  to 12 per cent in 1972 has resulted in lower\r\n\r\ntake-home pay. This greatly affects the middle and\r\n\r\nlower   grades  of  officers.  Their  incomes   as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the private sector are  meagre,  and\r\n\r\nthey  suffer more because o the increased cost  of\r\n\r\nliving. When the CPF contribution is increased  to\r\n\r\n15 per cent, they will suffer even more. Is it not\r\n\r\ntime that some form of increase in salary be given\r\n\r\nto  these  grades  of workers to  alleviate  their\r\n\r\nsufferings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to mention the\r\n\r\nrise in the cost of living in Singapore. Recently,\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of many consumer goods  and  services\r\n\r\nhave  gone  up greatly. The excuse given  by  most\r\n\r\nmanufacturers is that they have not increased  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  their  products  for  many  years  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it is justifiable to raise their prices\r\n\r\nby  a  nominal sum. It appears that most of  these\r\n\r\nproposals  are  coming  one  after  another.  Some\r\n\r\nretailers   are  only  waiting  for  such   slight\r\n\r\nincreases in the cost of manufactured products  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  could extort a higher price  from  the\r\n\r\npoor  consumers.  I would like to  call  upon  the\r\n\r\nMinister to view this grave situation with  utmost\r\n\r\nconcern  before it gets worse. The  Government  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  has been successful in getting  rid  of\r\n\r\npirate taxis, banning cigarette advertisements and\r\n\r\nhas  also  been  successful  with  many  important\r\n\r\nnational campaigns. Therefore, I have little doubt\r\n\r\nthat a remedy will be found for this major problem\r\n\r\nwhich affects the lives of the majority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  people. Nowadays, the ordinary  housewife\r\n\r\nfinds  that  her marketing budget  dries  up  very\r\n\r\nfast.  I  would suggest that the Government  takes\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  all  essential  foodstuffs  and,   if\r\n\r\npossible,  to open and to manage as many effective\r\n\r\nco-operative  centres  as  possible.   These   co-operative centres could deal with the needs of the\r\n\r\npublic  so that there would be no unfair means  of\r\n\r\nprofiteering  by any Tom, Dick and Harry.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  it  appears that most of the  people  are\r\n\r\nunder  the  clutches  of the  shopkeepers  because\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude  is  \"take it or  leave  it\".  The\r\n\r\nMinister    should   also   consider   introducing\r\n\r\ncontrolled prices for foodstuffs in certain places\r\n\r\nwhere   the  majority  of  the  people  do   their\r\n\r\nshopping.  And publicity on the actual  prices  of\r\n\r\nessential foodstuffs should be communicated to the\r\n\r\npeople daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago, the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nraised  the  question of the payment of  the  13th\r\n\r\nmonth  allowance  to  civil servants  who  retired\r\n\r\nbefore  the end of the year, to which the Minister\r\n\r\ngave  a  negative  answer.  The  Member  had  also\r\n\r\nreferred to cases of new recruits who are entitled\r\n\r\nto  receive  the allowance even though  they  have\r\n\r\nserved  for only a few months. The civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  retired before December had put in many years\r\n\r\nof  loyal  and dedicated service and yet they  are\r\n\r\nnot   privileged   to  receive  the   13th   month\r\n\r\nallowance,   just  because  they  retired   before\r\n\r\nDecember.  Sir, I wonder whether the Minister  can\r\n\r\nreconsider the matter, because I feel that a civil\r\n\r\nservant  should be given a good send-off  when  he\r\n\r\nretires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is that pensioners have all\r\n\r\nalong been drawing pensions computed on their  old\r\n\r\nbasic salaries. I am not speaking for myself. With\r\n\r\nthe  consolidation of salaries a few years ago and\r\n\r\nalso in view of the rising cost of living, can the\r\n\r\nMinister  look  into the matter and  do  something\r\n\r\nconcrete to revise the pension rates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he has any intention of transferring  all\r\n\r\ncivil servants, who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  present under the pension scheme, to  the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in our efforts to promote the use of\r\n\r\nlocally-made   products  through   the   Progress,\r\n\r\nQuality   and   Reliability  campaign,   we   have\r\n\r\nforgotten   one   aspect.   Foreign   manufactured\r\n\r\narticles  are allowed to compete with locally-made\r\n\r\nproducts at prices where the difference is  small.\r\n\r\nSurely  some  form  of tariff can  be  imposed  on\r\n\r\nforeign products so that they can be priced out of\r\n\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is that the income tax forms\r\n\r\nsent  out  in  January to taxpayers are  literally\r\n\r\ncausing  a headache. The print of the text  is  so\r\n\r\nsmall  that  in  some columns one cannot  see  the\r\n\r\ninstructions     clearly.     Furthermore,     the\r\n\r\ninstructions  seem  to be too complicated  for  an\r\n\r\nordinary worker to fill in the particulars. Can it\r\n\r\nbe  modified  in such a way that fewer particulars\r\n\r\nare only necessary, because taxpayers seem to fill\r\n\r\nin the form wrongly? I myself find it difficult to\r\n\r\nfill in the form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, may I raise a question relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  exemption of income tax for associations  and\r\n\r\nsocieties?  In  Singapore, there are  about  2,000\r\n\r\norganisations registered under the Societies  Act.\r\n\r\nThese societies are useful for the promotion of  a\r\n\r\nclosely-knit society and they are financed by  the\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  from members. Most of  the  office-bearers  are  voluntary  workers.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nsocieties  may  employ full-time staff  and  their\r\n\r\nsalaries are paid from the subscriptions collected\r\n\r\nfrom  members. Occasionally these societies  carry\r\n\r\nout  fund-raising activities for the  construction\r\n\r\nof  new  premises,  for  the  establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nscholarship   fund,  or  for  sports   and   other\r\n\r\nrecreational activities. Sometimes fund-raising is\r\n\r\nalso  carried  out for the purpose  of  organising\r\n\r\nstudy   missions  and  friendly  visits  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these funds which are collected by the\r\n\r\nsocieties  after  making a great  effort  are  not\r\n\r\nexempted from income tax, unless more than half of\r\n\r\nthe  amount are from members' subscriptions.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat I do not understand is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.  Why  cannot  the  Government  exempt  these\r\n\r\nsocieties  from  paying income  tax?  The  office-bearers of these societies voluntarily play  their\r\n\r\npart  in  running  the affairs of  the  societies.\r\n\r\nAfter great painstaking efforts, they find that  a\r\n\r\ngreat  chunk  of  their  collection  goes  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment coffers. They are rather discouraged. I\r\n\r\nthink  the societies which contribute towards  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our country should be exempted from\r\n\r\npaying  income tax. If we do not grant  exemption,\r\n\r\nthen  the  desire  to serve our  country  will  be\r\n\r\ndampened. Therefore, from the long-term  point  of\r\n\r\nview, this is undesirable. Sir, if these societies\r\n\r\ncan  be exempted from paying income tax, they will\r\n\r\nhave  more  funds for certain projects  which  are\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the society as a whole. For example,\r\n\r\nthey  will  have more money for scholarship  funds\r\n\r\nand   for  the  promotion  of  sports  and   other\r\n\r\nrecreational  activities. In this  way,  they  can\r\n\r\nhelp  promote  the development of our  society.  I\r\n\r\nsincerely  hope  the  Minister  for  Finance  will\r\n\r\nconsider   favourably  the  question  of  granting\r\n\r\nexemption of income tax to these societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the questions which have been  asked\r\n\r\nby  Members cover a very wide field. Some of  them\r\n\r\nperhaps are more appropriate to other Heads,  e.g.\r\n\r\nInland  Revenue, in respect of income tax.  But  I\r\n\r\nhope  that I can deal with all their queries under\r\n\r\nthis particular Head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the first question raised by the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  Sembawang and Anson, I would  assure\r\n\r\nthem  that  in  regard  to the  rising  prices  of\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  and  commodities, the  Government  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  very conscious of  their  effect  on\r\n\r\ncosts   of  living,  and  has  therefore   devoted\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time and effort to try and  minimise\r\n\r\nthe price increases of these commodities. However,\r\n\r\nit  is not always possible to do very much because\r\n\r\nof  the  nature of our economy. Being an  entirely\r\n\r\nopen  economy, Singapore is heavily  dependent  on\r\n\r\nimports  for  almost  all of its  requirements  of\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  and  essential commodities.  In  1972,\r\n\r\nimports of foodstuffs totalled $1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbillion.  Of these imports, $570 million  was  re-exported.  But  the  balance, approximately  worth\r\n\r\n$630  million, was retained for local consumption.\r\n\r\nThe  prices  which are charged for  these  imports\r\n\r\nmust,  of  course, reflect the conditions  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  from  which  these  imports  come.  Our\r\n\r\nlocally-produced livestock, vegetables and  fruits\r\n\r\ntotalled only $160 million. We process, of course,\r\n\r\nsome  commodities  such  as  sugar,  wheat  flour,\r\n\r\ncondensed  milk, and so on. But the raw  materials\r\n\r\nwhich  are produced abroad are imported, and  they\r\n\r\nmake  up  more  than  70 per  cent  of  the  cost.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is not much we can do as  far  as\r\n\r\nthis 70 per cent is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As inflation is rampant in the countries from\r\n\r\nwhich  we  buy our requirements, we  can  do  very\r\n\r\nlittle to prevent price increases. However, we can\r\n\r\ntry to moderate some of these price increases. For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  the  case  of sugar,  current  world\r\n\r\nprices  of raw sugar are about 100 per cent higher\r\n\r\nthan  they were a year ago. The price of sugar  in\r\n\r\nSingapore has increased by only 16 per cent.  This\r\n\r\nwas   possible  because  the  Sugar  Industry   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which produces all the sugar  consumed\r\n\r\nlocally,  had  the foresight to secure,  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  five years, supplies of raw sugar on a long-term  contract basis at prices lower than  current\r\n\r\nworld prices. In the same way, in Australia, which\r\n\r\nis  the  cheapest  source of  wheat,  wheat  grain\r\n\r\nprices  increased  by  nearly  50  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  allowed  the  two  flour   mills\r\n\r\nincreases of only 25 per cent. In the case of rice\r\n\r\ntoo,  because of our stockpile requirements  which\r\n\r\nwe   impose  upon  rice  importers,  consumers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore benefit from the imports which were made\r\n\r\nat  lower than current world prices. A very  sharp\r\n\r\nrise  in  the  price  of  rice  in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\ntherefore been avoided. I think the figure  of  50\r\n\r\ncents  mentioned  by the Member for  Sembawang  is\r\n\r\nvery  reasonable  in comparison  with  the  prices\r\n\r\ncharged in other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries, where there is even a physical shortage\r\n\r\nof  rice  at  those  prices. The  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be alert to any possibility of  price\r\n\r\nincreases in other essential commodities. However,\r\n\r\nit  must  be recognised that because of the  great\r\n\r\ndependence  on imports price increases  cannot  be\r\n\r\navoided.  A  close watch on wholesale  and  retail\r\n\r\nprices to prevent any undue profiteering, hoarding\r\n\r\nor manipulation, will be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the second question of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang. He spoke of our very  great  trade\r\n\r\ndeficit  and asked what action was being taken  to\r\n\r\nreduce   such  great  deficits.  In  past   Budget\r\n\r\nstatements  I  think  I mentioned  the  fact  that\r\n\r\ndeficits  in  our trade, while very serious,  have\r\n\r\nbeen   covered  by  our  invisible  earnings  from\r\n\r\ntourism,  by  capital inflow, and so on,  so  that\r\n\r\nthere is really no need for much concern. Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  deficit is also due to the importation\r\n\r\nof  capital  equipment and  goods  which  will  in\r\n\r\nfuture produce a greater possibility for export of\r\n\r\ngoods.  Therefore,  to that  extent,  the  figures\r\n\r\nwould  be  self-balancing.  I  thank  the  Member,\r\n\r\nhowever,  for his concern for what he  called  the\r\n\r\n\"ulcer in our economic bodies\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as his question on INTRACO is concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  intention was that the setting up of  INTRACO\r\n\r\nwould  help  in  the  export of our  manufactures.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary objects have been achieved, they\r\n\r\nare  now exporting to 40 countries, including  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, Australia, the EEC countries, ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  some  socialist  countries.   The\r\n\r\nincrease in our trade with the socialist countries\r\n\r\nhas not been all that is desired. However, exports\r\n\r\nover the last two years have accounted for some 65\r\n\r\nper  cent of the company's total turnover. I think\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts will have to be  made  in  export\r\n\r\npromotion  and, while INTRACO will be one  vehicle\r\n\r\nfor  such  export promotion, it will be  necessary\r\n\r\nover   the   next  few  years  to  develop   other\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  The Export Promotion Centre,  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  set  up  in the Trade  Division  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry, will be responsible for further progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the drive for more exports  to  various\r\n\r\ncountries, including the Communist countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang then turned to the\r\n\r\nquestion  of what he called the sharp  decline  in\r\n\r\ninvestments in the ship-building industry in 1972.\r\n\r\nMy  Budget  statement did not, however,  refer  so\r\n\r\nmuch  to  the  decline in investments  as  to  the\r\n\r\ndecline   in  investment  commitments,  which   is\r\n\r\nsomething  different. If he will look  closely  at\r\n\r\ncol.  466  of  Hansard, he will see that  this  is\r\n\r\nreally  what  I  meant: 1971 was,  of  course,  an\r\n\r\nunusually   good   year  as  far   as   investment\r\n\r\ncommitments    were   concerned,   and    although\r\n\r\ncommitments  in  1972 were by comparison  smaller,\r\n\r\nour  computation  has not taken into  account  the\r\n\r\nexpansion   of  existing  shipyards  which,   from\r\n\r\nprovisional  figures,  amounted  to   some   $83.1\r\n\r\nmillion in 1972. As I have mentioned in my  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement, there is really not very much need  for\r\n\r\nconcern  about  investment  commitments  in  ship-building  and shiprepairing because our locational\r\n\r\nadvantages  are  such  that  we  would  expect  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   our  competitive  advantage  in   these\r\n\r\nindustries. The investments which have  been  made\r\n\r\nin  the past and which are continuing to be  made,\r\n\r\nwhether  by expansion or by new commitments,  will\r\n\r\nensure that we will have an output of $600 million\r\n\r\nby   1975,  as  I  have  mentioned  in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement, and some $800 million by 1976. I  think\r\n\r\nwhat we are now looking forward to is an expansion\r\n\r\nof  the  supporting  industries for  shipbuilding,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  ship equipment and machinery,  and  this\r\n\r\nwill, I hope, upgrade our ship-building machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further matter which the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nraised was the question of salaries of officers in\r\n\r\nDivisions  IT,  III  and IV. In  my  statement  in\r\n\r\nParliament on the 16th February, I indicated  that\r\n\r\nafter  the restructuring and realignment of salary\r\n\r\nscales,  which have now been virtually  completed,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  Government's intention  to  consider\r\n\r\nincreases  for Divisions II to IV,  and  even  for\r\n\r\nthose  in Division I, namely, on the basis of  the\r\n\r\nguidelines  issued by the National Wages  Council.\r\n\r\nFor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the Member for Sembawang, I  would\r\n\r\nreiterate  that  it is Government's  intention  to\r\n\r\nadopt, so far as this relates or is applicable  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector, the agreed general guidelines\r\n\r\nof the National Wages Council for salary increases\r\n\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the questions asked by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson.  He  raised a considerable  number  of\r\n\r\npoints over a wide range of subjects. Let me first\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  chit funds.  The  last  date  for\r\n\r\nreceiving   claims   against  Gemini   Chit   Fund\r\n\r\nCorporation was the 6th January, 1973, and against\r\n\r\nStallion   Corporation  Limited   was   the   16th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1972. Since then the Official  Receiver\r\n\r\nhas  been  actively  processing  the  claims  from\r\n\r\nsubscribers of these two and nine other chit  fund\r\n\r\ncompanies  being wound up by the court. There  are\r\n\r\napproximately  42,000  claimants  altogether,  and\r\n\r\neach  claim  has to be individually  verified.  No\r\n\r\neffort  is being spared to expedite the settlement\r\n\r\nof  these claims. I do not think a date can as yet\r\n\r\nbe set for such settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also touched on the question\r\n\r\nof  the  National Wages Council. I have  mentioned\r\n\r\nthis  in another connection, but he wanted to know\r\n\r\nwhen they will be meeting and what is the time  at\r\n\r\nwhich they will submit their recommendations. This\r\n\r\nis  something  which, of course, I  am  not  fully\r\n\r\naware  of,  but they have met since December  last\r\n\r\nyear,  and  I  believe they are hoping  to  submit\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations to the  Government  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  April. I believe some Members  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side of the House will be able to give  him\r\n\r\nmore information on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also touched on the question\r\n\r\nof  price control. I have already answered this to\r\n\r\nsome  extent  in  my  reply  to  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang.  But let me assure him again  that  the\r\n\r\nTrade   Division   and   the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  conduct checks on prices of  essential\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs.   The  Government  will  continue   to\r\n\r\nexercise  some  control  on  such  commodities  as\r\n\r\nsugar, wheat, flour and condensed milk, which  are\r\n\r\nprotected by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntariffs and are therefore to some extent dependent\r\n\r\non Government permission for price increases. They\r\n\r\nhave to justify such price increases by giving  us\r\n\r\nfigures of cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson made some suggestions as to\r\n\r\nhow  to beat the price increases. I appreciate the\r\n\r\nproposal   he   made  for  the  establishment   of\r\n\r\ncooperatives.  This, I think, will  contribute  to\r\n\r\nfree and fair competition, which would be the best\r\n\r\nsafeguard  against unfair and manipulated  prices.\r\n\r\nHowever,  such co-operatives are best  managed  by\r\n\r\nnon-governmental organisations, such  as  the  one\r\n\r\nestablished in Toa Payoh. I hope that  this  pilot\r\n\r\nproject will prove successful and be the precursor\r\n\r\nof many other such co-operative stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to price tagging, it has already been\r\n\r\nintroduced by shopping centres and emporiums,  and\r\n\r\nno  doubt this tagging could be extended to  other\r\n\r\nshops.  I  do not think that legislation  to  this\r\n\r\neffect  would  help  to overcome  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nprofiteering by retailers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for daily publicity of prices of essential\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs, the suggestion is interesting and  can\r\n\r\nbe  given consideration. But many prices, such  as\r\n\r\nthose  for  condensed  milk, sugar,  soft  drinks,\r\n\r\ncoffee,  and so on, are fixed for long periods  of\r\n\r\ntime  and do not really require publicity. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  other essential foodstuffs, prices  vary\r\n\r\nfrom locality to locality. In the rural areas, for\r\n\r\nexample,  I think it may be possible to buy,  say,\r\n\r\npapayas  or  eggs at cheaper rates than  in  urban\r\n\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, I think, also mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  terms  and  conditions of  service  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   sector,  relating   particularly   to\r\n\r\nclerical officers and clerical assistants. I agree\r\n\r\nthat  as far as clerical work is concerned, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to  distinguish  the  duties   of\r\n\r\nclerical   officers   from   those   of   clerical\r\n\r\nassistants.  The  general rule  is  that  clerical\r\n\r\nofficers   are  given  more  responsible  clerical\r\n\r\nduties. It is not true that clerical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassistants  have  no prospects  of  promotion.  In\r\n\r\nfact, a promotion exercise was held in early 1972,\r\n\r\nand  out  of  833  clerical  assistants  who  were\r\n\r\neligible  for consideration, 277, or 33 per  cent,\r\n\r\nwere  promoted to clerical officers  as  from  1st\r\n\r\nApril,  1972. 1 have already said that  Government\r\n\r\nemployees will get salary increases based  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council guidelines, and it  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue therefore that the lower grades of workers in\r\n\r\nthe Government sector are totally neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about compensation for\r\n\r\nreduction  of  leave  for  officers  in  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies. I think this matter is being reviewed  and\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  subject of further negotiations  or\r\n\r\noffers by the statutory bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the Member mentioned the question of\r\n\r\nincrease  in CPF contributions from 10 to  12  per\r\n\r\ncent  in 1972, resulting in a lower take-home pay.\r\n\r\nThis may be true if one considers just the pay for\r\n\r\na  single month. But if the pay is taken in  terms\r\n\r\nof  a  year,  then  the 13th month non-pensionable\r\n\r\nallowance, which was paid last year and again this\r\n\r\nyear,   more   than   offsets  the   increase   in\r\n\r\ncontributions to the CPF. If anyone feels that his\r\n\r\ntake-home  pay  for  the  other  months  has  been\r\n\r\nadversely   affected  by  the  increase   in   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates,  he can always  instruct  the\r\n\r\nAccountant-General to have the total contributions\r\n\r\nfor  the  year  deducted at source from  his  13th\r\n\r\nmonth payment. This would help in alleviating some\r\n\r\nof  the hardship. I would remind the Member  that,\r\n\r\napart  from  the deduction from the worker's  pay,\r\n\r\nthe increased CPF contribution is also paid by the\r\n\r\nemployer. This will result in some benefit to  the\r\n\r\nworker  because it can be used as payment  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board,  so  that  lime  amount  which  is\r\n\r\npreviously paid from his salary is now substituted\r\n\r\nby   the  amount  available  from  the  employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned the question of\r\n\r\ntransferring  workers from the pension  scheme  to\r\n\r\nCPF  arrangements. The Government is  thinking  of\r\n\r\ntransferring pensionable officers in Divisions III\r\n\r\nand IV to CPF terms when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   have  been  improved.  Details   of   this\r\n\r\nconversion are still being worked out,  and  I  am\r\n\r\ntherefore  not in a position to say  more  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also made a very eloquent\r\n\r\nplea  for  the plight of civil servants,  who  are\r\n\r\nretiring  before 31st December, to  be  given  the\r\n\r\n13th  month  payment or a proportion  thereof.  He\r\n\r\nalso  wanted  to  know whether  I  would  consider\r\n\r\nincreasing  pension rates in view  of  the  rising\r\n\r\ncost  of  living. As a pensioner  myself,  I  have\r\n\r\nconsiderable sympathy for the case of  pensioners,\r\n\r\nbut  I am afraid I will have to say no to his very\r\n\r\neloquent pleas. I can hold out no hope of  varying\r\n\r\nthe decision on these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned the question of tariffs on\r\n\r\nforeign  manufactured articles. The  policy  which\r\n\r\nGovernment  has always adopted has been  to  grant\r\n\r\ntariff   protection  to  efficient  and  deserving\r\n\r\nindustries  faced  with  unfair  competition  from\r\n\r\nforeign products, and which are able to contribute\r\n\r\nto the development of the economy. Such protection\r\n\r\nis  normally  given on a very selective  basis  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be able to retain the  stimulus  of\r\n\r\ncompetition and avoid undue increases in the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living. The imposition of too liberal  tariffs\r\n\r\nmust  be  detrimental in the long run. The present\r\n\r\nposition   of   manufacturing  is  that   we   are\r\n\r\nencouraging more technology-based industries,  and\r\n\r\nthese  industries would usually have their markets\r\n\r\nabroad  and  would  not therefore  require  tariff\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter which the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nraised  was the question of the income tax  forms.\r\n\r\nHe  complained  that the forms are in  very  small\r\n\r\nprint and too complicated for ordinary workers  to\r\n\r\nfill  in.  I  have considerable sympathy  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  who,  like  myself  and  other\r\n\r\ngentlemen of advancing years, find it difficult to\r\n\r\nread  what they now consider small print but which\r\n\r\nthey   previously  found  quite  readable.  I   am\r\n\r\ninformed  that  the print used in the  income  tax\r\n\r\nreturn  is of the same size as that used in paper-backs and in certain pages of our daily news-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npapers  which are very widely read and  appear  to\r\n\r\ngive  no  difficulty  to the  average  or  younger\r\n\r\nreader.  If a larger print is required,  then  the\r\n\r\nincome tax form would run into more pages and cost\r\n\r\nconsiderably  more.  The  income  tax   form   has\r\n\r\nremained  the  same over the last  few  years  and\r\n\r\nthere  is really no reason for the ordinary worker\r\n\r\nto  be confused by the requirements. But I do  not\r\n\r\nblame  him if, like Professor Albert Einstein,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not find the filling in of these income  tax\r\n\r\nforms   easy.  I  am  told  by  the   Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,   and   I  received   it   with   some\r\n\r\nincredulity, that from experience they found  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  the forms  received  have  been\r\n\r\ncorrectly   completed.  But  if   there   is   any\r\n\r\ndifficulty in filling in the forms, the Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  willing to  offer  assistance  and\r\n\r\nthere are officials who can help taxpayers to fill\r\n\r\nin the forms correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Jurong who raised\r\n\r\nthe  question  of societies registered  under  the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Act  and the possibility  of  exempting\r\n\r\nthem  from income tax. I think he asked a  similar\r\n\r\nquestion at Budget time last year, and T gave  him\r\n\r\na fairly lengthy reply. It seemed to be exhaustive\r\n\r\nenough. But if I may recapitulate: I confirm again\r\n\r\nthat  where  the  objects of a society  registered\r\n\r\nunder the Societies Act are wholly charitable  and\r\n\r\nbenefit  the community at large, there is specific\r\n\r\nprovision  in the Income Tax Act for exemption  of\r\n\r\ntax  on  its  income.  This then  leaves  us  with\r\n\r\nsocieties  which  are not wholly charitable.  Even\r\n\r\namong these societies, very few would be liable to\r\n\r\nincome tax as tax is only liable if less than half\r\n\r\nof its receipts come from members. I think most of\r\n\r\nthe  receipts  of the societies he mentioned  have\r\n\r\ncome  from  non-members and  that  it  was  rather\r\n\r\npainful that it should be lost in income tax.  But\r\n\r\nas  I  said,  the legislation enables us  to  give\r\n\r\nexemption to those societies which have more  than\r\n\r\nhalf  of  its receipts from members. The rationale\r\n\r\nfor   this  is  that  if  the  society  is  mainly\r\n\r\ndependent on its members for its funds and for its\r\n\r\nexistence, it is not trading or profit-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the contributions received\r\n\r\nfrom  non-members  of  the  society  outweigh  the\r\n\r\nsubscriptions collected from its members, then  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  assumed  and deemed  to  be  carrying  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  and,  therefore, tax is  liable  on  any\r\n\r\nsurplus  in  its  accounts, just  like  any  other\r\n\r\ntrading organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding\r\n\r\nthe  income  tax form, is it right for the  income\r\n\r\ntax  officers to fill in the forms for the public?\r\n\r\nI  repeat: the income tax officers are filling  in\r\n\r\nthe  income  tax  forms for the  public.

I feel that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Finance  regards  the   societies\r\n\r\nregistered under the Societies Act as  a  kind  of\r\n\r\ntrading concern. I think basically this is  wrong.\r\n\r\nThese  societies have volunteered to work for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of  the  community and  their  members.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  they  raise funds  to  build  their  own\r\n\r\npremises or to give scholarships. They raise funds\r\n\r\nto   give   money   to  their  members.   In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I would like to ask  whether  these\r\n\r\nsocieties can be exempted from income tax although\r\n\r\nthey are not charitable organisations as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that\r\n\r\nif they are charitable organisations they would be\r\n\r\nexempted  from  tax. If the objects  are  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the community at large, that is another\r\n\r\ncondition. But if they benefit only a small group,\r\n\r\nsay, the people living in one particular road,  or\r\n\r\nthey give scholarships to the children in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneighbourhood of say, 10 houses, obviously  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  something which is of general benefit to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  at  large. In such cases we  would  not\r\n\r\ngive  exemption.  In cases where  the  benefit  is\r\n\r\nspread over the community at large, I think  there\r\n\r\nwould be no difficulties. I would suggest that  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member has any particular case he could refer\r\n\r\nit  to me and, if there is any doubt, then we will\r\n\r\nclarify the exact reasons why income tax exemption\r\n\r\ncannot be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I thank the Minister for his detailed answer\r\n\r\nto  my questions. We know now that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  has adopted certain measures  to  control\r\n\r\nthe  increases  in the prices of commodities,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is doing something to  put  a\r\n\r\nstop  to the rising cost of living. I believe this\r\n\r\nwill help the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the trade deficit, he said that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  reason  for  concern.  I  am  much\r\n\r\nrelieved to receive his assurance. But I feel that\r\n\r\nto allow the trade deficit to continue is not good\r\n\r\nin  the  long run.

It\r\n\r\nis  a  new  division. I would  like  to  make  one\r\n\r\nsuggestion for the consideration of the  Minister.\r\n\r\nIn the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrafting   of   the   Budget   for   the   various\r\n\r\ndepartments, certain provisions are connected with\r\n\r\ntwo departments. For example, in making a loan  to\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board, the  provision\r\n\r\nis  made  under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  vote.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in the past when the House debated  on\r\n\r\nthis  item  there  was  some confusion.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  loan  provision for the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board was made under the vote for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance, but when Members  spoke  on\r\n\r\nthat loan provision and made certain criticisms on\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance turned round and said that  this  was\r\n\r\nnot   within   his  ambit  as  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board came under the jurisdiction  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of National Development and that such\r\n\r\ncriticisms  should be directed to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development.  But  there  was  no   such\r\n\r\nprovision  under  the  vote for  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development. Hence, the confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting the Budget for next year, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   it  is  possible  to  place  this   loan\r\n\r\nprovision  under  the  vote for  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development, namely, \"Loan to the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board\". I do  not  know  whether\r\n\r\nthere  will be any administrative difficulties  in\r\n\r\norder  to carry out this suggestion. We know  that\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  People's Association  is  put\r\n\r\ntinder  the  Ministry of Culture. So if  provision\r\n\r\nfor  such an organisation can be placed under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture, I would like to  have  this\r\n\r\nitem, \"Loan to the Housing and Development Board\",\r\n\r\nplaced under the Ministry of National Development.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the suggestion of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang has some merit in that, for  better\r\n\r\nreflection   of  the  true  position,   the   loan\r\n\r\nprovision  should be made under  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development. I appreciate his suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt  is  correct  that if he wants details  of  the\r\n\r\noperations  of the Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nthen  his  inquiries  should be  directed  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development. I believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  has  taken every opportunity to do so  in  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  of the Estimates for the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development. The Member can raise  a  lot\r\n\r\nof questions under the provision for the Minister,\r\n\r\nin fact, any matter which relates to his Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the particular loan item appears\r\n\r\nunder  the Ministry of Finance is that the quantum\r\n\r\nand the terms of the loan are matters in which the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance is involved. That means,  if\r\n\r\nhe   wants  to  know  why  in  the  allocation  of\r\n\r\nfinancial resources the Minister gave $20 million,\r\n\r\nor  $30  million, or $100 million, or $300 million\r\n\r\nwhich is nearer what was provided, then it is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the Minister  for  Finance  to\r\n\r\nexplain.  And sometimes the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  to exercise the responsibility whether or not\r\n\r\nto  give $300 million if he only had $200 million.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why the provision is entered  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance. Similarly,  the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions under which the loans are given to  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board, whether it  is  for\r\n\r\n20  years, 25 years, or 30 years, and so on, would\r\n\r\nbe  a matter under the jurisdiction of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister. If there are any questions on this, this\r\n\r\nis  the  particular item under which it  could  be\r\n\r\nraised. But I accept the fact that perhaps matters\r\n\r\non  Housing  and Development Board could  also  be\r\n\r\npresented   under   the   Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is better to present this\r\n\r\nprovision   under  this  Ministry  or  the   other\r\n\r\nMinistry, that is a matter of judgment. I hope the\r\n\r\nMember  has not been inhibited in any way  by  its\r\n\r\nbeing  placed  under the Ministry of Finance.  The\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association is in a  somewhat  different\r\n\r\ncategory in the sense that the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\ndoes  not  give loans to the People's Association,\r\n\r\nand   although  there  is  a  provision  for   the\r\n\r\noperational  expenses of the People's Association,\r\n\r\nit  comes  under the control of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said  that the  provision  for  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board should perhaps  come\r\n\r\nunder the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development. However, we  can\r\n\r\neasily solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the loan provision for the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board, when Members  move  their\r\n\r\namendments  on this item they may raise  questions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nwhich   comes  under  the  Ministry  of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. But the Minister for Finance will not\r\n\r\nbe  able to answer such criticisms because  he  is\r\n\r\nonly  responsible for making loans to the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board. He is not responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe   detailed   working  of   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. In past debates  it  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  difficult whether to confine the debate  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development  or  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Finance, the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association is in a  different  position\r\n\r\nbecause the Ministry of Finance does not make  any\r\n\r\nloan  to  the People's Association. On  principle,\r\n\r\nthis  should not be different because the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance makes a loan to any department. It is a\r\n\r\nloan  in  the  account  books  and  it  can  claim\r\n\r\nrepayment of the loan. I feel that there should be\r\n\r\nsome   arrangement  between  one  department   and\r\n\r\nanother department. Perhaps this will only involve\r\n\r\na  change in the name of one department only.  But\r\n\r\nthe Minister may have other technical difficulties\r\n\r\nand   may   have  to  consult  other  departments.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am patient enough to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Minister has said that my suggestion\r\n\r\nhas  some  merit, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11*.\r\n\r\n(* The  same amendment also stood in the name  of Mr Ho Kah Leong.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for this subhead is\r\n\r\n$140,200,000 and this is a loan to the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation.  The  Jurong  industrial  estate  has\r\n\r\nbecome  famous and is a pride to the nation.  Many\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects have been carried out. To me,\r\n\r\nit  does not matter whether the industrial  estate\r\n\r\nis in Sembawang or in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how this\r\n\r\nhuge  provision of $140,200,000 is to be utilised.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister can give me a detailed answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am grateful\r\n\r\nto the Member for Sembawang for his lavish praises\r\n\r\non  Jurong. However, I feel that there is room for\r\n\r\nimprovement in the development of Jurong  Town.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask some questions relating to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Jurong Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of flats in Jurong Town;\r\n\r\none is low-cost housing and the other is executive\r\n\r\nhousing.  Priority is given to workers in  Jurong.\r\n\r\nLow-cost   flats   can  be  purchased   with   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.  But  one cannot  utilise  his  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions for the purchase of executive flats.\r\n\r\nThe  first few blocks of executive flats were sold\r\n\r\na  few  years ago at a price of $33,000 per  unit.\r\n\r\nThe  second  lot  is  about  to  be  sold,  and  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the price per  unit  is  $38,000\r\n\r\nupwards. To purchase an executive flat, one has to\r\n\r\nmake  a down payment of 20 per cent of the selling\r\n\r\nprice. Not every executive can afford such  a  big\r\n\r\nsum of money for the down payment for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  executive flats. I understand that the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  is building five-room flats, and the  price\r\n\r\nof  these  flats  in  the urban  areas  is  around\r\n\r\n$30,000  per unit. These HDB five-room  flats  are\r\n\r\nabout the same as those executive flats in Jurong.\r\n\r\nI  do  not understand why one can utilise his  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions for the purchase of five-room  flats\r\n\r\nbut  one cannot utilise his CPF contributions  for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of executive flats in Jurong. I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister concerned to  explain  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse the reasons for this difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is related to children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  in  Jurong. There  are  about  40,000\r\n\r\npeople  living in Jurong but there are only  three\r\n\r\nchildren's playgrounds. One playground is still in\r\n\r\ngood   condition,   but   the   other   two    are\r\n\r\nunfortunately in a state of disrepair.  The  play-things like the swings and the other equipment are\r\n\r\nalready damaged. I feel that the people in  Jurong\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  sufficient recreational facilities.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor of the blocks of flats cannot  be\r\n\r\nused  as a playground for the children, as is  the\r\n\r\ncase with the new blocks of Housing Board flats. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister whether the  flats\r\n\r\nto   be  built  in  Jurong  will  have  playground\r\n\r\nfacilities for children on the ground floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third point is related to the question of\r\n\r\nhygiene  and  health in Jurong. The  environmental\r\n\r\ncondition in Jurong is getting from bad to  worse.\r\n\r\nI  know that the cleaning up or sweeping of public\r\n\r\nplaces  and the collection of refuse in Jurong  is\r\n\r\ndone  by  contractors. If the contractors are  not\r\n\r\nable  to  employ enough workers to carry  out  the\r\n\r\njob,  perhaps because they pay very low  wages  or\r\n\r\nfor  any  other  reason, the result  is  that  the\r\n\r\ndrains  are clogged up and rubbish begins to  pile\r\n\r\nup  in  these public places. Sir, Jurong Town,  as\r\n\r\npointed  out  by  the Member for Sembawang,  is  a\r\n\r\nmodel  industrial  estate  in  Singapore.  It  has\r\n\r\nattracted many tourists from abroad. If all  these\r\n\r\nuntidy and dirty conditions prevail, it will leave\r\n\r\na  bad impression on the tourists. I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  to  request  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation to pay more attention to environmental\r\n\r\nhygiene  in  Jurong.  If the contractors  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing   their  job,  change  them  and   get   new\r\n\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the provision of $140.2\r\n\r\nmillion   for  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation   is\r\n\r\nrequired to partly pay for an expenditure of  $189\r\n\r\nmillion  in  development projects. The surplus  of\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Town  Corporation  is  sufficient  to\r\n\r\nsupply $48.8 million, to make up the total of $189\r\n\r\nmillion for development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the financial year 1973-74, the projects\r\n\r\nwhich  are  intended  to be  carried  out  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows. Firstly, industrial projects: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Industrial projects in Jurong Town - about\r\n\r\n1,000   acres   of   land   with   the   necessary\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  will  be  prepared,  and  over  40\r\n\r\nstandard factories built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Industrial projects in other industrial\r\n\r\nestates, covering a total area of 268 acres to  be\r\n\r\nprepared. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                     Acres\r\n\r\nAyer Rajah                             61\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah                          10\r\n\r\nKallang Basin, including Kolam Ayer   180\r\n\r\nToa Payoh                              17\r\n\r\n                                      ---\r\n\r\n                        Total         268\r\n\r\n                                      ===\r\n\r\n</pre>                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, seven blocks of multi-storey\r\n\r\nfactories  will  be completed and construction  of\r\n\r\nanother six will commence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Work on the extension of the Jurong Port to\r\n\r\nadd  another 3,000 feet of deep-water berths  will\r\n\r\ncommence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, housing projects: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Over 5,000 units of low-cost flats will be\r\n\r\ncompleted, and another 5,000 units will  be  built\r\n\r\non  220  acres of land at Neighbourhood II, Jurong\r\n\r\nTown.  In  addition, construction  of  over  4,000\r\n\r\nunits  of flats on 94 acres at Kampung Java Teban,\r\n\r\nJurong Town, will commence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In Sembawang, 528 units of low-cost housing\r\n\r\nwill be completed, and construction of another 572\r\n\r\nunits will commence covering 17 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On executive housing, over 3,000 units\r\n\r\ndesigned in the condominium standard will be built\r\n\r\nin Jurong Town, covering 10 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, social amenities. The Chinese Garden and\r\n\r\nthe   sports  complex  in  Jurong  Town  will   be\r\n\r\ncompleted in 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Jurong Town Hall will be completed\r\n\r\nby the end of 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question on executive flats asked by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jurong, the purchaser of such flats\r\n\r\nis   not   allowed  to  make  use   of   his   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  reason  for  this is quite  simple.  The  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions are only allowed to be used for low-cost  housing, and these $38,000-units are not  in\r\n\r\nthe low-cost housing class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member made a comparison with the\r\n\r\nfive-room flats of the Housing Board. These are in\r\n\r\na  slightly  different category.  They  are  lower\r\n\r\npriced  for one thing, and for another,  they  are\r\n\r\nstill  limited  to  people  with  combined  family\r\n\r\nincomes  of  $1,500 per month and  under.  So  the\r\n\r\nregulation  still  is that CPF  contributions  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  used  for purchase of  a  low-cost  flat\r\n\r\nconstructed  by the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nor  the Jurong Town Corporation. The JTC executive\r\n\r\nflat  is intended for the need of the professional\r\n\r\nand managerial staff in the higher income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the children's\r\n\r\nplayground  in Jurong. There are at present  three\r\n\r\nchildren's playgrounds in the residential area  in\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  I.  He  said  that  a  lot  of  the\r\n\r\nequipment,  swings and so on, is damaged.  If  so,\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation\r\n\r\nshould  be brought to bear on this problem and  to\r\n\r\nhave   the   damage  repaired.  The  Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  is,  however,  planning  seven   more\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  in Neighbourhood II,  four  of  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  completed in 1973-74  and  the  rest  in\r\n\r\n1974-75.  In  addition, the Jurong  Park  with  80\r\n\r\nacres  of park land will be opened soon to provide\r\n\r\nadded  recreational  amenities  for  the  children\r\n\r\nliving  in  Jurong Town. The Member for Jurong  is\r\n\r\nreally  more fortunate than most other Members  in\r\n\r\nthis House, so far as recreational facilities  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he spoke of the problem of taking measures\r\n\r\nregarding hygiene in the residential areas  within\r\n\r\nthe   jurisdiction   of  the   Ministry   of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  Therefore, this is  not  so  much  a\r\n\r\nproblem   for   the   Jurong   Town   Corporation.\r\n\r\nEnforcement measures are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the Ministry. The Corporation, however,\r\n\r\nworks  very  closely with the  Ministry,  and  has\r\n\r\nassisted  in  this  matter  since  some   of   the\r\n\r\nCorporation  officers, 24 in the  supervisory  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  grades, have been empowered  to  ticket\r\n\r\noffenders.  The  number  will  be  increased,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary, to cope with the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister for giving us a detailed reply.

So, on the same  ground,\r\n\r\nI think we should extend the housing scheme to the\r\n\r\nteachers in Government-aided schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, as to whether the scheme can\r\n\r\nbe  specifically extended to staff of  Government-aided schools, I am afraid the answer is still no,\r\n\r\nfor  the  reason  that  they  are  not  Government\r\n\r\nservants.  Even the current housing  loan  schemes\r\n\r\nare  not  extended to the Government-aided  school\r\n\r\nstaff  so that, apart from the allocation of  this\r\n\r\nhousing scheme for public officers, they would not\r\n\r\nbe eligible for such loans. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  is  simply  that they are  not  Government\r\n\r\nemployees.  The  distinction has  been  made,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  terms  of  service  are  not  the  same  as\r\n\r\nGovernment  in all respects. Maybe their  teaching\r\n\r\nload is the same, but they are not subject to  the\r\n\r\nsame obligations, say, to be transferred from  one\r\n\r\nplace to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am still\r\n\r\nnot   satisfied  with  the  reply  given  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister. He said that teachers in the Government-aided schools are not Government servants. I quite\r\n\r\nagree with this. However, I seem to have heard the\r\n\r\nMinister say that those officers in Divisions  III\r\n\r\nand  IV would be given the option to convert  from\r\n\r\nthe  pension scheme to the Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nScheme.  If this is done, then there is  not  much\r\n\r\ndifference  between Government and  non-Government\r\n\r\nservants.   The   Minister  also  mentioned   that\r\n\r\nteachers in the aided schools are not entitled  to\r\n\r\nthe current housing loans given by Government.  So\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister whether  he  is\r\n\r\nprepared to consider granting housing loans to the\r\n\r\nteachers of Government-aided schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not think that\r\n\r\nconsideration  can be given at  this  stage.  That\r\n\r\nanswer  should be sufficient. Whether or not  they\r\n\r\ndeserve to be given a scheme is not an appropriate\r\n\r\nmatter  to discuss under this particular  subhead.\r\n\r\nWhether  aided school staff should  be  given  the\r\n\r\nsame  facilities  as  all Government  officers  is\r\n\r\nsomething which should be taken up, first of  all,\r\n\r\nat  Ministry level, before he comes to  this  more\r\n\r\nspecific question. As you can see, Sir, the  title\r\n\r\nto   this  item  is  \"Housing  Scheme  for  Public\r\n\r\nOfficers\".  Therefore, whether  the  teachers  are\r\n\r\ndeserving  cases and ought to get  them,  that  is\r\n\r\nquite  another matter. I am saying  that  at  this\r\n\r\nstage  it is not possible. In any case, the scheme\r\n\r\nis  a  pilot scheme. The number of public officers\r\n\r\nwho  are eligible are so numerous that we have not\r\n\r\nbeen able to satisfy them, so that even if we  did\r\n\r\nadmit  teachers eventually, they will  have  lower\r\n\r\npriority on the basis of first come first served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am still\r\n\r\nnot satisfied with the Minister's reply, but owing\r\n\r\nto  the  time  limit, I beg leave to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to clarify one\r\n\r\npoint   regarding  the  loan  to   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nTeachers' Union. I would like to know what is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this loan to the Singapore  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnion,  and what is the rate of interest  charged.\r\n\r\nIf other teachers' associations would like to have\r\n\r\na  loan  from the Ministry will their  request  be\r\n\r\nconsidered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the total loan granted in\r\n\r\nDecember, 1972, to the Teachers' Union  is  a  sum\r\n\r\nlarger than the amount which has been provided. It\r\n\r\nis,  in  fact,  $100,000, for  which  $60,000  was\r\n\r\nprovided by virement this year and is expected  to\r\n\r\nbe  drawn  before the end of the current financial\r\n\r\nyear. The loan is to help finance part of the cost\r\n\r\nof  the  Teachers' Centre project in the  Teachers\r\n\r\nHousing  Estate at 12 1/2 m.s. Yio Chu  Kang  Road.\r\n\r\nThe  Centre, estimated to cost $1.5 million,  will\r\n\r\ninclude    library,   educational   and   research\r\n\r\nfacilities, and is expected to serve  as  a  focal\r\n\r\npoint  for  teachers in professional,  social  and\r\n\r\nrecreational activities. Members will surely agree\r\n\r\nthat  this is a project which is worthy of support\r\n\r\nnot only by teachers but also by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the privilege of a similar nature\r\n\r\nwill be extended to others, each case will have to\r\n\r\nbe  examined on its merits.
