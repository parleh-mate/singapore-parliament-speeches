This  was  not done  as  this  particular\r\n\r\nsubsection  is  meant to apply only  to  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries  that afford reciprocal rights to  citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for the Government of India came to\r\n\r\nsee me before I left for New Delhi and brought up the question of gazetting India as a Commonwealth country\r\n\r\nso  that  Indian  citizens in  Singapore  could  make\r\n\r\napplication under subsection (1) of section 8 of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  I  pointed out to him  that  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  do  so unless the Government  of  India\r\n\r\nafforded  reciprocal rights to citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\nI also pointed out to him that citizens of India were\r\n\r\nnot  deprived of their rights to register as citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, and that they could become citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore  by either registering as citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom and Colonies and then register  under\r\n\r\nsubsection  (1)  of  section 8 of the  Ordinance,  or\r\n\r\nregister under section 9 of the Ordinance.

Constitutional\r\n\r\nproblems have been settled in an atmosphere of reason\r\n\r\nand  friendliness which augurs well for  the  future.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore Citizenship Ordinance has become  law.\r\n\r\nThe new Local Government Ordinance has been approved.\r\n\r\nAn  excellent understanding has been established with\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the Federation of Malaya.  In  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  labour  relations,  there  has  been  less\r\n\r\ntension  between  employer and employee,  and  labour\r\n\r\ndisputes, strikes and consequential losses of pay and\r\n\r\nworking time have been far less frequent than in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  past. With the help and co-operation  of  all\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties,  great  progress  has  been  made\r\n\r\ntowards  settling  the vexed question  of  vernacular\r\n\r\neducation,  although we must face, in consequence,  a\r\n\r\nmuch  heavier  bill  to carry  the  new  policy  into\r\n\r\neffect.  A  cautious  and common  sense  approach  to\r\n\r\nproblems  in the economic field has commended  itself\r\n\r\nto  observers  all over the world. Most important  of\r\n\r\nall,  however, there has been a return of  confidence\r\n\r\nin  the future of Singapore. It would be idle to deny\r\n\r\nthat  the events of 1955 and early 1956 did  much  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  the  feeling  of  stability,  security   and\r\n\r\nconfidence  which  is  vital  for  the  existence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a centre of world trade, services  and\r\n\r\ncommunications. It is important that this  growth  of\r\n\r\nconfidence should be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the least important event of the year has been\r\n\r\nthe achievement of independence by the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. This has caused as much pleasure in Singapore\r\n\r\nas  it  has happiness in the Federation. It  has,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  given  rise  to  certain  problems.  It  has\r\n\r\nnecessitated  an examination of existing  Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\narrangements  in  the  economic  and  monetary  field\r\n\r\nagainst the background of the Federation's new status\r\n\r\nas  an  independent state. Existing arrangements  for\r\n\r\nthe  issue and control of currency, banking,  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  control,  import  and  export  control  and\r\n\r\ncertain aspects of fiscal policy, all of which  raise\r\n\r\nmost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  issues, have had to come under review.  It\r\n\r\nwould be inappropriate to deal with these matters  in\r\n\r\ndetail at this particular time. They are, as it were,\r\n\r\nsub judice and must be studied against the background\r\n\r\nof  the  very natural wishes of a sovereign state  to\r\n\r\nexercise  sovereign powers. At the same  time,  while\r\n\r\nunderlining  this  Government's sympathy  with  these\r\n\r\nfeelings and aspirations, I hope that it will not  be\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  if  I  express some  general  thoughts\r\n\r\nabout  these  matters. For close on a hundred  years,\r\n\r\nMalaya and Singapore have developed and grown  up  in\r\n\r\npartnership. As the production of rubber and tin  has\r\n\r\nexpanded in Malaya, so have the services supplied  by\r\n\r\nSingapore   in  the  field  of  marketing,   banking,\r\n\r\ninsurance, transport and communications increased. As\r\n\r\nthe  demands of the growing population of Malaya  for\r\n\r\nconsumer  goods have multiplied, so has the  capacity\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to meet them quickly and competitively\r\n\r\ngrown.  During  this  period,  the  ramifications  of\r\n\r\ncommerce  and  industry have spread  over  the  whole\r\n\r\npeninsula     regardless    of    geographical     or\r\n\r\nconstitutional boundaries. The economies of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories   have   become   complementary.   Common\r\n\r\npolicies  have  been followed not because  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  dictated but merely because reason,  experience\r\n\r\nand  commonsense  has indicated the desirability  and\r\n\r\nwisdom  of  a common approach in the economic  field.\r\n\r\nThe  results  of  this partnership  have  been  quite\r\n\r\noutstanding.   By  their  joint  efforts,   the   two\r\n\r\ncountries  have achieved a well-being and  prosperity\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  envy  of all their  neighbours.  With\r\n\r\nregard  to the future, reason, experience and  common\r\n\r\nsense   suggest  that  this  partnership  should   be\r\n\r\ncontinued  if  the  two countries  are  to  gain  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  advantage  in  the economic  field,  and  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and prosper in the manner in which they  have\r\n\r\ndone  in the past. When I speak of partnership  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  talking  in constitutional terms but  merely  in\r\n\r\nterms  of full economic co-operation. I mean  a  free\r\n\r\nassociation of two partners whereby their  individual\r\n\r\nresources  and  skills  are used  jointly  for  their\r\n\r\nmutual advantage in matters of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmutual  concern. There need be nothing hard  or  fast\r\n\r\nabout  such an association. It need subsist  just  as\r\n\r\nlong as mutual self-interest demands. It calls for no\r\n\r\nmore  machinery  for consultation  and  agreement  on\r\n\r\nmatters of policy than exists at the present time. It\r\n\r\nwould be hoped that it would continue for as long  as\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories remain apart because  it  seems\r\n\r\ncertain  that  any  relationship  short  of  such   a\r\n\r\npartnership  could  only be to the  disadvantage  and\r\n\r\ndetriment of both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as trade generally is concerned, 1957 has\r\n\r\nperhaps  not  been  quite as  good  a  year  as  1956\r\n\r\nalthough it has not been a bad year by any means. The\r\n\r\nvalue  of total trade is likely to be maintained  but\r\n\r\nimports  tend  to exceed exports and it  is  probable\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  be  a fairly  substantial  adverse\r\n\r\nbalance  of trade at the end of the year. The gradual\r\n\r\ndecline  in  the price of rubber has already  had  an\r\n\r\neffect  on  the  economy and traders are  finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to maintain their turnover. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  there  are  one  or two encouraging  features.\r\n\r\nDespite  a  deterioration in conditions in Indonesia,\r\n\r\nthere has been some slight improvement in trade  with\r\n\r\nthat country. Exports to Indonesia in particular  are\r\n\r\nshowing an increase over previous years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one would expect against this background of\r\n\r\nreturning  confidence  and  prosperity,  revenue  has\r\n\r\nremained  reasonably buoyant. Details of the  revised\r\n\r\nestimate of collections are given in the pages of the\r\n\r\nDraft  Estimates  which are devoted  to  revenue  and\r\n\r\ncomments are made in the Memorandum which accompanies\r\n\r\nthe  Draft Estimates. I will not go into great detail\r\n\r\nat  this  time but merely endeavour to draw attention\r\n\r\nto main points.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original estimate of revenue was $235.9 million\r\n\r\nand  it  seems  likely that $235.7  million  will  be\r\n\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised estimate of collections under Class I is\r\n\r\n$186.9 million compared with the original estimate of\r\n\r\n$193 million. The main shortfall is under Income Tax.\r\n\r\n$68.5  million was estimated but only $65 million  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be collected. This shortfall  reflects  a\r\n\r\nslight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfalling  off  in the profits of smaller companies  in\r\n\r\n1956  as  compared  with 1955. It also  reflects  the\r\n\r\neffects of Malayanisation in the Department of Income\r\n\r\nTax. A number of experienced income tax officers have\r\n\r\nleft  and  their places have not yet been  filled  by\r\n\r\nofficers  with  the same degree of experience.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  there has been a slight slowing  up  in  the\r\n\r\nwork  of the department, and assessments have  fallen\r\n\r\nslightly  into  arrears. This decrease in  efficiency\r\n\r\nwill  only  be  temporary. Arrears of assessment  and\r\n\r\ncollection will be caught up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco also shows a shortfall of about $5 million,\r\n\r\nthe revised estimate being $39 million as against the\r\n\r\noriginal estimate of $44 million. There are a  number\r\n\r\nof  reasons  for this shortfall. A certain  temporary\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  consumption was to  be  expected  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  price increases resulting  from  the\r\n\r\nincrease in duty imposed last November. This has been\r\n\r\naggravated by recent medical reports on the  possible\r\n\r\neffects  of  excessive cigarette smoking.  There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  an  increase in smuggling as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  duty.  Exports to Rhio  have  increased\r\n\r\nsince  November last year and considerable quantities\r\n\r\nof  cigarettes are brought back into Singapore  under\r\n\r\ncover of darkness, despite the efforts of the Customs\r\n\r\nDepartment   to   prevent  the  traffick.   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection,  I  should like to pay a tribute  to  the\r\n\r\nofficers of the Preventive Branch of the Customs who,\r\n\r\nnight  in  night  out and often in  circumstances  of\r\n\r\ngreat  discomfort,  patrol  the  sea  approaches   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  wage  a  constant  war  against   the\r\n\r\nsmugglers.   Another  reason  for  the  decrease   in\r\n\r\ncollections is the fact that, under the protection of\r\n\r\na wide differential in duty, local manufacturers have\r\n\r\nmade  certain inroads into the monopoly  of  imported\r\n\r\ncigarettes. It is unfortunate that this has not  been\r\n\r\noffset by any marked increase in local employment. It\r\n\r\nis thought, however, that these limiting factors will\r\n\r\nbe  temporary  phenomena and  that  consumption  will\r\n\r\nreturn  in  due  course to its  previous  level.  The\r\n\r\ncollections of duty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  liquors  and  petrol are  likely  to  exceed  the\r\n\r\noriginal estimate by fairly substantial amounts.  The\r\n\r\ncollections of entertainment duty continue  to  mount\r\n\r\nand  the yield on other items of taxation imposed  in\r\n\r\n1956  appears  likely  to equal  if  not  exceed  the\r\n\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collections under the other Classes of Revenue\r\n\r\nseem  likely  to  exceed the estimate.  Gains  should\r\n\r\ncounterbalance  the  shortfalls  on  Income  Tax  and\r\n\r\nTobacco.  As I said earlier, the revised estimate  is\r\n\r\nonly  a little short of the original estimate and  it\r\n\r\nmay in the end exceed it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to expenditure, it will be remembered\r\n\r\nthat  the original estimate was $254 million, and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  seen  from pages 15 and  16  of  the  Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates  that it is likely that actual  expenditure\r\n\r\nin  1957 will amount to about $242 million. It should\r\n\r\nbe  noted, however, that this total includes a sum of\r\n\r\n$9  million  in  respect  of compensation  under  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Scheme. If this sum is excluded - it is,\r\n\r\nI think, a fair charge on surplus funds since it will\r\n\r\nbe  recouped  by  savings  on  expatriation  pay  and\r\n\r\npassages over a period of years - what might be  called\r\n\r\n\"normal\"  expenditure  will  amount  to  about   $233\r\n\r\nmillion and there will probably be a small surplus of\r\n\r\nrevenue over actual normal expenditure at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As will be seen from pages 15 and 16 in the Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates, the revised estimate of expenditure in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  very  large number of Departments  falls\r\n\r\nbelow   the  original  estimate,  usually  by   small\r\n\r\namounts. In the case of several, however, the  under-expenditure is likely to be considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main under-expenditure again appears under\r\n\r\nEducation. Here actual expenditure is likely to  fall\r\n\r\nshort of the estimate by about $8 million. About half\r\n\r\nof  this  will be in respect of personal  emoluments.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  on  Defence  Services  and  Medical  and\r\n\r\nHealth  Services is likely to fall below the original\r\n\r\nestimate  by  about $3 million in  each  case,  again\r\n\r\nmainly due to difficulties in filling vacant posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I propose to comment on the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  1957  and  1958  after  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates  have been dealt with. All I  will  say  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage  is  that expenditure  has  again  fallen\r\n\r\nconsiderably short of the estimate, and that there is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  a  substantial balance  left  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the financial position at the end of\r\n\r\n1957, attention is invited to the Statement of Assets\r\n\r\nand Liabilities which appears on pages 6 and 7 of the\r\n\r\nDraft  Estimates. It will, of course, be  appreciated\r\n\r\nthat  this  Statement was drawn up in  September  and\r\n\r\nthat there will be numerous amendments in matters  of\r\n\r\ndetail by the time the final accounts are made up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets are estimated at $153 million, Liabilities at\r\n\r\n$81  million, and the General Revenue Balance at  $72\r\n\r\nmillion.  Amendments will of course have to  be  made\r\n\r\nwhen  the final accounts are available, and allowance\r\n\r\nwill have to be made for depreciation in the value of\r\n\r\ninvestments, but the final result should not be  very\r\n\r\nmuch different from the estimate which is now given.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, therefore, the position of the\r\n\r\nColony  is  sound. The public debt is  small  and  is\r\n\r\nbeing  serviced as required by Law. We have a general\r\n\r\nrevenue balance in liquid form which is equivalent to\r\n\r\n3\u00bd  months'  revenue. In point of fact, however,  the\r\n\r\nposition  is even sounder than at first appears.  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  should  be added to the liquid  reserves  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the payment which will be  made  by  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  and New Zealand Governments in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  loss of Christmas Island revenue.  Account\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  taken  of  $17  million  worth   of\r\n\r\nSingapore Telephone Board stock which will be  issued\r\n\r\nin  due  course  in respect of the  purchase  of  the\r\n\r\nOriental  Telephone  and  Electric  Company.   Having\r\n\r\nregard to the steady progress which is being made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board, it is likely  that  a\r\n\r\nready  sale would be found for this stock if it  were\r\n\r\nplaced  on the market. In short, the Colony  is  very\r\n\r\ncomfortably off and many larger territories with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  greater natural resources would be happy to  be\r\n\r\nin the same fortunate position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to 1958, it is difficult to make any\r\n\r\nforecast  of what conditions may be like  during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  the  year. Too many unknown  factors  are\r\n\r\ninvolved.   It  is  also  undesirable   to   be   too\r\n\r\ncategorical  in  such  circumstances.   But   it   is\r\n\r\nundeniable  that  there  is at  the  present  time  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of pessimism about the future.  World\r\n\r\nconditions are unsettled and are likely to remain so.\r\n\r\nIt  is  feared that there may be a recession of trade\r\n\r\nin Europe and the United States, which may affect the\r\n\r\nprice  of  rubber  and consequently  the  economy  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Conditions in our main entrepot markets  are\r\n\r\ndisturbed  and trade may be affected.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  experts whom I have been able to  consult\r\n\r\nare  not  quite so despondent. In their opinion,  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of a trade recession has  tended  to  be\r\n\r\nexaggerated in the light of recent events. The  long-term  prospect for rubber is sound. The price  should\r\n\r\nremain  not very far off the 80 cents mark throughout\r\n\r\n1958.  Conditions in some of our traditional entrepot\r\n\r\nmarkets  are  certainly disturbed but, despite  this,\r\n\r\ntrade  has shown a certain buoyancy in recent  months\r\n\r\nand the indications are that this trend is likely  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.  All in all, they feel that conditions  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  as  bad as the pessimists fear.  Trade  will\r\n\r\nalmost certainly be less favourable than it has  been\r\n\r\nin  recent  years, and profits will be reduced  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent,  but  there is nothing  to  indicate\r\n\r\nanything  more than a slight recession of trade  such\r\n\r\nas  Singapore  has often taken in its stride  in  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, collections of revenue\r\n\r\nunder Class I have been estimated at $189 million, or\r\n\r\n$3  million  in  excess of the revised  estimate  for\r\n\r\n1957.  Allowance has been made for a slight  increase\r\n\r\nin  entertainment duty. Over 90 per cent of this duty\r\n\r\nis  derived  from cinema tickets. New picture  houses\r\n\r\nhave been or are being built, the cinema-going public\r\n\r\ncontinues to increase, and it is estimated that  this\r\n\r\nduty will yield $6,750,000 in 1958. Income Tax has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  estimated  at the same level as collections  in\r\n\r\n1957.  It  is  doubtful if company profits  generally\r\n\r\nwill  maintain the same levels as in 1956  and  1957.\r\n\r\nAgain, as  I said earlier, the department is  having\r\n\r\nstaffing troubles. On the other hand, tax assessed in\r\n\r\n1957 but not collected in that year will be collected\r\n\r\nin 1958. In the circumstances, it is hoped that about\r\n\r\n$65  million  will be collected in 1958.  As  far  as\r\n\r\nliquor   duty  is  concerned,  the  increased  demand\r\n\r\nresulting  from  growth of population  will  probably\r\n\r\nmore  than counterbalance any decrease in consumption\r\n\r\ndue  to  falling purchasing power, and the figure  of\r\n\r\n$28 million entered for 1958 is slightly in excess of\r\n\r\nthe revised estimate for 1957. The number of cars  on\r\n\r\nthe  road,  the  number of new cars  registered  each\r\n\r\nyear,  and the amount of petrol consumed continue  to\r\n\r\nincrease and it seems reasonably safe to assume  that\r\n\r\n$27  million would be collected from petrol  duty  on\r\n\r\nthe  present  basis of taxation in 1958.  As  far  as\r\n\r\ntobacco  is  concerned, 541 million has been  allowed\r\n\r\nfor  1958. Consumption is bound to recover  from  the\r\n\r\nsetbacks  of 1957. The smoking population is  growing\r\n\r\nall the time, a quota on exports to Rhio has recently\r\n\r\nbeen   imposed  and  the  campaign  of  the   Customs\r\n\r\nDepartment  against  smuggling  is  gaining  momentum\r\n\r\nmonth  by  month. It will be noticed that  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  marked  drop  in  revenue  from  pawnbroking\r\n\r\nlicences, due to the change in policy with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of licences. As hon. Members  are  aware.\r\n\r\nlicences now bear a fixed fee. They are no longer the\r\n\r\nsubject of tender, as they have been in the past,  it\r\n\r\nhaving  been  decided that the system of  tender  was\r\n\r\nanachronistic and open to objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate for Class III shows an increase of\r\n\r\nabout  $1.4  million  due to  the  increased  returns\r\n\r\nexpected  from Postal and Telecommunications Services\r\n\r\nwhich increase steadily year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class IV is increased by $2.4 million due partly to\r\n\r\ninterest  on  loans  and  partly  to  the  fact  that\r\n\r\ninterest  on  funds in the hands of the Custodian  of\r\n\r\nProperty will be credited to revenue under the  Draft\r\n\r\nEnemy  Property  Bill which, it  is  hoped,  will  be\r\n\r\nenacted during the next session of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimate or Revenue for 1958, on the\r\n\r\npresent basis of taxation, is $242 million, or $7\r\n\r\nmillion more than the revised estimate for 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates of expenditure for 1958 total $277\r\n\r\nmillion compared with $254 million in 1957. This is a\r\n\r\nsubstantial increase but I can assure you, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe estimates have been prepared with the utmost care\r\n\r\nand  that  no  provision has been made which  is  not\r\n\r\nessential for the maintenance of existing services or\r\n\r\nfor  the expansion of the social and defence services\r\n\r\nto which great importance is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this will be clear from an examination of\r\n\r\nthe  estimates.  It will be seen that a  considerable\r\n\r\nnumber of departments are provided with less or  very\r\n\r\nlittle  more in 1958 than was provided in  1957.  The\r\n\r\nmain  increases  appear  under  Medical  and  Health,\r\n\r\nDefence  Services,  Pensions  and  Education,   which\r\n\r\nbetween  them,  account for $16 million  of  the  $23\r\n\r\nmillion increase on the Estimates for 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional sum of $2.6 million is required for\r\n\r\nMedical  and Health, of which $2.2 million represents\r\n\r\nan   increase   in  personal  emoluments.   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection,  attention is invited to the schedule  of\r\n\r\nnew  appointments which appears as an appendix to the\r\n\r\nMemorandum  which  accompanied the  Draft  Estimates.\r\n\r\nFrom  this, it will be seen that 314 new appointments\r\n\r\nare  provided  for the expansion of the  Medical  and\r\n\r\nHealth Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Service estimates show an increase of\r\n\r\n$2.8  million. Of this sum, $700,000 is required  for\r\n\r\nthe  Royal  Malayan Navy, $800,000 for the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMilitary  Forces  and $1.3 million for  the  Infantry\r\n\r\nBattalion which will get into full swing in 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions require an additional $3.9 million. Of this\r\n\r\nincrease,  $917,000 is provided for the Supplementary\r\n\r\nAllowances  on existing pensions which were  approved\r\n\r\nby  the  Assembly  this year. Of  the  remainder,  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  is required for commutation of pensions  and\r\n\r\nordinary  pensions arising in the  main  out  of  the\r\n\r\nretirement   of   pensionable  officers   under   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increase is, however, under Education\r\n\r\nwhere  an  additional $6.7 million is  required.  The\r\n\r\nestimates  for  1958, by comparison  with  those  for\r\n\r\n1955,  show  very  clearly  the  effect  of  the  new\r\n\r\nEducation  Plan. The salaries of Headquarters  staff,\r\n\r\nand  teachers  and  servants  in  Government  English\r\n\r\nschools, demand $30.9 million as compared with  $18.9\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1955. Recurrent expenditure has risen  to\r\n\r\n$30 million compared with $13 million in 1955. Grants\r\n\r\nin aid total $23 million, of which $14.4 million goes\r\n\r\nto Chinese schools. This compares with a total of $10\r\n\r\nmillion, including $4 million for Chinese schools, in\r\n\r\n1955. $1 million is provided for the running expenses\r\n\r\nof  the Polytechnic, $360,000 is provided for Evening\r\n\r\nClasses,  $300,000  for the provision  of  free  text\r\n\r\nbooks,  $388,000  for  aided  school  provident  fund\r\n\r\nschemes,  $934,000  for the teaching  of  English  in\r\n\r\nMalay  Schools and so on. Special expenditure  totals\r\n\r\n$3.9 million of which $3.2 million is required as the\r\n\r\nGovernment contribution towards the running  expenses\r\n\r\nof the University.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, there is nothing new or novel in the\r\n\r\nestimates of expenditure. The truth of the matter  is\r\n\r\nthat  the framing of the ordinary estimates does  not\r\n\r\npresent much opportunity for dramatic changes in  the\r\n\r\nemphasis or incidence of expenditure. The services of\r\n\r\nGovernment  expand  as the need for  them  increases.\r\n\r\nExpansion is only approved after long drawn  out  and\r\n\r\nsometimes bitter arguments with the Treasury and even\r\n\r\nthen is only in accordance with plans which have been\r\n\r\npresented  to and approved by the Assembly and  which\r\n\r\nare  generally accepted as necessary by the taxpayers\r\n\r\nof Singapore. Short of a major trade recession with a\r\n\r\nserious contraction of Government revenue and  demand\r\n\r\nfor  Government  services, it  is  difficult  if  not\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  limit  or  restrict  expenditure   on\r\n\r\nservices  which  arc already in existence.  They  are\r\n\r\nalready  operating on the minimum standard consistent\r\n\r\nwith  efficiency.  Government  operates  within  very\r\n\r\nnarrow  financial limits and funds are not  available\r\n\r\nfor  any  dramatic departures from the  well  trodden\r\n\r\npath of approved policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that the estimate of\r\n\r\nrevenue  is $242 million, the estimate of expenditure\r\n\r\nis  $277  million, and we are faced with an estimated\r\n\r\ndeficit of $35 million.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what would this deficit be in the\r\n\r\nevent if no steps were taken to eliminate it. We know\r\n\r\nthat,  in the past, expenditure has invariably fallen\r\n\r\nshort  of  the  estimate and estimated deficits  have\r\n\r\nturned   into   substantial  surpluses.   Development\r\n\r\nprogrammes have not been implemented as fast  as  was\r\n\r\nexpected,   recruits  have  not   come   forward   in\r\n\r\nsufficient  numbers to fill vacant posts,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen   delay  in  placing  orders  and  in  obtaining\r\n\r\ndelivery of costly items of special expenditure,  and\r\n\r\nso  on  and so forth. The question is to what  extent\r\n\r\nwill expenditure fall below the estimate in 1958?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no formula which indicates what actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will  be. We make our  estimate  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of past experience and results and anticipated\r\n\r\nfuture  requirements and capacity. We know that,  for\r\n\r\nthe  past two years, actual recurrent expenditure has\r\n\r\ntended  to  increase  on the  average  by  about  $18\r\n\r\nmillion   a  year.  In  this  connection,  I   invite\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  tables which were  given  in  the\r\n\r\nMemorandum which accompanied the Draft Estimates.  It\r\n\r\nseems  likely  that  this rate of  increase  will  be\r\n\r\nmaintained in 1958. If that should prove  to  be  the\r\n\r\ncase,  actual expenditure, excluding any compensation\r\n\r\nin  respect  of Malayanisation which may have  to  be\r\n\r\nbrought  to account, should be of the order  of  $250\r\n\r\nmillion.  In  the  circumstances, assuming  that  the\r\n\r\nestimate of revenue is achieved, it is possible  that\r\n\r\nthe  actual  deficit  would be of  the  order  of  $8\r\n\r\nmillion,  and it is this sum which we must  endeavour\r\n\r\nto cover by means of additional taxation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, it is proposed to increase the duty on\r\n\r\npetrol  and  to make slight increases in the  special\r\n\r\ntax  on  heavy oil engine vehicles and in  the  stamp\r\n\r\nduty  on  conveyances  of immovable  property.  These\r\n\r\nincreases  should yield about $8 million  in  a  full\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to petrol, an order under Section 11 of\r\n\r\nthe  Customs Ordinance has been gazetted this morning\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraises  the  duty from 80 cents to $1 a gallon.  This\r\n\r\nrate  of  $1  a  gallon  has been  in  force  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  since  November  of  last  year  and  its\r\n\r\nimposition  is  unlikely to  cause  any  hardship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It has caused none in the Federation.  The\r\n\r\nnew  rate  of  duty will result in cars which  do  20\r\n\r\nmiles  to  the gallon costing 1 cent a mile  more  to\r\n\r\nrun.  Those which do 30 miles to the gallon will cost\r\n\r\n2/3rd  of  a cent a mile more to run, those doing  40\r\n\r\nmiles  to the gallon, \u00bd a cent more, and so on.  If\r\n\r\n1,000 miles a month, or 30 miles a day, is taken as a\r\n\r\nfair  average mileage for private cars in  Singapore,\r\n\r\ncars  doing 20 miles per gallon will cost $10 a month\r\n\r\nmore  to run, cars doing 30 miles to the gallon $6.60\r\n\r\na  month more, and those doing 40 miles to the gallon\r\n\r\n$5  a month more. These additional sums can be of  no\r\n\r\nconsequence to people who can afford to run cars  for\r\n\r\npleasure  or who have to run them in connection  with\r\n\r\ntheir work. Nor will the increase in duty be of  much\r\n\r\nconsequence to hauliers. A round trip to Penang  will\r\n\r\ncost about $10 more. I do not think that the increase\r\n\r\nin  duty will affect consumption. The number  of  new\r\n\r\ncars,  and the total number of cars registered,  tend\r\n\r\nto  increase each year and the consumption of  petrol\r\n\r\nincreases  accordingly. I doubt if the increase  will\r\n\r\ntend  to  make people use their cars less  than  they\r\n\r\nhave  done  in  the  past. It is  expected  that  the\r\n\r\nincrease in duty will yield between $6 and $7 million\r\n\r\nin a full year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the tax on heavy\r\n\r\noil  engine vehicles. As hon. Members are aware, this\r\n\r\ntax was originally imposed to compensate for the loss\r\n\r\nof  petrol  duty  occasioned by the  introduction  of\r\n\r\ndiesel  engine vehicles into Singapore.  The  present\r\n\r\nrates  of  tax are shown in the schedule attached  to\r\n\r\nGazette  Notification No. 5 202 of 22nd  July,  1955.\r\n\r\nThe  rates  have not been changed since the  duty  on\r\n\r\npetrol  was raised to 68 cents a gallon. It will  now\r\n\r\nbe   $1  a  gallon.  This  increase  would  merit   a\r\n\r\nproportional increase in the heavy oil engine vehicle\r\n\r\ntax  of  about 50 per cent. However, it is considered\r\n\r\nthat an increase of this order at this juncture is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundesirable. As a first step, therefore, it has  been\r\n\r\ndecided  to raise the present rates by 25  per  cent.\r\n\r\nThe  new rates are given in the motion which will  be\r\n\r\npresented  in the near future. They will be effective\r\n\r\nfrom  the  1st of January. 1958. It is not considered\r\n\r\nthat  this  increase should occasion any hardship  to\r\n\r\nbus companies or hauliers or necessitate any increase\r\n\r\nin  fares.  It  will  be noted, when  the  motion  is\r\n\r\npublished,  that  the fee on diesel  taxis  has  been\r\n\r\nraised   considerably.  The  new  fee  places   these\r\n\r\nvehicles  on all fours with petrol-driven taxis.  The\r\n\r\nyield  from  this  increased tariff is  estimated  at\r\n\r\n$375,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to increase the stamp duty\r\n\r\non   conveyances   of  immovable   property   to   an\r\n\r\n\"advalorem\"  rate of 2 per cent on the value  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty transferred. This rate is the same  as  that\r\n\r\ncharged  in  Hong Kong. It is expected that  the  new\r\n\r\nrate will yield an additional $700,000 in 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated yield from these items of new\r\n\r\ntaxation is therefore approximately $8 million and  I\r\n\r\nhope that this additional revenue will go a long  way\r\n\r\ntowards  balancing actual revenue and expenditure  in\r\n\r\n1958. However, if it is found later in the year  that\r\n\r\nthese   measures   are  going  to  be   insufficient,\r\n\r\nadditional measures will have to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the Development Estimates, it is\r\n\r\ndesirable at this time to give some idea of what  has\r\n\r\nbeen done in this connection since the war. There  is\r\n\r\nso  much  pre-occupation with  the  present  and  the\r\n\r\nfuture that there is perhaps a tendency to forget  or\r\n\r\noverlook what has been done in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all standards, the achievement has been\r\n\r\nmonumental. Since the war, over 15,500 housing  units\r\n\r\nand  600  shops  have been built at  a  cost  of  $95\r\n\r\nmillion.  $28  million has been spent on  93  primary\r\n\r\nschools  and 11 secondary schools, quarters,  playing\r\n\r\nfields, equipment and other educational services. $20\r\n\r\nmillion  has  been  spent on  expanding  the  Medical\r\n\r\nServices. The number of beds in the General  Hospital\r\n\r\nhas been increased by 100 per cent, in Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital by 50 per cent and in Tan Tock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeng Hospital by over 100 per cent. Accommodation  in\r\n\r\nthe Trafalgar Home and in the Woodbridge Hospital has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased by 300 per cent. $36 million  has  so\r\n\r\nfar  been spent on making the finest airport  in  the\r\n\r\nFar  East.  $15  million  has  been  spent  on  Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  Land  purchases  for  development  have\r\n\r\ntotalled  close on $50 million. $10 million has  been\r\n\r\nspent  on  capital work for Defence  Services.  These\r\n\r\nitems alone total over $250 million. In addition, $17\r\n\r\nmillion   has  been  paid  in  connection  with   the\r\n\r\nacquisition  of the Oriental Telephone  and  Electric\r\n\r\nCompany,  $4  million  lent to the  City  Council  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the Kallang Bridge Road, $30  million\r\n\r\nlent to the Federation of Malaya, $10 million lent to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board, and considerable sums\r\n\r\nspent on the construction of buildings for the police\r\n\r\nand customs, roads, bridges, quarters and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from Government expenditure on development,\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council has since the war spent over  $270\r\n\r\nmillion on the development of the public utilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, development work of this order represents\r\n\r\na  monumental  achievement. This small island,  which\r\n\r\ndepends  for its prosperity on trade, has managed  to\r\n\r\nfind  funds for development to the tune of well  over\r\n\r\n$600  million  over  a  period of  10  years  without\r\n\r\nextending  itself  unduly. It is  an  achievement  of\r\n\r\nwhich we can justly be proud and it must be the  envy\r\n\r\nof many larger territories outside Malaya.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to development expenditure in 1957, it\r\n\r\nwill  be  recalled  that the estimates  presented  in\r\n\r\nNovember   1956  envisaged  expenditure  on   general\r\n\r\ndevelopment   (including  Colonial  Development   and\r\n\r\nWelfare  Fund projects) amounting to $66 million  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  by the Singapore Improvement  Trust  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone  Board of  $15  million  and  $5\r\n\r\nmillion   respectively.  Under  general  development,\r\n\r\nprovision  of $17 million was made for  work  of  one\r\n\r\nkind  and  another for the Education Department,  $10\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the Medical and Health Department,  $17\r\n\r\nmillion for purchase of land, resettlement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsquatters  and  rural  development,  $3  million  for\r\n\r\nDefence  Services and $3 million for further work  on\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Airport. It was  estimated  that  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund would be completely exhausted by the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  year  but, knowing how far  performance\r\n\r\nfalls  short of expectation in the field  of  capital\r\n\r\nworks, we were fairly confident that there would,  in\r\n\r\nthe end, be a balance in the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has proved to be the case. On the basis of\r\n\r\nfigures  available up to September, it is clear  that\r\n\r\nthere will again be substantial under-expenditure  on\r\n\r\ngeneral  development. As in the past, difficulty  has\r\n\r\nbeen experienced over the acquisition, clearance  and\r\n\r\npreparation  of  sites. Lack  of  \"capacity\"  in  the\r\n\r\narchitectural branch of the P.W.D. has also caused  a\r\n\r\nplanning bottle-neck. The only expenditure which  has\r\n\r\nexceeded the estimate is that on public housing. Here\r\n\r\nit seems likely that the Trust, with a clear field at\r\n\r\nKallang and St. Michaels Road, will spend $23 million\r\n\r\nagainst  the estimated $15 million. And,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Telephone  Board  has  spent  the  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  provided  in the Estimates.  Altogether,  it\r\n\r\nappears likely that, instead of the estimated deficit\r\n\r\nof  $3  million,  the Development Fund  will  show  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  at the end of the year of the order  of  $40\r\n\r\nmillion  including interest on investments  amounting\r\n\r\nto  $7.6  million not brought to account  until  this\r\n\r\nyear.  I  mention  the round figure  of  $40  million\r\n\r\nbecause adjustment will have to be made in respect of\r\n\r\nrevaluation of investments and in respect of interest\r\n\r\npayments. But it does mean that we will start off the\r\n\r\nnew  year very substantially better off than we hoped\r\n\r\nto  be  and  that the question of raising  funds  for\r\n\r\ncapital  development in Singapore  in  1958  will  be\r\n\r\neased correspondingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates for 1958 are shown on\r\n\r\npages 395 to 439 of the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Fund is given on page 395. It will\r\n\r\nbe  seen  that receipts are estimated at $64 million,\r\n\r\nexpenditure at $94 million and the deficit  at  about\r\n\r\n$30 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the items on the receipts side of the\r\n\r\naccount,  the  item \"Repayment of Loans\"  allows  for\r\n\r\nrepayment  of  principal of long-term  loans  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust which will  be  made  in\r\n\r\n1958. It will be recalled that I said in 1956 that it\r\n\r\nhad been decided that such repayments, which will  be\r\n\r\nspread  over  60  years  in  most  cases,  should  be\r\n\r\ncredited  to  the  Development  Fund  so  as  to   be\r\n\r\navailable for further development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also be noted that a contribution of $20\r\n\r\nmillion  is  again made from revenue for development.\r\n\r\nIt  is,  in  my  opinion,  of vital  importance  that\r\n\r\nsubstantial   contributions  of  this   kind   should\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  be  made  for  expenditure  on   \"non-productive\"  items  of capital  development  such  as\r\n\r\nschools,  hospitals, etc. - in fact, much of  the  work\r\n\r\ndone under General Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen from an examination of the Estimates\r\n\r\nthat  they  follow the same pattern  as  in  previous\r\n\r\nyears.  Indeed that is inevitable when Government  is\r\n\r\nalready  committed to approved long-term  development\r\n\r\nplans.  Briefly,  of the sum of $32 million  provided\r\n\r\nfor  general  public  works,  $10  million  goes   to\r\n\r\nEducation,  $8.8 million to Medical  and  Health,  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  to  Civil Aviation, $4 million  for  special\r\n\r\nP.W.D. schemes which are outlined under Head 60,  and\r\n\r\n$1 million for police building and quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sum of $61 million provided for special\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure, $26.5 million  is  provided\r\n\r\nfor  further work by the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\non  programmes  6, 7 and 8 and a further  sum  of  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  is  provided for Singapore  Telephone  Board\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Provision is made for the  loan  of  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  (out  of  a total of $2  mil  lion)  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  Officers Co-operative  Housing\r\n\r\nSociety in accordance with the policy that Government\r\n\r\nwill  not provide quarters for its officers but will,\r\n\r\nwithin  the limits of its capacity, provide loans  on\r\n\r\nreasonable terms to enable officers to acquire  their\r\n\r\nown homes. Again, out of this sum of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$61 million, $10 million is provided for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  land  and  $4.8 million is provided  for  further\r\n\r\nrural  development. Of the $6 million provided  under\r\n\r\nHead  D. 45 Education, for special expenditure,  $2.8\r\n\r\nmillion  is required for dollar for dollar grants  to\r\n\r\naided  schools, and $1.25 million for  equipment  for\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic and $1.25 million for equipment  for\r\n\r\nnew  schools. $2.6 million is provided under Head  D. 59 Telecommunications   for   further    essential\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the telecommunications system which is\r\n\r\nrevenue earning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deal with the estimates of development\r\n\r\nexpenditure in greater detail. This has already  been\r\n\r\ndone   in   the  Memorandum  which  accompanied   the\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the estimated deficit, it is, difficult\r\n\r\nto  say  what  actual expenditure will amount  to.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  more  than  likely that  the  estimate  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the Singapore Improvement Trust  will\r\n\r\nbe  fulfilled,  which is gratifying  in  itself.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board will be able to spend  the\r\n\r\n$5  million which has been provided. In the light  of\r\n\r\ndiscussions  which I have had with the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nhaving  regard to past performance, I am inclined  to\r\n\r\ndoubt  if  planning  and building capacity,  and  the\r\n\r\nother factors which tend to delay capital works, will\r\n\r\npermit  of  expenditure in excess of $22  million  in\r\n\r\n1958.  Again,  on  the basis of past performance,  it\r\n\r\nseems  unlikely  that  more than  two-thirds  of  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of special expenditure, after loans  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust and Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard  have been subtracted, will be spent. In short,\r\n\r\nit  seems unlikely that total development expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  be  much in excess of $70 million and that  the\r\n\r\ndeficit, if any, will be comparatively small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Development Fund will be\r\n\r\nexhausted  and development will in future  depend  in\r\n\r\nthe  main  on  contributions from  revenue  and  loan\r\n\r\nmoney,  and  whatever  sums can be  transferred  from\r\n\r\ngeneral reserves to finance further development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise the position therefore, if all the\r\n\r\nprognostications about 1957 and 1958  are  fulfilled,\r\n\r\nrevenue  and expenditure should balance  in  1958  at\r\n\r\nabout  $250 million (excluding any charge in  respect\r\n\r\nof  Malayanisation compensation), the General Revenue\r\n\r\nBalance  (including the Christmas Island payment  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone Board stock) should  be  of  the\r\n\r\norder  of $100 million and the development fund  will\r\n\r\nbe exhausted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to say something about the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure has increased at a very great rate since\r\n\r\nthe  war. In this connection, attention is once  more\r\n\r\ninvited  to the schedule of actual expenditure  which\r\n\r\nappears  on page 13 of the Draft Estimates. In  1947,\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  including  Public  Works  Non-Recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  amounted  to  $51  million.  In   1957,\r\n\r\nincluding  Development  expenditure,  the  total   is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  about $300 million.  If  we  look  at\r\n\r\nindividual  items, we see that recurrent  expenditure\r\n\r\non Education has risen from $2 million in 1947 to $50\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1957;  on Medical  and  Health  from  $5\r\n\r\nmillion to $27 million; on Social Welfare from  under\r\n\r\n$1  million to $11 million; on Police from $2 million\r\n\r\nto  $26  million,  and  on Defence  from  practically\r\n\r\nnothing  to  $8 million. Recurrent expenditure  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole has risen from $50 million in 1947 to a revised\r\n\r\nestimate of $232 million in 1957.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that recurrent expenditure will\r\n\r\ncontinue to increase in the future, although  perhaps\r\n\r\nnot  at  the same striking rate. As in the past,  the\r\n\r\nmain  reasons  for increase will be the expansion  of\r\n\r\nEducation and Medical and Health Services and Defence\r\n\r\nServices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Education 40,000 children are\r\n\r\nreaching the age for entry into Primary Schools  each\r\n\r\nyear.  It  is  the am of Government to  give  primary\r\n\r\neducation to all children between the ages of  6  and\r\n\r\n14, and secondary education of either a general or  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  nature to a large percentage of those  who\r\n\r\npass  through the primary stage successfully. It will\r\n\r\nconsequently  be necessary to make similar  additions\r\n\r\nto staff in the future as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been made in the past and funds will be required\r\n\r\nto  meet  the recurrent expenditure required for  the\r\n\r\nadditional  schools  which will  have  to  be  built.\r\n\r\nAgain, increased provision for grants-in-aid will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to meet increased expenditure in  expanding\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools.  The  recurrent  cost   of   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  will increase as the organisation  comes\r\n\r\ninto  full operation. Again, the University  must  be\r\n\r\nexpanded to provide the graduates of all kinds  which\r\n\r\nthe  expanding economy of Singapore requires.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to say to what extent the cost of Education\r\n\r\nwill increase over the next five years. Prior to  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the full aid scheme, the  effect  of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  seen  in the returns for  1956  and  1957,\r\n\r\nexpenditure tended to increase at the rate  of  about\r\n\r\n$7  million  per  annum. It might  be  reasonable  to\r\n\r\nassume  that the increase in the future  will  be  at\r\n\r\nabout  the same rate. This would mean that, by  1962,\r\n\r\nexpenditure on education will have reached a total of\r\n\r\nabout $80 million a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Medical and Health Services, it is a\r\n\r\ncase  of  expanding hospital accommodation,  clinics,\r\n\r\nhealth  centres, etc, as fast as the availability  of\r\n\r\nstaff,  funds and building capacity will  allow.  The\r\n\r\nultimate  aim  is to build another General  Hospital,\r\n\r\nten  district hospitals - 5 in the urban area and 5  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas and each with 500 beds - 20 out-patient\r\n\r\ndepartments and about 100 small maternity  and  child\r\n\r\nhealth clinics. In addition, now that the elimination\r\n\r\nof  tuberculosis  is no longer a  possibility  but  a\r\n\r\nprobability, the drive against this disease  will  be\r\n\r\nstepped  up.  Quite obviously, it will be  very  many\r\n\r\nyears before these plans can be fulfilled. As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  lack  of funds and lack of trained  staff  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to be the limiting factors. But they will  be\r\n\r\nfulfilled  gradually and recurrent  expenditure  will\r\n\r\nmount   in  the  same  way.  In  the  past  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure on Medical and Health services has tended\r\n\r\nto  mount at the rate of about $3 million per  annum.\r\n\r\nAssuming that it continues to mount in the same  way,\r\n\r\nit  will  by 1962 have reached a total of  about  $41\r\n\r\nmillion per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely that the Police Force will grow to\r\n\r\nany  great  extent between now and 1962,  but  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncost of Defence Services will increase. The future of\r\n\r\nthe Royal Malayan Navy is still uncertain but, if  it\r\n\r\nis  transferred to the Federation of Malaya, we shall\r\n\r\nhave  to  expand the role of the Malayan Royal  Naval\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Reserve and of course we have  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  second  battalion of the  Singapore  Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiment.  Expenditure  on  Defence  Services  is  at\r\n\r\npresent  running at the rate of about $11  million  a\r\n\r\nyear,  and  I  consider that it is not unlikely  that\r\n\r\nthis may have increased to about $16 million by 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if expenditure on any other service\r\n\r\nof Government will expand at anything approaching the\r\n\r\nsame rate as in the case of the three services I have\r\n\r\nmentioned specifically. There will of course be  some\r\n\r\nincrease.  That  is  inevitable.  But  it  should  be\r\n\r\ncomparatively  small. By and large, the  majority  of\r\n\r\ndepartments  have stopped expanding - at  least  for\r\n\r\nthe  time being. For the next five years at any rate,\r\n\r\nany  increase in expenditure should only be  required\r\n\r\nin connection with increments and replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, therefore, it seems likely\r\n\r\nthat total expenditure will tend to increase over the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years at a rate of something between  $12\r\n\r\nand  $15  million a year. Total expenditure  by  1962\r\n\r\ntherefore may well be of the order of $300 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a somewhat alarming figure and the first\r\n\r\nreaction of hon. Members may be to ask not how it can\r\n\r\nbe met but how it can be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult question. Contrary to general\r\n\r\nbelief,  there is no more over-staffing, extravagance\r\n\r\nor  waste  in Government than there is in  any  large\r\n\r\nscale   commercial  undertaking.  There  is   not   a\r\n\r\nsuperfluity  of staff in any section of the  service.\r\n\r\nOnly that amount of recurrent and special expenditure\r\n\r\nis  allowed  which is necessary to keep  the  machine\r\n\r\nrunning with maximum efficiency. The Treasury sees to\r\n\r\nthat,   as   any  Head  of  Department  will   agree.\r\n\r\nAllegations  as regards Government extravagance  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  in the past and investigations have  been\r\n\r\nmade  by  select committees, organisation consultants\r\n\r\nand other agents. But the results have generally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  disappointing from the point  of  view  of  the\r\n\r\ncritics.  Minor  examples of waste  and  extravagance\r\n\r\nhave of course come to light and have been corrected,\r\n\r\ntemporary staff which has become redundant  has  been\r\n\r\nremoved, but the total saving which has resulted  has\r\n\r\nbeen   comparatively  small.  This   has   been   the\r\n\r\nexperience of other administrations as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that waste and extravagance do\r\n\r\nnot  exist,  or  that the Government is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nclose   its   eyes  to  them.  Quite  the   contrary.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  always  on the lookout  to  eliminate\r\n\r\nwaste,  extravagance and redundancy. To this end,  it\r\n\r\nis  proposed  to  set  up  an  organisation  in  each\r\n\r\nMinistry   which   will   keep   these   matters   of\r\n\r\norganisation and efficiency constantly under  review.\r\n\r\nThe  scheme follows the proposal of an Indian  expert\r\n\r\nwho  visited Singapore in 1955. Unfortunately we have\r\n\r\nnot  yet  been able to recruit the adviser who  would\r\n\r\ntrain  the officers required to run the scheme.  Such\r\n\r\nmen are in very short supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is to be any significant reduction in\r\n\r\nGovernment spending, it can only come as a result  of\r\n\r\ndrastic  changes in plan, reduction in  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nexpansion of the social services, retrenchment,  cuts\r\n\r\nin salaries, or a combination of some or all of these\r\n\r\nfactors. For example, expenditure could be reduced if\r\n\r\nit  were  decided that secondary education should  be\r\n\r\nlimited  to  a  smaller percentage of  those  passing\r\n\r\nthrough  primary  school, or that  primary  education\r\n\r\nshould stop at 12 years of age and not be extended to\r\n\r\n14  years  of age, or that the expansion  of  Medical\r\n\r\nservices  should  be drastically cut  down  or  cease\r\n\r\naltogether  for a period, or that variable allowances\r\n\r\nshould be reduced and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such decisions could defeat the Government's\r\n\r\navowed intention to expand essential services to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Consequently we must look  in  the  main  to\r\n\r\nincreased taxation to meet the bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue has increased substantially over the past\r\n\r\ndecade  from  $77 million in 1947 to an  estimate  of\r\n\r\n$235  million in 1957. During this period,  the  only\r\n\r\ncompletely novel measure of taxation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been introduced is Income Tax  which  now\r\n\r\nyields  $65  million or about 27 per  cent  of  total\r\n\r\nrevenue. There have been increases in rates of duties\r\n\r\ncollected  by the Customs Department over  the  years\r\n\r\nand collections under Class I have increased from $42\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1947 to $186 million in 1957. Again,  the\r\n\r\nexpanding  economy, the growing population,  and  the\r\n\r\ngrowing demand for Government services have all  made\r\n\r\na material contribution to the increase in revenue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a considerable revenue potential\r\n\r\nleft  in  Singapore  within the  present  pattern  of\r\n\r\ntaxation.  We are, in effect, still one of  the  most\r\n\r\nlightly  taxed  nations  in the  world.  We  are  for\r\n\r\nexample  considerably better off than people  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation who, in addition to paying duty on tobacco\r\n\r\nat  a much higher rate than we do, have to pay a wide\r\n\r\nrange of customs duties on other goods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But increases within the present pattern of\r\n\r\ntaxation  will  not  be enough in  themselves.  Other\r\n\r\nmeans  of  taxation, hitherto novel  in  the  Malayan\r\n\r\ncontext,  will  have  to be devised.  The  population\r\n\r\ngenerally  will  have  to  contribute  more   towards\r\n\r\nEducation - perhaps  through  the  Education  rate.  It\r\n\r\nseems doubtful if Medical attention and the supply of\r\n\r\nmedicines  can remain altogether free for any  length\r\n\r\nof  time.  I  do not exclude the possibility  of  the\r\n\r\neventual  introduction of import duties on a selected\r\n\r\nrange  of  goods which either do not enter  into  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade or enter only to a limited extent. But\r\n\r\nI hope sincerely that this step will be long delayed,\r\n\r\nand  only  taken after all other measures  have  been\r\n\r\nexploited to the full.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if Singapore is going to have the\r\n\r\nservices  it wants, it must be prepared  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthem, and to pay much more heavily than it has in the\r\n\r\npast.  We  must  be  prepared for  greatly  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation.  Reduction  in  expenditure  can  only   be\r\n\r\nachieved  by a drastic change of policy which  should\r\n\r\nprobably  be avoided as long as any revenue potential\r\n\r\nremains untapped.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of financing development in the future\r\n\r\nalso raises difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestions.  I  have already given some indication  of\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been  done  in Singapore  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in the public sector since  the  war.  I\r\n\r\nthink that it will be generally agreed that what  has\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved is most impressive. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nmuch  remains to be done. Assuming that estimates  of\r\n\r\nthe amount of development which can be undertaken  in\r\n\r\n1958  prove  to  be  correct, Government  will  still\r\n\r\nremain   committed  to  work  estimated,  at  present\r\n\r\nprices,  to  cost  over  $100 million.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nallowance must be made for continuing items not shown\r\n\r\nin the estimates such as housing after the completion\r\n\r\nof  existing programmes, rural development,  purchase\r\n\r\nof   land  for  development,  education  and  medical\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  addition to noted  commitments,  and\r\n\r\nDefence  Services development. The City  Council  has\r\n\r\nplans  for the development of public utilities  which\r\n\r\nwill entail the expenditure of $130 million over  the\r\n\r\nnext three or four years. The proposed allocation  of\r\n\r\nthis expenditure is $50 million for electrical works,\r\n\r\n$40  million for water works, $6 million for gas  and\r\n\r\n$36  million  for sewage disposal. In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telephone  Board will require  substantial\r\n\r\nsums  for  further  development  if  the  demand  for\r\n\r\ntelephone   facilities  is  to  be  met.  In   short,\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be faced with the task  of  financing\r\n\r\nknown commitments amounting to something of the order\r\n\r\nof  $340  million  irrespective of any  other  urgent\r\n\r\nworks which may arise in the meantime, and this  will\r\n\r\nhave to be undertaken over the next few years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question immediately arises whether this can be\r\n\r\ndone, and if so, over what period of time must it  be\r\n\r\nspread. I think the answer is that it can be done  if\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions are fulfilled, but it  will  take\r\n\r\nsomewhat  longer than most authorities  and  citizens\r\n\r\nwould  like,  and  implementation  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nplanned and integrated on an island-wide basis if  we\r\n\r\nare going to succeed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto we have managed to finance our development\r\n\r\nbecause of a number of factors. We have experienced a\r\n\r\ndecade  of unparalleled prosperity which has  enabled\r\n\r\nGovernment to build up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreserves  beyond  the  wildest  dreams  of  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretaries  of the past. Government has  managed  to\r\n\r\nfinance all its development, including loans  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust  and  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board,  from  these  resources  and,  more\r\n\r\nrecently,   from   substantial   contributions   from\r\n\r\nrevenue,  and has left the loan market  free  to  the\r\n\r\nCity Council which has managed to borrow $214 million\r\n\r\nsince  the  war. All the quasi Government authorities\r\n\r\nin Singapore have, like Government, been able to make\r\n\r\nsubstantial    contributions    from    revenue    to\r\n\r\ndevelopment. In addition, confidence in the future of\r\n\r\nSingapore has been high and institutions and  private\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  a  lesser  extent  have  been   easily\r\n\r\npersuaded  to  invest  their surplus  funds  in  City\r\n\r\nCouncil loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, however, the position has changed somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe boom period is over. We are back to what might be\r\n\r\ncalled   \"normal\"  Singapore  conditions.  Money   is\r\n\r\ntighter.  Institutions  and  firms  have  no   longer\r\n\r\nsurplus funds to invest in long-term loans. Long-term\r\n\r\nloans have lost popularity and all the emphasis is on\r\n\r\nshort-term  lending  and  borrowing.  The  Government\r\n\r\nProvident  Funds  have appeared on  the  scene  as  a\r\n\r\nsource of development capital for the two Governments\r\n\r\nand  have had the effect of almost completely  drying\r\n\r\nup  other  institutional sources. Although confidence\r\n\r\nis  growing, it would be idle to deny that  there  is\r\n\r\nnot now as much confidence in the future of Singapore\r\n\r\nas  there  was, say, in early 1955. It  is  now  more\r\n\r\ndifficult than it has been before to obtain access to\r\n\r\nthe  London market. Perhaps due to the nature of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and  to  its subjection to the  vagaries  of\r\n\r\ncommodity   prices,  there  is  an  almost   complete\r\n\r\nabsence, amongst the population as a whole,  of  that\r\n\r\ninstinct  to save which is a characteristic of  other\r\n\r\nraces.   The  response  of  private  individuals   to\r\n\r\nGovernment and City Council loans has been  poor  and\r\n\r\nthe  response  to  such means of saving  as  National\r\n\r\nSavings  Certificates and Premium Bonds  even  worse.\r\n\r\nThe problem of how best to promote the saving habit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the population is one of the Government's main pre-occupations at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, one may safely say that, by and large,\r\n\r\nthe main sources of development capital available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore at present are the contributions which  the\r\n\r\nvarious  authorities can make from their  own  funds,\r\n\r\nsuch  funds  as the Central Provident Fund  Board  is\r\n\r\nprepared to make available for local investment, and\r\n\r\nthe  small  sums  which  other sources  of  long-term\r\n\r\ninvestment capital can supply. As regards the Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund, I am afraid I am not very happy about\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of the Board of this national  provident\r\n\r\nfund  which  insists that 25 per cent  of  its  funds\r\n\r\nshould be invested outside Malaya at a time when  the\r\n\r\nCity   Council  is  sorely  in  need  of  funds   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes. At the very outside,  I  place\r\n\r\nthe  total sum which is likely to be available in any\r\n\r\none  year  from  these sources  at  $50  million.  In\r\n\r\naddition, it may be possible to obtain specific loans\r\n\r\nfrom  international organisations for development  of\r\n\r\ncertain aspects of the City Council utilities, and it\r\n\r\nmay  also  be possible to invest some of the currency\r\n\r\nfund  in  local  loans. These accretions  of  wealth,\r\n\r\nhowever, are not certain and, even if available, will\r\n\r\nnot accrue for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, the implementation of existing\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans after 1958 is going to  be  limited\r\n\r\nby  financial  considerations  to  at  the  most  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  a year, at least at the start. This  clearly\r\n\r\ndemands  the  integration  and  phasing  of  existing\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans against the background  of  finance\r\n\r\nlikely  to be available. Gone are the days when  both\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the City Council could  go  blithely\r\n\r\nahead  without  much thought for the availability  of\r\n\r\nfunds.  From  now  on, development will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nplanned  on an island-wide basis to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nfunds available for capital development are spent  to\r\n\r\nthe  best  advantage of the territory as a whole.  To\r\n\r\nthis  end,  it has been decided to set up a  Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee   under   the   Financial   Secretary   and\r\n\r\nconsisting  of representatives of the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe City Council and other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment authorities. This Committee,  which  will\r\n\r\nmeet as soon as possible, will examine existing plans\r\n\r\nand  commitments of the Government and  City  Council\r\n\r\nand will integrate and phase them in the light of the\r\n\r\nessential  needs of the Colony funds, and development\r\n\r\ncapacity likely to be available. It will be appointed\r\n\r\nby  the  Council of Ministers to which it will report\r\n\r\nfrom time to time. Its findings will also, of course,\r\n\r\nbe made available to the City Council which will have\r\n\r\nan opportunity of expressing any opinions it desires.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, I must make it clear - since fears\r\n\r\nhave  been expressed in other quarters - that the  need\r\n\r\nfor  the  development of public  utilities  is  fully\r\n\r\nappreciated,  and  will  not  be  overlooked  in  the\r\n\r\nallocation of funds for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect of this limitation of funds and\r\n\r\nphasing  of  development will be that development  is\r\n\r\nspread  over  a  longer period  than  was  originally\r\n\r\nintended. This is regrettable but unavoidable in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances. We can, however, take comfort from the\r\n\r\nfact  that so much has been done in the past and rest\r\n\r\nassured   that,  if  there  is  any  opportunity   to\r\n\r\naccelerate the programme in the future, it  will  not\r\n\r\nbe neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, gives some indication of the shape of\r\n\r\nthings to come. If we are to have the services  which\r\n\r\nwe   regard  as  essential  for  our  well-being  and\r\n\r\nprosperity, we must be prepared in the future to save\r\n\r\nmuch  more  and pay much more in taxes than  we  have\r\n\r\never done in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the\r\n\r\nofficers   who   have   been  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\npreparation of the Estimates. They have been hard  at\r\n\r\nit since April and I cannot speak too highly of their\r\n\r\nconscientiousness and devotion to duty. I should also\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank the Government Printer and his  staff\r\n\r\nwho, as always, have met all demands on their ability\r\n\r\nand time with cheerfulness and customary efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

A\r\n\r\nthoughtful  providence, Sir, saw to it that  man  was\r\n\r\nprovided  the  wherewithal to obtain  sustenance  for\r\n\r\nhimself  and  for  his family. A merciful  providence\r\n\r\nprovided  man with land to till and mine, to  extract\r\n\r\nhis  needs  by  the sweat of his brow. A  cooperative\r\n\r\nprovidence provided man with the seas to extract food\r\n\r\nfrom,  if  he  was  clever and courageous  enough.  A\r\n\r\nthoughtful  providence also provided man with  swamps\r\n\r\nand  marshes,  which is neither land nor  sea,  as  a\r\n\r\nreserve, for man to use his skill and cunningness, if\r\n\r\nhe  wished  to  put  it to his  use  when  his  other\r\n\r\nresources were found to be insufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the resources of Singapore: We in\r\n\r\nSingapore are land hungry. On an island of 225 square\r\n\r\nmiles,  we  have a population of 1\u00bd million.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  are not aware of the  density  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation. I have here, Sir, the Colombo  Plan  fact\r\n\r\nsheets   that  are  produced  by  the  Colombo   Plan\r\n\r\nInformation Office in which are quoted the density of\r\n\r\npopulation  figures  for  the  various  Colombo  Plan\r\n\r\ncountries. Now the figures for Singapore are taken on\r\n\r\na  previous  census basis of 1\u00bc million.  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfigures are quoted as 1,635 per square kilometre  and\r\n\r\nthe  next  highest Colombo Plan country's density  of\r\n\r\npopulation is that of Ceylon, that is, 131 - less  than\r\n\r\n1/10th  of  Singapore. Now, the enormousness  of  the\r\n\r\ndensity of population situation cannot be realised by\r\n\r\nhon. Members unless they see such figures. Worked out\r\n\r\non a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation  basis of 1\u00bd million, Sir, our  population\r\n\r\ncomes  to  6,667  per square mile  and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nhighest  population density, I believe, in the  world\r\n\r\nif  we  take  Singapore as a nation - as a  country  by\r\n\r\nitself which we are now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken at various times on the need to\r\n\r\nput  land to the best and the most economical use  we\r\n\r\ncan.  Even then, it cannot be concealed that we  have\r\n\r\nnot   sufficient  land  and  at  the  rate  that  our\r\n\r\npopulation is growing, we will find it very  hard  to\r\n\r\nproduce enough food even on the basis of what we  are\r\n\r\nproducing now. Therefore, it is our duty to make  use\r\n\r\nof every little bit of land that is available, and if\r\n\r\nno  land is available, to make use of other resources\r\n\r\nlike marshes and swamps rather than to let them go to\r\n\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Fisheries Division in my Ministry has\r\n\r\nshown,  by experiments, that it has conducted in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  prawn  ponds,  that  it  is  possible  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the yield per acre of prawn ponds in  swamp\r\n\r\nareas  to  .34  ton per annum, that is more  than  5\u00bd\r\n\r\npicul  per acre per year. A survey of the swamp areas\r\n\r\nof  Singapore has also disclosed that not many  areas\r\n\r\nof such swamp lands are available for development for\r\n\r\nprawn  pond  purposes.  In  order  to  increase   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  for our local citizens,  I  put  up  a\r\n\r\nproposal to the Nature Reserve Board early this year,\r\n\r\nthat  the Board should release the Ulu Pandan  Nature\r\n\r\nReserve  for  the  purposes of prawn  cultivation  in\r\n\r\nponds.  Later on, I modified my proposal to a request\r\n\r\nfor  a  further 800 acres only because 200  acres  of\r\n\r\nthat  Nature Reserve are already occupied by a  prawn\r\n\r\npond operator without licence and those 200 acres, it\r\n\r\nseems,  were  opened up by him during the  Occupation\r\n\r\nperiod.  At least a quarter of the 800 acres which  I\r\n\r\nam  asking  this  House to vote for release  will  be\r\n\r\nreserved  for cooperative prawn ponds for  the  Malay\r\n\r\nfishermen  living  in  the  area  and  I  propose  to\r\n\r\norganise  these  Malay fishermen into a  co-operative\r\n\r\nfor  that  purpose. Full assistance will be given  to\r\n\r\nthese Malay fishermen in order to organise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  and to set them on a proper footing into a  co-operative so that they can exploit the prawn ponds in\r\n\r\nthe area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, Sir, that considerations which favour\r\n\r\nthe release of a large area of mangrove swamps in the\r\n\r\nPandan Nature Reserve for the purposes of prawn  pond\r\n\r\ncultivation more than outweigh those which favour the\r\n\r\nretention of this area for the limited purpose  of  a\r\n\r\nnature  reserve to serve only a small section of  the\r\n\r\npopulation,  either for the purpose of recreation  or\r\n\r\nof  education. The colony, Sir, has come to  a  stage\r\n\r\nnow  where  it cannot afford the luxury  of  mangrove\r\n\r\nswamps as nature reserves, for such swamps can be put\r\n\r\nto  better  economic  use,  and  for  the  biological\r\n\r\nstudies of nature students, it is considered that the\r\n\r\nswamps  along  the  south coast of Johore  which  are\r\n\r\nquite close to us will be more suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order, Sir, that the whole of the Pandan Reserve,\r\n\r\nexcepting  an  area of 370 acres which  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired and which will be kept as a reserve,  should\r\n\r\nbe  released  for  the economic  use  of  prawn  pond\r\n\r\ncultivation,  an  amendment to  paragraph  5  of  the\r\n\r\nSchedule   to   the  Nature  Reserves  Ordinance   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  under section 4  (1)  of  the  Nature\r\n\r\nReserves Ordinance,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Legislative Assembly may by resolution amend\r\n\r\nthe Schedule to this Ordinance by either the addition\r\n\r\nto or deletion from the said Schedule or may make any\r\n\r\nmodification  of  the boundary  of  an  area  already\r\n\r\nincluded in the said Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the motion which I have moved will be\r\n\r\nto  reduce the present acreage of the area  shown  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 5 of the Schedule from 1,370 acres  to  370\r\n\r\nacres,  thereby confirming the release of  200  acres\r\n\r\nwhich  are now already covered by prawn ponds without\r\n\r\nlicence,  and also releasing a further 800 acres  for\r\n\r\nredevelopment as prawn ponds. The remaining 370 acres\r\n\r\nwill continue under the control of the Nature Reserve\r\n\r\nBoard  as a nature reserve-cum tourist attraction.

Since  then,  I  have made  investigations  and\r\n\r\nenquiries, just as the Minister himself has. The only\r\n\r\ndifference  between  us  is  that  we  have  come  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  conclusions: his conclusion  is  that  the\r\n\r\nisland's  prawn catch can be increased by  converting\r\n\r\n1,000  acres of this mangrove forest, or  rather  the\r\n\r\nbalance of 800 acres, into prawn ponds: my conclusion\r\n\r\nis  that  the reverse may very well be the case,  not\r\n\r\nonly  shall  we  reduce our prawns  but  reduce,  and\r\n\r\nreduce  to extinction, a unique mangrove area  to  no\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall first put forward reasons, and the\r\n\r\nreasons of experts, why this mangrove area should  be\r\n\r\nreserved  as  an area of scientific importance,  and.\r\n\r\nsecondly, reasons why the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis running a great risk of doing the opposite of what\r\n\r\nit  intends if it carries through the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall urge as strongly as I can that the\r\n\r\nGovernment withdraws this motion, that it reconsiders\r\n\r\nall   the   evidence  available  and  acquires   more\r\n\r\nscientific data on this subject before proceeding any\r\n\r\nfurther.  I base my plea on this simple truism:  that\r\n\r\nyou  can cut down a tree in a matter of minutes,  but\r\n\r\nit takes you 10, 20 or 30 years to undo what you have\r\n\r\ndone and replace that tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I launch into my main\r\n\r\nargument,  I would like to emphasise that I  have  no\r\n\r\naxe  to  grind in this particular matter, I  have  no\r\n\r\ninterest in the forest reserve or prawn ponds  except\r\n\r\na  scientific interest and an interest in Singapore's\r\n\r\nwell  being,  and I have considered this  problem  as\r\n\r\nobjectively and dispassionately as I can in a  desire\r\n\r\nto find out the truth. My whole case is this: that in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of present evidence I am of  the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat the Minister is making a grave mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would first like to draw your attention to\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  the Nature Reserves  Ordinance  now\r\n\r\nbefore  us:  the  long title states that  it  is  \"to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  dedication and  administration  of\r\n\r\ncertain  lands in the Colony of Singapore  as  Nature\r\n\r\nReserves\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3 of the Ordinance states the objects in\r\n\r\ngreater detail. Sub-section (1) reads:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The lands shown in the Schedule to this Ordinance\r\n\r\nare  hereby dedicated, set aside and reserved for the\r\n\r\npurposes   of   the   propagation,   protection   and\r\n\r\npreservation of the indigenous fauna and flora of the\r\n\r\nColony and for the preservation of objects and places\r\n\r\nof aesthetic, historical or scientific interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-section (2) reads:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Such lands shall be controlled and managed not only\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of protection and preservation  as\r\n\r\naforesaid but also for the purpose of providing under\r\n\r\nsuitable  conditions and control facilities  for  the\r\n\r\nstudy  of and research into matters relating  to  the\r\n\r\nfauna  and  flora  of  the Colony  and  the  physical\r\n\r\nconditions in which they live.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lands mentioned in the Schedule are the\r\n\r\nfollowing, each of which was created as a reserve for\r\n\r\na particular reason:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 1. This is the forest reserve known as the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Catchment Area, which is preserved for  the\r\n\r\nobvious  reason  of  protecting  part  of  our  water\r\n\r\nsupply,  and  accounts for the  City  Council  having\r\n\r\npowers  to nominate one of its members to the  Nature\r\n\r\nReserve Board.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nos. 2 and 3 are two adjoining sections of the Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  Forest Reserve forming one area which  is  the\r\n\r\n\"classical   collecting  area  for   a   very   large\r\n\r\nproportion of Malaya's flora. It is the type locality\r\n\r\nfor  probably more species of plants than  any  other\r\n\r\narea  of comparable size in the world. It is the only\r\n\r\nremaining   piece  of  primary  lowland   forest   on\r\n\r\nSingapore Island.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 6 - if I may skip Nos. 4 and 5 for the moment-is\r\n\r\nthe   Labrador  area  which  \"conserves  a  primitive\r\n\r\nspecies of fern, 'Dipteria conjugata', which is found\r\n\r\nelsewhere in Malaya only above 3,000 feet.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nos. 4 and 5 are firstly the Kranji Forest\r\n\r\nReserve,  which \"typifies the transition  from  muddy\r\n\r\nforeshore  to  a  dry land vegetation,\"  whereas  the\r\n\r\nPandan  Forest Reserve is \"typical of tidal mangrove.\r\n\r\nWith  the total exploitation of other mangrove  areas\r\n\r\non  Singapore Island and the extensive working of the\r\n\r\nmangrove   in  South  Johore,  Pandan  is  the   last\r\n\r\nremaining piece of typical mangrove.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should explain, Sir, that the obvious scientific\r\n\r\nportions of the explanation of the areas which I have\r\n\r\njust given are not my views, but part of a considered\r\n\r\nreport made by the Nature Reserve Board itself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandan, I repeat, is \"the last remaining piece of\r\n\r\ntypical  mangrove\".  And I would  add  the  following\r\n\r\nreport   of  the  present  Director  of  the  Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The species of plants recorded from the Pandan\r\n\r\nReserve represent about 1/20th of Singapore's  flora.\r\n\r\nOne  species at least is found elsewhere only on  the\r\n\r\neast  coast  of Malaya, and another nowhere  else  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  South  of Negri Sembilan and Pahang.  A  fern\r\n\r\nrecently found at Pandan has been previously recorded\r\n\r\nin  Malaya  only in the mountains of central  Malaya.\r\n\r\nSome  13 species of rare plants are at present  known\r\n\r\nin the area.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore be realised that the five areas\r\n\r\nlisted  in the Schedule were all to be protected  for\r\n\r\nspecific and separate reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, therefore, this Assembly reduces the Pandan\r\n\r\nNature  Reserve  from 1,370 acres  to  370  acres  by\r\n\r\napproving  this motion, an area which  is  \"the  last\r\n\r\nremaining piece of typical mangrove\", I maintain that\r\n\r\nit  is  violating  the  letter  and  spirit  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which expressly states that  the  area  is\r\n\r\n\"dedicated,  set aside and reserved for the  purposes\r\n\r\nof  the  propagation, protection and preservation  of\r\n\r\nthe  indigenous  fauna and flora of  the  Colony\".  I\r\n\r\nwould   add  that  the  word  \"dedication\"  expressly\r\n\r\ncarries with it a sense of permanence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I know perfectly well what the Minister's answer\r\n\r\nto  this  might be: it is perhaps the only  point  he\r\n\r\nhas.  Professor Holttum, in giving his views on  this\r\n\r\nproblem earlier in this year, stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Natural vegetation can only be preserved in samples\r\n\r\nsufficiently  large to be self-propagating.  In  most\r\n\r\ncases,  units  of  about 200  acres  are  probably  a\r\n\r\nminimum for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my hon. Friend the Minister might say, \"There you\r\n\r\nare,  Professor Holttum has stated that 200 acres  is\r\n\r\nsufficient. I am leaving you with 370 acres or almost\r\n\r\ndouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are at least two points which qualify, if\r\n\r\nnot negative, Professor Holttum's statement which was\r\n\r\nwritten in London without more accurate knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  areas  proposed  to be alienated.  Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nareas  to  be  left are divided into  three  separate\r\n\r\nsections of 236, 90 and 45 acres respectively so that\r\n\r\nthe  last  two are of no value at all. Secondly,  all\r\n\r\nthree areas are strips along the coast, and I have  a\r\n\r\nmap  which  shows that this is so. Now, if you,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhave  been  into this mangrove area, as I  have,  you\r\n\r\nwill  immediately have noticed one curious fact. That\r\n\r\nthe  mangrove along the edge of the coast and on  the\r\n\r\ntwo  banks of the Sungei Jurong is stunted: in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  trees  are smaller  than  those  growing\r\n\r\nfurther inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature Reserve Board has pointed this out as\r\n\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is utterly impossible for these (three areas) to\r\n\r\nbe representative of a whole mangrove community since\r\n\r\nmangrove   vegetation  consists  of   a   series   of\r\n\r\ngradations  from  the seaward edge of  the  innermost\r\n\r\nborder  to  where dry land begins. The plant  species\r\n\r\nand  the  animals associated with them vary with  the\r\n\r\ndegree of inundation and exposure they have from  the\r\n\r\ntide.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you take this argument - and any ordinary\r\n\r\nperson   can  accept  it  after  simple  observation\r\n\r\ntogether  with Professor Holttum's opinion, you  will\r\n\r\nappreciate that the fragmentary 370 acres proposed to\r\n\r\nbe left untouched are of little or no value. He said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Natural vegetation can only be preserved in samples\r\n\r\nsufficiently large to be self-propagating.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acres concerned lying along the coast do not form\r\n\r\na  complete unit of mangrove and therefore cannot  be\r\n\r\nself-propagating.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed what Professor Holttum said was this and I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In most cases, units of about 200 areas are\r\n\r\nprobably a minimum for this purpose, and larger areas\r\n\r\nwould  be  better. From an educational  and  cultural\r\n\r\nviewpoint,  it  is  the  duty  of  any  community  to\r\n\r\npreserve  adequate samples of its natural vegetation,\r\n\r\nand in Singapore mangrove constitutes a distinct type\r\n\r\nof vegetation of particular biological interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear therefore that Professor Holttum\r\n\r\nqualified his minimum of 200 acres by saying that  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  an  adequate sample of  natural  vegetation\r\n\r\nwhich  means  that  it  must  be  large  enough   and\r\n\r\nrepresentative enough to be self-propagating.  It  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear that these coastal strips do not  fulfil\r\n\r\nthese  conditions,  that therefore  the  granting  of\r\n\r\nthese  strips  does not fulfil the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and that the Minister's interpretation  of\r\n\r\nProfessor  Holttum's  200 acres  would  be  extremely\r\n\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Professor Holttum's view is not the only expert\r\n\r\nview: if his view gives the Minister the ghost  of  a\r\n\r\ncase,  other experts whom I shall now quote give  him\r\n\r\nno case at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E. J. H.

Impoverished samples  of  the\r\n\r\nformer can be seen in areas subjected to cutting, but\r\n\r\nit  is  largely exterminated by conversion to  ponds.\r\n\r\nThese  animals (especially the crustacea) are  easily\r\n\r\nobserved during the day and are of great interest  to\r\n\r\nstudents of animal behaviour. . . The proposed action\r\n\r\nat  Pandan would therefore destroy a nature  reserve\r\n\r\nof a very special and important kind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Purchon, Raffles Professor of Zoology at\r\n\r\nthe University of Malaya, stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The area in question is the type locality for a\r\n\r\nnumber of described species. Indeed the value of  the\r\n\r\narea  in  this respect is so great that to assess  it\r\n\r\naccordingly would be a very difficult task. The  area\r\n\r\nis  important scientifically and educationally. It is\r\n\r\nregularly   used  by  staff  and  students   of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Zoology for teaching purposes,  and  it\r\n\r\nis similarly valuable to our schools.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professor of Botany, Professor Gilliland, has\r\n\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In Singapore, with its very large number of schools\r\n\r\nand its two universities, these nature reserves are a\r\n\r\nvital  necessity  for the teaching of  biology.

There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, one important point still remaining, one  of\r\n\r\nthe  few made by the Hon. Minister which requires  to\r\n\r\nbe answered, in a singularly unconvincing speech.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has suggested that students and teachers can go to Johore to study biology, but will\r\n\r\nhe  tell the House where in Johore there is a  Nature\r\n\r\nReserve? There is, I believe, some accessible  Forest\r\n\r\nReserve  40  miles  away  at  Pontian,  but  that  is\r\n\r\ncontrolled  and cut for the purposes of timber.  Only\r\n\r\nin  a  Nature  Reserve will we find  the  undisturbed\r\n\r\nmangrove   in  its  natural  state  which  biological\r\n\r\nstudies  require. Are we to deny these  opportunities\r\n\r\nto our two Universities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only yesterday I obtained further information on\r\n\r\nthis point. I have it on the authority of a prominent\r\n\r\nmember of the Department of Zoology at the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya - whom for some reason the Minister has  not\r\n\r\nthought  fit  to consult - that there  is  in  fact  no\r\n\r\nmangrove  in the whole of South Malaya which  can  be\r\n\r\ncalled  first-class, and you would have to go to  the\r\n\r\nmouth of the Sarawak River in order to find it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense it would be true to say that the\r\n\r\nPandan   Reserve  is  not  ideal,  although   it   is\r\n\r\nrecovering very fast, but it is also true to say that\r\n\r\nthere is no better mangrove in South Malaya and  that\r\n\r\nthe only mangrove of comparable quality in Johore  is\r\n\r\nin   the   Kukup   area,  where  it   is   completely\r\n\r\ninaccessible  except  by boat after  almost  a  day's\r\n\r\njourney.  All mangrove in Johore which is  accessible\r\n\r\nby  road  is unrepresentative for the obvious  reason\r\n\r\nthat it is not left undisturbed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great point about the Pandan Reserve from the\r\n\r\nteachers' point of view is that they know what is  in\r\n\r\nthe  Reserve and they can bring their students to  it\r\n\r\nwithout having to search for it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are facts from experts who know the mangrove\r\n\r\nintimately,  and I would venture to suggest  that  if\r\n\r\nour  aim,  through the University of Malaya  and  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, is to produce our own biologists\r\n\r\nand botanists to fill future posts in the Departments\r\n\r\nof   Agriculture  and  Fisheries,  and  the   Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens, and to provide teachers for the students and\r\n\r\nthe  next  generation, why deny  them  what  we  have\r\n\r\nalready at hand on our own island.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to another opinion, the Planning Adviser to\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Improvement Trust has stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I confirm without question that we looked upon the\r\n\r\nNature  Reserve as complementary to the  Green  Belt,\r\n\r\nand  that  they  were specifically  included  in  the\r\n\r\nMaster   Plan  under  the  designation   of   'Nature\r\n\r\nReserves' in order that they might be enjoyed by  the\r\n\r\npublic in their natural state.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart therefore, from any protection which may\r\n\r\nbe  afforded by the Nature Reserves Ordinance, it  is\r\n\r\nmy  opinion that it would be entirely contrary to the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan for these areas to be used for any  other\r\n\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that I have not wearied the House by\r\n\r\npursuing  to  such lengths what is  in  fact  only  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary argument\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto my main argument to which I am shortly coming, but\r\n\r\nit is important to establish this point, namely, that\r\n\r\nin introducing this motion, the Minister is in effect\r\n\r\nsaying,  firstly,  that the educational,  biological,\r\n\r\nbotanical, zoological and tourist value of this \"last\r\n\r\nremaining   piece  of  typical  mangrove\"   must   be\r\n\r\ndestroyed;  and,  secondly, that he  must  flout  the\r\n\r\nspirit and intention of the Nature Reserves Ordinance\r\n\r\nas I have already quoted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us suppose that we must accept this, although I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure that the House will be fully  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister in this matter; let us suppose that we  must\r\n\r\nsacrifice these valuable assets of the Pandan Reserve\r\n\r\nin  the interests of more prawns for our markets  and\r\n\r\nmore  employment for our people, a need on  which  we\r\n\r\ncan all agree. Is there irrefutable evidence that the\r\n\r\nopening  up of another 800 acres to prawn  ponds  and\r\n\r\nthe  reduction of the mangrove forest  to  370  acres\r\n\r\nwill  produce this result? The Minister has  possibly\r\n\r\nthe  authority of the Department of Fisheries to tell\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir, that it will, though I wonder whether they\r\n\r\nare  really  convinced; but the amount of  scientific\r\n\r\nevidence  on his side is practically nil, nor  indeed\r\n\r\nhas he produced any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, Sir, that there is an almost overwhelming\r\n\r\nbody  of evidence on the other side, and I would  put\r\n\r\nthe   proposition  that  if  there  is  the  remotest\r\n\r\npossibility that by converting 800 acres of mangroves\r\n\r\ninto   prawn   ponds  you  will  reduce   the   prawn\r\n\r\npopulation, then this motion should be withdrawn  and\r\n\r\nthe whole question given further study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature Reserve Board has stated its views most\r\n\r\nemphatically on this subject, as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"With regard to over-trapping the Board would\r\n\r\nemphasise  again  most strongly the evidence  already\r\n\r\nsubmitted  that a proportion of the prawn  population\r\n\r\nmust  be at large in undisturbed mangrove to  form  a\r\n\r\nbreeding nucleus from the fry of which the ponds  are\r\n\r\nstocked.  Since  the ponds are traps and  the  prawns\r\n\r\ntherein   are  caught  before  they  breed  this   is\r\n\r\nessential.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Nature Society puts the problem in its\r\n\r\nsimplest form:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Since we include among us two ecologists of more\r\n\r\nthan  local  repute,  we think  our  opinion  on  the\r\n\r\nproposed scheme may be worth giving. We believe  that\r\n\r\nit  would actually lead to a drop in prawn production\r\n\r\nrather than a rise, for the following reasons.  These\r\n\r\nprawns  are  really mangrove animals; that  is  their\r\n\r\nnatural habitat where they feed and grow. They follow\r\n\r\nthe  tide  up, thus entering the prawn ponds  at  the\r\n\r\ninner  edge of the mangrove and being caught  at  low\r\n\r\ntide  when  the sluice gates are opened. If  however,\r\n\r\nthe  mangrove is removed and the whole area is filled\r\n\r\nwith  prawn  ponds, then the prawns' natural  habitat\r\n\r\nand  feeding  grounds are destroyed.  The  inevitable\r\n\r\nresult would seem to be a rapid fall in the catch  of\r\n\r\nprawns,  as they will go elsewhere in search  of  the\r\n\r\nright habitat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point it is only fair to say that, quite\r\n\r\nunwittingly, I may have misled the Minister-as indeed\r\n\r\nI   misled   myself-when  I   asked   the   following\r\n\r\nsupplementary  question on 22nd  May  of  this  year,\r\n\r\nnamely,  whether the Minister was aware that  it  had\r\n\r\nnow been discovered that prawns breed in the mangrove\r\n\r\nareas.  I  should in fact have said  \"feed\"  and  not\r\n\r\n\"breed\", a very different thing. It is in fact agreed\r\n\r\nby   the   experts  that  the  prawns  of  commercial\r\n\r\nimportance breed somewhere out to sea and not in  the\r\n\r\nmangrove, but where is not yet known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister somewhat naturally seized on this point, and I do not blame him, when he wrote to me on\r\n\r\n3rd June as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There are two kinds of prawns, one belonging to the\r\n\r\nfamily  known  as  the  'Carideans'  which  breed  in\r\n\r\nmangrove areas and the other belonging to the  family\r\n\r\nknown  as  'Peneids' which do not breed  in  mangrove\r\n\r\nareas.  The  former are only useful as pig  and  duck\r\n\r\nfood  whilst it is on the latter 'Peneids'  that  our\r\n\r\npresent prawn rearing industry is based.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, according to Mr P. N. F. Hall, a prawn\r\n\r\nspecialist  who  left Singapore  when  the  Fisheries\r\n\r\nResearch Station collapsed - and it is a pity he is not\r\n\r\nhere  to help us over this problem - according  to  Mr\r\n\r\nHall  who has been contacted, there may be 14 species\r\n\r\nof  prawn present in a catch, of which seven  species\r\n\r\nrarely constitute less than 95 per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nAnd this 95 per cent are the Peneids which, according\r\n\r\nto Mr Hall, \"breed offshore and spend their juvenile\r\n\r\ngrowing life feeding in the mangrove swamps or in the\r\n\r\nponds\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now if I may revert to the Minister's letter to\r\n\r\nme,  we  will  find,  Sir, that  his  information  is\r\n\r\nexactly  similar, expressed though it is in different\r\n\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Almost all members of the family known as the\r\n\r\nPeneids breed at sea and the young larval stages  are\r\n\r\nbrought into the mangrove swamps by the tide. As soon\r\n\r\nas they have reached the mangrove swamps or perhaps a\r\n\r\nlittle earlier they settle down on the bottom to feed\r\n\r\nand  grow up. When they have reached a length of from\r\n\r\ntwo  to three inches they have a natural urge to swim\r\n\r\nout  to  sea again, to mature and breed. It is during\r\n\r\nthis stage of their life history that they are caught\r\n\r\nby our prawn cultivators.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this admission that from the young larval\r\n\r\nstages until they reach a length of from two to three\r\n\r\ninches    they    are    living    and    feeding - not\r\n\r\nbreeding - feeding  in  the  mangrove,  how   can   the\r\n\r\nMinister contemplate with equanimity the cutting down\r\n\r\nof  800  acres of it? His own letter to me proves  my\r\n\r\ncase, and not his.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put this all once again in my own words\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  the crux of the whole  problem.  The\r\n\r\nprawns breed out to sea, but how far they travel  and\r\n\r\nwhere  they  breed is not yet known. In  their  early\r\n\r\nlarval stages they come in with the tide, either into\r\n\r\nthe mangrove or into the prawn ponds, where they sink\r\n\r\ninto  the mud and feed and grow and fatten. When they\r\n\r\nhave  reached  a  certain  size - about  two  or  three\r\n\r\ninches - the urge comes to stir themselves  and  to  go\r\n\r\nout  to  sea  again and breed. Those feeding  in  the\r\n\r\nmangrove  swim out to sea without restriction;  those\r\n\r\nthat  have fattened in the ponds cannot get  out  but\r\n\r\nare  caught in the nets at the sluice gates and  find\r\n\r\ntheir way to the market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to follow quite logically, therefore, that\r\n\r\nif  you  reduce  your mangrove to a  small  area  and\r\n\r\nincrease your prawn pond area by the amount by  which\r\n\r\nyou  have reduced your mangrove, too many prawns will\r\n\r\nbe  caught, too few prawns will swim out  to  sea  to\r\n\r\nbreed,  and  the  law  of  diminishing  returns  will\r\n\r\noperate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts proclaimed by the Minister that the prawn\r\n\r\ncatch  in  the  Government  experimental  ponds   has\r\n\r\nincreased in the last three years to one-third  of  a\r\n\r\nton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  acre per annum proves nothing. But if it  proves\r\n\r\nanything at all in the Pandan area, it surely  proves\r\n\r\nthat the mangrove should be left undisturbed, and not\r\n\r\nthe  reverse.  Indeed there is some evidence,  though\r\n\r\nnot  conclusive, that there is already a falling  off\r\n\r\nin  the  prawn catch in the Pandan and Ponggol areas,\r\n\r\nthat these areas, in other words, are being fished to\r\n\r\nthe limit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one further important point to be\r\n\r\nremembered  regarding this Pandan  or  Sungei  Jurong\r\n\r\narea,  and that is this: the 1,370 acres of  mangrove\r\n\r\nof  this Forest Reserve is the only mangrove left  on\r\n\r\nthe  southern shore of the island; if it is cut  down\r\n\r\nto  all  but  370  acres,  there  is  no  alternative\r\n\r\nmangrove in this area at all to which the prawns  can\r\n\r\nturn for the feeding ground.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the prawn population diminishes through the\r\n\r\nstripping  of  the mangrove along the  banks  of  the\r\n\r\nSungei  Jurong, as is intended, the first  people  to\r\n\r\nsuffer hardship will be the poor Malay fishermen who,\r\n\r\nas  you  probably  know, Sir, eke  out  a  precarious\r\n\r\nliving by wading up to their armpits in the mud  with\r\n\r\ntheir  nets  for  a  meagre and fortuitous  catch  of\r\n\r\nprawns  and  other  crustacea,  and  whose  catch - and\r\n\r\ntherefore their living - will be reduced still further,\r\n\r\nand  the co-operative scheme for them will be  of  no\r\n\r\navail.  If that were to happen, the Minister and  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government will have a great deal to  answer\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, there is little or no scientific\r\n\r\nevidence  on the side of the Minister to support  the\r\n\r\naction  he  proposes to take, and one can  only  hope\r\n\r\nthat, having taken the stand that prawn ponds in  the\r\n\r\narea  are to be increased, he will not feel  that  he\r\n\r\ncannot  withdraw from that stand even in the face  of\r\n\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one more quotation, and it is from\r\n\r\nthe  findings of the Malayan Branch of the  Institute\r\n\r\nof Biology:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Not one single member of the Institute who has been\r\n\r\ncontacted  has  given even qualified support  to  the\r\n\r\nproposal for alienating the reserve.

That is certainly  not\r\n\r\nthe  case.  The Nature Reserve Board has pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat there is considerable acreage of tidal swamp  on\r\n\r\nCrown  Land suitable for development around the coast\r\n\r\nof   Singapore.  The  Tuas  area,  for  example,   is\r\n\r\nparticularly  promising, and it might well  be  that,\r\n\r\nafter  experimentation, a considerable area could  be\r\n\r\nopened  up  to  prawn  ponds without  damage  to  the\r\n\r\nnecessary mangrove feeding areas; because on the west\r\n\r\ncoast  there are considerable stretches of  mangrove,\r\n\r\nnot  only  on the Singapore side, but on  the  Johore\r\n\r\nside as well, and it is not straying too far into the\r\n\r\nrealms of conjecture to suggest that the Johore coast\r\n\r\ncan  and  does  provide  the  feeding  grounds  which\r\n\r\nbenefit  Singapore prawn ponds in the Johore  Straits\r\n\r\neven today, and that the feeding grounds utilised are\r\n\r\ntherefore  something like twice the area  at  present\r\n\r\ncalculated.  Certainly  it  is  something   requiring\r\n\r\nfurther research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Commerce and Industry have put\r\n\r\nforward the curious argument that areas such  as  the\r\n\r\nTuas  area  cannot be developed as prawn  pond  areas\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the objections of the fishermen  in  the\r\n\r\narea, whose plight is desperate because of the curfew\r\n\r\nin  the  Johore Straits. Apart from the fact  that  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the restrictions have now been eased,  I\r\n\r\nfail  to see why the fishermen would not welcome  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of their own area through the  enrichment\r\n\r\nof prawns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am not going to say to this House that\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  the Nature Reserve Board  or  of  the\r\n\r\nbiologists   must  be  correct  and  those   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister's   and  his  advisers   are   not.   I   am\r\n\r\nsufficiently imbued with the scientific temper to say\r\n\r\nno  more  than that there are at least two points  of\r\n\r\nview, and that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment should proceed with extreme caution  until\r\n\r\nfurther research has taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what seems to me unfortunate is this: that it\r\n\r\nappears  that the data and the research work  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Fisheries has never been published  or\r\n\r\nrevealed  so that the other experts in Singapore  can\r\n\r\nalso  work  on  it.  The  Department  has  worked  in\r\n\r\nisolation.  Its views may be right - I am  not  denying\r\n\r\nthat-but with so much conflicting opinion they should\r\n\r\nnot   be  accepted  until  they  have  been  expertly\r\n\r\nexamined by other authorities in the same field.  Why\r\n\r\nis it that the Minister has never called together the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Nature Reserve Board and members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Institute  of  Biology  to  discuss  this  whole\r\n\r\nproblem  with the Fisheries Department,  so  that  if\r\n\r\nthere  are conflicting theories, they can be thrashed\r\n\r\nout?  Is this not the proper course even now, instead\r\n\r\nof  the  leap  in  the dark which the  Government  is\r\n\r\nproposing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the Minister never consulted the Department\r\n\r\nof  Zoology at the University, which is there in  our\r\n\r\nmidst  to  give  advice? Is it because  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfears  that  he  will  get the  answer  he  does  not\r\n\r\nwant? - because I come back to the point I made at  the\r\n\r\noutset:  that you can cut down 800 acres of  mangrove\r\n\r\ntrees  in  a short space of time but if your theories\r\n\r\nare proved to be wrong, it will take some 30 years or\r\n\r\nmore to grow them again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I referred to Mr Hall who was with the\r\n\r\nResearch  Station at Changi and who did a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  work  on prawn biology while he was here.  It  is\r\n\r\nbetraying  no secret for me to say that his  treatise\r\n\r\non   the  subject  is  in  the  press  and  due   for\r\n\r\npublication in one of the scientific journals. He may\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  throw  a great deal  of  light  on  the\r\n\r\nimportance  or otherwise of mangroves, on the  effect\r\n\r\nof  the currents round the Singapore coast which must\r\n\r\nhave  some  influence on the breeding areas.  If  the\r\n\r\nmigratory  movements  of  the  prawns  were  properly\r\n\r\nunderstood, it would be much simpler to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformulate    efficient   schemes    for    commercial\r\n\r\nexploitation, and to avoid the error of  killing  the\r\n\r\ngoose  which  lays  the golden  eggs.  Would  it  not\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  wiser to obtain Mr  Hall's  data,  or\r\n\r\nawait  its publication, instead of plunging into  the\r\n\r\nunknown?  As this is a purely scientific problem,  is\r\n\r\nthere  any reason why the Government should not adopt\r\n\r\na scientific approach towards it?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have, I think, said enough to explain why we\r\n\r\nare not happy about this motion. There is still more,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, which I could say. I might mention that\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Board is unanimously opposed to this move,\r\n\r\nhaving heard from one of its own Health Officers that\r\n\r\na  large scale clearing of the mangrove is likely  to\r\n\r\ncreate   breeding   sites  for  the  malaria-carrying\r\n\r\nmosquito called Anopholes sundiacus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might pause to wonder why it is that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Commerce and Industry, and not the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government, Lands and Housing, is  introducing\r\n\r\nthis  motion, as the Nature Reserves come within  the\r\n\r\nlatter's portfolio. I might pause to wonder why it is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Commerce and Industry  is  so\r\n\r\ndesperately  keen  to  press  this  issue   at   this\r\n\r\nparticular time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own belief is this: that if all the experts oil\r\n\r\nthe subject in the country got round one table to  go\r\n\r\ninto  this matter and pool their knowledge - as  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  done  before - it would be found,  firstly,\r\n\r\nthat the area of land alienated for prawn ponds could\r\n\r\nbe  increased beyond the present area; secondly, that\r\n\r\na  sufficient but different area of mangrove could be\r\n\r\nretained  at the Pandan Forest Reserve as  a  feeding\r\n\r\narea  for  prawns and as a self-propagating area  for\r\n\r\nbiological study; and thirdly and finally, the proper\r\n\r\nbalance  of nature could be achieved. That  would  be\r\n\r\nthe  best  possible  results, while  at  present  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may get the worst of both worlds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only conclude by urging the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  in  the  light  of  all  the  present\r\n\r\nevidence,  to have the honesty and courage  to  think\r\n\r\nagain. I do not know whether the Minister will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  fact consider withdrawing his motion but in order\r\n\r\nthat  all Members on both sides of the House  may  be\r\n\r\nable to consider this question more carefully, I wish\r\n\r\nto  move, under Standing Order 20 (1) that the debate\r\n\r\nbe  now adjourned to a later date to be fixed by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am speaking on the second\r\n\r\nmotion,  Sir. First of all, the Minister  is  not  \"a\r\n\r\nsingle man\". The Minister is not expected to be a man\r\n\r\nwith  academic  knowledge of fisheries,  swamp  land,\r\n\r\nmangroves, stunted  mangrove  growths,  centipedes,\r\n\r\nserpents  and  whatever else that grow  in  the  man-groves,  or that live in the mangroves. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  to  rely  on advice from the head of department,\r\n\r\nwho  is  the man who should know his job and what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on.  According to the advice that I  have  got\r\n\r\nfrom  my Chief Fisheries Officer, there is no  danger\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be a diminution in the breeding  of\r\n\r\nprawns because of this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps hon. Members may like to know why there is\r\n\r\nno  such danger, and I will give the answer in brief.\r\n\r\nWith  the  Peneid variety of prawns, the  full  grown\r\n\r\nones  live  out offshore, far out at sea,  more  than\r\n\r\nfive miles away from the coast. When they breed,  the\r\n\r\nlarvae come into the inshore waters. They remain  and\r\n\r\nfeed  in the inshore waters and grow until they reach\r\n\r\n\"young  hood\". That is when the prawn operators  open\r\n\r\ntheir  gates and get them in. But it does not  follow\r\n\r\nthat  the  whole lot of larvae in the inshore  waters\r\n\r\nwill  be  caught by the pond operators. Quite  a  big\r\n\r\nnumber  are not caught because there is the  urge  in\r\n\r\nthese  young  prawns  to swim out  to  sea,  back  to\r\n\r\noffshore waters. Therefore a lot of these prawns  are\r\n\r\nnot caught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This talk of breeding in the inshore areas of\r\n\r\nSingapore - it  has been fished by local fishermen  for\r\n\r\nthe  last  50  years and yet there is no evidence  of\r\n\r\nover-fishing so far. The Peneids are not caught until\r\n\r\nthey  reach  near  maturity and the prawn  ponds  are\r\n\r\nfeeding  grounds so that the prawns will grow faster.\r\n\r\nBut as I said earlier, a good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nportion of the prawns manage to get far out into  the\r\n\r\nsea from the inshore waters, and when they go far out\r\n\r\nto sea they breed again and the larvae come back into\r\n\r\nthe inshore waters to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir,\r\n\r\ncould the Hon. the Minister explain to us what is the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of  his argument that  there  has  been\r\n\r\nfishing  for  50  years without a diminution  in  the\r\n\r\namount of prawns available to be caught, with respect\r\n\r\nto  the  argument that if you cut down the  1,370  by\r\n\r\n1,000 acres there will be a diminution of the area in\r\n\r\nwhich  these  larvae  can grow to  \"youth-hood\" - as  I\r\n\r\nthink it was put by the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I was answering the\r\n\r\nargument  of  the  hon. Member for  Tanglin  when  he\r\n\r\nsuggested that there might be over-fishing, that  is,\r\n\r\ntoo  many of these young prawns may be caught by  the\r\n\r\nprawn  ponds  so  that  there  will  be  insufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers to go out and breed. But that is not so, as I\r\n\r\nhave explained earlier. As regards the area that  may\r\n\r\nbe  cut down reducing breeding area, I think there is\r\n\r\nno  danger  of  that  because  the  prawns  breed  in\r\n\r\noffshore  waters and we have offshore waters  on  all\r\n\r\nsides of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a further point, Sir, as I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  the  larvae come  into  the  inshore\r\n\r\nwaters  and  into the mangrove. There  it  feeds  for\r\n\r\nthree months or so until they are ripe for the catch.\r\n\r\nThen  the  sluice gates are opened,  the  prawns  are\r\n\r\ncaught  and  fed in the ponds and are ready  for  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  The argument of the hon. Member for Tanglin,\r\n\r\nwhich should carry considerable weight if it is true,\r\n\r\nis that if you cut down the feeding area, which is at\r\n\r\npresent 1,370 acres, by 1,000 acres (although in fact\r\n\r\nit  has  already been cut down by 200 acres, so  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  another 800 acres to be  cut  off),  then\r\n\r\nthere  will  not be sufficient space in the  mangrove\r\n\r\nfor the larvae to feed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

What   will\r\n\r\ninfluence  our vote as to whether this debate  should\r\n\r\nbe adjourned or not is the usefulness of having these\r\n\r\nextra  800  acres  as  a natural  reserve.  From  the\r\n\r\nanswers  which the Minister has given to  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar, it seems that  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nhimself  in considerable doubt as to what the  answer\r\n\r\nought  to  be.  We want to know definitely  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  before  we  cast our vote  whether  he  has\r\n\r\nconsidered this question from all the scientific  and\r\n\r\nbiological  information from the experts who  are  on\r\n\r\nhand and whose opinions have been given by my learned\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Tanglin. Unless we have the\r\n\r\nMinister's assurance that he has fully considered  it\r\n\r\nand  is  prepared  to demolish 1,000  acres  of  land\r\n\r\ndedicated for the last 100 years in 10 minutes or  20\r\n\r\nminutes debate, then I am sure we are unable to  cast\r\n\r\nour votes even on the motion for adjournment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Is it not  possible\r\n\r\nthat  for a consideration of a small amount of prawns\r\n\r\nthat may be caught during that time, we could adjourn\r\n\r\nthis  debate and think carefully on the pros and cons\r\n\r\nof  this  subject? I think there should  be  no  loss\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, but if the Government, after hearing  all\r\n\r\nthis  argument, would still want to use its Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers to bulldoze this issue through, then I think-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I think anybody wise enough should\r\n\r\naccept  the  motion, because, if  the  evidence  does\r\n\r\npoint  out  that it is harmful to do  away  with  the\r\n\r\nnature  reserve, we would not have done away with  it\r\n\r\nyet;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  if the evidence shows that it will be profitable\r\n\r\nto  carry on making the whole area into prawn  ponds,\r\n\r\nthen  it  will not be late, even though it  may  take\r\n\r\nplace a month or two later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I understand\r\n\r\nthe  mover  of  this motion - or emotion - correctly,  he\r\n\r\nessentially  seeks  to get more expert  advice  on  a\r\n\r\nmatter  on which expert advice has of course  already\r\n\r\nbeen  given. It is not a matter on which I  can  give\r\n\r\nexpert    advice,   except   some    experience    in\r\n\r\nadministration: but the more experts  you  have,  the\r\n\r\nmore  differing opinions you will get. I do not think\r\n\r\nit  will  be helpful, after the Ministry has  made  a\r\n\r\nthorough  study and come forward with a proposal,  to\r\n\r\nthrow  it  all  back  for a lot of  further  ex-parte\r\n\r\nexpert   advice.  I  cannot  help  recollecting   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of floods and water storage in  which  the\r\n\r\nCity Water Engineer put up an expert scheme first and\r\n\r\nthen  my  drainage adviser put up another scheme  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they  were in conflict we had a special  expert\r\n\r\nout from the United Kingdom to put up a third scheme.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile  the Water Engineer was changed, and  there\r\n\r\nwas a fourth scheme. That was the result of going  to\r\n\r\ntoo  many experts.

I have to protest because we only  received\r\n\r\nthis motion less than a week ago on a matter of vital\r\n\r\nimportance to Singapore, in the respect that  we  are\r\n\r\nchanging a dedicated area of this country in so short\r\n\r\na  time  and  after  my learned  Friend  has  brought\r\n\r\nforward considerable evidence and scientific data  to\r\n\r\nraise  doubt  even in the mind of the leader  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party. It  is  a  very  inopportune\r\n\r\nmoment for us to resist this motion at a moment  when\r\n\r\nelections   to   the  City  Council   are   imminent.\r\n\r\nUnscrupulous politicians-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I for  one\r\n\r\nand  my  Party have always advocated more work,  more\r\n\r\nfood,  and  if  we are certain that cutting  down  of\r\n\r\n1,000  acres  would improve the prawn  feed  and  the\r\n\r\nprawn  population,  I say cut down  10,000  acres  or\r\n\r\nwhatever you have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not clear and it has not been proved, and\r\n\r\nwe  will not accept the word of just one expert  when\r\n\r\nthe scientific data are against it. Sir, if this goes\r\n\r\non,  why  not  cut down the Botanic Gardens  too  and\r\n\r\nplant tapioca or whatever you like? There must  be  a\r\n\r\ncertain balance and careful deliberation and thinking\r\n\r\nbefore measures like this are forced through within a\r\n\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, I think there is one point\r\n\r\non   which   the   Opposition  is  being   a   little\r\n\r\nunrealistic - the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassumption  that  if this is not done  now,  it  will\r\n\r\nnever  be  done.  If  we  look  at  the  increase  in\r\n\r\npopulation  of  Singapore,  it  makes  it  absolutely\r\n\r\ncertain that if things go on as they are, in the  end\r\n\r\neven the Botanic Gardens will have to go, unless  you\r\n\r\nput  guards  around them and fence them  with  double\r\n\r\nreinforced concrete and all the rest of it; for there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  space on the island which can  be  left\r\n\r\nvacant  if we go on breeding at the present rate.  It\r\n\r\nis  a matter of ten, fifteen or twenty years. We have\r\n\r\nalready  got six to seven thousand people per  square\r\n\r\nmile  of  the  island and it is impossible  that  you\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to preserve any space  that  is  not\r\n\r\nfully developed and put to the maximum economic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try to preserve this area as a sanctuary for\r\n\r\nprawns or crustacea or snakes or any other flora  and\r\n\r\nfauna -  I  have the greatest sympathy with those  who\r\n\r\ncare  for  them  and  find  educational  benefits  in\r\n\r\nthem - nevertheless  they will go  quite  soon.  People\r\n\r\nwill  start  cutting the mangrove for  firewood;  you\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to stop them; they will be in there\r\n\r\nin  every  possible way and you will be  rooting  out\r\n\r\nsquatters  from the area. It is illusory  to  imagine\r\n\r\nthat  with the population pressure of Singapore, this\r\n\r\nsort of area can be preserved in perpetuity. The most\r\n\r\nyou  can  do  is  to delay it for  a  while  but  its\r\n\r\ndevelopment is inevitable in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour\r\n\r\nFront   never   liked   experts - the   Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works said that. But I  find  that\r\n\r\nit  imports one expert after another one for  water,\r\n\r\none  for transport, one for local government, and one\r\n\r\nfor  every other thing it can think of. But  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter  it  will say, \"No, it does not like experts.\"\r\n\r\nIt  is  one  of  the  funniest things  to  apply  the\r\n\r\nargument only when it suits the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point I would like clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nOut  of those 2,000 acres of mangrove swamp you would\r\n\r\nwant  to cut down 1,300, leaving only a small acreage\r\n\r\nas  a  nature reserve. If we do really want  to  have\r\n\r\nthat place developed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas prawn ponds, then why not cut down everything? Why\r\n\r\nleave  that  little  bit?  If  it  is  not  going  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards the breeding of prawns,  then  by\r\n\r\nall  means  take  off the whole area;  do  not  leave\r\n\r\nanything.  Why leave a little bit here and  a  little\r\n\r\nbit there serving no useful purpose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we come to a case in which, as the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications and Works said,  people\r\n\r\nwill  chop down the trees as firewood, and when  only\r\n\r\nsuch a small area is left, I definitely think that it\r\n\r\nwill  vanish in no time. So again this is a  case  in\r\n\r\nwhich Government is doing things half-heartedly. Does\r\n\r\nit think that that little area will be good enough as\r\n\r\na  nature  reserve?  Or does it think  that  it  will\r\n\r\nproduce  more  prawns?  Whichever  way  it  is,   the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the Government this\r\n\r\nmatter  of  food production. Here we have the  Pandan\r\n\r\nNature  Reserve,  but elsewhere around  Singapore  we\r\n\r\nhave many more areas of mangrove. Does the Government\r\n\r\nencourage prawn fishing in those areas? Does it  give\r\n\r\nlicences freely? In some cases it would say  that  it\r\n\r\nis   looking  after  the  interests  of   the   Malay\r\n\r\nfishermen;  in  this  case it is going  to  over-rule\r\n\r\nthem.  In some instances Government would go  out  of\r\n\r\nits  way  to  consult  the  fishermen.  I  am  asking\r\n\r\nGovernment  whether it has done so in this  case.  If\r\n\r\nnot, why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on a matter of food production, in Singapore\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  just produce in the swamps. I think  the\r\n\r\nHon, the Minister for Commerce and Industry is  also\r\n\r\nconcerned   with   agriculture.  Just   look   around\r\n\r\nSingapore and note the various areas where  there  is\r\n\r\nwaste land. What has he done about such land? Has  he\r\n\r\nconverted  it  into  useful food-producing  areas?  I\r\n\r\nwould like an answer to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I would say that, in conflict with\r\n\r\nanother    Department   of   Government - the    Health\r\n\r\nDepartment - the Government has not seen fit to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow  Kallang basin to be developed for the purposes\r\n\r\nof prawn fishing - Kallang basin, not fit for building,\r\n\r\nnot  fit  for  any other purpose, yet the  Government\r\n\r\nwill   not   issue   licences  because   the   health\r\n\r\nauthorities say no. Now in this instance again,  what\r\n\r\nis  the view of the Health Department? Has Government\r\n\r\nconsidered it? If not, why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard very interesting quotations right at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning of this debate. Many people can  quote\r\n\r\nScripture  but many people can also get  their  facts\r\n\r\nwrong.  Devils  can  also quote  Scripture  and  also\r\n\r\ndevils  can  get  their facts wrong. Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nnation. We do not have a representative at the United\r\n\r\nNations   Organisation.   Singapore   has   a   thick\r\n\r\npopulation.  Yes, it is very thick because  it  is  a\r\n\r\nCity  and I do not see how all these things can  help\r\n\r\nthe  debate when it just concerns a few hundred acres\r\n\r\nwhere we can catch prawns. I would ask Government  to\r\n\r\nthink of better ways of increasing food production by\r\n\r\ndeep-sea  fishing. I think Government has  been  most\r\n\r\nobstructive  in the matter of encouragement  of  food\r\n\r\nproduction when it first refused to allow freely deep-sea  fishing-boats to be licensed to go out. And here\r\n\r\nit  is squabbling over some little bit of swamp land,\r\n\r\nand even that half-heartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a great pity\r\n\r\nthat  in  a  debate such as this we do  not  have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  first of hearing the Hon.  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry in reply. I quite realise  what\r\n\r\nthe  situation is. But obviously he held back a great\r\n\r\ndeal of his fire and so we have not heard what he has\r\n\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime we have heard the most cogent\r\n\r\narguments put up by the hon. Member for Tanglin.  Now\r\n\r\nI would like to say, with reference to remarks passed\r\n\r\nby  the  hon.  Member  for Paya Lebar  and  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications  and  Works,   that   I\r\n\r\npersonally  am not in the slightest degree interested\r\n\r\nin  the  preservation of a Nature Reserve as such.  I\r\n\r\nthink the very fact that there are in Singapore large\r\n\r\nareas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder mangrove is a little bit out of place in  this\r\n\r\nage.  What  I  want  to hear from  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce   and   Industry  in  reply  is   scientific\r\n\r\nrefutation of the arguments put forward by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin, that the destruction of the mangroves is\r\n\r\ngoing to lead to lesser breeding of the prawns.  That\r\n\r\nseems to me the only argument of any substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we voted\r\n\r\nagainst  the motion proposed by the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  because he sounded like a Catholic on  birth\r\n\r\ncontrol.  They come to you and they say,  \"Well,  you\r\n\r\nknow it has really nothing to do with Catholicism; it\r\n\r\nhas  to  do with the nervous system of the woman  and\r\n\r\nthe  man and everybody else. But do not vote for  the\r\n\r\nF.P.A.\"  Sir, I was very interested to hear from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin that there were peculiar  plants,\r\n\r\nand  insects, the flora and fauna, in these  mangrove\r\n\r\nswamps which may be of some benefit to those who have\r\n\r\nthe  leisure to go and take pictures at long distance\r\n\r\nof  birds  and bees and snakes and prawns  and  other\r\n\r\nthings. But it seems to me completely unrealistic  to\r\n\r\ntalk   about  nature  reserves  in  the   island   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. If you want to talk of nature reserves  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation - like King George VI Park - then  I  say\r\n\r\nthere  is some sense of proportion; but if you  think\r\n\r\nnature can be saved from the teeming population,  and\r\n\r\nmangrove  swamps  at that, saved  for  some  doubtful\r\n\r\nbenefit, I think it is completely and utterly mad.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was sorry that the Minister did not have at\r\n\r\nhis  finger-tips the data with which to  destroy  the\r\n\r\narguments  put forward by the Member for  Tanglin - not\r\n\r\nthe  argument which he really believed  in,  but  the\r\n\r\nargument  he put forward to preserve his main  point,\r\n\r\nnamely, that it should be a nature reserve. Now, very\r\n\r\nsimply,  it  is  this:  if  there  is  the  slightest\r\n\r\npossibility of the total prawn population going  down\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of  mangroves disappearing  and  ponds\r\n\r\nappearing, then I say it should be stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is no danger of this happening if the\r\n\r\nscheme is put into operation in several phases. If we\r\n\r\ndo not have the 800 acres suddenly cut down and ponds\r\n\r\nappearing, but it is done in phases, we can  see  the\r\n\r\nway the prawn population is going - whether it is dying\r\n\r\noff, like the aborigines in Australia, or whether  it\r\n\r\nis multiplying, like the Negroes in America. It is on\r\n\r\nthat  basis that the Government is going to  use  its\r\n\r\ncommon  sense and put the scheme through  in  several\r\n\r\nphases to make sure that the scientific calculations,\r\n\r\nor  the calculations of the scientific experts quoted\r\n\r\nby the Member for Tanglin, are not proved correct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as we can make out, if we already have 200\r\n\r\nacres  of  the  1,000 acres you want  set  aside  for\r\n\r\nprawns,  in  fact fish ponds, then  do  it  in  three\r\n\r\nphases, and as you finish each phase you can see  the\r\n\r\n\"state of the nation\" as far as prawns are concerned,\r\n\r\nand  go on with it if prawns keep on multiplying. And\r\n\r\nit   is  on  that  basis  that  we  objected  to  the\r\n\r\nadjournment,  particularly when the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon suggested three months. This is one of  the\r\n\r\nelection  issues which is bound to  crop  up  in  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.  We, the P.A.P., are not interested;  we  are\r\n\r\njust spectators there, but the Liberal-Socialists are\r\n\r\nnot just mere spectators. But I would say this, it is\r\n\r\nvery  close to the City area. The moment I receive  a\r\n\r\nletter  which contains all the arguments put  forward\r\n\r\nby the Member for Tanglin, signed by a person who has\r\n\r\nlarge  acres of fish or prawn ponds in that  area,  I\r\n\r\nview  the matter with some pardonable suspicion. When\r\n\r\nI  find a big owner of fish ponds putting forward all\r\n\r\nthe  biological and zoological reasons why this thing\r\n\r\nshould  not be turned into ponds, I think the  matter\r\n\r\nshould be pursued with even greater vigour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I think it is quite clear from the arguments\r\n\r\nwe  have heard from both sides that all agree that it\r\n\r\nis  the  duty  of  Government  wherever  possible  to\r\n\r\nincrease  food  production,  particularly,  when  one\r\n\r\nlooks at the reports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the statistics which show that the population  is\r\n\r\nfast  growing. Now prawns are very expensive  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket  and  everything that can be done to  increase\r\n\r\nprawn  production  of  course  should  be  supported.\r\n\r\nTherefore  on balance food production comes  foremost\r\n\r\nagainst  Nature  Reserve. The biological,  zoological\r\n\r\nand other \"ological\" reasons do not move me one bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly concerned with the ability to\r\n\r\nincrease food production, and the only argument  that\r\n\r\nwas  advanced by the hon. Member for Tanglin, on  the\r\n\r\nimportant question raised by Mr Sutherland,  whether\r\n\r\nthe  cutting down of the mangroves is going to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  prawn population, the only argument advanced  by\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Tanglin  seems  to  me  absolutely\r\n\r\ncontradictory.  He  says in one  breath - and  I  speak\r\n\r\nsubject  to correction, I may have heard wrongly - that\r\n\r\nby  destroying  and  demolishing mangroves,  you  are\r\n\r\ndemolishing  and doing away with the food  which  the\r\n\r\nprawns  require  in order to grow  up.  In  the  next\r\n\r\nbreath he says, quoting from another expert, that the\r\n\r\nprawns,  the larvae, go into the mangrove swamps  and\r\n\r\nbury  themselves into the mud for a period until they\r\n\r\ngrow in size to two or three inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir. The\r\n\r\nbiological  problem is simply this:  prawns  feed  in\r\n\r\nmud,  mangroves  or  ponds; when they  are  ready  to\r\n\r\nbreed, they leave the mud, mangroves or ponds for the\r\n\r\nsea.  If  too high a proportion of an area  is  pond,\r\n\r\nthen  too high a proportion of prawns is trapped  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  not enough left to go out to sea  and  to\r\n\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That is still contradictory, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  cannot  see  how the  demolition  of  the\r\n\r\nmangroves themselves as mangroves is going to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  food  for  prawns.  These  larvae  feed  on  the\r\n\r\nmolecules  that  are  in the  mud,  and  whether  the\r\n\r\nmangroves are there or not they still have their food\r\n\r\nin  the mud for a certain period. That is how  I  see\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I cannot support any argument which says\r\n\r\nwe must preserve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmangroves,  for  botanical reasons or for  zoological\r\n\r\nreasons  or  for biological reasons,  and  also  that\r\n\r\nmangrove  is  food  for the prawns. Someone  remarked\r\n\r\nabout the Botanic Gardens. The Botanic Gardens, as  I\r\n\r\nsee it, is a place which is particularly set aside to\r\n\r\ngrow  and  preserve such flora as are found in  one's\r\n\r\ncountry in a particular site, and anybody who  wishes\r\n\r\nto study that flora can go there at their leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those grounds, Sir, I am not satisfied with any\r\n\r\nargument advanced by the Member for Tanglin  that  by\r\n\r\ndestroying the mangrove we are going to do away  with\r\n\r\nprawn  food  and  thus reduce the population  of  the\r\n\r\nprawns.  As  no  argument has been  advanced  I  must\r\n\r\naccept the expert advice of the Fisheries Officer  on\r\n\r\nthis question, and I support this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

It  was\r\n\r\nbecause  I was holding my guns for the reply  to  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the original Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must assure this House specifically that all\r\n\r\nthese arguments which the hon. Member for Tanglin has\r\n\r\nput  up  have already been put up to the Ministry  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of  the  Nature  Reserve  Board,  with\r\n\r\nsupporting evidence as put forward by the Member from\r\n\r\nthe  various  other  professors and  people  of  high\r\n\r\nacademic   qualifications,   and   they   have   been\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Ministry. The Ministry feels  that,\r\n\r\nas far as fisheries is concerned, it is its Fisheries\r\n\r\nOfficer who is best qualified to speak on the subject\r\n\r\nand  who should know his job. If the House feels that\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of the Fisheries Officer is wrong,  then\r\n\r\nthe House can vote against the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, the Member for Tanglin ended his\r\n\r\nlong  academic speech with the remark that he  paused\r\n\r\nto  wonder why the Minister was so keen to press this\r\n\r\nissue.  Sir,  I  can  assure the House  there  is  no\r\n\r\nsinister motive behind my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressure to get this motion passed. It is the job  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Commerce and Industry, besides  his\r\n\r\nvarious  other jobs of expanding industry,  commerce,\r\n\r\nagriculture, veterinary services, keeping an  eye  on\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  exchange and what not,  to  expand  the\r\n\r\neconomy of the country, and if he does not carry  out\r\n\r\nthat job, then he is not an efficient Minister.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was not so very long ago that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin,  speaking  in  the  debate   in\r\n\r\nCommittee stage on the Appropriation Bill last  year,\r\n\r\nmade this remark:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...I have no doubt that, through more research, it\r\n\r\nshould  be  possible to increase the yield of  prawns\r\n\r\nper acre; thus increasing the return to the fishermen\r\n\r\nand, at the same time, reducing the market price.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And, Sir, he went on to advocate that there should be\r\n\r\nmore prawn ponds and so on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the hon. Member for Serangoon, the leader\r\n\r\nof the Liberal-Socialist Party, had this to say:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Land must be granted by the Land Office and then\r\n\r\nsanctioned  for fishing by the Fisheries  Department.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as I know, a great deal of our marshland  is\r\n\r\nstill not being made use of, and most of such land is\r\n\r\nbeing given under Temporary Occupation Licences...\" .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he went on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the marshland is brackish in nature, very\r\n\r\nlittle will grow there except mangroves, and I  think\r\n\r\nthat   the  department  concerned  should  reconsider\r\n\r\ngranting  such land for purposes of fishing  as  this\r\n\r\nhas  been  considered as most important  by  so  many\r\n\r\nMembers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, like a true democratic Minister I took\r\n\r\nheed  of what the Opposition Members remarked  and  I\r\n\r\ngoverned  myself accordingly and tried to  find  land\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of growing more food. And now  I  am\r\n\r\nunder  censure for trying to carry out what they  had\r\n\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back, Sir, to the first argument of the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin that it is against the very nature\r\n\r\nof  the  Nature  Reserves Ordinance to  move  such  a\r\n\r\nmotion,  it  is remarked that the words  \"dedicated\",\r\n\r\n\"set  aside and reserved for purposes of propagation,\r\n\r\nprotection . . .\". etc, have been used in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection 3 (1). But I hasten to point out that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot dedicated in perpetuity. There is also provision,\r\n\r\nSir, in the same Ordinance; under section 4 (1), \"the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  may by  resolution  amend  the\r\n\r\nSchedule to this Ordinance by either the addition  to\r\n\r\nor deletion from the said Schedule of any area or may\r\n\r\nmake any modification\" and so on. That shows that the\r\n\r\nintention  was not that this area should be  a  final\r\n\r\ndedication  in  perpetuity, but that  this  area  was\r\n\r\nreserved and that the Assembly, which is the  highest\r\n\r\nauthority in this country, should have the  power  to\r\n\r\nmake  any  amendments to it if it  wished.  Evidently\r\n\r\nwhat  was  in mind is that circumstances  may  change\r\n\r\nwhen  we  cannot  afford the luxury  of  having  such\r\n\r\nreserves.   And  in  accordance  with  the  machinery\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Ordinance, I am bringing the  matter\r\n\r\nup to this House for the decision of hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, talking of experts; you always have two\r\n\r\nopinions  on  any  subject.  You  have  the  Liberal-Socialist  opinion, you have the P.A.P. opinion,  and\r\n\r\nyou  have the Labour Front opinion which in this case\r\n\r\nis  coincidental  with  the P.A.P.'s.  You  have  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  one  expert, you  have  the  opinion  of\r\n\r\nanother,  but  somebody has got to  decide  which  to\r\n\r\nfollow,   and   that  somebody,  according   to   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  set  up,  is  the  layman,  because   the\r\n\r\nMinisters  are not experts in the field. You  do  not\r\n\r\nhave a doctor as a Minister for Health. Therefore  it\r\n\r\nis  the  layman who decides. He does not decide  only\r\n\r\nfrom one angle, and that is the technical angle,  but\r\n\r\nhe  decides from the common man's angle, and that is:\r\n\r\nwhat is most important and good for the country.  And\r\n\r\nbasing my decision on that, I - being in the position\r\n\r\nto  make the decision - now have brought it up to the\r\n\r\nHouse  because  I feel that it is important  that  as\r\n\r\nmuch  area as possible is opened up to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for food production. It is  now  a  matter\r\n\r\nthat  rests  with this House, for Members to  decide,\r\n\r\nand  all  Members in this House are  laymen  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a lot has been said about the Nature\r\n\r\nReserve Board saying this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the Nature Reserve Board saying that. The Nature\r\n\r\nReserve  Board is not an expert body. Except for  one\r\n\r\nor two persons on the Board, and that is the Director\r\n\r\nof  Botanic  Gardens and the Professor of  Botany  (I\r\n\r\nthink) of the University, the rest of the members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Nature  Reserve Board are laymen. And  therefore\r\n\r\nwhen  the  hon. Member says the Nature Reserve  Board\r\n\r\nsays  this, what he really means is what the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Nature Reserve Board says. The rest  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  are laymen, just like you and me,  and  they\r\n\r\ncannot express a technical opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that Sir Stamford Raffles, when he\r\n\r\nfounded Singapore, did not see the paramount need  of\r\n\r\npreserving the flora and the fauna of the island  but\r\n\r\nopened  up the island to commerce. If he had seen  it\r\n\r\nhe  would  probably have kept the whole island  as  a\r\n\r\nnature  reserve, in which case of course  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  and his colleagues would  not  be  here\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also said, 'Don't you want to\r\n\r\npreserve this Reserve for our University students  to\r\n\r\nstudy   and  produce  Directors  of  Raffles  Museum.\r\n\r\nProfessors  of  Biology,  and  Directors  of  Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens,  and Fisheries Officers, and so  on?'  These\r\n\r\nnature reserves have existed since the time Singapore\r\n\r\ncame  into  being.  Whether they  were  dedicated  by\r\n\r\nOrdinance or not, they were there. How many Directors\r\n\r\nof   Botanic  Gardens  have  we  produced?  How  many\r\n\r\nDirectors of Raffles Museum have we produced from our\r\n\r\nlocal boys? None. Why not? Luckily today we have one,\r\n\r\na  local  officer,  who  is Chief  Fisheries  Officer\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got to take the advice of my expert, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  Chief Fisheries Officer,  on  subjects\r\n\r\nconnected  with fisheries and prawns, as against  the\r\n\r\nadvice of the Nature Reserve Board. But this I  think\r\n\r\nwill  help to convince hon. Members that not all  the\r\n\r\narguments   put   up  are  absolutely   correct   and\r\n\r\nunchallenged. Here is a letter from the  Director  of\r\n\r\nFisheries, Malaya, in which he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I have spoken with Messrs. G. C. Maddock, F. G. H.\r\n\r\nAllen and Dr B. D.

I also understand there are  no\r\n\r\nrare   botanical  specimens.  It  has   no   specific\r\n\r\nattributes and is in no way unique...\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking of this Ulu Pandan Reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir - and this is the expert opinion\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Fisheries Officer:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The prawns which are of commercial value found in\r\n\r\nthe  Ulu  Pandan  prawn ponds belong  to  the  family\r\n\r\nPeneids  and  are known as Peneids to scientists.  No\r\n\r\nconclusive  research work on the breeding of  Peneids\r\n\r\nin  Malayan waters has been carried out. The  present\r\n\r\nstate of knowledge based on the research work done in\r\n\r\nthe  United States of America and elsewhere  on  this\r\n\r\ngroup of prawns indicates that they breed fairly  far\r\n\r\nout  to sea in clear water. A review of this work  by\r\n\r\nthree  U.S.A. experts  on  prawns,  namely,  W.   N.\r\n\r\nAnderson, J. E. King and M. J. Linder, may  be  found\r\n\r\nin the Biological Bulletin of 1949, and this work has\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted by biologists all over  the  world  as\r\n\r\naccurately representing the position, so that we  may\r\n\r\nuntil   such  time  as  proof  to  the  contrary   is\r\n\r\navailable, assume that our Peneid prawns spawn fairly\r\n\r\nfar  out  to  sea  and that their larval  stages  are\r\n\r\nbrought  into  the  ponds by the tide  from  spawning\r\n\r\ngrounds  which may be ten miles or more from the  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan area. These larval stages then grow up in  the\r\n\r\nponds until they are large enough to spawn. They then\r\n\r\nmigrate  back to the sea. It is during this migration\r\n\r\nthat the prawns are caught by the filter nets of  the\r\n\r\nprawn pond operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a sufficient number of prawns will always go out\r\n\r\nto  sea  for breeding, and the prawn ponds can  never\r\n\r\ncatch the whole lot that is growing up in the inshore\r\n\r\nwaters, and that is the reply to the argument of  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he (the Member for Tanglin) has quoted an\r\n\r\nexpert  who  actually  is a carsinologist.  The  term\r\n\r\ndenotes  a person who is expert in the classification\r\n\r\nof  crustaceans, which includes crabs, prawns  and  a\r\n\r\nhost  of  other  shrimp-like animals, into  families,\r\n\r\ngenera   and  species.  A  carsinologist   need   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily   be   an  expert  on  the   biology   of\r\n\r\ncrustaceans   such  as  prawns.  Sir,   indeed   many\r\n\r\ncarsinologists  are not biologists  in  the  accepted\r\n\r\nsense   of  the  word  and  therefore  do  not   know\r\n\r\nsufficient of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  biology  of prawns or crabs to  offer  expert\r\n\r\nopinion   on   whether  or   not   the   continued\r\n\r\nproductivity of the Ulu Pandan prawn ponds depends\r\n\r\non the utilisation of this Nature Reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there you have an expert speaking out his\r\n\r\nmind.  I do not know whether hon. Members wish  to\r\n\r\naccept it or not but the fact is that cutting down\r\n\r\nthese  800  acres  is  not  going  to  affect  the\r\n\r\nbreeding of the prawns.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot of other arguments, Sir, on points\r\n\r\nwhich  I  could  answer but I think  the  time  is\r\n\r\nrunning short. There is one other thing, Sir;  the\r\n\r\nimportant  question  of Malay fishermen  has  been\r\n\r\nraised  and  I assured the House earlier  that  we\r\n\r\nwould try to form them into a co-operative so that\r\n\r\nthey  will not be the losers because of this,  and\r\n\r\nwe  will guarantee them a quarter of the area,  to\r\n\r\nbe  run by the co-operative. Now let me give  some\r\n\r\nfigures   on   the   economics   of   pond   prawn\r\n\r\ncultivation.  Supposing there are  200  Malays  in\r\n\r\nthis  area now and their catch value is an average\r\n\r\nof  $5  per  day  per family, their cash  earnings\r\n\r\nprobably  come  to only about $1,000  a  month  or\r\n\r\n$12,000  a year because not all sell their  catch.\r\n\r\nIf  you  have 200 acres, at the Fisheries rate  of\r\n\r\nproduction,  that is 5 piculs and 70  katties  per\r\n\r\nyear  per acre, you get $114,000 per year  if  you\r\n\r\nsell  your prawns at $1 a katty. So now  you  have 200 Malays earning about $12,000 a year; if  they\r\n\r\nco-operate  and join this scheme, and develop  200\r\n\r\nacres, they could stand to gain $114,000 per  year\r\n\r\nif  the  production is at the maximum rate of  the\r\n\r\nFisheries Department. But if the production is  at\r\n\r\nthe minimum rate, as alleged by the Nature Reserve\r\n\r\nBoard,  and that is 200 katties per year, even  at\r\n\r\nthat rate, they could still get $40,000 a year. So\r\n\r\nthey will not be the losers by this. And of course\r\n\r\nyou  get a vast increase in the quantity of prawns\r\n\r\nin  our  markets,  and  that  means  a  relief  to\r\n\r\nhousewives, who could get their prawns cheaper and\r\n\r\nmore readily whenever they want.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other mangroves, wherever it is possible\r\n\r\nGovernment has encouraged prawn ponds.

It seemed so eminently\r\n\r\nreasonable, and so eminently correct,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  I  did  not put it down in the  form  of  a\r\n\r\nmotion.  However, I was wrong. I understand  that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  is  not  very  keen  on  having\r\n\r\npolitical Parties speaking over the radio. I have\r\n\r\ntherefore today tabled a motion on which  a  vote\r\n\r\nwill be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see any reason why we should be afraid\r\n\r\nto use this very powerful weapon of disseminating\r\n\r\ninformation  in  a  very  peaceful  and   orderly\r\n\r\nmanner,  and why this channel should not be  open\r\n\r\nto  political Parties. I have been brought up  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that the theory of the democratic  system\r\n\r\nis  that  competing political  Parties  put  over\r\n\r\ntheir   views   and  their  programmes   to   the\r\n\r\nelectorate,  and every member of that  electorate\r\n\r\nis  given  an  opportunity - by  secret  ballot  to\r\n\r\nindicate his choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways of putting over one's\r\n\r\nprogramme        and       one's        political\r\n\r\nphilosophy-newspapers owned by  big  combines  or\r\n\r\nwealthy proprietors, mass meetings-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If  my  suggestion  is\r\n\r\nfavourably received, then I see no reason why  we\r\n\r\nshould  waste  the time of the House  by  further\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Sir, there are many\r\n\r\nways  of  putting over one's political points  of\r\n\r\nview.   We  depend  upon  the  courtesy  of   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  and  some  of  them  are  not   very\r\n\r\ncourteous. They go of their way not to  tell  the\r\n\r\npublic  that you are holding an election  meeting\r\n\r\nbecause they do not happen to like your political\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey black out one party's meeting, they boost up\r\n\r\nanother's.  When one party has a big  crowd  they\r\n\r\nsay it has a small gathering. If the Parties they\r\n\r\nfavour  have  a small crowd they do  not  show  a\r\n\r\npicture  of the crowd. There are many other  ways\r\n\r\nof manipulating propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one medium which cannot be\r\n\r\nmanipulated.  If  you  allocate  to  each  Party,\r\n\r\naccording  to the number of candidates contesting\r\n\r\nthe  elections  a certain period of  radio  time,\r\n\r\nthere  can  be  no distortion, there  can  be  no\r\n\r\ndanger of rioting. It is the most reasonable form\r\n\r\nof putting forward one's point of view. There can\r\n\r\nbe  no danger of being booed either. So I do  not\r\n\r\nsee any reason why anybody should be afraid to go\r\n\r\nbefore the microphone to put his party's point of\r\n\r\nview across.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as I have said, it is so eminently\r\n\r\njust  that  I see no purpose being served  by  my\r\n\r\nbringing up argument after argument, and I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know from the Government what  are  its\r\n\r\nreasons  against  giving  political  Parties  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to use this medium which is owned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. It could be done  fairly.  There\r\n\r\nare  certain rules of the game which we  observed\r\n\r\nin  the last general elections. I remember in the\r\n\r\nold  days  when elections were not very  popular,\r\n\r\nbecause  they were not based on a wide franchise,\r\n\r\nevery  piddling little City Council election  was\r\n\r\nallowed   radio  time.  And  now,  at  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant election for the City of Singapore, for\r\n\r\nthe  administration  of the City  Council  for  4\r\n\r\nyears, we are to be denied radio time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It being four o'clock, the Motion for the\r\n\r\nAdjournment   of  the  Assembly  lapsed   without\r\n\r\nQuestion put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.
