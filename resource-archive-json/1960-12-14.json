The\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  his reply, stated that  the  primary\r\n\r\nrole  of  Inspectors  of  Schools  was  to  inspect\r\n\r\nschools in order to advise and assist them.  I  was\r\n\r\nvery  glad to be able to agree wholeheartedly  with\r\n\r\nhim  on  that. Unfortunately, Sir, in the  carrying\r\n\r\nout  of  the policy and in the working out  of  the\r\n\r\ndetails,  things  have  gone  amiss.  I  drew   his\r\n\r\nattention to one main function that has been  added\r\n\r\non, that is, to investigate into complaints sent in\r\n\r\nby  writers of anonymous letters. I felt, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe procedure was wrong, that the anonymous letters\r\n\r\nshould have been put into the wastepaper basket  or\r\n\r\nsent  to  the Ministry of Home Affairs for  further\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  Or if any action was  needed,  such\r\n\r\nletters  should  have been sent  to  the  heads  of\r\n\r\nschools  in  order not to give the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  assumes,  on  the  basis  of  these\r\n\r\ncomplaints, that the heads and the teachers have to\r\n\r\nprove their innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just after the school closed for the\r\n\r\nvacation, a 13-page circular was sent out-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Thirteen - or was it 20?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The first circular was 13\r\n\r\npages.

Certain  relationships  are\r\n\r\ndeveloping  which are not desirable. Those  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  somehow  act as if  they  belong  to  the\r\n\r\nruling  class, and those in the schools  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey belong to the subject working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read out a few extracts to\r\n\r\nillustrate my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`School Tuck-shop Committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Government and aided school which has a\r\n\r\ntuck-shop shall set up a school tuck-shop committee\r\n\r\ncomprising the following:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal of school, Chairman;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of the teachers of the school;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of the hawkers of the school;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an Inspector of Schools from the Ministry of Education;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of students for a secondary or\r\n\r\na full school; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative of either old boys or parents\r\n\r\nor pupils for a primary school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  School Tuck-shop Committee shall meet at least\r\n\r\ntwice a year.

I am just wondering whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  a  matter of general policy  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry which ought to be debated when we come  to\r\n\r\nthe  last amendment. So far the item pinpointed  is\r\n\r\nthe  item in connection with Inspectors of Schools,\r\n\r\nand  they, I take it, perform duties laid  down  by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry. If it is part of their duty merely to\r\n\r\nsend a notice of this nature to headmasters, then I\r\n\r\nsuppose  they are just carrying out the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. So that perhaps we are getting  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the motion before the House, and that is,  an\r\n\r\namendment in connection with Inspectors of  Schools\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, my point here is that if\r\n\r\nInspectors of Schools have to be involved in  these\r\n\r\nduties,  they will not be able to carry  out  their\r\n\r\nduties as Inspectors of Schools.

In that event, I suppose the\r\n\r\nhon. Member has made his point. But if he goes into\r\n\r\ndetail  about  what a headmaster has  to  do  about\r\n\r\ntuckshops,  then  I think perhaps  he  is  going  a\r\n\r\nlittle further and dealing with the policy of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry in connection with tuckshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I would like to prove here\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  procedure adopted by  Inspectors  of\r\n\r\nSchools  towards  teachers  and  principals,  their\r\n\r\napproach is wrong. It is pertinent to the duties of\r\n\r\nInspectors  of  Schools,  not  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry, I think, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the Member then alleging\r\n\r\nthat  the  contents of that circular in  regard  to\r\n\r\ntuckshops  were  prepared  by  the  Inspectors   of\r\n\r\nSchools,  as  part of their duties,  and  that  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of the circular have not had the  general\r\n\r\napproval  of the Ministry, and, therefore,  do  not\r\n\r\nrepresent the policy of the Ministry? Is  that  the\r\n\r\nallegation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I do not think that the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  aware that the approach and  all  the\r\n\r\ninstructions  are  going  against  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\npolicy, and that if they were carried out, then the\r\n\r\nInspectors  of  Schools could not carry  out  their\r\n\r\nproper  duties  as Inspectors of  Schools  if  they\r\n\r\nbecome inspectors of tuckshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the Minister will be\r\n\r\nable  to  assist  us  on this  point;  whether  the\r\n\r\ncontents of this circular about tuckshops represent\r\n\r\nMinisterial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard\r\n\r\nto  the alleged circular, I am glad the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin has since corrected his statement. I  think\r\n\r\nlast  evening  he  said it was a 20-page  circular.\r\n\r\nThis  afternoon he has corrected his statement  and\r\n\r\nsaid  that it was a 13-page circular. This circular\r\n\r\nwas issued with my approval. In fact, soon after we\r\n\r\ncame into office, it was important-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is exactly what I wish\r\n\r\nto know. I think it is now quite clear that that is\r\n\r\nthe   general  policy  of  the  Government  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education.  Therefore,  I  think,  in\r\n\r\nfairness  to  the other Members who  have  in  fact\r\n\r\ngiven notice of amendments, this matter of the \r\n\r\ntuckshop  ought  to be discussed when we  come  to  the\r\n\r\nfinal  amendment. It is, of course, a  question  of\r\n\r\ntime  available, and I am trying to be fair to  the\r\n\r\nother Members who have given notices of amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, then I will proceed to the\r\n\r\nother  answers  given  by  the  Minister.  He  says\r\n\r\napplicants  for the 20 posts are available  but  it\r\n\r\ntakes  time  to get them approved. We have  noticed\r\n\r\nthat there seems to be more red-tape developing  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  and  it is more  difficult  to  get\r\n\r\napproval  for appointments of teachers  and  clerks\r\n\r\nthan previously. I do not know where the fault  is,\r\n\r\nbecause the Minister himself now complains that  he\r\n\r\nis  facing  the  same  difficulty  -that  there  is\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in getting approval of appointments  to\r\n\r\nthe posts of Inspectors of Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, he had to resort to the\r\n\r\nappointment   of   heads  of  schools   as   acting\r\n\r\nInspectors of Schools. Sir, the result of that  has\r\n\r\nbeen that heads of schools have been pulled out  of\r\n\r\ntheir schools to perform duties in the Ministry  as\r\n\r\nInspectors of Schools, to the neglect of their  own\r\n\r\nduties  in the schools. No doubt, senior assistants\r\n\r\nwere  appointed  in the schools to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  the  heads,  but  since  the  senior\r\n\r\nassistants   are   not  given  any   responsibility\r\n\r\nallowance, one cannot expect them to carry out  all\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities fully, because if  anything\r\n\r\ngoes  wrong they have to take the blame. So usually\r\n\r\nwhen  it comes to important issues, they will  wait\r\n\r\nfor  the  head, who is now working in the Ministry,\r\n\r\nto  come  along  and carry the baby himself.  Also,\r\n\r\nSir, in the matter of pay, if a major in an army is\r\n\r\nasked  to do the duty of a colonel, he is given  an\r\n\r\nacting allowance.

We\r\n\r\nknow that the Member for Tanglin has always been  a\r\n\r\nprincipal.  What he has said is for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nprincipals.

Let us  come  to\r\n\r\nthe point of Inspectors of Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  as regards the Inspectors of Schools, we know\r\n\r\nthat  in the past, the relevant department  was  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of the old officials. It was not  taken\r\n\r\nproper  care  of by the Government. After  our  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  came into office, we have had  to  make\r\n\r\nsome adjustments. We had to transfer some people to\r\n\r\nthe  Inspectorate. When these Inspectors go out  to\r\n\r\ninspect  the schools, of course, this will directly\r\n\r\naffect  the  interests  of  the  principals.  Those\r\n\r\nprincipals  who in the past had been  irresponsible\r\n\r\nand corrupted, of course, would not like this. They\r\n\r\nwanted to carry on their old attitude under the old\r\n\r\nGovernment. Of course, we do not say that  all  the\r\n\r\nprincipals  are  like  this. There  are  also  many\r\n\r\nresponsible principals. When our school  inspectors\r\n\r\ngo  to visit the schools, they gather many valuable\r\n\r\nviews from the parents and the students. Since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  took  office,  we  have  established  a\r\n\r\nComplaints Branch,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  under  its direction we have dealt  with  many\r\n\r\ncases  of  complaints. Some of the complaints  were\r\n\r\nsigned  and  some  were not.  Of  those  that  were\r\n\r\nunsigned, we cannot, of course, say that  they  had\r\n\r\nall  been fabricated. Of these unsigned complaints,\r\n\r\nat  least more than 50 per cent of them were  true.\r\n\r\nBecause  it  was  a  rule  that  when  there  were\r\n\r\ncomplaints  the  complainants must go  through  the\r\n\r\nprincipals, it was therefore difficult for them  to\r\n\r\ngo  direct  to  the Ministry of Education  to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  complaints.  We handed  these  over  to  the\r\n\r\nInspectors  to  investigate. It is  but  right  and\r\n\r\nproper  because  the job of the Inspectors  is  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  the relevant matters and to  see  that\r\n\r\nthe schools are properly carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some examples here. Last year, there were\r\n\r\nthree  primary school principals who pocketed money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  sale of books and building  funds.  They\r\n\r\nwere  properly dealt with after being called up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Inspectors.  Another primary school  principal\r\n\r\nhad, under the old Government, fabricated a diploma\r\n\r\nto the effect that he was a University graduate. So\r\n\r\nafter due investigation, he was also properly dealt\r\n\r\nwith.  Another  example was  of  a  primary  school\r\n\r\nprincipal  who signed the form of a teacher  saying\r\n\r\nthat   this   particular   teacher   was   properly\r\n\r\nqualified,  when  it  was not  so.  This  case  was\r\n\r\ninvestigated  by an Inspector and the  teacher  was\r\n\r\nalso properly dealt with. Another case was this.  A\r\n\r\nmiddle  school principal appointed his own relative\r\n\r\nto  an  important post in his school  and  also  to\r\n\r\ncontrol the management of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these investigations by Inspectors, how\r\n\r\ncould we have found out all these anomalies in  the\r\n\r\nschools? The Member for Tanglin must know  that  we\r\n\r\nmust accept the criticisms of parents, students and\r\n\r\nthe  public. If the principals have done no wrong,\r\n\r\nthen,  of course, they will not incur any criticism\r\n\r\nfrom  anybody.  We know of a Chinese  saying  which\r\n\r\nsays,  \"True  gold  will not  dread  fire.\"  So  if\r\n\r\nprincipals carry out their functions properly, they\r\n\r\nwill  have  no fear at all. I am only mentioning  a\r\n\r\nfew  examples  here. I believe most principals  are\r\n\r\nvery responsible people and are seriously carrying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout their jobs. I think only a few of them have had\r\n\r\ncomplaints made against them by the people  because\r\n\r\nthey  had  already  been corrupted  under  the  old\r\n\r\nGovernment. But then the Government in  those  days\r\n\r\nhad   not  carried  out  their  responsibility   of\r\n\r\ninvestigating  all  these  cases.  Since  the   new\r\n\r\nGovernment  took office, it has started  on  a  new\r\n\r\nline.  Of course, there are many people who do  not\r\n\r\nfeel  satisfied.  I think all the  Inspectors  have\r\n\r\nproperly carried out their responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  seems to have misunderstood my  argument\r\n\r\nin  that  he thought that I was firstly criticizing\r\n\r\nthe  appointments of Inspectors of Schools. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave said that I agree completely with the Minister\r\n\r\nregarding   the  primary  role  of  Inspectors   of\r\n\r\nSchools.  But what the Parliamentary Secretary  has\r\n\r\nsaid  has  now confirmed that although the Minister\r\n\r\nconsiders the primary role of Inspectors of Schools\r\n\r\nis  to  inspect and advise and assist, it  has  now\r\n\r\nbecome  their  primary role  to  inspect  and  seek\r\n\r\nevidence to incriminate and to punish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rarely have I heard of Inspectors of Schools\r\n\r\nnowadays coming with this question, \"Have  you  got\r\n\r\nany  complaints?  Is there anything  where  we  can\r\n\r\nhelp?\"  Sir, that is the primary role of Inspectors\r\n\r\nof  Schools,  or should be. I hope you will  pardon\r\n\r\nme, Sir, for having to explain in answer to what  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  accused of, that I have always  been  a\r\n\r\nprincipal.  Sir,  for  nearly  31  years  I  was  a\r\n\r\nteacher.  I  began  my  teaching  profession  as  a\r\n\r\nteacher in a primary school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin inquired as to the  duties  of\r\n\r\nInspectors of Schools in the Ministry of Education,\r\n\r\nI  did  say that the primary function of Inspectors\r\n\r\nwould   be   to   advise   on   organisation    and\r\n\r\nadministration   of   schools;   to   ensure   that\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  are  being  complied  with,  also,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  when  it comes to a teacher  crossing  the\r\n\r\nbar, they will drop in to see whether he should  be\r\n\r\nrecommended to cross the bar, and so forth.  But  I\r\n\r\ndid add that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  other  multifarious duties, not,  of  course,\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  anticipate  what  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  would want to proceed thereafter. But  the\r\n\r\nmultifarious  duties  would  include  investigation\r\n\r\nwhere  complaints have been lodged.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin keeps insisting as  if  the\r\n\r\nonly  function of the Ministry of Education or even\r\n\r\nthe   Inspectorate   is  just   in   pursuance   of\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  It is part and parcel of a  change  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  that  there would be a  reorganisation,\r\n\r\nnot only in the Ministry of Education, but in other\r\n\r\nMinistries.  Therefore, letters of  complaints  are\r\n\r\naddressed to the Ministry, and sometimes personally\r\n\r\nto  the Minister himself. Well, anyone who has  not\r\n\r\ndone  any  wrong  should  not  be  afraid  of   any\r\n\r\ncomplaint,  whether  it is anonymous  or  a  signed\r\n\r\nletter  of  complaint, because  it  can  be  safely\r\n\r\nassumed  that if action is to be taken,  the  party\r\n\r\nwho  is  aggrieved would be given a chance  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething  for  himself, and I can put  it  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin, Sir, to provide any  evidence\r\n\r\nthat  harsh  treatment had been meted  out  to  any\r\n\r\nparticular  teacher or principal. In  fact,  I  can\r\n\r\ntruthfully say, Sir, that after investigations have\r\n\r\nbeen  made, I do not remember a single instance  in\r\n\r\nwhich I have rejected the professional advice  that\r\n\r\nhas  been  offered  by  the Inspectors  of  Schools\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G.

At first, some  principals\r\n\r\ntook  it  as  if it was going to be  a  black  mark\r\n\r\nagainst  them,  and they hurriedly  tendered  their\r\n\r\nresignations. I think the Member for  Tanglin  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to find out that some of them have  since\r\n\r\nregretted  their  move  or  have  withdrawn   their\r\n\r\nresignations. Because all that was required was  to\r\n\r\nsay  to  them, \"Look here, there is now a  complete\r\n\r\nchange   in   government.  It   is   the   people's\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"  The  Minister is not  sitting  in  an\r\n\r\noffice segregated from the people. He is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  Assemblyman who has to face the public at least\r\n\r\nonce   a   week   when   he  goes   down   to   his\r\n\r\nconstituency - like last night I did not come back to\r\n\r\nmy  home till midnight in order to meet the  people\r\n\r\nin  my constituency to try and solve their problems\r\n\r\nas  an Assemblyman. We listen to their problems and\r\n\r\ntry  to  do  what  we can, not just on  educational\r\n\r\nmatters but on matters embracing citizenship and on\r\n\r\nother  matters which for some reason or other  they\r\n\r\nfeel they have to see their Assemblyman. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  get verbal complaints, \"So and so is a  wicked\r\n\r\nman. So and so is a wicked teacher.\" But I am never\r\n\r\nprepared to work on verbal complaints. If they have\r\n\r\na  complaint, they are expected to put it  down  in\r\n\r\nwriting.  These  complaints can  be  put  into  two\r\n\r\ncategories. When complaints are received by  me,  I\r\n\r\nsend  them  to the Chief Inspector of Schools  with\r\n\r\nthis comment, \"Please investigate, or please deal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the Member for Tanglin has\r\n\r\nbeen somewhat erratic in trying to infer as if  the\r\n\r\nInspectors of Schools in the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nare  such  wicked people. After all, most of  them,\r\n\r\nincluding  those  who  have been  seconded  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  have  been teachers themselves  with  as\r\n\r\nmany years of experience as the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\nThey have also been principals. I am confident that\r\n\r\nwhen    these    officials   proceed    with    the\r\n\r\ninvestigations they know exactly how to talk to the\r\n\r\nprincipal or to the teacher, and how to conduct the\r\n\r\ninvestigations  to  the  best  of  their   ability.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  must  say that  if  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  is  able to give me evidence and  tell  me\r\n\r\nexactly  which particular official has been lacking\r\n\r\nin  courtesy or in finesse, I will be the first  to\r\n\r\ntake  it  up  with the official concerned,  not  to\r\n\r\npunish  him  but  to  advise him  that  times  have\r\n\r\nchanged and that they have got to go to the schools\r\n\r\nto  find  out for themselves whether the complaints\r\n\r\nstated  are true and, if so, what they can  suggest\r\n\r\nshould be done in the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last evening, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  suggested  that  he  heard  it  said  that\r\n\r\ncomplaints had to be investigated within 48  hours.\r\n\r\nI  must  say  that  this  statement  is  completely\r\n\r\nuntrue.  My colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary,\r\n\r\nhas   already  explained  how,  as  a   result   of\r\n\r\ncomplaints, we have been able to follow up  to  put\r\n\r\nright    serious   discrepancies:   for    example,\r\n\r\nunauthorised  collections, false certificates,  and\r\n\r\nso  forth.  Some  complaints  were  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nreports  that  principals or  teachers  were  doing\r\n\r\nadditional  work,  perhaps  as  pianists  in  night\r\n\r\nclubs.  Now there is a ruling in the Ministry  that\r\n\r\nthe  principals or teachers concerned  could  apply\r\n\r\nfor  permission to undertake additional  employment\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding six hours per week, and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education   very   rarely   turn   down   such\r\n\r\napplications.   But  if  the  teachers   concerned,\r\n\r\nknowing of the existence of such a circular, do not\r\n\r\nask for permission, then I think they are not being\r\n\r\nfair. If a teacher, who should be conscientious and\r\n\r\nfair  to  his  students, accepts  employment  as  a\r\n\r\npianist  in  a night club, he has got to  be  told,\r\n\r\n\"Are  you  going  to  be fair to  the  children  at\r\n\r\nschool?\"  If  he  thinks that he  is  a  very  good\r\n\r\npianist in a night club, then perhaps he should  be\r\n\r\na   full-time  performer  and  withdraw  from   the\r\n\r\nteaching service. There are other teachers who give\r\n\r\nprivate tuition on the sly. Here again, we  do  not\r\n\r\nobject to a teacher wanting to give private tuition\r\n\r\nwithin  limits, but his first duty is to the school\r\n\r\nand  to  the Ministry which give him a good  living\r\n\r\nwage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we also have complaints about the\r\n\r\nimmoral  conduct of certain teachers which  extends\r\n\r\neven   to  the  islands.  It  is  not  for  me   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into the private life of an  individual\r\n\r\nteacher, but it interests me, as a Minister, if his\r\n\r\nmoral  conduct affects his teaching  or  if  he  is\r\n\r\nguilty  of  such conduct as to be a danger  to  the\r\n\r\nmorals  of  young  children. Only  then  should  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  be carried out and adequate  justice\r\n\r\nmeted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the courses which were conducted in\r\n\r\nthe Political Study Centre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  principals  of schools and in  my  discussions\r\n\r\nwith them, I was a little surprised that principals\r\n\r\nwere   not   quite  aware  of  their   rights   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. In fact, some principals  appear'\r\n\r\nnot  to  have any sense of discretion. That  was  a\r\n\r\nvery   unfortunate   impression   I   gained   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I decided that our Inspectors should get\r\n\r\nto  know  more about the principals of schools.  So\r\n\r\nduring the third term of this year, that is to say,\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  few months, I gave  instructions\r\n\r\nthat  Inspectors of Schools should meet  principals\r\n\r\nin  their  various  groups once a  term.  This  has\r\n\r\nalready  taken  place, not due to  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  taking  up  the  case  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipals, but because this is a matter which  has\r\n\r\nalready exercised the minds of the Inspectorate.  I\r\n\r\nread the minutes of these meetings and I think  the\r\n\r\ntone   has  considerably  improved  vis-a-vis   the\r\n\r\nprincipals and the inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking on this subject of principals, you will\r\n\r\nremember, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  asserted that he very bravely  defied\r\n\r\ncertain  requests of the Ministry to call there  to\r\n\r\ncollect  documents and cheques. This is  exactly  a\r\n\r\ncase  where  if  a principal of a  school  is  that\r\n\r\nfearful he should not be a principal. After all,  a\r\n\r\nprincipal  is  paid  a  charge  and  responsibility\r\n\r\nallowance. Far from the principal becoming  a  peon\r\n\r\nand   a  messenger  boy  collecting  documents  and\r\n\r\ncheques from the Ministry, what does the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  expect the Ministry to do? Does he  expect\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to write to the messenger boy of  the\r\n\r\nAnglo-Chinese School - for example - to come to collect\r\n\r\ncertificates, cheques, and so forth? Naturally, the\r\n\r\nletter  must be addressed from either the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Education or the Accountant of the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nthe  principal, who is the officer responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  administration of his school, and it is up  to\r\n\r\nhim   to  decide.  If  it  were  a  case  of,  say,\r\n\r\nexaminations where secrecy is important,  then  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  himself should call at the Ministry  for\r\n\r\nthe   question   papers  to   be   taken   by   him\r\n\r\npersonally - that is, if the memorandum does  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the principal should personally call  at  the\r\n\r\nMinistry. But if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstereotyped letters are sent to him saying, \"Please\r\n\r\ncall  at  the  Finance Section with  this  chit  to\r\n\r\ncollect  a cheque in respect of this or that\",  or,\r\n\r\n\"Would you please call at the Establishment Section\r\n\r\nwhen  you next visit the Ministry?\" - mind the  word\r\n\r\n\"please\";   we   are   being  very   courteous - or,\r\n\r\n\"Whenever  you  call  at this Ministry,  would  you\r\n\r\nplease  see  the Office Superintendent and  collect\r\n\r\ncertificates, etc.?\", therefore whether he is to be\r\n\r\na  peon or a principal depends upon himself. So the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin has not been a very brave  man\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said  that  he  defied  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation circular and sent somebody else,  because\r\n\r\nmost principals have done that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin brought up the subject of\r\n\r\nasking  for permission to leave the State.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthat is normal procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Johore Bahru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I myself go to Johore Bahru\r\n\r\nfor satay. I do not ask permission for that. Surely\r\n\r\nthis is a question of discretion on the part of  an\r\n\r\nindividual. It is not a question of principle. If a\r\n\r\nperson chooses to be so literal about a circular or\r\n\r\nan instruction, I am sorry for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of the bulky circular for\r\n\r\ntuckshops - 20  pages reduced to 13 pages  within  24\r\n\r\nhours -  this is another case where Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  always overstate their  case  and  then\r\n\r\ndecide to check up and get cold feet, resulting  in\r\n\r\nthe  circular shrinking to 13 pages. This  circular\r\n\r\nis  actually six pages of contents and six pages of\r\n\r\nappendices.  This  is actually a  consolidation  of\r\n\r\nprevious  circulars. It is not  something  entirely\r\n\r\nnew  which is being sprung on principals. All  that\r\n\r\nit  tries  to effect are standard rates of tuckshop\r\n\r\nfees  which, on the whole, have been reduced  after\r\n\r\nthe  experience of one year based on profit and not\r\n\r\non  arbitrary  charges. The number of stall-holders\r\n\r\nallowed  in each tuckshop is clearly defined.  Also\r\n\r\nlimitation  in the range of food to be  sold  by  a\r\n\r\nstall-holder and a specimen application form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, a little disappointed in the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin when he suggested, \"Are not principals\r\n\r\nexpected to have their holidays?\" Of course!  I  am\r\n\r\none of those who believe in compulsory leave, and I\r\n\r\nthink  it is good for any individual in service  to\r\n\r\nhave  his leave - of course, at the right time.  The\r\n\r\ncircular  that went round to principals of  schools\r\n\r\nwas  dated 6th December, 1960. Everybody knows that\r\n\r\nthe  next school year begins on 3rd January,  1961.\r\n\r\nWell,  we would like to see that all tuckshops  and\r\n\r\nstall-holders get things started properly  for  the\r\n\r\nfull  year. So a circular went out suggesting  that\r\n\r\nprincipals  of English schools should meet  on  the\r\n\r\n12th   December - that  is,  more  or  less  a   week\r\n\r\nlater - those  of Chinese schools on the  14th  (that\r\n\r\nis,  today) and those of Malay schools on the 16th,\r\n\r\nto  explain, if necessary, anything in the circular\r\n\r\nwhich may not be quite clear. As explained earlier,\r\n\r\nthe  circulars  have to be addressed to  principals\r\n\r\nand there is this sentence which says, \"Please send\r\n\r\nyour  senior assistant to the meeting  if  you  are\r\n\r\nunable to attend.\" Surely somebody responsible must\r\n\r\nturn  up  to be able to interpret the instructions,\r\n\r\nto ask questions, and be assured about the contents\r\n\r\nof the circular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the acting allowances for officers\r\n\r\nseconded  to the Ministry, it is true that  in  the\r\n\r\npast   there   had  been  considerable  frustration\r\n\r\nbecause officers who were performing the duties  of\r\n\r\nofficers with higher responsibilities were known as\r\n\r\nofficiating and not acting. I think that  has  been\r\n\r\nput  right.  We have recommended that all  officers\r\n\r\nwho  were  seconded or have been acting in  certain\r\n\r\ncapacities would draw acting allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  suggested  that  because  the  names  of\r\n\r\nprincipals or senior teachers who have applied  for\r\n\r\nappointments as Inspectors were sent to the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission in June and July, therefore, the\r\n\r\nposition in the Ministry is unsatisfactory.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  exactly unsatisfactory. The staffing  position\r\n\r\nremains  like this: they are already doing the  job\r\n\r\nin  an  acting capacity as seconded members of  the\r\n\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether they will be permanent holders would depend\r\n\r\nupon the decision of the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has got me wrong.

It all depends on  how\r\n\r\nfar   the   principal   is  allowed   to   exercise\r\n\r\ndiscretion. I remember being told by a very  senior\r\n\r\nofficer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Department, who is still there, that  when\r\n\r\ncirculars are sent round, every principal or person\r\n\r\nconcerned   must  first  put  them  into  practice.\r\n\r\nWhether  he  or she objects to them or thinks  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  wrong,  they must be put  into  practice\r\n\r\nfirst, and then the complaint or argument about  it\r\n\r\ncould  be made to the Ministry. And probably  there\r\n\r\nwas  some sense in the argument when he said,  \"Can\r\n\r\nyou  imagine. Mrs Seow, if a circular goes out and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is not able to say that that circular\r\n\r\nwill  be implemented by everyone? That the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas to guess how many principals might think it  is\r\n\r\ngood  or how many principals might think it is  bad\r\n\r\nand should not be implemented? It has been shown to\r\n\r\nme,   and  insistence  has  been  made,  that   the\r\n\r\ncirculars  must  be  implemented  first.  Then  any\r\n\r\ncomplaints  or  opinions as to  the  circulars  not\r\n\r\nbeing  workable  should come later.\"  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould be grateful to the Minister if he could  make\r\n\r\nit  very  clear whether that is not so  or  whether\r\n\r\nprincipals can exercise discretion. Even on  little\r\n\r\nthings  like this: sometime ago a principal sent  a\r\n\r\ncircular round the school saying, \"Please send your\r\n\r\nrecord  books  to  the  office.\"  Unfortunately  it\r\n\r\nhappened to be a European principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> When was that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sometime ago, but it just -\r\n\r\n[Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

And  when the principal said, \"Please  send\",\r\n\r\nsome   teachers,   for  reasons   best   known   to\r\n\r\nthemselves,  brought  their books  to  the  office,\r\n\r\neither  to  explain something to the  principal  or\r\n\r\nbecause   the  teachers  were  free.  Then  another\r\n\r\ncircular  went round, \"Teachers in this  school  do\r\n\r\nnot understand English. Please note the word `send'\r\n\r\nand  not `bring'.\" Sir, things like that do happen.\r\n\r\nAnd  the principals are worried as to how and  when\r\n\r\nthey  should  exercise discretion. There  are  some\r\n\r\npeople who insist on things, which go to show  that\r\n\r\nwhen they exercise their discretion, they are being\r\n\r\ntold off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I would like to touch on is when the\r\n\r\nMinister said that if a principal is not guilty  he\r\n\r\nshould  not be worried about complaints,  not  even\r\n\r\nfrom anonymous letters, not even being investigated\r\n\r\ninto. I would like to point out, Sir, that a person\r\n\r\ndoes  worry - just like the Hon. the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen  he felt that the Member for Hong Lim has  not\r\n\r\nmade  true accusations or statements about him,  he\r\n\r\nwas  very worried; so worried that he went  outside\r\n\r\nand  challenged  him. You do feel worried  because,\r\n\r\nwhen  a  statement is made against your  character,\r\n\r\neven if you succeed in proving it in court that  it\r\n\r\nis  not true, a smear has already been made, and to\r\n\r\nsome  people it sticks in their minds. So  that  is\r\n\r\nwhy we feel that complaints should not be taken  up\r\n\r\nunless the Minister feels that there is some  truth\r\n\r\nand  that  they should be taken up. I  myself  have\r\n\r\nreceived  complaints - after I had  stopped  teaching\r\n\r\nand  not  when I was teaching - complaints about  the\r\n\r\nimmoral  conduct  of  teachers  in  all  sorts   of\r\n\r\nschools,  not only the school in which  I  used  to\r\n\r\nteach. These were anonymous and typewritten so that\r\n\r\nit  could not be established who sent them. I  just\r\n\r\nthrew  them into the wastepaper basket. At first  I\r\n\r\nthought this was a Ministry of Education affair and\r\n\r\nshould  be  sent there, but, on second thoughts,  I\r\n\r\nthought that, if a man is not brave enough  to  put\r\n\r\ndown  his  signature and tries to hide his identity\r\n\r\nby even typing out his letter, it is not worthwhile\r\n\r\nand  so  I threw the complaints into the wastepaper\r\n\r\nbasket.   If  the  Minister  is  going  to   accept\r\n\r\ncomplaints like that in anonymous letters,  then  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that he is going to encourage scoundrels\r\n\r\nor people who try to have their own back by writing\r\n\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is going to be swamped with such letters if\r\n\r\nhe gives this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencouragement and takes up such anonymous  letters.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am very glad that the Minister did  give\r\n\r\nus  an  assurance that he would not take up  verbal\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  I  feel  that if he  does  not  accept\r\n\r\nverbal  complaints, then much less should he accept\r\n\r\ncomplaints  when he does not know where  they  come\r\n\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the way the Minister and his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  spoke  about Inspectors  of  Schools,  I\r\n\r\ngather  that they have a high opinion of Inspectors\r\n\r\nof Schools, and I wholeheartedly agree with them. I\r\n\r\ndo not think the Member for Tanglin intended to say\r\n\r\nthat  Inspectors of Schools are not  efficient  and\r\n\r\nare  not doing their duty. If the Minister and  his\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary admit that the  Inspectors\r\n\r\nare so efficient, I wonder why there is a number of\r\n\r\nprincipals  who have been seconded to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nand   who   have  been  working  there,  I   think,\r\n\r\nimmediately after the P.A.P. came into power. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  in a position to say exactly when, but  it  is\r\n\r\nsoon  after the P.A.P. took office. I went  to  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  and met some principals. I  found  that\r\n\r\nthey  had  been  seconded and were  acting  in  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  Inspectors of Schools.  Although  the\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that they would be paid  an  acting\r\n\r\nallowance, would they be paid retrospectively  from\r\n\r\nthe   time  they  were  seconded?  If  not,  I  was\r\n\r\nwondering whether it is fair to them, since it  has\r\n\r\nbeen admitted that they are efficient and that they\r\n\r\nhave done a good job, to penalise them because they\r\n\r\nhave not been put before the P.S.C., or because the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  not  decided  to  give  them  the\r\n\r\nallowance for their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tuckshop, Sir,-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It is not really  difficult\r\n\r\nto  draw  a line for some people who accept  powers\r\n\r\nand  act  responsibly  and know  when  to  exercise\r\n\r\ndiscretion;  others  just have  to  take  an  order\r\n\r\nbefore   they  move.  My  opinion,  which  I   have\r\n\r\nexpressed to officials in my Ministry, is that what\r\n\r\nI  would  like to see is the spirit,  and  not  the\r\n\r\nletter of the law or the circular, to be adopted by\r\n\r\nthemselves and also principals of schools. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is possible to draw very neatly  a  line\r\n\r\nindicating just what a principal may or may not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Mountbatten proceeded to say\r\n\r\nthat  during the period of the previous government,\r\n\r\nshe  was told by a very important official  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry, who is still an important official,  that\r\n\r\ncertain  things  had to be done as  stated  in  the\r\n\r\ncircular.  I have already indicated my  views,  and\r\n\r\nthis particular official, who may have carried  out\r\n\r\nthe  policy of the last government in that  spirit,\r\n\r\nwould  not, I think, find it very convenient  under\r\n\r\nmy  direction at the moment. Sir, should  there  be\r\n\r\nany instances of such rigid interpretation, then  I\r\n\r\nwill not be behind it. She followed on by trying to\r\n\r\ngive  an  example of an expatriate principal  of  a\r\n\r\nschool.  I  can  assure the Member for  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nthat  it  could not have happened under the present\r\n\r\nGovernment, because there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  expatriate who is a principal of  a  school  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today. So if these are all  frustrations\r\n\r\nand  irritations of the past, I am  not  answerable\r\n\r\nfor  the activities of the last government,  but  I\r\n\r\nshall be fully responsible for what has taken place\r\n\r\nsince June 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She further enquired whether officers who have\r\n\r\nbeen  seconded to the Ministry would be in  receipt\r\n\r\nof acting pay from the time of their appointment.

I will, however,  endeavour\r\n\r\nto answer to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name implies, a Staff Officer is one who is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the appointment, distribution  and\r\n\r\ntransfer of the staff. We have, as everybody knows,\r\n\r\nsomething like 11,000 teachers and, say.  2,000  to\r\n\r\n3,000  other  staff  - perhaps one  of  the  largest\r\n\r\nMinistries in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the staffing formula, there is actually\r\n\r\nreally  nothing new about it. This is  the  formula\r\n\r\nwhich existed in the past, except that there was  a\r\n\r\nslight  amendment  to  it recently.  This  is,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, one of detail which I am  attempting\r\n\r\nto  answer  as  best I can. In the past,  when  the\r\n\r\nstaffing  quota  was  mentioned,  and  before   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation  decided  to  emphasise  the   study   of\r\n\r\nlanguages, language teachers were excluded from the\r\n\r\nstaffing quota. Whereas in the case of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,  they were included. So in order to  bring\r\n\r\nabout integration and a single system of education,\r\n\r\nand  in trying to bring about a common formula,  it\r\n\r\nwould appear that difficulties have arisen.

It is not possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to be interested in the details  when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to the execution of policy. The Minister\r\n\r\nhas  a  monthly meeting, at which about  14  senior\r\n\r\nofficials  meet - Grade G and above - and we  discuss\r\n\r\nproblems  that arise from the respective  sections.\r\n\r\nThey,  in  turn, hold monthly meetings  with  their\r\n\r\nstaff,  the  minutes of which I regularly  read.

I\r\n\r\nam,  in fact, very pleased that in the Ministry the\r\n\r\nadministration have pulled their weight despite the\r\n\r\nvolume of work that they have had to cope with, and\r\n\r\nthe  considerable  changes that have  been  brought\r\n\r\nabout within the last one and a half years.

I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  trying  to  save time for  Members  who  come\r\n\r\nafter.  That is all there is to it. Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nconvenient. Shall we deal with it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the staffing formulas are\r\n\r\nvery   vital  in  maintaining  efficiency  in   our\r\n\r\nschools, and in the primary schools today  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  there is a gradual loss of efficiency because\r\n\r\nthe  staffing  formula  being  implemented  is  not\r\n\r\nworkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula is now as follows. For every ten\r\n\r\nclasses, there can be only one relief teacher.  Now\r\n\r\nif there were twelve classes, 12 x 11/10; and there\r\n\r\nis a fraction, the fraction is cancelled, and there\r\n\r\nis  still only one relief teacher. Then, of course,\r\n\r\ncomes the Principal. There is one teacher per class\r\n\r\nup to about 14 classes, plus one relief teacher and\r\n\r\nthe head or the senior assistant. Sir, in the past,\r\n\r\nextra  language teachers were regarded  as  outside\r\n\r\nthe  quota.  But  now extra language  teachers  are\r\n\r\nincluded  as  within the quota. So primary  schools\r\n\r\nhave  to  organise themselves into one teacher  per\r\n\r\nclass  in  the  English medium, if teaching  is  in\r\n\r\nEnglish,   plus   the  relief  teacher - he   is   an\r\n\r\nadditional  language  medium teacher - and  then  the\r\n\r\nHead.  At  the  moment, if one  teacher  is  absent\r\n\r\nbecause   of  sickness,  then  the  extra  language\r\n\r\nteacher, say, in the Chinese medium, if he  or  she\r\n\r\nis  in  an English-medium school, has to substitute\r\n\r\nfor  the  absent  teacher - maybe a teacher  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language - and he or she must go round  class\r\n\r\nby  class, and usually he or she knows only how  to\r\n\r\nteach  in  Chinese or in Malay. So that means  that\r\n\r\nfor  most of the period, there is no lesson because\r\n\r\nof  language difficulty. And if one teacher  is  on\r\n\r\nmaternity   leave,  the  situation   becomes   more\r\n\r\ndifficult,  and the poor Head must not  only  teach\r\n\r\nbut  sometimes  he has to combine classes.  Parents\r\n\r\nhave  complained to the Head, saying  that  certain\r\n\r\nclasses were not manned. But what could the Head do\r\n\r\nwhen the staffing formula is so tight that when one\r\n\r\nteacher  is  absent, things become disorganised?  I\r\n\r\nfeel strongly that if the efficiency in the primary\r\n\r\nschools  has  to be maintained, then  the  staffing\r\n\r\nformula must be revised until\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  becomes  workable. I am glad of  the  assurance\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the Minister that he would  welcome  the\r\n\r\nresuscitation  of  the  Head Teachers'  Conference,\r\n\r\nbecause he now values opinions expressed by such  a\r\n\r\nbody.  I  was  against  the  closure  of  the  Head\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Conference, but the fact that  they  did\r\n\r\nclose down shows how frustrated they must have felt\r\n\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the application of the staffing\r\n\r\nformula - the manning of schools - sometimes the  poor\r\n\r\nStaff  Officers get rather confused, maybe  because\r\n\r\nof some other directives, and in their hurry to get\r\n\r\nteachers  for  Government schools, they  forget  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the first aim of Government - equality  of\r\n\r\ntreatment  of all streams of education and  of  all\r\n\r\nschools.  I  believe, Sir, that that is a  cardinal\r\n\r\npoint  in their policy. And I agree wholeheartedly,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  have been fighting for  this  for  many\r\n\r\nyears. But what do you find, Sir? A young would  be\r\n\r\nteacher  applied for a job, and naturally he  would\r\n\r\napply  to  as many schools as possible.  There  are\r\n\r\nseveral  teachers that I know of. But we will  just\r\n\r\ntake   one  case.  This  teacher  applied  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and to an aided school. The  Government\r\n\r\nmachinery takes a long time to operate, and by  the\r\n\r\ntime  the  Government  decided  to  interview  this\r\n\r\nparticular applicant, she had already been employed\r\n\r\nand  was teaching in an aided school for some time.\r\n\r\nShe  was  told  that unless she resigned  from  the\r\n\r\naided  school and joined a Government  school,  she\r\n\r\nwould not be given an opportunity in the next batch\r\n\r\nto  go in for teacher training. In other words, she\r\n\r\nwould  be put far behind. Sir, this is not equality\r\n\r\nof treatment. Naturally the teacher was in tears. I\r\n\r\ncould  not  believe it. I spoke  to  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  and  he  assured me that  it  could  not\r\n\r\nhappen.   Then  I  was  shown  a  letter  to   this\r\n\r\nparticular applicant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to your letter of [such and such\r\n\r\na  date] and my reply of [of such and such a  date]\r\n\r\nto  your  Principal, I am to inform you  that  your\r\n\r\napplication  is  hereby  cancelled,  as  you   have\r\n\r\ndeclined  the offer of appointment as a teacher  in\r\n\r\ntraining in the English-language medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I am to remind you that this Ministry cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee your admission to the Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege in 1961, and in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture  any  correspondence from you pertaining  to\r\n\r\nthis  appointment  and admission to  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College will not be entertained.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Sir, the poor girl was in tears. I\r\n\r\nassured  her  that this could not be  because  this\r\n\r\nwent against the cardinal point in the policy, i.e.\r\n\r\nequal treatment in all streams and for all schools.\r\n\r\nHow  could there be discrimination against teachers\r\n\r\nin aided schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, a Ministry official approached\r\n\r\naided-school  heads asking for vacant classrooms so  that\r\n\r\nthey  could use them for their students. I am  glad\r\n\r\nto  say,  Sir, that aided-school principals,  after\r\n\r\nconsulting their Boards, agreed to help.  But  they\r\n\r\nwanted  this point to be clarified. Would  they  be\r\n\r\nassisted in getting teachers for the classes? Would\r\n\r\nGovernment  allow teachers from Government  schools\r\n\r\nto  be  transferred: specially to man these classes\r\n\r\nin  the aided schools? Of course, one official said\r\n\r\nit was not in his section, so he could not give any\r\n\r\nguarantee.  Sir, we thought it was reasonable,  and\r\n\r\nall of us applied. Then we were given an indication\r\n\r\nthat something had gone wrong. These teachers going\r\n\r\nto  an  aided school must resign. Well, it was  all\r\n\r\nright. But the important point was - would they  draw\r\n\r\ntheir last drawn salary? Would they continue to  be\r\n\r\non  the  old salary scheme? That, the Staff Officer\r\n\r\nsaid,  he could not say. Sir, if he knew that  this\r\n\r\npolicy  must  be implemented, surely it  was  quite\r\n\r\neasy.  Because when the Government wanted a trained\r\n\r\nsportsman,  a star athlete, from one aided  school,\r\n\r\nthe  poor aided school head would not stand in  the\r\n\r\nway   of   that  man's  transfer.  The   man   was,\r\n\r\ntransferred  on  the same terms  and  on  the  same\r\n\r\nsalary   scheme.  When  they  wanted   a,   science\r\n\r\nspecialist,   the  man  was  also  transferred   or\r\n\r\nreleased  on  that  basis.  But  when  it  came  to\r\n\r\nGovernment teachers who wanted to come to the aided\r\n\r\nschool  system,  the  Staff Officer  had  no  clear\r\n\r\nindication.  It  has come to a  stage  where  aided\r\n\r\nschools are feeling that this is a one-way traffic.\r\n\r\nTeachers   from   aided   to  Government   schools?\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  have everything.\" Teachers from Government  to\r\n\r\naided  schools?  \"No  we have certain  Conditions.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have not yet received any definite  reply.\r\n\r\nBefore  the  reply comes, I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nlook  into  it  and  ensure  that  there  is  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment of teachers in the different scales-aided\r\n\r\nschools and Government schools. We only want  that,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the staffing of graduate\r\n\r\nteachers.  There  is a great shortage  of  graduate\r\n\r\nteachers,  we  know that, Sir. Hitherto,  at  least\r\n\r\nuntil  the  new  Government came  into  power,  the\r\n\r\nruling  was  that  Government  bursaries  were  for\r\n\r\nstudents  in all schools - Government and  aided.  It\r\n\r\nwas  based on this fact - that the children  of  the\r\n\r\npeople are being educated in Government schools  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in aided schools. The people of Singapore\r\n\r\ncontributed money, through taxes, to the revenue of\r\n\r\nthe  country.  Therefore, the  bursaries,  although\r\n\r\ncalled   Government  bursaries,  were   meant   for\r\n\r\nstudents  from schools of any category.  When  they\r\n\r\ngraduated,  the understanding was,  and  they  were\r\n\r\ntold,  that they could choose to serve their  \r\n\r\nfive-year bond in any school - either Government or aided.\r\n\r\nThat  was  the understanding, Sir. We assumed  that\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  equality  of  treatment  would  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Naturally, Sir, when we expanded  our\r\n\r\nsecondary  classes, we were quite willing.  We  had\r\n\r\ntheir  applications.  They came  willingly  because\r\n\r\nsome  of  them wanted to teach in their old schools\r\n\r\nand some because of religious connections. This was\r\n\r\nwhat I got from one of the applicants:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>`Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your letter of the third instant\r\n\r\nwith application forms enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a reply from the Ministry only three\r\n\r\ndays ago telling me that I cannot be posted to  ...\r\n\r\n(name of an aided school)... as I asked for, as I would be properly posted \r\n\r\nto  a Government  school. Needless to  say,  I  am  quite\r\n\r\ndisappointed as I had hoped to be allowed to choose\r\n\r\nthe school I would like to teach in.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is equality of treatment for all\r\n\r\nschools and freedom of choice, surely, this  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  taking place in the Staff Section  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Perhaps, Sir, they were not quite  aware\r\n\r\nof  it,  and  I do hope the Minister will  make  it\r\n\r\nclear that aided schools are really trying their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest  to co-operate with the Government.

This  is\r\n\r\nright  and  proper. To serve the Government  is  to\r\n\r\nserve the people. If he serves the Government, that\r\n\r\nmeans he serves the people. This is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I can now understand some of the\r\n\r\nproblems  that the Ministry of Education  is  faced\r\n\r\nwith.

It  is  in\r\n\r\norder to arrive at a satisfactory solution that  we\r\n\r\nhave to put our heads together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the staffing formula, as I have said,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  it is a very professional  question.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nsince  decided that for next year, if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfraction of .6, then the school will be entitled to\r\n\r\none  additional teacher. They could not really have\r\n\r\n.6 of a teacher for a particular school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry for the case mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin, about the poor girl teacher who cried.\r\n\r\nWhy  could  that not have been put  to  me  in  my\r\n\r\nofficial capacity? I would like to take the  matter\r\n\r\nup  if  he  would be good enough to  let  me  have\r\n\r\nparticulars of the case. Speaking off-hand, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  most harsh indeed for the official to write\r\n\r\nin   that  manner,  and  it  will  not  receive  my\r\n\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question was in respect of the movement\r\n\r\nof   teachers  from  aided  schools  to  Government\r\n\r\nschools. I think, in this respect, it is again from\r\n\r\nthe  English  stream  where the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  are in Government schools. I  think  they\r\n\r\nalways feel that if there are any promotions or any\r\n\r\nmovement, they would like to restrict it  to  those\r\n\r\nwithin the service. I personally feel that I  would\r\n\r\nprefer  everything to be thrown  wide  open.  There\r\n\r\nshould  be  fair competition. Why  I  say  this  is\r\n\r\nbecause I have to think of the Chinese stream where\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  the teachers are  in  the  aided\r\n\r\nschools,  and if we want to get the best  material,\r\n\r\nthen  we must open the gates wide to get the cream\r\n\r\nfrom the Chinese aided schools. So our reasons  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in the award of bursaries to students to\r\n\r\nuniversities,  if  the  Member  for   Tanglin   has\r\n\r\nfollowed  closely  the  statement  issued  by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  we  do say that we bind bursary  holders\r\n\r\nfor  Government  or  quasi-Government  service.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  distinction really. We feel  that  a\r\n\r\ngraduate  in receipt of public funds to enable  him\r\n\r\nto  complete  his  studies should  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nrender  service to the State, be it in a Government\r\n\r\nMinistry or in a Government aided school. There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  no  question  of reserving  all  bursary\r\n\r\nholders for service in Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to\r\n\r\nexpress  my  thanks to the Minister for  giving  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that he is going to attend to  the  case\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  just brought up. In fact,  there  is\r\n\r\nanother case - the case of a trainee teacher who  was\r\n\r\ntold  that  he would not be allowed any facilities.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  has  also given his  assurance  that\r\n\r\nGovernment bursary holders would have the option of\r\n\r\nservice in either Government or aided schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary unfortunately - I\r\n\r\nnotice it every time I speak - takes the line that  I\r\n\r\nrepresent only the English schools. Sir, my  record\r\n\r\nof    service    during   the   British    Military\r\n\r\nAdministration period can testify that when  I  was\r\n\r\nresponsible, I was fair to all the schools  of  all\r\n\r\nstreams.  An  attempt was made  by  my  subordinate\r\n\r\nofficers to confine the issue of chocolate  rations\r\n\r\nto  only  Government schools, but I  insisted  that\r\n\r\nthey  should be distributed to all schools - English,\r\n\r\nChinese  and Malay media. I believe there was  only\r\n\r\none  Tamil school, and I am sure that it  also  got\r\n\r\nthe  rations. So it is wrong to say that I  do  not\r\n\r\nspeak for the Chinese schools. When I spoke on  the\r\n\r\nstaffing formula, it applied to all schools. It  is\r\n\r\nwrong  for the Parliamentary Secretary to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  schools are quite satisfied,  for  in\r\n\r\ntoday's  Free Press appears this heading,  \"Chinese\r\n\r\nprimary school hours should be cut, Minister told\".\r\n\r\nThe report reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The request was made in a memorandum submitted\r\n\r\nby   the   conference  [Singapore  Chinese  Schools\r\n\r\nConference which comprises in its membership  heads\r\n\r\nand teachers of Chinese schools] ... sought:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional teachers for large schools;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Additional teachers\". This shows that the  formula\r\n\r\nis not satisfactory:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Transport allowances for teachers living far\r\n\r\nfrom their schools.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  fact, Sir, what they are asking for is that the\r\n\r\nformula  is  such  that the  load  falling  on  the\r\n\r\nindividual  teacher  in  the  Chinese  schools   is\r\n\r\nheavier, than he should really bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another thing is that blame was put on the\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock Government. Let us compare the formula\r\n\r\nof the Lim Yew Hock Government with the formula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is  implemented now. The then primary  school\r\n\r\nformula  stated that a student teacher was regarded\r\n\r\nas  being half a point. That is to say, two student\r\n\r\nteachers  were equal to one qualified  teacher,  so\r\n\r\nthat for 11 trained teachers in those days we could\r\n\r\nhave 22 student teachers for ten classes. But today\r\n\r\nthe student teacher is regarded as being equivalent\r\n\r\nto  the  trained teacher. How can we then say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Lim Yew Hock Government formula was the  same?\r\n\r\nIn  those days, the additional language teacher was\r\n\r\noutside the formula. Now, it is inside the formula,\r\n\r\nI  should  say that the staffing formula under  the\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock Government was more generous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We come back again to the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  outlook:  this  question  of  student\r\n\r\nteachers again - in the past during the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment,  a Chinese stream trainee  teacher  was\r\n\r\none  unit;  English stream, half a unit.  Again  in\r\n\r\norder to bring about a single integrated system  of\r\n\r\neducation,  difficulties  arise.  These  are   the\r\n\r\nproblems which the Ministry of Education faces. All\r\n\r\nI  can say is this. Let us try to approach it  with\r\n\r\nan  element of goodwill and understanding - a  little\r\n\r\nof give and take. If in the past the English stream\r\n\r\nhad been fortunate in that the formulae had been to\r\n\r\ntheir  advantage, and in trying to  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nsingle system they have to strain a little bit, now\r\n\r\nwe   do   not   ask  that  they  should   sacrifice\r\n\r\nthemselves,  but  we  are  trying  to  bring  about\r\n\r\nsomething which will be the same for all  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  fact that the Minister  is  facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  trying to bring  about  a  single\r\n\r\nsystem.  I  am  glad to hear that the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to disabuse any abuse that is brought  to\r\n\r\nhis  notice about his department, but I  am  really\r\n\r\nsurprised  that  the arguments put forward  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin, which were  on  a  matter  of\r\n\r\npolicy  and  principle, should  be  termed  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary as \"personal  benefits\".  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to add two points to what has  already\r\n\r\nbeen said by the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary schools, as the children in Primary I\r\n\r\nto  Primary  II are very small, it is the  sensible\r\n\r\ninclination of the principals to make the  sessions\r\n\r\nnot more than 30 minutes. Then from Primary III, IV\r\n\r\nand  upwards, it is the inclination to make  it  40\r\n\r\nminutes.  And as it goes up, 45 minutes. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  timetables of the three different sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  school do not coincide with one another.  They\r\n\r\ndo  not start and finish at the same time. So  when\r\n\r\nthe language teacher has to go from class to class,\r\n\r\nthere  is usually a space of 15 minutes in  between\r\n\r\nthat  is void. That is one difficulty where a class\r\n\r\ngoes  without  a teacher during the 15  minutes  in\r\n\r\nbetween the sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is this. A class that is put under\r\n\r\nthe  charge  of a vernacular language  teacher  has\r\n\r\nanything  from  9,  10 to 16 teachers  taking  that\r\n\r\nclass,  because while the vernacular  teacher  goes\r\n\r\nround   to   the  different  classes   taking   the\r\n\r\nvernacular   language,  the  teachers  from   those\r\n\r\nclasses have to come round to teach that class.  So\r\n\r\nif  a  school  has  16 classes and this  vernacular\r\n\r\nlanguage teacher goes round to those 16 classes and\r\n\r\nthe  16 teachers come round to that class to teach,\r\n\r\nyou  can  imagine  the plight of  that  class.  The\r\n\r\nchildren  are at a loss as to who is their teacher,\r\n\r\nand if the teaching is not correlated, they are  at\r\n\r\nsea  as to what they are learning and what they are\r\n\r\nnot learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I hate to enter into a debate where\r\n\r\nexperts  are taking part in it. But looking  at  it\r\n\r\nfrom outside, perhaps the problem as it strikes  an\r\n\r\noutsider might interest the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been talking about staffing\r\n\r\nformulae.  It  would  appear that  in  the  English\r\n\r\nstream  the  staffing formula is not - at least  this\r\n\r\nside  of  the House thinks - conducive to  efficiency\r\n\r\nand  good  teaching,  and therefore  we  might  not\r\n\r\nproduce the men we think we should produce. If  the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream  thinks that its  staffing  formula\r\n\r\nshould be different, it should be different.  Maybe\r\n\r\ntheir  teaching problems are entirely different  to\r\n\r\nthe English teaching problems. So the Minister said\r\n\r\nthat his problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to  apply one formula to all the four  streams.\r\n\r\nSir,  could  I  suggest  to him  that  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nproblems  in  each stream are such  that  different\r\n\r\nformulae should be applied?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on the staffing formulae, I  think  the\r\n\r\ncase of the school children has been lost sight of.\r\n\r\nIt  has happened in many schools and in many \r\n\r\nclass-rooms.  It has happened to my own daughter. Because\r\n\r\nof  the  shortage of teachers as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nformulae   that  are  being  implemented   by   the\r\n\r\nEducation Department now, children are asked to  go\r\n\r\nhome  and  stay  away for two or three  days  as  a\r\n\r\nteacher  is  sick. When I asked my daughter,  \"What\r\n\r\nhas  gone  wrong?\", she said, \"There is no teacher.\r\n\r\nSo  it is better for us not to go to the school. We\r\n\r\ncan stay at home and have some fun. Why should  we\r\n\r\ngo  to  school, daddy?\" Let us tackle this  problem\r\n\r\nfrom  the point of view of the school children.  It\r\n\r\nhas  happened. I am sure it cannot be denied  that,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the absence of a teacher on sick  leave\r\n\r\nand  because of a shortage of relief teachers, many\r\n\r\nclasses in schools have been left without teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten has raised professional  questions\r\n\r\nwhich I think really should be better dealt with by\r\n\r\na conference of teachers and head teachers, and not\r\n\r\nby  ex-principals and the Minister  for  Education,\r\n\r\nalthough  ultimately the general  policy  would  be\r\n\r\nwithin my purview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great danger in the suggestion put\r\n\r\nforward  by  the Member for Farrer  Park  that  the\r\n\r\ndifferent streams would require different formulae.\r\n\r\nI  think one should think in terms of the long-term\r\n\r\naim,  which  is  a  single  integrated  system   of\r\n\r\neducation.  There  are initial  difficulties  which\r\n\r\nwill  take time to solve and, as I have said, there\r\n\r\nshould   be  some  give  and  take  on  all  sides.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   I  feel  that  in, implementing   any\r\n\r\nformulae in the scheme of things we should  attempt\r\n\r\ngradually to bring them together rather than permit\r\n\r\ndifferent  formulae to apply, because a start  must\r\n\r\nbe  made  at  some time.

Sir, these are  superscale\r\n\r\nposts   and  they  are  all  pensionable   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment school system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been asked by people from the Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium schools as to why there are no such posts in\r\n\r\nthe   aided   school  system.  In  view   of   the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  that  there  should  be  equality   of\r\n\r\ntreatment, then, Sir, it is only logical that  they\r\n\r\nexpect  similar  superscale posts in  the \r\n\r\nChinese-medium  aided  school system and  in  the \r\n\r\nEnglish-medium  aided  school system. In the  case  of  the\r\n\r\naided English schools, there are no such superscale\r\n\r\nposts.  But what happens is this: if the holder  of\r\n\r\nthe  principalship  of  a very  big  school  is  an\r\n\r\nHonours graduate, then together with the allowance,\r\n\r\nhis  total  salary  is  the same  as  that  of  the\r\n\r\nPrincipal of Raffles Institution. But if he is  not\r\n\r\nan Honours graduate, then he gets less. In the case\r\n\r\nof   the   principalship  of  Raffles  Institution,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether he is an Honours graduate  or\r\n\r\notherwise, he gets straightaway that full salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is this: would Government\r\n\r\nconsider having in the aided school media the  same\r\n\r\nsort  of superscale posts in order that there might\r\n\r\nbe  a  true implementation of the policy  of  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment in all schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Chinese school system, we know that\r\n\r\nthere  are at least three big schools, maybe  more,\r\n\r\nwhere  the heads should be on this scale.  I  would\r\n\r\nnot  mention the names, Sir, but we all  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  are at least three or four big schools which\r\n\r\ndeserve  to be in the same category as these  three\r\n\r\nbig English schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, in the case of principals of secondary\r\n\r\nschools, there are certain allowances, and they are\r\n\r\nall   pensionable.  In  the  case  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,   the   allowances  are  not  pensionable,\r\n\r\nand - this is another thing, Sir - they find that  when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to contributing to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund,  they  are limited to a maximum of  $25  p.m.\r\n\r\nonly. Sir, they ask for equality, and I feel it  is\r\n\r\nonly  right that they should get it in view of  the\r\n\r\ndeclared  policy that there should be  equality  in\r\n\r\nall streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, \"That the sum to\r\n\r\nbe  allocated  for  Head 56 be reduced  by  $10  in\r\n\r\nrespect of item (37) of sub-head 1.\" The debate may\r\n\r\nrange  over the next three amendments, items  (38),\r\n\r\n(39)  and  (40) -  Principal,  Raffles  Institution;\r\n\r\nPrincipal,  Victoria  School;  Principal,   Raffles\r\n\r\nGirls' School; and Principals of Secondary Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nprinciple  raised  by  the Member  for  Tanglin  is\r\n\r\npurely  one of being in the Government service  and\r\n\r\nin  the  aided school. This perennial  question  is\r\n\r\nreally  difficult to equate. For example, a teacher\r\n\r\nor  principal in the Government Service is  subject\r\n\r\nto General Orders. He is not permitted to take part\r\n\r\nin   political  activities,  like  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin or any hon. Member of the Assembly; whereas\r\n\r\na  Government  officer would have to  resign  first\r\n\r\nbefore  contesting  the  elections,  in  the  aided\r\n\r\nschools  a  particular teacher or  principal  could\r\n\r\nhazard an election and, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturned, become a Member of the Assembly.  Another\r\n\r\ndifference  is  that  a  Government  officer   will\r\n\r\nreceive a pension after a long period of service in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. But for the aided school teacher  or\r\n\r\nprincipal,  he  contributes to the  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nand,  at the time of retirement, collects the whole\r\n\r\nsum  back from the Provident Fund if he reaches the\r\n\r\nage  of  55. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  a  little\r\n\r\ndifficult to try and say that both are equal. It is\r\n\r\ndifficult to equate two separate things. We try to\r\n\r\nbring  about equality as close as possible  in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three posts mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin - Principal of Raffles Institution, Principal\r\n\r\nof Victoria School, and Principal of Raffles Girls'\r\n\r\nSchool - are  known  as Superscale appointments.  For\r\n\r\nthose   who  have  what  are  known  as   Grade   G\r\n\r\nappointments,  the  salary scales  are  $1,520  for\r\n\r\nmales  and  $1,260 for females. This is actually  a\r\n\r\nrelic  of the past. We in the Ministry of education\r\n\r\nhave  not  endeavoured to monkey  around  with  the\r\n\r\nsalary scales because we could discuss them for  10\r\n\r\nor 20 years and there would still be bad blood. But\r\n\r\nI  can  say  this:  in the past  the  Principal  of\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution  was a Grade  F  post  with  a\r\n\r\nsubstantive salary of $1,620. I brought  this  down\r\n\r\nto  G  level because I do feel that this post  need\r\n\r\nnot  be  at such a high rung in the service of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Principals  of aided  schools  would  be\r\n\r\nentitled to responsibility allowances, which  could\r\n\r\nbe  $420  if it happens to be a five-stream school,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  scheme of the  higher  service.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this question of streams in  schools\r\n\r\nis  again  a typical English tradition and  is  not\r\n\r\nfound  in  the other streams. I would like  to  see\r\n\r\nprincipals' allowances based not on streams but  on\r\n\r\nenrolment.  In fact, for 1961 I have  decided  that\r\n\r\nschools with an enrolment of more than 2,000  could\r\n\r\nappoint  a  Vice-Principal.  This  Vice-  Principal\r\n\r\ncould  then  be  in receipt of half  the  allowance\r\n\r\napplicable to the principal. From memory,  I  think\r\n\r\nmost of the larger Chinese schools will come within\r\n\r\nthis scheme, and only a few schools in the, English\r\n\r\nstream will benefit from the appointment of  \r\n\r\nVice-Principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it\r\n\r\nthat  the answer is in the negative. Sir, the Chung\r\n\r\nCheng High School, the Chinese High School and  the\r\n\r\nNanyang Girls' High School would be regarded as the\r\n\r\nthree  schools  equivalent  to  the  three  schools\r\n\r\nmentioned  here  in the Government  school  system.\r\n\r\nSir,  if the policy is one of equality of treatment\r\n\r\nas  regards  pay  scales, I see  no  difficulty  in\r\n\r\ngiving the heads of the three major schools in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream the same salaries as the three  big\r\n\r\nschools  in  the Government Stream, As regards  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  about  the  aided  school  system,  the\r\n\r\ndifference between the two systems, Sir, is because\r\n\r\nof  the history of education in this country.

If  the   only\r\n\r\nobstacle  to equality of treatment is the privilege\r\n\r\nof  participation in politics, I am sure the  aided\r\n\r\nschool  teachers will say gladly, \"We renounce  our\r\n\r\nright to participate in politics if\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But I thought\r\n\r\nthat  he was looking forward to the idea that since\r\n\r\nthe  children, of the people are the same,  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are in Government schools or in aided schools\r\n\r\nand  in  every stream - Chinese stream, Malay stream,\r\n\r\nTamil stream - the aim is to treat them equally.  Why\r\n\r\nthen  should  we  wait until the  Government  group\r\n\r\nbecomes  larger and so on? In that  case  then,  it\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that  the children in  the  Government\r\n\r\nschools  are superior to the children in the  aided\r\n\r\nschools.  Surely, Sir, that is not the  assumption,\r\n\r\nand  that  the people of Singapore, when  they  pay\r\n\r\ntheir   taxes,  pay  taxes  to  finance  only   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools?

And, of course, the Government\r\n\r\nteachers  will draw their pensions and  have  their\r\n\r\nspecial hospitalization rights, whereas in the case\r\n\r\nof  others, they should have the same emoluments as\r\n\r\nthose  for  their  counterparts in  the  Government\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The principle of equality is\r\n\r\nthe  basis of our educational policy, Mr  Speaker.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past, unfortunately, Government had failed\r\n\r\nto assume its full responsibility for educating all\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  the  State.

When the salary\r\n\r\nschemes   for   the  education  service   and   the\r\n\r\nadministrative  service were drawn  up,  they  were\r\n\r\ndone in such a way that the educational service was\r\n\r\nnot  to  be penalised to the point where graduates,\r\n\r\nHonours graduates in particular, would not want  to\r\n\r\nbecome  teachers,  because it  was  felt  that  the\r\n\r\neducation  service deserved to have  good  material\r\n\r\njust as much as the administrative service. And  so\r\n\r\na  device was made, with the agreement of the  then\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Singapore Teachers' Union,\r\n\r\nwho  was until recently the Political Secretary  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education under this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  that there should be these  specialist\r\n\r\nallowances; so that ultimately an Honours  graduate\r\n\r\ngoing  into the teaching profession would still  be\r\n\r\nnot    far   behind   his   counterpart   in    the\r\n\r\nadministrative  service. With the  removal  of  the\r\n\r\nspecialist allowances, of course, there is no  more\r\n\r\nchance  for  an  Honours graduate  going  into  the\r\n\r\neducation  service  ever coming  near  his  college\r\n\r\nmates who took and passed the same examinations and\r\n\r\nwho  went to the Government administrative service.\r\n\r\nThe result, Sir, is that schools are now unable  to\r\n\r\nget  graduate  teachers of high calibre.  Time  and\r\n\r\nagain  we have lost them. Some of them are  honest,\r\n\r\nand they tell the schools that they will join as  a\r\n\r\nstop-gap  measure, but the moment they get  another\r\n\r\njob  in  the administrative service, then  we  must\r\n\r\nallow  them  to leave.

As regards\r\n\r\nusing  the school funds to pay for these specialist\r\n\r\nteachers,  this  is not the correct method  because\r\n\r\nthe  appointment  of every specialist  teacher  was\r\n\r\napproved by the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wanted to\r\n\r\nshout   \"Hurray!\"  just  now  when  I   heard   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary say  that  the  specialist\r\n\r\nallowances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  abolished,  that  they  should  be\r\n\r\ncontinued,  because I was wanting that  to  happen.\r\n\r\nWithout   the   continuation  of   the   specialist\r\n\r\nallowances,  we will never be able to get  the  top\r\n\r\ngraduates.  If  the  Government  is  going  to \r\n\r\nre-introduce the specialist allowances, then  I  would\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am afraid the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin, Sir, is jumping to conclusions too quickly\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the translation facilities,  which\r\n\r\nperhaps   are   not   quite   adequate.   What   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  said  was   that   these\r\n\r\nspecialist appointments were discontinued since May\r\n\r\n1958,  and  we have decided that for new appointees\r\n\r\nwe  would  not  consider the payment of  specialist\r\n\r\nallowances.  That  was made clear,  I  think,  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin then talked about the\r\n\r\ndesirability   of  recruiting  Honours   graduates.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  our  University  is  not  producing\r\n\r\nenough graduates to serve the needs of the country.\r\n\r\nThat,  unfortunately,  is also  the  cry  in  every\r\n\r\ncountry, not just Singapore. My view is that a pass\r\n\r\ndegree  graduate is perhaps of more use to schools.\r\n\r\nWe  do need some Honours graduates to teach in  the\r\n\r\nSixth  Form or for pre-university classes. I should\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  our  University  produce  more  Pass\r\n\r\ngraduates  to man our schools. A way out  would  be\r\n\r\nperhaps  to  introduce what is  now  known  as  the\r\n\r\nBachelor  for  Education course in  the  University\r\n\r\nitself. The University of Sydney has made a  start,\r\n\r\nand  I  think British universities which have  been\r\n\r\nmost  traditional and have avoided the teaching  of\r\n\r\neducation  as an under-graduate course  are  slowly\r\n\r\ncoming  round.  So  we are hoping that  discussions\r\n\r\nwith the University of Malaya authorities will take\r\n\r\nplace  in  the  near future for the institution  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a course, because our secondary schools would\r\n\r\nneed  hundreds of graduates each year  to  man  the\r\n\r\nclasses which we have in mind, because in the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years,  our greatest need is an  expansion  in\r\n\r\nsecondary education, where the ideal is to  have  a\r\n\r\ngraduate to be a teacher in a secondary class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like most other countries, even advanced\r\n\r\ncountries, they are not able to have a graduate for\r\n\r\nevery class in a secondary school. However, that is\r\n\r\nan  ideal which we will strive for, and we hope  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  attain it  in  the  foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry\r\n\r\nthe  translation was not quite correct.  I  thought\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  had  agreed to the  continuation  of\r\n\r\nspecialist allowances. My own conviction,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthat the question of supply and demand is such that\r\n\r\nif  we cannot get our science teachers and graduate\r\n\r\nteachers  to  man  our expanded secondary  schools,\r\n\r\nthen we will have to do something rather, than  let\r\n\r\nthe thing go sliding down. I wonder if the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  been informed that at a meeting with heads  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  and aided secondary schools,  when  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  shortage  of teachers  for  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  was  discussed, the  suggestion  was  made\r\n\r\nofficially that the only way out was to push up the\r\n\r\nteacher  with the class. Form III teacher with  the\r\n\r\nclass  into Form IV, Form IV into Form V, with  the\r\n\r\nresult that we shall have teachers teaching Form V,\r\n\r\nwho  themselves have only passed Form V. Sir,  that\r\n\r\nis  a deplorable prospect to face. I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will really think out ways and  means\r\n\r\nso that during this intervening period of shortage,\r\n\r\nsomething  could  be  done. We are  losing  science\r\n\r\ngraduates holding Master of Science degrees because\r\n\r\nthey  are  dissatisfied. We  are  losing  to  other\r\n\r\nbranches  of Government service teachers  who  have\r\n\r\ngained   experience  in  the  teaching   profession\r\n\r\nbecause of the great disparity in pay. We are  told\r\n\r\nby  one teacher that if, it was not for loyalty  to\r\n\r\nthe  old  school he could have gone over to  Johore\r\n\r\nBahru  to teach and draw $200 more. It seems rather\r\n\r\nhard  to appeal to a fellow because of loyalty  to\r\n\r\nthe  old  school to keep on sticking  to  the  old\r\n\r\nschool and lose $200 a month. II there can be  some\r\n\r\nadjustment  made officially by the Government,  our\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools could tide over this  period  of\r\n\r\nshortage and difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I failed to give an answer to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin when he requested whether it\r\n\r\nwas possible for the Ministry to permit, I presume,\r\n\r\naided schools to pay the additional salaries out of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  funds. As long as they are  not  public\r\n\r\nfunds  (I  think  there  are  philanthropists   who\r\n\r\nsupport the aided schools and are prepared to  foot\r\n\r\nthe  bill), I cannot see any objection. In fact,  I\r\n\r\nwould    wish   that   there   were    more    such\r\n\r\nphilanthropists to assist education in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I have not been kept informed about\r\n\r\nthe  discussions which the Member for  Tanglin  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  about  the  difficulties  of   engaging\r\n\r\ngraduate  teachers in schools. That is a  perennial\r\n\r\nproblem. I would be glad if he could send me a copy\r\n\r\nof  that memorandum for study. I think we sometimes\r\n\r\nmake  a mountain out of a molehill when we say that\r\n\r\nstandards  are going down, and there is a desperate\r\n\r\nshortage of graduate teachers in schools, when more\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries are saying the same thing;  and\r\n\r\nwe  are a newly developing nation. But this much we\r\n\r\ncan  say.  Our standards are comparable.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to be ashamed about. In fact,  we  can  be\r\n\r\nvery  proud. The Member for Tanglin is a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Education Service himself. Is he proud of  the\r\n\r\nservice?  Why  should we belittle ourselves?  After\r\n\r\nall,  before we had even a college or a university,\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who had the opportunity for secondary\r\n\r\neducation  were taught by normal-trained  teachers.\r\n\r\nThey  did  not  have  more than  just  a  secondary\r\n\r\neducation. Some of them were probably some  of  the\r\n\r\nfinest specimens of what teachers should be.  Their\r\n\r\ndedication,   their  love  for  the   school,   for\r\n\r\neducation and for the pupils - I mean, it  is  all  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of the quality of the persons  concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd   I  have  confidence  that  in  Singapore  the\r\n\r\nteachers  in  general, despite the additional  work\r\n\r\nrequired for nation-building and other things, will\r\n\r\nrise  to  the occasion, as they have. I am  pleased\r\n\r\nand  proud  that they are holding up  the  standard\r\n\r\nbravely,  and  this, all of us  can  be  proud  of,\r\n\r\nbecause  before long, we ourselves will not  be  on\r\n\r\nthe  stage,  but  just spectators  looking  at  the\r\n\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\ncomplaining that we are lacking in high  standards.\r\n\r\nI  am  proud, Sir, that we have maintained our high\r\n\r\nstandards.   Our  high  standards  are   not   only\r\n\r\ncomparable to, but in some cases, they excel  those\r\n\r\nof  other  countries. We can now say that our  boys\r\n\r\ncan  go to some of the best universities abroad and\r\n\r\neven  top  the pass list. Sir, but with  all  these\r\n\r\nincreasing  difficulties,  naturally,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nexpress our worries; that if we go on like this, it\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be  difficult to maintain  the  high\r\n\r\nstandards.   For   instance,  Sir,   the   Minister\r\n\r\nemphasises the importance of technical training and\r\n\r\nscience  training. What is the use  of  having  new\r\n\r\nschools, laboratories and technical schools  if  we\r\n\r\ncannot  retain our science teachers? We  might  say\r\n\r\nthat  our organisation is hanging by just a  single\r\n\r\nthread.  If  one  teacher  resigns  today,   in   a\r\n\r\nparticular  section,  we  cannot  run  our  science\r\n\r\nstudies.  That  is  a  very  precarious  state   of\r\n\r\naffairs.  We should have a reserve always in  every\r\n\r\nbranch. In case the first line goes, then there  is\r\n\r\na second line. But, at the moment, we cannot do it,\r\n\r\nSir, I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister,\r\n\r\nbecause he does not control the finance. It is good\r\n\r\nof him to say that aided schools can, if necessary,\r\n\r\npay more to engage or retain their specialists. But\r\n\r\nit  would be better if, for the sake of equality of\r\n\r\ntreatment,  it  could be done  by  the  Government,\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is  the fairest way  of  maintaining\r\n\r\nefficiency all round. It is not easy, Sir,  to  get\r\n\r\nbenefactors  to  donate money nowadays  because  of\r\n\r\nvarious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We have taken steps, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, to train more teachers  for  science\r\n\r\nteaching.

I am afraid those are days of the  past.\r\n\r\nIf  we are in any way to cope with the rapid growth\r\n\r\nof the population, our schools will have to take in\r\n\r\nmore pupils than they did in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nthe past. For example, in our proposed new schools,\r\n\r\nthe  enrolment would actually reach something  like\r\n\r\n2,000: 1,000 for the morning session and 1,000  for\r\n\r\nthe afternoon session. And in certain schools which\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to  build by next year, or by  1962,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a ten-storey school in Selegie  Road,  we\r\n\r\nwill have a total enrolment of close to 3,000,  and\r\n\r\nin  Silat Road an enrolment of 4,000. Of course, we\r\n\r\ncannot  say  that  this is ideal,  but  because  of\r\n\r\neconomy we will have to make the best possible  use\r\n\r\nof   what   we  have. Under  the  present  Schools,\r\n\r\nRegulations, 1957. Regulation 115 does say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Except with the permission of the Director [which\r\n\r\nmeans the Director of Education] given by notice in\r\n\r\nwriting  to  the  supervisor,  not  more  than  one\r\n\r\nthousand two hundred pupils shall be in the charge\r\n\r\nof  any  one  principal, and pupils  controlled  by\r\n\r\ndifferent  principals shall  not  occupy  the  same\r\n\r\nschool  building or buildings at one and  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  I  think  the  formula of  500  pupils  to  one\r\n\r\nprincipal is too generous a formula to be  accepted\r\n\r\nin  these  present times. We allow a  principal  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  a  school. It may be that  in  certain\r\n\r\nrural  schools  there  is only  a  morning  session\r\n\r\nbecause there are not enough pupils to fill up  the\r\n\r\nafternoon  session. But in city schools there  will\r\n\r\nonly   be  one  principal  for  both  morning   and\r\n\r\nafternoon sessions. If the enrolment of the  school\r\n\r\nexceeds  2,000,  we are prepared to  have  a  \r\n\r\nvice-principal appointed who will be in receipt of  \r\n\r\none-half of the allowance applicable to the principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no doubt\r\n\r\nbecause  of  economic reasons, the Government  must\r\n\r\neconomise, but can we economise to the point  where\r\n\r\nthere is inadequate supervision of the education of\r\n\r\nthe  young? Sir, professionally speaking, I believe\r\n\r\nthose who are advising the Minister agree that if a\r\n\r\nhead has more than 500 pupils in a secondary school\r\n\r\nand  about  640 pupils or 16 classes in  a  primary\r\n\r\nschool,  he is running the risk of not knowing  his\r\n\r\npupils  as  human  beings but  merely  as  so  many\r\n\r\nfigures on the school roll. However, if the  number\r\n\r\nhas  to  exceed 500 in the secondary or 640 in  the\r\n\r\nprimary - and as the Government says if it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeyond  1,200  there  must be permission  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry - then it is only right that there should be\r\n\r\nanother  head with equal responsibility and  almost\r\n\r\nequal remuneration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arrangement that is being introduced now\r\n\r\nis  that  no  matter how large a  school  is  there\r\n\r\nshould   be  just  one  head  drawing  a   headship\r\n\r\nallowance. I agree that there should be one overall\r\n\r\nhead  in control of a big school, or of a group  of\r\n\r\nunits  on the same site, in order to preserve unity\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure  co-ordination. But  to  insist  on\r\n\r\nhaving  only one head drawing a headship  allowance\r\n\r\nwhen  the  total  enrolment  is  beyond  1,000   is\r\n\r\nexpecting  too  much  from  a  human  being.   Sir,\r\n\r\nhitherto I think no Government school has grown  as\r\n\r\nlarge as some of the aided schools. I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  Chung  Cheng High School has an  enrolment  of\r\n\r\nsomething like 4.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> 3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> 3,000. The Chinese High School\r\n\r\nhas  also  round  about 3,000. Some  of  the  aided\r\n\r\nschools  are  almost reaching that figure.  So  the\r\n\r\nproposed reorganisation in which the aided  schools\r\n\r\nare  co-operating is such that if one man  only  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the  head-ship allowance  and  the  rest  as\r\n\r\nsenior  assistants  are asked to  do  the  work  of\r\n\r\nprincipals  without even getting  an  extra  dollar\r\n\r\nallowance - unless,  of course,  they  are  appointed\r\n\r\nvice-principals - I think it is expecting  too  much\r\n\r\nfrom  them to shoulder all the responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nthe  regular  head.  What I envisage  is  that  the\r\n\r\nsenior  assistants performing the duties of a  head\r\n\r\nof, say, an afternoon session school of about 1,000\r\n\r\nor  1,200 pupils will say to the parents coming  in\r\n\r\nwith  their  problems, \"Sorry. I am not  the  head.\r\n\r\nWill  you please see the head?\" Whether we like  it\r\n\r\nor not, although the head is supposed to be on duty\r\n\r\nchiefly  in  the morning session, he must  shoulder\r\n\r\nall  the  problems  of the afternoon  session,  And\r\n\r\nwhere  there is also an evening session,  the  poor\r\n\r\nhead  is  in charge of three sessions with  overall\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  In theory, the  senior  assistants\r\n\r\nare supposed to carry out duties almost similar  to\r\n\r\nthose   of  independent  heads  in  their   various\r\n\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think  that is expecting too much from that  one\r\n\r\nhead. Sooner or later, he will have a breakdown, or\r\n\r\nhe will suffer from high-blood pressure, or have  a\r\n\r\nstroke.  Sir,  we have already had  such  cases.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister might know of a few cases where\r\n\r\nthe  strain  has been so continuous  that,  humanly\r\n\r\nspeaking, it is expecting too much of one  head  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  charge of three sessions with  the  aid  of\r\n\r\nsenior  assistants. My suggestion is that  where  a\r\n\r\nsenior  assistant does practically the  work  of  a\r\n\r\nprincipal,  he  should  be  given  at  least   some\r\n\r\nresponsibility   allowance,  not   because   senior\r\n\r\nassistants  are mercenary but because  it  is  only\r\n\r\nnatural - and  I am sure the trade union  experts  on\r\n\r\nthe Government side would agree in the interest  of\r\n\r\njustice - that it they are expected to carry out the\r\n\r\nduties  of the head in their single sessions,  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  some remuneration  so  that  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  one teacher as a senior  assistant\r\n\r\ncan  be  considered as a promotion. The appointment\r\n\r\nof  an  officer  as  a  senior assistant  today  is\r\n\r\nregarded as a penalty or a sentence whereby  he  is\r\n\r\nasked  to  do the work of a principal and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  shoulder  the  responsibilities  of  a\r\n\r\nprincipal, because if anything goes wrong he is  in\r\n\r\ntrouble.  Yet he is told that he cannot  draw  even\r\n\r\none  cent  more unless he becomes a vice-principal.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have  the situation in a very large  school\r\n\r\nwhere  we  have  only one overall head  and  senior\r\n\r\nassistants, where formerly there were three or four\r\n\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will look into this\r\n\r\nmatter - in  the  interest of  efficiency  consistent\r\n\r\nwith  economy,  because there  will  be  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nsaving - with  a  view to giving some  responsibility\r\n\r\nallowance to the senior assistants who perform  the\r\n\r\nduties of a head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall,  I would like to correct the figures mentioned\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Tanglin. The enrolment for  the\r\n\r\nChung  Cheng High School for last year  was  3,714,\r\n\r\nand  for  the Chinese High School it was 2,242.  It\r\n\r\nwas  not  4,000 for the Chung Cheng High School  as\r\n\r\nstated  by  the hon. Member. In fact,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlimitation to the enrolment of the Chung Cheng High\r\n\r\nSchool as a result of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfortunate  events in 1957. They are not  supposed\r\n\r\nto exceed S2 classes, thus bringing it to something\r\n\r\nlike  3,600 or 3,700. That is the maximum enrolment\r\n\r\npermissible  for the Chung Cheng High School.  Last\r\n\r\nyear,  this  school was the only school  which  was\r\n\r\npermitted  to appoint a vice-principal  because  of\r\n\r\nits  considerable enrolment and, as I have  already\r\n\r\nexplained,  we have already decided that  for  1961\r\n\r\nschools  with  an enrolment exceeding 2,000  pupils\r\n\r\nwill  be  permitted to appoint a vice-principal.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this will apply to at least a dozen  schools\r\n\r\nthe majority of which will be Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is one thing to say we have an ideal,\r\n\r\nand  another  thing to practise it. I have  already\r\n\r\nexplained that, for economic reasons, we are unable\r\n\r\nto bear the burden of one principal for 500 pupils.\r\n\r\nIt  is  just as well saying it is ideal to  have  a\r\n\r\nprivate tutor to look after your children.  If  you\r\n\r\ncan  afford it, well and good. But here we are  not\r\n\r\nthinking  in terms of education for the  elite.  We\r\n\r\nare  trying to provide education for the mass;  not\r\n\r\njust  tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands,\r\n\r\nand never in the history of Singapore are we giving\r\n\r\nso  much education to so many people. Because it is\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of the State to give  the  best\r\n\r\npossible education to as many as possible, so  that\r\n\r\nthose who are unfortunate from the point of view of\r\n\r\nfinance  may be able, after education,  to  improve\r\n\r\nand better their social and living standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that senior assistants regard their\r\n\r\nappointment as one of penalty is indeed  unfair  on\r\n\r\nthe   part  of  those  who  have  been  given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to assist the principal in  schools  to\r\n\r\nassume  heavier responsibility. And I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  every time we talk in terms of giving someone\r\n\r\na  little  more  responsibility, we must  dangle  a\r\n\r\ncarrot: here is so much money because you are doing\r\n\r\na  little extra. I feel that if we approach it from\r\n\r\nthis  point  of view, then we are all  a  bunch  of\r\n\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I do not know what the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law has to say.

And it is wrong for you to ask for  a  bit\r\n\r\nmore.\"  Sir, I wonder whether that is not  contrary\r\n\r\nto the principle of a workers' government. I am not\r\n\r\nasking that the Government should not economise.  I\r\n\r\nam   in  favour  of  it  in  view  of  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation.  But to ask that a senior assistant  act\r\n\r\nas,  say, the head of an afternoon session, who has\r\n\r\nto  go  to school even during holidays, who has  to\r\n\r\nattend  to  extra  duties, who  has  to  listen  to\r\n\r\ntelephone calls and problems during the night, that\r\n\r\nhe  should  be paid the same salary as the  regular\r\n\r\nteacher  on  the  staff who has  not  got  all  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  under him - if, Sir,  that  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy, and if they still  insist  on\r\n\r\nthat,  I suppose the teacher will have to take  it,\r\n\r\nalthough  I  must  say  we have  to  express  their\r\n\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case, Sir - this is very\r\n\r\npeculiar - that in the interests of economy, measures\r\n\r\nare  sometimes carried out too far.  There  is  one\r\n\r\ninstance  where  a  lady  principal  of  a  primary\r\n\r\nschool,  on  reaching the age of 50, was  asked  to\r\n\r\nretire. The obvious reason was that in that way the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  save  the principal's  allowance\r\n\r\nbecause she was already a principal. Sir, if a lady\r\n\r\nprincipal  is  asked to retire at the  age  of  50,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  she  cannot  draw  her  provident   fund.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the provident fund regulations,  she\r\n\r\nmust  be 55 - I am correct, Sir - before she is allowed\r\n\r\nto  withdraw her provident fund. If she is asked to\r\n\r\nleave and lose her job just because she happens  to\r\n\r\nhave been made principal and because of economy the\r\n\r\nprincipal's   allowance  must  be  cut   off   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  at the age of 50 she could be  got  rid\r\n\r\nof,   is  that  an  adequate  return  for  faithful\r\n\r\nservice?  I  am  sure,  Sir, in  the  interests  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the  morale  of  teachers  and  heads,\r\n\r\nsurely at the age of 50 a lady principal like  that\r\n\r\nshould  be allowed to continue to at least the  age\r\n\r\nof  55  when she could withdraw her provident  fund\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was another case of a lady teacher who\r\n\r\nin some way, because of qualifications, was given a\r\n\r\ngraduate  allowance but was teaching in  a  primary\r\n\r\nschool.  She was asked to retire at the age  of  50\r\n\r\nbecause thereby they could use her salary to employ\r\n\r\nmaybe  two or three young teachers. Surely  at  the\r\n\r\nage of 50, a lady teacher should not be retired. If\r\n\r\nthat  is the case, then the Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nregulations  must  be revised to  the  point  where\r\n\r\npeople  who  retire  at  50 should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  their provident fund benefits.

Are there  enough\r\n\r\nreligious teachers to meet the demands for 1961?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan, it will be necessary\r\n\r\nto  discuss  the question of religious teaching  in\r\n\r\nschools  in  principle. Except for schools  in  the\r\n\r\nMalay  medium, we are discouraging the teaching  of\r\n\r\nreligion  in the other streams. In fact,  religious\r\n\r\nteaching  in  mission schools will be  an  optional\r\n\r\nsubject as from 1961. As a special lee-way, because\r\n\r\ncertain  pupils prepare religious knowledge  as  an\r\n\r\nexamination   subject  for  the  Senior   Cambridge\r\n\r\nExamination,  it has been agreed with  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nChristian  Council that the teaching  of  religious\r\n\r\nknowledge   in   the  English  schools   would   be\r\n\r\npermissible  for Form 4 and Form 5  if  the  pupils\r\n\r\nchoose to take it as a subject for the examination.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, we are trying to discourage, being\r\n\r\na  secular  State,  the  teaching  of  religion  in\r\n\r\nschools proper. But noting the special position  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  in  the Constitution,  where  religion\r\n\r\nforms  part  of  the  school  curriculum,  we   are\r\n\r\ndesirous  that  Malays  who  wish  to  study  their\r\n\r\nreligion would join the religious schools.  If  the\r\n\r\npupils are attending the morning session, then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, they should attend the afternoon session of\r\n\r\nthe   religious  schools,  and  vice  versa.  These\r\n\r\nschools will receive aid from the Government at the\r\n\r\nrate of $10 per annum per pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.

But  in\r\n\r\naddition  to that, there is another point  which  I\r\n\r\nsee   I  must  explain.  I  must  plead  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, particularly the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister for Education, on this matter, because the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Ulu  Pandan said  just  now  that  the\r\n\r\ncandidates  appointed  as  religious  teachers  are\r\n\r\ncandidates   who  possess  the  highest   religious\r\n\r\nqualifications. But, Mr Speaker, if  we  carefully\r\n\r\nconsider  the emoluments of the religious teachers,\r\n\r\nwe see that the remuneration of the overseer in the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College is much better than that\r\n\r\nof   a  religious  teacher,  So  if  they  are   in\r\n\r\npossession of the highest qualifications, and their\r\n\r\nremuneration  as  a  religious teacher  is  low,  I\r\n\r\nconsider  that their status is not being given  due\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I  feel  that  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation   should  reconsider  this  matter.   The\r\n\r\nmaximum of the annual increment is $7.50 a year, if\r\n\r\nwe  compare  it  with the other provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates. There is no religious college here.  So,\r\n\r\ncomparatively speaking, the disparity is great. May\r\n\r\nI  get  a reply from the Minister for Education  in\r\n\r\nregard  to my question? Does the Minister  consider\r\n\r\nthe  status of the Malay religious teachers low  or\r\n\r\nthat   the   certificates   are   not   given   due\r\n\r\nrecognition, and hence, they receive a lower pay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As explained previously, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe question of salary scales has not been altered,\r\n\r\nand  so this is a carry-over of what used to be the\r\n\r\neffective scale for teachers appointed as  teachers\r\n\r\nof  religion in Malay schools. I have been  advised\r\n\r\nthat  the teachers so appointed are those who  have\r\n\r\ncompleted seven years of primary education in  what\r\n\r\nis  known  as sekolah ra'ayat or religious schools,\r\n\r\nwhere  they  teach  partly religious  subjects  and\r\n\r\npartly  normal school subjects. So that the  salary\r\n\r\nscale  would  appear  to apply  to  those  who  are\r\n\r\nappointed with a primary school education. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  best  course in the circumstances because,  as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kampong Kembangan has said, there is\r\n\r\nno  higher religious college in Singapore. The only\r\n\r\none  existing is in Klang, where there is a  Muslim\r\n\r\ncollege.

They work according to a rough formula of\r\n\r\nproviding  six servants for a secondary school  and\r\n\r\nfour  servants  for  a primary school.  It  depends\r\n\r\nagain  on  whether the school has a  large  playing\r\n\r\nfield which would then require more gardeners,  who\r\n\r\ncome  under the category of servants. If there  are\r\n\r\nthree  or four schools grouped together using  just\r\n\r\none  playing-field, then I suppose there will be  a\r\n\r\nlittle  give and take. Three schools - 3 x 4  is  12\r\n\r\nservants - I  suppose then they  could  do  with  two\r\n\r\nservants less, because all of them are sharing  one\r\n\r\nfield and things like that. There are instances, of\r\n\r\ncourse, where it is probably cheaper to purchase an\r\n\r\nelectric  lawn  motor  in  place  of  one  or   two\r\n\r\nservants.

I have to refer  to  this,\r\n\r\nSir,  because some time last year, heads of schools\r\n\r\nwere shocked when they were told that the number of\r\n\r\ntheir school servants was to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe reduced, even in the case where a school had new\r\n\r\nbuildings with a larger floor area. One school  was\r\n\r\nasked  to reduce the servants quota by three.  Sir,\r\n\r\nafter  a  lot  of  time  had  been  wasted  in  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of a detailed memorandum to explain the\r\n\r\nsituation  of  new buildings, more floor  area  and\r\n\r\nlarge  fields, at last the number reduced  was  one\r\n\r\ninstead  of three. Sir, I am not speaking  for  the\r\n\r\nheads  of  schools. I am speaking for the  servants\r\n\r\nthis  time.  How  could the servants  appreciate  a\r\n\r\nreduction  when  the schools had increased  by  new\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  they were told that  their  present\r\n\r\nstaff  must  be reduced by One? So what the  school\r\n\r\nhad  to  do was to employ an extra servant and  pay\r\n\r\nout of private funds. Sir, with this double session\r\n\r\nand  in  some  school  cases  triple  session,  the\r\n\r\nservants  are complaining that if the Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was applied then they could  really  ask\r\n\r\nfor  overtime. But because they have been  long  in\r\n\r\nthe  service of the school and they also  have  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of give and take, they would rather not  do\r\n\r\nit, Sir, and they naturally ask that they should be\r\n\r\nsupplied  with additional servants in order  to  do\r\n\r\nthe  work  better. I know of cases where they  work\r\n\r\nfrom  6.30  a.m. until 7 or even past 7  p.m.  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  of that, I am glad that the Minister  has\r\n\r\ngiven  an  assurance that in a spirit of  give  and\r\n\r\ntake, depending on circumstances, he is prepared to\r\n\r\nadjust  the number of school servants allocated  to\r\n\r\nschools.

As usual, in the\r\n\r\npast,  those were the only schools that existed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. All other schools did not  exist  at\r\n\r\nall.  Aided schools just carried on. They presented\r\n\r\ntheir  cheques  and money was forthcoming.  Anyway,\r\n\r\nthe hours of work for school servants have been the\r\n\r\nsame  as in the past. Mondays to Fridays 7 a.m. to 6.45 p.m.; not 6.30 in the morning nor 7 o'clock at night; Saturdays from 7 to 11 a.m., total 44  hours\r\n\r\na  week.  This  circular  will  be  issued  to  all\r\n\r\nstreams, including aided schools. Then there  is  a\r\n\r\nfurther  circular  issued in February  1959,  about\r\n\r\nextra  remuneration for school servants in  respect\r\n\r\nof  additional work.

Once  again,  whereas   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools  they were paid  during  school\r\n\r\nsessions,  that is to say, exclusive  of  holidays,\r\n\r\nservants in aided schools were paid 12 months in  a\r\n\r\nyear.

Sir,  regarding\r\n\r\nextra  remuneration and working hours, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nproblem  is  not appreciated unless we are  on  the\r\n\r\nscene  with  the school servants. If they  commence\r\n\r\noperations  at  7.15 a.m., it  will  be  too  late,\r\n\r\nbecause  some of our students are in the  habit  of\r\n\r\ncoming  to  school very early. The  doors  must  be\r\n\r\nopen,  otherwise  the children  will  be  hammering\r\n\r\nimpatiently at the school doors. Those in charge of\r\n\r\nopening  the classroom doors and office doors  have\r\n\r\nto  be  on  duty  much  earlier.  If  there  is  an\r\n\r\nafternoon  session and a night session, one  cannot\r\n\r\nassume that the servants only do the sweeping  once\r\n\r\na  day, because after the morning session, there is\r\n\r\nalready  one quota of dirt all over the  place.  We\r\n\r\ntry  to relieve the burden of the servants in  some\r\n\r\nschools  by  having  service squads  clean  up  the\r\n\r\nclassrooms before the pupils go home. This is  just\r\n\r\nto  lighten the burden of the servants.  Then  when\r\n\r\nthe  new  session  comes in in the  afternoon,  you\r\n\r\ncannot tell the children to keep things as clean as\r\n\r\nadults  could.  After that, there will  be  another\r\n\r\nquota  of  dirt. At night there is a third session.\r\n\r\nVery  often,  Sir,  we  have visitors  and  parents\r\n\r\ncoming  round.  Surely we do not  want  the  school\r\n\r\nbuildings  to  be at any moment in an unpresentable\r\n\r\nstate.  So, naturally, the servants, after sweeping\r\n\r\noff  the dirt of the morning session, will have  to\r\n\r\nsweep off the dirt of the afternoon session, and at\r\n\r\nnight, they have to sweep off the dirt of the night\r\n\r\nsession also. I do not know how we can stagger  the\r\n\r\nwork  so  that the servants can just do  their  own\r\n\r\nparticular quota as if they are working only for  a\r\n\r\none-session school. It is not easy, and we will  be\r\n\r\nglad if the Ministry could really supply us with  a\r\n\r\nworkable scheme. But we, who are in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharge  of  schools, realise that with  the  triple\r\n\r\nsession  coming in, the work will become a hardship\r\n\r\nto these servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding remuneration, I wonder how $8\r\n\r\nextra  per  month  for six days a week  plus  extra\r\n\r\nlabour  not  in single-session schools but  double,\r\n\r\nand in some cases triple-session schools, is worked\r\n\r\nout. Maybe the servants would rather work it out on\r\n\r\nan  overtime basis and calculate it at  rates  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  approved by the Labour Ministry. I  really\r\n\r\nfeel, Sir, that $8 per month extra where we have  a\r\n\r\ntriple-session or a double-session  school  is  not\r\n\r\nadequate for the labour and the time involved. Sir,\r\n\r\na  thing like this naturally takes the heart out of\r\n\r\nthe labourers if they are told that. In the case of\r\n\r\nthe school of which I am at the moment in charge, I\r\n\r\ndo not propose even to implement this, because I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it  is  fair. The principals  of  aided\r\n\r\nschools have been instructed that since December is\r\n\r\na  vacation month, Sir, the extra allowance  of  $5\r\n\r\nfor  December should not be payable. Naturally  the\r\n\r\nservants  reason  that  if fees  for  December  are\r\n\r\ncollected  and  teachers  are  paid  for  December,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is a vacation month or not, why  should\r\n\r\nthey  not have their allowance? Maybe there is some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding, but the circular has been issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Of course, Sir, there is no\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.  I  have  told  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nTanglin  just  now that that is the position.  Many\r\n\r\nthings  took place in the past where aided  schools\r\n\r\njust did as they pleased and presented a cheque.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is unfair for those working in Government\r\n\r\nschools  to be given poorer terms. If the principle\r\n\r\nwas  to pay extra remuneration for extra work, then\r\n\r\nif  there  was no work because of the  holidays.  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  it was only fair that during the  holidays\r\n\r\nthey  should  not receive this extra  emolument.  I\r\n\r\nfind  it  most amusing indeed that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  is  taking such a great  interest  in  all\r\n\r\nmatters  educational just in the last few weeks  of\r\n\r\nhis  active service in education.

Unless the Labour Ordinance says that\r\n\r\nthose  working in Government service  are  excluded\r\n\r\nfrom  the  ambit of the Labour Ordinance, then  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation is possible. But,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  not  aware  of  the  Labour  Ordinance\r\n\r\nexcluding  servants working for the Government  who\r\n\r\ncould otherwise have come within the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Ordinance. And even if this  group  of\r\n\r\npersons  are  specifically excluded by  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance  on the basis that they are  servants  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government - I understand that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  is bringing up a  new  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ordinance -  perhaps  he  might  give   this\r\n\r\ncategory his earnest consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I suppose I will ask my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Labour and Law, to read\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard to see whether he would like to follow\r\n\r\nit up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, counting\r\n\r\nthe  number  of hours stipulated, it does  come  to\r\n\r\nnine  hours; but I suppose if you deduct the period\r\n\r\nof  recess, and so on, it comes within the limit of\r\n\r\nthe eight hours. Unfortunately, in practice, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible, as the Member for Tanglin is  trying\r\n\r\nto  point out. A servant is supposed to start  work\r\n\r\nat  7.45 a.m. but he cannot do so at 7.45 a.m.; and\r\n\r\nhe  is  supposed to finish at 6.30 p.m., but it  is\r\n\r\nnot  practical as he cannot finish it by 6.30  p.m.\r\n\r\nThe  principals merely try to follow the Government\r\n\r\nregulations to the letter so that they  do  not  go\r\n\r\nagainst the Labour Ordinance, but I feel that it is\r\n\r\nin  a way cheating these servants, especially those\r\n\r\nservants  who do not have quarters in the  schools.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have  to do is to keep within  the  eight\r\n\r\nhours and say, \"All right, you work this number  of\r\n\r\nhours  before  school, this number of hours  during\r\n\r\nschool, and this number of hours after school.\" And\r\n\r\nthen  we  work  it  out for each  session  so  that\r\n\r\naccording  to the timetable on paper, the  servants\r\n\r\nwork  eight hours a day. But then the servant  does\r\n\r\nnot  work  only eight hours a day. During the  time\r\n\r\nwhen he is supposed to be free, as he has no living\r\n\r\nquarters in the school, he is at the beck and  call\r\n\r\nof  the  principal. He has nowhere  to  go  but  to\r\n\r\nremain  in school; and should there be any work  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  for the school, for example, if  a  child\r\n\r\nfeels sick and messes up the floor, who else but he\r\n\r\nwill  have  to clean it up? The servant  is  needed\r\n\r\nduring  the  time  when it is supposed  to  be  his\r\n\r\nrelief hour. So actually even if you space it  out,\r\n\r\nas  the principals are doing now, so that it can be\r\n\r\nsaid  that the servants are working eight  hours  a\r\n\r\nday  as  laid down in the Labour Ordinance, I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  it  is really cheating them, because as  they\r\n\r\nare  not  free  to  go home and they  do  not  have\r\n\r\nquarters,  they  are not resting during  the  hours\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  supposed to be resting.

But\r\n\r\naccording to the Pensions Ordinance, which  I  have\r\n\r\nread,  the  retiring age for a woman is five  years\r\n\r\nbelow  that of a man. Since the retiring age  of  a\r\n\r\nman  is 50 years with an option of retiring at  the\r\n\r\nage of 55 years, I take it that the women would  be\r\n\r\nretiring  at  the  age of 45 years  and  compulsory\r\n\r\nretirement at 50 years. Before I go to the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund question, could I have clarification\r\n\r\nof  that, because it all depends on when the  woman\r\n\r\nis asked to, retire?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that relevant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes. If the woman is asked\r\n\r\nto  retire  at 50, then the situation is  different\r\n\r\nwith  the  Central Provident Fund. But  if  she  is\r\n\r\nasked  to  retire at 55, then my argument will  not\r\n\r\nhold any water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The position is as the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has  said. But the point was raised  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague.  It was not merely because  of  the  age\r\n\r\nfactor but because there was the statement made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanglin  that  she  lost  certain\r\n\r\nprovident fund benefits as a result of retiring  at\r\n\r\nthat  age. And I think that, because of this, there\r\n\r\nmight  have been special circumstances that  needed\r\n\r\nlooking into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it\r\n\r\nthat  the compulsory age for retirement for a woman\r\n\r\nis  50 years. Therefore, I would like to point this\r\n\r\nout,   especially  with  regard  to  women   school\r\n\r\nteachers.  They have to contribute to  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund. Nevertheless, there is provision in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance that a school teacher who has served\r\n\r\n15   years - including  principals - and  has   reached\r\n\r\nretiring   age,  which  is  either  45   years   or\r\n\r\ncompulsory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretirement  at  50  years, is  entitled  to \r\n\r\nthree-quarters of what she would have got if she were not\r\n\r\nmarried.  The  difficult situation arises - in  fact,\r\n\r\ndouble difficulty for the woman-in this way. At  45\r\n\r\nyears  of age a woman teacher retires. She has  all\r\n\r\nthe  time  been  contributing towards  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund.  When  she retires,  she  opts  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  three-quarters pension  plus  whatever\r\n\r\ngratuities it carries - three-quarters of  the  usual\r\n\r\ngratuity. Now whatever she has contributed  towards\r\n\r\nthe  provident  fund she is not  able  to  draw  on\r\n\r\nretirement. The Central Provident Fund is  supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  a  sum to help the worker when  he  or  she\r\n\r\nretires. When she retires, she is not able to  draw\r\n\r\nthat  amount. The double difficulty is  this.  From\r\n\r\nher  gratuity is deducted the amount the Government\r\n\r\nhas paid into the Provident Fund because there is a\r\n\r\nrule  in a Government Ordinance that when they  pay\r\n\r\nout  any  gratuity or any pension, or any money  at\r\n\r\nall  to  their employees, on retirement, they  take\r\n\r\nout everything that is due to the Government before\r\n\r\nthe  sum is given to the pensioner. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nwoman  has to pay not only her share of the Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund - and not being able to  withdraw  it\r\n\r\nfor  another ten years, because she is not able  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw it until she has reached 55 years - but she\r\n\r\nhas  also to pay for the Government's share on  her\r\n\r\nretirement.  So that if she has put in $5;000,  she\r\n\r\nhas  to  pay Government's share of $5,000 and  that\r\n\r\nmoney  will  be in the Central Provident  Fund  for\r\n\r\nanother ten years until she reaches the age  of  55\r\n\r\nyears. So I feel that that is very unfair on women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am just wondering whether the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  prepared to answer.

It is so\r\n\r\nlong that in the end -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> To bring about\r\n\r\nstandardisation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - the one who drew up this\r\n\r\ncircular,  Sir, decided that the people would  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty either in understanding or carrying  out\r\n\r\nthe  details  of  the circular, so  a  meeting  was\r\n\r\nconvened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second circular went out, dated about 8 days\r\n\r\nlater. Paragraph (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The attached notes [some more notes, Sir] have\r\n\r\nbeen drawn up to introduce uniformity in the matter\r\n\r\nof  calculating of fees of individual  stallholders\r\n\r\nand   to  assist  school  tuckshop  committees   in\r\n\r\ndetermining the monthly fees to he paid.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Paragraph (3) :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A meeting of all principals of schools affected\r\n\r\nby   Education  Circular  33/60  will  be  held  as\r\n\r\nscheduled below to clarify any doubts you may  have\r\n\r\nregarding the circular and the attached notes, and\r\n\r\nto   expound   procedure  and  other  details   not\r\n\r\nmentioned in the circular.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is \"to expound procedure and other\r\n\r\ndetails\".  So, in due course, the heads of  schools\r\n\r\nwent  there.  Sir, I had to be here, so  my  senior\r\n\r\nassistant had to go. I was told, Sir, when I  asked\r\n\r\nfor  a  report,  that it was just to  listen  to  a\r\n\r\ndirective. No request was made whether they had any\r\n\r\nimprovements to suggest or whether the  system  was\r\n\r\nreally  the best possible. They were just  convened\r\n\r\nto  listen to an exposition of this thing. Somebody\r\n\r\nexpounded  and  they were asked to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\norders.  Sir,  that is the spirit which  democratic\r\n\r\npeople  do  not  quite  appreciate.  If  there   is\r\n\r\nsomething  not  quite right with the  system,  they\r\n\r\nshould be given the right to say so and their views\r\n\r\nshould  be  considered by the Ministry  before  the\r\n\r\nthing is given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   them  just  like  that.  In  that  case,   the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the heads of schools  in, tuckshop\r\n\r\nmanagement counts for nothing. In fact, the  system\r\n\r\nintroduced in all the schools here was tried out in\r\n\r\nmany of the older schools, and they found something\r\n\r\neven  better. Now, will the Minister assure us that\r\n\r\nif  a  system  is  better than the  system  he  has\r\n\r\nintroduced,  should it be scrapped in favour  of  a\r\n\r\nworse  system for the sake of uniformity?  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nwant equality. But when it comes to uniformity,  it\r\n\r\nis just like saying, we want a standard-size dress,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the average one, and we ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Labour  and  Law,  who  is  rather  huge   in\r\n\r\nproportion, Sir, to go into that standard suit.  He\r\n\r\nbecomes  too  big for that. And we ask  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to go into that suit, Sir.  He  may\r\n\r\nnot  want it. In fact, Sir, I have been told by one\r\n\r\nhead  of a Government school that when he tried  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this, he found that the hawkers  in  his\r\n\r\nschool  canteen were going to be made to, pay  more\r\n\r\nthan  they were then paying. Sir, the system  which\r\n\r\nwas  devised  in one larger school  was  on  a \r\n\r\nco-partnership basis. Here the hawkers contribute 5 to\r\n\r\n10  per cent of the gross takings to the school  in\r\n\r\nreturn  for use of equipment and canteen.  If  they\r\n\r\nmake  their  foodstuffs attractive  and  delicious,\r\n\r\nnaturally, more school children buy the  stuff,  so\r\n\r\nthey  make  more  profit. If they  give  foodstuffs\r\n\r\nwhich  the  children consider to be below  quality,\r\n\r\nthey  will not buy; so they will get less. So, this\r\n\r\nkind  of  a system, Sir, is much better than  where\r\n\r\nthe rates are fixed. The hawkers are happier and so\r\n\r\nare  the  children and teachers, because  they  get\r\n\r\ngood   quality  food.  The  school  is  also  happy\r\n\r\nalthough  it  does not get as much as it  will  get\r\n\r\nunder this proposal. Sir, under this proposal,  all\r\n\r\nthe  net  takings  are  to be  surrendered  to  the\r\n\r\nAccountant-General. The Government  will  only  get\r\n\r\n$100  from  each primary school. Sir, in the  past,\r\n\r\ntiffin  shed  profits were ploughed back  into  the\r\n\r\nschools  for  the  benefit of the schools  and  the\r\n\r\nschool  children.  Under  this  scheme,  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nprofits are sent to the Accountant-General for  the\r\n\r\nrevenue of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, aided schools, since they have to pay for\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the  cost  of  the  buildings,  are  more\r\n\r\nfortunate  in that they are allowed to  retain  the\r\n\r\nprofits  which  are to be ploughed  back  into  the\r\n\r\nschools.  But surely, Sir, in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren  in Government schools, at least  half  of\r\n\r\nthe  profits should be retained in the schools for\r\n\r\nthe  use of the school children. In any case,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  authoritative attitude militates against  the\r\n\r\nfresh   ideas   that   are   being   received   for\r\n\r\nimprovement. I would suggest, Sir, that in view  of\r\n\r\nwhat the Minister has said about the spirit of give\r\n\r\nand  take,  the same should prevail down below,  so\r\n\r\nthat  before  anything is made  cut  and  dry,  the\r\n\r\nprincipals   of  schools  or  the  Head   Teachers'\r\n\r\nConference - if it is resuscitated - would  be  invited\r\n\r\nto   discuss  the  pros  and  cons  and   to   make\r\n\r\nsuggestions for further improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next subject I would like to touch on -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have to remind honourable\r\n\r\nMembers  that this debate ends at 7.45  p.m.,  that\r\n\r\nis,  another  quarter of an hour.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether tuckshops can be disposed of in a couple of\r\n\r\nminutes before we touch on any other subject? I see\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Farrer Park is also interested\r\n\r\nin this particular matter-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not on tuckshops, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. Perhaps we could deal with\r\n\r\ntuckshops. The Minister might wish to give his\r\n\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has touched on\r\n\r\nthe question of school tuckshops. He asked just now\r\n\r\nwhy  these inspectors were not allotted better work\r\n\r\nto  do,  instead  of  sending them  to  investigate\r\n\r\ntuckshop  problems.  We must understand  that  only\r\n\r\ninspectors  can  be  sent  to  investigate  matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to  schools. When we send  inspectors  to\r\n\r\ninspect  the  tuckshops, we do not mean  they  must\r\n\r\ninterfere with the schools' internal matters. Their\r\n\r\npurpose is to supervise, to see that hawkers in the\r\n\r\ntuckshops  carry out their services  properly,  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  see  whether the tuckshop  committee  has\r\n\r\nproperly carried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout the directives of the Education Ministry. As to\r\n\r\nanother issue raised, he said that in the circular,\r\n\r\nthe word \"shall\" was used. He touched on this word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to show what the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nwanted   them  to  do  because  this   relates   to\r\n\r\ndirectives by the Ministry more or less on  matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to legal aspects. Therefore, we must  use\r\n\r\nthe  word \"shall\" and we must not use other  terms.\r\n\r\nThis  is very clear. The Member for Tanglin is  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  of  an  English  school  and  he  should\r\n\r\nespecially understand this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member does not entirely understand the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unions  there  are  for  hawkers.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  recognises  the School  Canteen  Vendors'\r\n\r\nAssociation,  because  from  the  list  of  members\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the Ministry, we know how many members\r\n\r\nthere  are.  We are satisfied that the  members  of\r\n\r\nthat   union  outnumber  those  of  other  hawkers'\r\n\r\nunions.  As  far  as I know, the membership  totals\r\n\r\nover  1.000.  Therefore, we  have  written  to  the\r\n\r\nschools   saying   that   the   above   association\r\n\r\nrepresents the school hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that the rents paid for\r\n\r\nstalls  have increased. This is not true. Formerly,\r\n\r\nthere were two kinds of schools: Government schools\r\n\r\nand  aided schools. In the past, the stalls in  the\r\n\r\naided  schools  were  rented  out  through  tenders\r\n\r\ncalling  for contracts. In this respect, the  rents\r\n\r\nwere  higher. But since the introduction last  year\r\n\r\nof   the   unification  of  rents   affecting   all\r\n\r\ntuckshops, they have been reduced by half. In  some\r\n\r\nschools,  they pay slightly more than  the  average\r\n\r\nrent.  After  one year of experience, some  trouble\r\n\r\nhas  arisen.  Therefore, we have  classified  these\r\n\r\nrents  as `A', `B', `C', `D', and `E'. If a  school\r\n\r\nbelongs to the `A' class, it means to say that  the\r\n\r\nstudents  of  that school have a higher  purchasing\r\n\r\npower. The leviable sum on that school is 18  cents\r\n\r\nper  pupil. On a `B' class school, it is  16  cents\r\n\r\nper pupil. On a `C' class school, perhaps it is  13\r\n\r\ncents per pupil, and on a `D' class school, perhaps\r\n\r\nit  is 10 cents per pupil. The schools belonging to\r\n\r\nthe  `A' class are very few in number. What I  have\r\n\r\njust said applies only to primary schools. The  `B'\r\n\r\nclass\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools are more than the `A' class schools, and so\r\n\r\non.  The rates charged are fair to all hawkers. The\r\n\r\nrates paid by the hawkers in Government schools are\r\n\r\npaid   to  the  Government.  The  fees  from  aided\r\n\r\nschools,  of  course, are allotted  to  some  other\r\n\r\nproper channel-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye) rose -</b>\r\n\r\n<b></b>\r\n\r\n<b><br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b></b> Dr Toh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nmove a motion to censure and suspend the Member for\r\n\r\nHong   Lim   unless  he  apologises   for   certain\r\n\r\nmisdemeanours committed in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have waited for the Member for Hong Lim to be\r\n\r\npresent in this Chamber to move this motion, but as\r\n\r\nhe  does not seem to be making an appearance  here,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  is getting late, I wish to  move  the\r\n\r\nmotion now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just wondering whether the\r\n\r\nLeader  of the House will make the request at  7.45\r\n\r\np.m. when we complete this debate.

It  seems  that  the\r\n\r\nofficials in their pettifogging officialdom do  not\r\n\r\nseem to understand the problems of school teachers,\r\n\r\nschool-masters  and  head-masters.  If   they   can\r\n\r\nconcede   the   point   that   the   teachers   and\r\n\r\nschoolmasters,  being nearer the  school  children,\r\n\r\nare  in a better position to appreciate educational\r\n\r\nproblems than Ministry officials, perhaps we  might\r\n\r\nbe  able  to restore some sort of peace and thereby\r\n\r\nensure  some  sort of progress in  the  educational\r\n\r\nfield. It seems to me that all that is happening in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today is a lot of frustration caused  by\r\n\r\nunnecessary circulars, petty regulations,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  one  which was read out this evening,  all  of\r\n\r\nwhich  seem  to  show  that  the  whole  point   of\r\n\r\neducation  is  being missed. Perhaps  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials have nothing else better to do than  seem\r\n\r\nto  be interested in tuckshops and spend their time\r\n\r\ndrafting regulations which run to 20 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to touch upon is the\r\n\r\nquestion of the six-day week for primary schools. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish  to  speak on the  six-day  week  for\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, because I do not feel that I  am\r\n\r\nsufficiently  competent to do so on  that  subject.\r\n\r\nBut on the question of primary schools, I would ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Education respectfully  to \r\n\r\nre-consider  the whole position in the light  of  what\r\n\r\nhas happened in the last year or so. Sir, I submit,\r\n\r\nwith respect, that in so far as the primary schools\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  the  six-day week  has  served  no\r\n\r\nuseful purpose. If anything, it has acted in a  way\r\n\r\nnot in the best interest of the primary schools. We\r\n\r\nwere made to understand that as the Chinese schools\r\n\r\nthemselves have a six-day week, perhaps it  is  not\r\n\r\nout  of place that the English schools should  also\r\n\r\nfall  into line. So I was surprised to read on page\r\n\r\n1  of this afternoon's Free Press under the heading\r\n\r\n\"Chinese  primary  school  hours  should  be   cut,\r\n\r\nMinister  told\" describing the hours  that  Chinese\r\n\r\nprimary  school teachers should be called  upon  to\r\n\r\nwork.  I have done some multiplication and division\r\n\r\nand find that it eventually comes to about 41 hours\r\n\r\na  day  which, when multiplied by five, gives  them\r\n\r\nthe time they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink that primary school teachers should be called\r\n\r\nupon  to  teach  in Chinese schools. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nseems  to  me that we could quite easily  get  back\r\n\r\ninto  the  five-day week in so far as  the  English\r\n\r\nstream is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to take up any more time of the\r\n\r\nHouse. Perhaps the Minister might want to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\nquickly answer the points raised by the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin. The circular mentioned is not meant to  be\r\n\r\nan   army   directive.  We  are  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  But,  unfortunately,  the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nthinks  that  \"shall\" is a command. I could  almost\r\n\r\nfeel that he was clicking his heels every time  the\r\n\r\nword  \"shall\" was mentioned. He takes the  view  of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  being asked to take some part  in  the\r\n\r\nmembership  of  a  school  tuckshop  committee   as\r\n\r\npolitical  interference. It is  far  from  that.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is important that Assemblymen, if they are\r\n\r\nprepared to offer their services, should know  what\r\n\r\ngoes  on  in their own constituencies. New  schools\r\n\r\nare  to  be erected. After all, almost every parent\r\n\r\nhas  at  least one or two children in  school.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  of  how  they  are  looked  after  in  the\r\n\r\ntuckshop is not confined to P.A.P. Assemblymen  but\r\n\r\nto  the  Assemblyman of the particular constituency\r\n\r\nin  which the school is. We welcome the presence of\r\n\r\nOpposition Members to see that all is well, so that\r\n\r\nthey  can be happy with what is going on, far  from\r\n\r\ninterfering with the responsibilities and powers of\r\n\r\nthe  principal.  Most of the difficulties  that  we\r\n\r\ncome  across are, of course, brought about  by  the\r\n\r\ndesire   of   bringing  the   four   streams   into\r\n\r\nuniformity. A simple analogy is this.  If  we  were\r\n\r\ndealing with only one stream of education, it would\r\n\r\nbe  like  a  ball rolling smoothly; but  with  four\r\n\r\nstreams  of education, it is like a cube.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot roll but it just wobbles here and there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come next to the remarks of the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park.  I  agree that officialdom  could  be\r\n\r\nsomewhat  stiff and officious in their bearing  and\r\n\r\nalso  in  the manner in which circulars and letters\r\n\r\nare  sent out. That is why it is necessary for  the\r\n\r\nofficials to go through a political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudy  course to understand that keeping  in  touch\r\n\r\nwith  the public is important, and I would  welcome\r\n\r\nmore  discussion groups and meetings of inspectors,\r\n\r\nprincipals  and teachers. These have  already  been\r\n\r\nstarted  and  I  would  encourage  more  of   these\r\n\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the six-day week for primary schools, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  that  there  will  be  no  change  in   the\r\n\r\neducational policy of Singapore, but I  can  inform\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park that, at the moment,  we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  devise  new time-tables  both  for\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary schools for 1961 whereby  we\r\n\r\nwill  be bringing all activities, which in the past\r\n\r\nwere considered as extra-mural activities, into the\r\n\r\nnormal  school curriculum. Since most  schools  are\r\n\r\nnow  normally working on two or three sessions,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  very  difficult  for  the  pupils  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning  session  to turn up in the  afternoon  for\r\n\r\ntheir  activities.

The terms of\r\n\r\nmy motion are-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nfor  his  dishonourable conduct  unbecoming  of  an\r\n\r\nelected  representative of the people, in  that  he\r\n\r\nrepeatedly used his privilege in this Assembly as a\r\n\r\ncloak   for   spreading  malicious  falsehoods   to\r\n\r\nunjustly  injure innocent persons both  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he be suspended from the service of this\r\n\r\nAssembly until such time as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) he apologises to this Assembly for his\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) he unreservedly withdraws his unfounded\r\n\r\nallegations  against the Prime  Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Law; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) he assures the Assembly that he will not\r\n\r\npersist  in  abusing his  privilege  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  for uttering malicious  falsehoods;\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) be prepared when challenged to repeat\r\n\r\noutside  the  Assembly the charges  he  makes\r\n\r\ninside the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have a copy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of the Motion handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think there are two points on\r\n\r\nwhich I must be satisfied. Firstly, whether or  not\r\n\r\nthis motion can be taken on a day allotted for  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of Supply. That is the first point that  I\r\n\r\nam  not quite certain about. I would like to  refer\r\n\r\nthe  Leader of the House and honourable Members  to\r\n\r\nthe  relevant Standing Order No. 85, paragraph (2),\r\n\r\nwhich reads -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On a day allotted to the business of Supply, the\r\n\r\nbusiness of Supply shall stand as the first  order,\r\n\r\nand  so long as the business of Supply has not been\r\n\r\ncompleted,  no business other than the business  of\r\n\r\nSupply  shall  be taken after 3 p.m. or  before  8 p.m.,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>the  other  part of the paragraph is not  relevant.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it appears to me that this motion,  which\r\n\r\nis  purported  to  be  moved without  notice  under\r\n\r\nStanding  Order No. 30, paragraph (e), is a  motion\r\n\r\nwhich   goes  beyond  merely  a  motion   for   the\r\n\r\nsuspension of a Member. Under Standing Order 30:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unless Standing Orders otherwise direct, notice\r\n\r\nshall  be  given of any motion which it is proposed\r\n\r\nto move with the exception of the following:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>*** *** ***</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) A motion for the suspension of a Member.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  appears  to  me  that in reading  the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders,  one  must read the Standing  Orders  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  The  Standing Orders are  really  aimed  at\r\n\r\ngiving  fair  notice  to  Members  of  any  motion,\r\n\r\nespecially one of grave import. It appears  to  me,\r\n\r\nat first glance, that Standing Order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30  (e) should be related to Standing Order 56 (1).\r\n\r\nThere  is  a motion there which could be  moved  to\r\n\r\nsuspend  a Member from the service of the  Assembly\r\n\r\non  the  initiative of the Speaker  when  there  is\r\n\r\ngrave disorder, abuse of the rules of the Assembly,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  I would like to consider this  point.\r\n\r\nThere  is little time left to carry on, unless,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the Leader gets the assent of the House  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with this business after 8  p.m.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that  I give  a  considered  ruling\r\n\r\ntomorrow at half-past two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> So be it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are now nearing 8 p.m. and if the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  agree, we could adjourn.
