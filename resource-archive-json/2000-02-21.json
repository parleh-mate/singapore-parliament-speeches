the development\r\n\r\nof   the   telecommunications  and   information   technology\r\n\r\nindustry,  especially in the industry's pricing  of  services\r\n\r\nand marketing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a fully\r\n\r\nliberalised  and  competitive market environment,  the  Info-communications  Development Authority of Singapore,  or  IDA,\r\n\r\nwill be moving towards regulating with a lighter touch.  This\r\n\r\nwill allow more freedom for telecom operators to innovate and\r\n\r\ncompete in terms of pricing and marketing.  However, IDA will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to uphold the key regulatory requirements  of  fair\r\n\r\nand  equitable inter-connection, inter-operability  and  open\r\n\r\naccess so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsumers  can transparently and seamlessly communicate  with\r\n\r\nothers  regardless  of whichever network  they  are  directly\r\n\r\nconnected  to.  Only then will consumers truly  benefit  from\r\n\r\ncompetition  in a multi-operator, multi-network  environment.\r\n\r\nIDA  also recognises that there will be a transitional  phase\r\n\r\nas  we  move towards a fully liberalised environment.  During\r\n\r\nthis  period, it will still be necessary for IDA  to  keep  a\r\n\r\nvigilant  watch over the industry to facilitate the entry  of\r\n\r\nnew players.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, press reports seem\r\n\r\nto  suggest that our telecommunications policies are  falling\r\n\r\nbehind Hong Kong and that we are playing catch up.

We  cannot  hide\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact  that we have stipulated a deadline  for  the\r\n\r\nopening  up  of  the market and this deadline was  stipulated\r\n\r\nwhen  we  first  privatised Singapore  Telecom  and  when  we\r\n\r\ninvited  tenders  for  the  second  fixed  line  network   in\r\n\r\nSingapore which was set in 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE TELECOM AND CABLE & WIRELESS HKT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Proposed merger)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he\r\n\r\nwill  explain the rationale for the merger between  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelecom  and Cable & Wireless HKT and whether there  are  any\r\n\r\nlong-term security concerns due to the dilution of Government\r\n\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if\r\n\r\nhe   will  state  the  Government's  position  regarding  the\r\n\r\nproposed  merger  between  Singapore  Telecom  and  Cable   &\r\n\r\nWireless  HKT,  and if there are any plans to  safeguard  our\r\n\r\nshareholders' interests in the proposed merger in the face of\r\n\r\nadverse reactions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom certain quarters of the business community in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, before I ask Question No. 2, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  declare my interest as an independent  director  of\r\n\r\nPacific Century Development Limited.  Question No. 2, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos\r\n\r\n2 and 3 together as they are related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you may.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the proposed merger is\r\n\r\ndriven  purely  by  commercial considerations.  The  combined\r\n\r\nentity,  which  would  become one  of  the  leading  regional\r\n\r\ntelcos,  would  be better positioned to face  the  challenges\r\n\r\nposed    by    the    rapidly   globalising   and    evolving\r\n\r\ntelecommunications industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential dilution of Government's shareholdings in\r\n\r\nSingTel  should  not pose security problems.   Concerns  over\r\n\r\nsecurity   confront   telecommunication   markets   worldwide\r\n\r\nwhenever mergers and acquisitions of telcos, whether  foreign\r\n\r\nor  local, take place.  However, these security concerns  can\r\n\r\nbe adequately addressed through the regulatory framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek Holdings and SingTel believe that the merger\r\n\r\nwill  create  value for the shareholders of both SingTel  and\r\n\r\nCable & Wireless HKT.  As with all commercial companies, they\r\n\r\ntake into account the interest of its shareholders, including\r\n\r\nminority  shareholders, when making any  business  decisions,\r\n\r\nparticularly major ones involving mergers and acquisitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not intend to institute any specific\r\n\r\nsafeguards  for shareholders, as the investing public  should\r\n\r\nexercise  prudence in their investments.  The  caveat  emptor\r\n\r\napplies to all investments, including investment using CPF as\r\n\r\nwell as those under Asset Enhancement schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I have two supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions.   The  first question is, if this  is  strictly  a\r\n\r\ncommercial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeal,  press  speculation is that it is more than  commercial\r\n\r\nbut  political as well, especially in our case,  one  of  our\r\n\r\nMinisters  has approached the Hong Kong government on  behalf\r\n\r\nof SingTel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that Government's shareholding in\r\n\r\nSingTel  will  continue to be diluted  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nloyalty  shares issued to current shareholders.  Which  point\r\n\r\nwill  the  Minister feel comfortable that we need to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  framework to make sure that Government still has control\r\n\r\nover SingTel?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, on the first question, I\r\n\r\nam  in  no position to comment on these speculations.   These\r\n\r\nare  pure speculations on the part of the media.  As  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government is concerned,  this  is  a  purely\r\n\r\ncommercial  consideration.  The fact that  Government  has  a\r\n\r\nmajor shareholding is irrelevant in this particular case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, whilst the proposed merger may\r\n\r\ndilute the Government's shareholding it should not affect the\r\n\r\nsecurity  concerns.   This is because the Info-communications\r\n\r\nDevelopment Authority has already put in place provisions  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  national  interest.  For  example,  as  a  licence\r\n\r\ncondition,  telecom operators will be required  to  cooperate\r\n\r\nfully with relevant Government agencies for the provision  of\r\n\r\nnational security and emergency services.  We will cover this\r\n\r\nparticular problem through the regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  clarify.   Since  the  public  listing  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Telecom,  the share price  has  fallen  below  the\r\n\r\nlisted  price.   I  would  like to  know  whether  sufficient\r\n\r\nefforts have been taken by Singapore Telecom and the relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  restore  the  confidence  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nshareholders to achieve the original purpose, ie, to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe scheme to give Singaporeans a stake in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, I do not see the relevance of your\r\n\r\nquestion to the Questions which are on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> In the light of the proposed merger,\r\n\r\nwe  know  that  SingTel's share price has  fallen  below  its\r\n\r\nlisted price.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I think share prices will\r\n\r\nhave  to reflect what the market demand is and Government  is\r\n\r\nin no position to influence it directly.  I am confident that\r\n\r\nSingTel  management  has done all it can  to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nposition  of SingTel but the Member should realise that,  all\r\n\r\ntelecom  monopolies as SingTel was, are subject to  extremely\r\n\r\nstrong  competitive  pressures as a result  of  deregulation.\r\n\r\nThe  same situation has happened in all countries where share\r\n\r\nprices  of monopolies tend to take a major hit because  their\r\n\r\noverseas  IDD  calls  are  usually  the  ones  first  hit  by\r\n\r\ncompetition.   As  far  as SingTel is  concerned,  they  have\r\n\r\nexpanded overseas into many areas, Belgium, UK and Australia,\r\n\r\nand  Members  have  read in the press  that  they  have  made\r\n\r\nseveral  moves  to  acquire  other  telcos,  but  with  mixed\r\n\r\nsuccess, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not get the second part of the question. Can the\r\n\r\nMember repeat it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> SingTel was the first of a series of\r\n\r\nGovernment  enterprises to be privatised and it was  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Asset Enhancement Scheme.  The drop in its share  prices\r\n\r\nwill reduce public confidence in this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> In the case of SingTel, the\r\n\r\npublic was granted a discount of the original price and  with\r\n\r\nthe  loyalty  shares the effective price paid by shareholders\r\n\r\nis  a  lot lower than $3.60.  But I think the basic principle\r\n\r\nis that Government cannot protect the price of shares.  As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned   earlier  in  my  reply  to  Mr  Chng's  question,\r\n\r\ninvestors  must make their own judgment and I  still  believe\r\n\r\nthat, in the long term, SingTel is a good investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, since Pacific Century\r\n\r\nCyberworks  is  also  bidding for a  share  of  the  Cable  &\r\n\r\nWireless  HKT,  I would like to know what is  the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nposition on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Ministry has no position on\r\n\r\nthis.   This  is an independent bid from a Hong  Kong  entity\r\n\r\nand,  like  all proposals, it is being put on  the  table  in\r\n\r\ncompetition with the SingTel deal.

The political\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Indonesia has improved since the  presidential\r\n\r\nelection  in October last year.  President Abdurrahman  Wahid\r\n\r\nenjoys  domestic political legitimacy and wide  international\r\n\r\nsupport.   The present Indonesian leadership is possibly  the\r\n\r\nbest combination under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the present government inherited multi-faceted\r\n\r\nproblems  when  it  assumed power last  year.   The  security\r\n\r\nsituation  has  not fully stabilised.  There are  still  many\r\n\r\nsocial problems.  Racial and religious violence continues  to\r\n\r\nbreak  out from time to time.   These problems faced  by  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  are  complex and cannot be resolved  in  a  short\r\n\r\ntime.   The  President is trying to address and  resolve  the\r\n\r\nmany challenges it now faces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Indonesian economy, it is showing a tentative\r\n\r\nrecovery.   Real  GDP  is  expected to  register  a  flat  or\r\n\r\nslightly  positive  growth in 1999, after contracting  nearly\r\n\r\n14% the previous year.  The consensus forecast for GDP growth\r\n\r\nfor Indonesia this year is about 3-5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Prime Minister led an\r\n\r\ninternational   business   delegation   to   Jakarta   as   a\r\n\r\ndemonstration of our confidence in Indonesia.   PM  Goh  also\r\n\r\nannounced a package of economic assistance measures  to  help\r\n\r\ncatalyse   Indonesia's  economic  recovery.   For   Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, there is the $400 million loan financing  scheme\r\n\r\nadministered by the EDB through participating Singapore-based\r\n\r\nbanks.   This  scheme is to encourage Singapore companies  to\r\n\r\nlook  for  commercially  viable opportunities  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nWhen  these  are identified, these companies  can  seek  loan\r\n\r\nfinancing   at   competitive   interest   rates   from    the\r\n\r\nparticipating Singapore-based banks.  The risk of  the  loans\r\n\r\nwill  be  shared  between the Singapore  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nparticipating  banks.   A  seminar  was  just  held  on  18th\r\n\r\nFebruary  to  elaborate on the details of  the  scheme.   The\r\n\r\nresponse was very good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other elements of the assistance package include a\r\n\r\nUS$500  million Singapore Co-Investment Fund  for  the  major\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government-linked  companies  to  support   other\r\n\r\nforeign  investors who may be interested in  acquiring  IBRA-held  assets  and other financially viable investments.   Our\r\n\r\nTourism  Board will also implement a $2 million  Tourism  and\r\n\r\nMarketing  Package  to  help Indonesia  restart  its  tourism\r\n\r\npromotion activities.  At the same time, we will continue  to\r\n\r\nwork   with   the  Indonesian  authorities  to  enhance   the\r\n\r\ninvestment climate in the Riaus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our investments and efforts, we hope to create a\r\n\r\npositive   catalytic  effect  that  will  help   to   attract\r\n\r\nadditional  investment  funds from other  foreign  investors.\r\n\r\nHowever,  ultimately, whether the businessmen will decide  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  Indonesia  depends on  their  assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nprospects.  They will choose to invest in places  where  they\r\n\r\nand their investments are safe and their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noperations  can  carry  on  uninterrupted.   They   will   be\r\n\r\nmonitoring if the current Indonesian leadership pursues sound\r\n\r\neconomic  policies  and  if there  is  political  and  social\r\n\r\nstability within Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is unfortunate that the issue of land\r\n\r\ncompensation at the Bintan Industrial Estate has  resurfaced.\r\n\r\nWhen  development  works  by  the  Indonesia-Singapore  joint\r\n\r\nventure  company on the Bintan Industrial Estate  began  more\r\n\r\nthan  five  years ago, compensation for the  land  was  fully\r\n\r\nsettled and the land was free of encumbrances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent demonstrations at the Bintan Industrial\r\n\r\nEstate  have  resulted in losses for the companies  operating\r\n\r\nthere  as  work  had to be stopped.  They have also  affected\r\n\r\ntourist  arrivals,  and undoubtedly, the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Bintan as well. The disturbances,  if  unchecked,\r\n\r\nwould  not  only  affect investors in the  Estate,  but  more\r\n\r\nseriously,  it  would dampen foreign investor  confidence  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   Singapore's ability to  act  as  a  catalyst  to\r\n\r\nenhance investor confidence in Indonesia and help bring  back\r\n\r\nforeign investment there would be curtailed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has conveyed to the Indonesian\r\n\r\nauthorities, at various levels, the importance for  Indonesia\r\n\r\nto resolve the problems.  However, the disturbances in Bintan\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen  in  the context of the other  incidents  of\r\n\r\nsocial  unrest  elsewhere  in  Indonesia.   President   Wahid\r\n\r\nhimself  has  said  that the recent outbreaks  of  unrest  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  were  the  product of  a  conspiracy  against  his\r\n\r\ngovernment.   The Indonesian authorities have indicated  that\r\n\r\ndisruptive  elements from other parts of Indonesia  had  been\r\n\r\ninvolved  in Bintan.  They recognise the nature and potential\r\n\r\nimpact of the problems and have taken swift action to end the\r\n\r\ndisturbances.   We  will  continue  to  closely  monitor  the\r\n\r\nsituation in Bintan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have three\r\n\r\nsupplementary  questions.

Whether the money in fact went to  the  people\r\n\r\nfrom  whom  the  land was taken, that is  something  for  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  side  to  resolve, and I believe  that  they  are\r\n\r\ntaking  actions  in that direction.  But as I also  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  Jakarta suspects that there were political elements\r\n\r\ninvolved in the disturbances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the population of Bintan, I do not have it with me\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> It is 600,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> 600,000 according to Mr Chng\r\n\r\nHee  Kok.

To  facilitate  competition,  Singapore  Power   was\r\n\r\nstructured   as   a  holding  company  with   five   separate\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries,  namely  two generation companies  (PowerSenoko\r\n\r\nand  PowerSeraya),  a  transmission  &  distribution  company\r\n\r\n(PowerGrid), a supply company (Power Supply) and a  piped-gas\r\n\r\ncompany (PowerGas).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another power station being built in Tuas was put under\r\n\r\na  separate  company, Tuas Power Ltd (TP), owned directly  by\r\n\r\nTemasek  Holdings, so that it could compete  against  the  SP\r\n\r\ngeneration  companies.   To  facilitate  competition  in  the\r\n\r\ngeneration and supply sectors, the Singapore Electricity Pool\r\n\r\n(SEP) was established as an exchange for trading electricity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided in March 1999 that the next step\r\n\r\nin  restructuring the electricity industry was for  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower to fully divest its generating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies to Temasek Holdings in 2001.  This will bring about\r\n\r\nownership  separation  of  the  generators,  which  are   the\r\n\r\ncontestable  part  of the market, from the  transmission  and\r\n\r\ndistribution network, which is the non-contestable part.  All\r\n\r\ngenerators will have a level playing field.  The transmission\r\n\r\nand  distribution  network will be  regulated  tightly  as  a\r\n\r\nnatural  monopoly.   In the year 2001,  there  will  be  four\r\n\r\ncompeting  generation  companies,  PowerSenoko,  PowerSeraya,\r\n\r\nTuas Power and SembCorp Co-gen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of Industry Structure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many more countries have now liberalised their\r\n\r\nelectricity  services.  As a result, electricity prices  have\r\n\r\ndropped significantly.

We  have\r\n\r\nengaged  a consultant to carry out a comprehensive review  of\r\n\r\nthe electricity industry and to recommend how competition  in\r\n\r\nthe  sector  could be further enhanced.  The  consultant  has\r\n\r\njust  completed  its  review and we are  now  evaluating  the\r\n\r\nchanges recommended by the consultant.  We will announce  the\r\n\r\nchanges once we have obtained feedback from industry players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Number of players</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently no limit on the number of players in\r\n\r\nthe   generation  and  retail  sectors  of  the   electricity\r\n\r\nindustry.    Companies  that  want  to  generate  or   supply\r\n\r\nelectricity in Singapore can apply to the PUB, the Regulator,\r\n\r\nfor  a public licence.  The PUB will evaluate the application\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  the  proposed  project  complies  with  our\r\n\r\ntechnical  requirements, rules and regulations  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nsystem  security  and that the applicant  has  the  financial\r\n\r\ncapability and technical expertise.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  over  the last two years, only seven out  of  the  228\r\n\r\nrapes  were committed in the parks and playgrounds.   All  of\r\n\r\nthem were committed, except for one, by persons known to  the\r\n\r\nvictims.

The question  is  this:   can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and the police do more to reassure the public  that\r\n\r\nmatters are indeed under control?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, certainly, police on the\r\n\r\nground in the various divisions know where patrols need to be\r\n\r\ndone.  Indeed, with the new Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC)\r\n\r\nset  up,  more  patrols have been projected  on  the  ground.\r\n\r\nPolice's estimation is that last year about 4% more in  terms\r\n\r\nof  police projection was on the ground.  We should leave  it\r\n\r\nto  the  police to exercise professional judgment  where  the\r\n\r\npatrols  should be mounted.   As I have said, I am sure  they\r\n\r\ndo  regularly  patrol parks.  If there are  parks  out  there\r\n\r\nwhich  are  secluded, police presence will be felt.   I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  told that, in fact, at the particular park in question,\r\n\r\nie,  the  Bukit Batok Nature Park, police patrols are mounted\r\n\r\nthere.   Having said this, let me also say that while  police\r\n\r\nwill  certainly do its part, the community can  also  do  its\r\n\r\npart.  For example, under the CSSP, there is a park, ie,  the\r\n\r\nBukit  Purmei  Park,  where the community  has  also  mounted\r\n\r\npatrols.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our parks are safe. But, as in anywhere, if a\r\n\r\nperson  is not aware of the risk and danger, even walking  at\r\n\r\nnight  -  of course, we are very safe here - if it so happens\r\n\r\nthat  you are at the wrong place at the wrong time, a heinous\r\n\r\ncrime can also take place.  Our parks are safe.  Let me  give\r\n\r\nthat  assurance.  Police is mindful that there is a need  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  be aware professionally of areas in the  park  that\r\n\r\nneed  patrol and yet, at the same time, the call  is  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  also  take this call  to   heart  not,  for\r\n\r\nexample, as I have said, to be alone in secluded places or at\r\n\r\nnight.   At  the  same time, on the ground,  under  the  CSSP\r\n\r\nprogramme, if community leaders like yourselves, working with\r\n\r\nyour  grassroots, feel that certain parks need more  patrols,\r\n\r\nyou  can also, working with the police, work out arrangements\r\n\r\nwhich will benefit park users.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, while I am aware that\r\n\r\nthe police force is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstrained  by limited human resources, would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  greater  use  of  alternative  approaches  such  as\r\n\r\nsurveillance  cameras in the more secluded places  to  ensure\r\n\r\nsafety  and  to  give greater comfort and confidence  to  the\r\n\r\npeople using such secluded places?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes, certainly. When I said\r\n\r\nCSSP,  I have cited park patrols only as one example.   Other\r\n\r\nexamples can be considered, such as surveillance cameras  and\r\n\r\nlighting  up  certain  areas of the park  which  need  to  be\r\n\r\nlighted  up.  I think that if we are proactive, more  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.   What I am saying is that certainly police takes  this\r\n\r\ncase  in  hand  and the message that is being sent,  and  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of police patrols.  The presence of park  patrols\r\n\r\nis  also important.  At the same time, all of us can also  do\r\n\r\nour  part,  as users of the park, to be mindful  of  possible\r\n\r\ndangers  and risks and, also working with grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\non  the  ground, take whatever steps that can be helpful.

The  new  Agency is to be formed from  the  Defence\r\n\r\nTechnology  Group in the Ministry of Defence,  together  with\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  Defence Administration Group in the  Ministry\r\n\r\ndealing  with  science and technology.  The  Agency  will  be\r\n\r\ncharged  with the responsibility of providing the most  cost-effective and appropriate leading-edge technology to the SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Background</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to briefly trace the history of the\r\n\r\nDefence Technology Group and its roles in supporting the  SAF\r\n\r\nsince the beginning of the Republic of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Technology Group had its origins in the\r\n\r\nLogistics  Division of the Ministry of Interior and  Defence,\r\n\r\nset  up in 1966.  Defence industries were set up in 1967  and\r\n\r\nresearch laboratories in 1972.  MINDEF was the first Ministry\r\n\r\nto  embrace  IT with the set up of the Systems  and  Computer\r\n\r\nOrganisation in 1979.  Today, the Defence Technology Group is\r\n\r\na  smart  defence  equipment buyer as well  as  a  leader  in\r\n\r\napplying  new  technologies  to  defence  applications.    It\r\n\r\nperforms  a wide range of functions for MINDEF and  the  SAF,\r\n\r\nranging from research and development to maintenance support,\r\n\r\nprocurement  to  defence  industry  development.   Under  the\r\n\r\nprevailing  system,  the  SAF concentrates  on  training  and\r\n\r\noperations,  while  the  Ministry  of  Defence  provides  the\r\n\r\nmanpower  and financial resources as well as the  procurement\r\n\r\nand technological support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for Statutory Board</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I explained in Parliament in March last\r\n\r\nyear  the rationale for the formation of the statutory board,\r\n\r\nwhich I would like to reiterate this afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has always been, and will continue to be\r\n\r\ncritical  to  the  SAF  in the 21st century.   Technology  is\r\n\r\nadvancing  at  a rapid rate.  As new technology  and  systems\r\n\r\nemerge,  existing ones become obsolete.  To ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nSAF  maintains  and sharpens its technological  edge,  MINDEF\r\n\r\nneeds to be able to respond more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquickly  and flexibly to technological change.  Yet, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  impractical for MINDEF to simply continue to  expand  its\r\n\r\nengineering   talent  pool.   This  will  only  distort   the\r\n\r\ndeployment of the national engineering resource.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nsimply  growing  larger, we have to do  things  smarter.   To\r\n\r\ntranscend  our  manpower limitations, we need to  effectively\r\n\r\ntap  on  external engineering expertise from either local  or\r\n\r\noverseas organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet these challenges, it is imperative that we\r\n\r\nfind  new  ways of repositioning and re-organising ourselves.\r\n\r\nAt  present, the DTG in MINDEF undertakes the whole range  of\r\n\r\ntechnology functions, from policy formulation to acquisition,\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  development.  Although this  structure  was\r\n\r\nsuitable for the build up of our capabilities in the past, it\r\n\r\nis  not  optimal and cannot provide the degree of  nimbleness\r\n\r\nand flexibility that will be required in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, MINDEF has decided to form a new statutory\r\n\r\nboard  to  provide  a more flexible and nimble  framework  to\r\n\r\nimplement defence technology policies and plans.  MINDEF will\r\n\r\nthen  be  better  able to concentrate on  the  core  Ministry\r\n\r\nfunctions of policy, planning and resource allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Formation of DSTA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Agency is to be formed by merging all the\r\n\r\nprocurement  and science and technology-related  entities  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence.  It will serve as an agent of MINDEF\r\n\r\nand  the SAF in achieving their scientific, technological and\r\n\r\nequipping goals.  These entities have about 2,400 staff.  The\r\n\r\ncorporatised DSO National Laboratories, which has  about  900\r\n\r\nstaff,  will  remain a corporate entity; but its  supervision\r\n\r\nand  control  will  be transferred from  MINDEF  to  the  new\r\n\r\nAgency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will retain responsibility for oversight\r\n\r\nand  control  of  the new agency to ensure that  the  desired\r\n\r\nresults are achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Provisions of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the key aspects of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill, read together with the First\r\n\r\nSchedule,  provides  for the constitution  of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors  of  the  Agency.  The Minister  for  Defence  will\r\n\r\nappoint  the Chairman and directors of the Board.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive  of the Agency will be appointed with the  approval\r\n\r\nof the Minister, under clause 10.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the mission and functions of the\r\n\r\nAgency.   The  Agency shall harness and exploit  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,   and   provide  technological  and   engineering\r\n\r\nsupport,  to meet the defence and national security needs  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Its broad functions are to advise the Ministry of\r\n\r\nDefence  on  all  matters  relating to  defence  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,   to  provide  defence  science  and   technology\r\n\r\nservices  and  facilities  to  MINDEF,  and  to  promote  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate   the   development   of   defence   technological\r\n\r\ncapability in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out the powers of the Agency. Among other\r\n\r\nthings,  the  Agency will be empowered to form companies  and\r\n\r\nparticipate in joint ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 13 pertain to appointments of the Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive,  officers  and employees of the  Agency.   Special\r\n\r\nprovisions  have  been  included to  guarantee  the  Agency's\r\n\r\ncontinued operations, especially in times of emergency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 14 to 21 are the financial provisions. The main\r\n\r\nsource of funding for the Agency will be in the form of  fees\r\n\r\nfor services and functions performed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 22 to 29 provide for the transfer of property,\r\n\r\nassets,  liabilities and employees to the Agency.   Property,\r\n\r\nassets  and liabilities as may be determined by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance will be transferred to the Agency.  A substantial\r\n\r\nnumber  of  MINDEF  and SAF employees currently  employed  in\r\n\r\nMINDEF,  the SAF, and in the DSO National Laboratories,  will\r\n\r\nbe  transferred  to the Agency.  They will be transferred  on\r\n\r\nterms not less favourable than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat they were enjoying immediately before the transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 30 to 34 are general provisions. Clause 32\r\n\r\nprovides for the preservation of secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have always recognised the role of\r\n\r\ntechnology as an important force multiplier to give  the  SAF\r\n\r\nthe edge.  It is vital that we be proactive and innovative in\r\n\r\nexploiting  technology.  The Bill before the House  sets  out\r\n\r\nthe  legislative  framework to establish the Defence  Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology Agency.  The Agency will be nimble to respond\r\n\r\nquickly  to  changes  in technology,  so  that  the  SAF  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to receive cost-effective technology support to help\r\n\r\nit maintain its strategic edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGPC   for   Defence   and   Foreign  Affairs   supports   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the Defence Science and Technology  Agency.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  wish to raise some points of  concern  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is timely to establish the Defence Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Agency as the integrated body  for  defence  R&D,\r\n\r\ntechnology, IT, communications, command, defence procurement,\r\n\r\nand land and estates matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no doubt the right move to put all under one roof,\r\n\r\nwith  an  integrated management and command, with  a  central\r\n\r\nfocus  and  direction.  It will  maximise,  I  am  sure,  the\r\n\r\nsynergy, resources and impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater flexibility, it will be easier for the\r\n\r\nAgency  to attract, nurture and retain the best talents,  and\r\n\r\nenlarge  the  talent  pool.  Talent is the  critical  factor.\r\n\r\nWith  the  right strategy and deployment, the R&D talent  can\r\n\r\ntip the scale between victory and defeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Agency has a pivotal role in the defence of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  especially  in  this technological  and  IT  age.\r\n\r\nDefence  research, development and related preparations  will\r\n\r\nindeed decide the outcome of war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology alters the course of war. The machine gun in\r\n\r\nthe  First  World War, the tanks and aircrafts in the  Second\r\n\r\nWorld War, and the precision guided missiles in the Gulf  war\r\n\r\nchanged  the  face of warfare.  Next it will be  the  digital\r\n\r\nbattlefield and cyber warfare.  The Agency can therefore give\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  the  comparative advantage,  the  cutting  edge  in\r\n\r\ntechnology, communications and IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Agency does its job, we will win the war before\r\n\r\nthe  first  shot is fired.  Better still, such intensive  and\r\n\r\nthorough  preparations will deter any  potential  enemy  from\r\n\r\nwaging  war against us.  The strategy of deterrence is indeed\r\n\r\nour best bet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with what Sun Tzu, the best known Asian\r\n\r\nstrategist said 2,000 years ago, that the best strategy is to\r\n\r\nwin  without fighting, and to out-plan and out-manoeuvre  the\r\n\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise two points for consideration and\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the `no strike' clause which stated that \"No\r\n\r\nemployee  of  the Agency shall go on strike or  instigate  or\r\n\r\ninitiate  others  to  take  part  in  or  otherwise  act   in\r\n\r\nfurtherance  of  any industrial action.\"   I  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nsensitive nature of the work of this Agency, and that we must\r\n\r\nnot  and  cannot  afford strikes and  disruption  in  such  a\r\n\r\ncritical area.  I appeal to the Agency management not to  use\r\n\r\nthis  clause  as a fig leaf but to take it as a  calling,  as\r\n\r\ntheir special responsibility, to place an even higher premium\r\n\r\nand  priority on good employee-management relationship.  They\r\n\r\nshould  take care of the interests and welfare of  all  their\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Agency to put in place procedures for\r\n\r\nhandling  staff  grievances  and appeals  and  provide  ample\r\n\r\nopportunities for staff dialogues and counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask whether this prohibits the employees from\r\n\r\njoining the NTUC union or the general branch of the NTUC, not\r\n\r\nfor  industrial actions, but for welfare purposes and for the\r\n\r\nwide range of benefits of NTUC membership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point is that the Agency will present\r\n\r\nits  annual  report to a committee, appointed  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, instead of to Parliament.  This is indeed a special\r\n\r\nprovision, necessitated again by the sensitive nature of  its\r\n\r\nwork.  I hope the persons appointed to this committee will be\r\n\r\nthorough in their scrutiny and fearless in their enquiry, for\r\n\r\nthe good of the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill which will see the creation of  the\r\n\r\nDSTA  which  has  evolved  out of the  restructuring  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Defence's Defence Technology  Group.   It  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  become a one-stop Agency to advise MINDEF  on  key\r\n\r\nmatters as laid out in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly endorse the statement of the GPC\r\n\r\nChairman for Defence and Foreign Affairs on the pivotal  role\r\n\r\nof technology, how it will help one to win wars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Deputy Prime Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  the following matters in respect of the Bill.   The\r\n\r\nfirst matter that I would like to raise is on the composition\r\n\r\nof  the board of directors under clause 5(1).  Sir, the First\r\n\r\nSchedule  states that the persons who can be  appointed  must\r\n\r\nhave  public administration experience or be involved in  the\r\n\r\ndefence, science or technology field.  Sir, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider the scope of those who would qualify  as\r\n\r\nI  feel  that it would be unduly restrictive if  one  was  to\r\n\r\nrestrict appointees to these two categories.  With the Agency\r\n\r\naiming to be nimble and something that would be similar to  a\r\n\r\ncorporatised  agency,  it  will  be  appropriate   if   other\r\n\r\nindividuals who may qualify should be considered and co-opted\r\n\r\nas directors of the board.  Perhaps, some CEOs in the private\r\n\r\nsector\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  may  be  able to contribute good corporate  practice  or\r\n\r\ncertain  business practices can be incorporated as  directors\r\n\r\nto  the  board.  I would urge that the clause in the Schedule\r\n\r\nbe  amended  to also include a clause to say that \"any  other\r\n\r\nindividual  whom  the Minister deems appropriate  or  fit  to\r\n\r\nserve as director\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise another issue under clause\r\n\r\n11(2)  which requires an employee to work for the  DSTA  when\r\n\r\nthe  Minister so orders.  Sir, I am not sure that this  is  a\r\n\r\nprovision worth inserting as it is no good trying to keep  an\r\n\r\nemployee whom you have tried to persuade to stay but refuses.\r\n\r\nSo why keep a body if his soul is not in it?  Sir, the courts\r\n\r\nhave  long  hesitated  to supervise such  clauses  as  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething   very   difficult  to  supervise  and   implement.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the Minister may wish to delete the clause  and  try\r\n\r\npersuasion and provide incentives for such employees to stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another clause which is clause 11(4), prohibits\r\n\r\nstrikes and industrial action.  Naturally, some are concerned\r\n\r\nas  to  whether it is something that infringes the  right  of\r\n\r\nevery worker in Singapore and whether we are compromising the\r\n\r\nrights  of  workers  in Singapore.  I would  have  been  much\r\n\r\nhappier  if  the  mechanism on how workers' rights  would  be\r\n\r\nprotected in the DSTA could have been spelt out either in the\r\n\r\nBill  itself  or as a Schedule to the Bill so that  employees\r\n\r\nwithin the DSTA can feel comforted that their grievances  and\r\n\r\nproblems  can  be heard by the management in the  appropriate\r\n\r\nway  and  some resolution sought in the most appropriate  way\r\n\r\nwithin  the  organisation.  Sir, I look forward to  the  DSTA\r\n\r\nworking out an arrangement, together with the involvement  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement, NTUC in Singapore to ensure  that\r\n\r\nworkers within the DSTA are adequately protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue that I would like to raise is on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  accountability to Parliament.  Sir,  clause  19\r\n\r\nrecognises  that  the  Minister  dispenses  money  given   by\r\n\r\nParliament  to DSTA.  But nowhere in the Bill do  I  see  any\r\n\r\naccountability to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nParliament.   The Bill requires under clause  30  the  annual\r\n\r\nreport  of  the DSTA to be given to the Minister for  Defence\r\n\r\nand  he, in turn, will hand it to a committee to be appointed\r\n\r\nby  the  Prime  Minister.  Who sits in this committee  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Prime Minister is unclear and nowhere  does\r\n\r\nit say that Members of Parliament will be represented in this\r\n\r\ncommittee.  As Parliament dispenses funds to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence  and in turn they dispense this fund to the  DSTA,  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge that this committee to be appointed is  one  that\r\n\r\ntakes  into  its ambit people from different fields  who  can\r\n\r\nsupervise the work of DSTA and ensure that the funds  of  the\r\n\r\nDSTA  are  properly  used and some of the  research  that  is\r\n\r\nundertaken  by the DSTA is  appropriate to the needs  of  our\r\n\r\ndefence  forces.   I  would also urge  the  Minister  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether there could be certain instances where the report  of\r\n\r\nDSTA  could  be given to Parliament.  Because in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  there  is  an equivalent agency called  the  Defence\r\n\r\nResearch   Agency  which  indeed  provides  its   report   to\r\n\r\nParliament on what exactly it does, not in specifics, but  at\r\n\r\nleast a broad picture of what exactly it does so that Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament can see what exactly this organisation is doing\r\n\r\nand in particular whether the fund and research that is being\r\n\r\nundertaken   are  appropriately  and  properly  used.    Sir,\r\n\r\nnaturally,  as  the body that approves the  money  for  DSTA,\r\n\r\nParliament  will be interested in ensuring that  these  funds\r\n\r\nare effectively and efficiently used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue that I am concerned with is clause\r\n\r\n32(3)  which states that a ministerial certificate stating  a\r\n\r\nmatter  to  be  secret will be deemed secret  and  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndisclosed  to Parliament or any other person.  Sir,  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle  uncomfortable, as I am always wary of the  judge  and\r\n\r\njury being the same person.  It may perhaps be appropriate if\r\n\r\nthe  secrecy  of  the matter is verified by  a  third  party,\r\n\r\nperhaps  even  by a committee to be appointed  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  under clause 32, which hopefully will  not  be  one\r\n\r\nthat is totally dominated by the Executive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those comments, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  strengthening of national security deserves the  support\r\n\r\nof   every   Singaporean   and  I   therefore   support   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening of national security and what this Bill aims to\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference that this Agency will make heavily\r\n\r\ndepends on the quality and the motivation of people who  work\r\n\r\nin  this  Agency.  I support what the Minister said that  you\r\n\r\nneed  to have talent and talent that can work smart.   So  in\r\n\r\nreviewing the Bill, I have looked at how this Agency tries to\r\n\r\nlook  at  staff matters, the people who work for this Agency.\r\n\r\nI am glad that they spend more than one part devoted to staff\r\n\r\nmatters  and staff moving to this Agency from elsewhere  were\r\n\r\ngiven  an assurance that they would not lose out in terms  of\r\n\r\nremuneration and recognition of service.  As employees  of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board, I assume that they can be  a  trade  union,\r\n\r\nthey  can  get  representation rights and these are  positive\r\n\r\nthings.   However,  there are some aspects of  the  provision\r\n\r\nthat  do  not  really give the right signal that  people  are\r\n\r\nvaluable, can be trusted and can be treated as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some concerns on those provisions and I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  express them.  I am referring to clause 11(2)  that\r\n\r\nempowers  the  Minister to compel an  employee  to  carry  on\r\n\r\nworking even if he or she has tendered in her resignation  as\r\n\r\nwell as clause 11(4) which prohibits employees from going  on\r\n\r\nstrike  or  to  take industrial action.  When  employees  are\r\n\r\nunhappy,  they  normally  express it  by  voicing  out  their\r\n\r\ncomplaints.   In most places, when they are not  heard,  they\r\n\r\nleave.  So we say that you either voice it or if it cannot be\r\n\r\nheard,  you just leave and exit.  This Bill puts restrictions\r\n\r\non both.  And I ask:  is it really necessary?  Are we sending\r\n\r\nthe right signal?  Is our existing law not adequate to handle\r\n\r\ndifferences  that may arise between an Agency,  or  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  any employer, and its employees?  Someone who  wants\r\n\r\nto  leave  and  he is asked to carry on is an unhappy  worker\r\n\r\nwhich  will  not  contribute  to  morale  and  general   work\r\n\r\nenvironment of the workplace.  So why is he leaving?  And if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  union, he could articulate  his  concerns  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of workers which can be addressed early,  wisely\r\n\r\nand reduce the chance of a trade dispute arising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming on to clause 11(4) on strikes and industrial\r\n\r\naction, I would like to say that strike is an ultimate weapon\r\n\r\nfor the workers and the unions.  Even if the workers call for\r\n\r\na  strike,  the  workers have a great probability  that  they\r\n\r\nmight  lose their jobs, they might lose their income and,  in\r\n\r\nsome  countries,  even  their lives.   Strikes  are  never  a\r\n\r\npreferred  option for trade unions.  In Singapore, there  had\r\n\r\nnot  been a strike since 1977 except for one during the  last\r\n\r\nrecession.   Strikes, since they are not a preferred  option,\r\n\r\nhappen for various reasons.  One of it is that it is actually\r\n\r\nan  open  manifestation of conflict and a total breakdown  of\r\n\r\nconsensus.   It  is an explosion of pent-up feelings.   These\r\n\r\nfeelings  and bad blood get bottled up because procedures  to\r\n\r\nhandle disputes are inefficient or inadequate.  I also accept\r\n\r\nthat  there  may  even be elements who might use  strikes  to\r\n\r\npromote  their  narrow interests and cause  havoc.   But  are\r\n\r\nthese possible in today's Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show this question, I just want to review and talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  laws that exist here.  We have the  Criminal  Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Act and the Trade Disputes  Act  which\r\n\r\nprohibit strikes and lock-outs in water, electricity and  gas\r\n\r\nservices.   It is these three areas which render  service  to\r\n\r\nthe  community and we are all dependent on them.   But  while\r\n\r\nthe  law  prohibits a strike, it also prohibits lock-out.   I\r\n\r\nask  why  this  Agency,  which is so  important  to  national\r\n\r\ninterest,  prohibits strikes but not lock-out.  The  Criminal\r\n\r\nLaw  (Temporary  Provisions) Act and the Trade  Disputes  Act\r\n\r\nalso  provide for workers in essential services to  give  two\r\n\r\nweeks'  notice  before  commencing  a  strike  or  industrial\r\n\r\naction.  It has to be in pursuit of a trade dispute.  It  has\r\n\r\nto  be employment related.  And the Trade Unions Act actually\r\n\r\nsays that the majority of union members who are involved have\r\n\r\nto give support for this industrial action and they have to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshow  their support through a secret ballot.  And during this\r\n\r\nperiod of two weeks' cooling-off period, efforts can be  made\r\n\r\nto  resolve the dispute and if the dispute is referred to the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court, no strike or industrial  action\r\n\r\ncan  take place.  Strike, I say again, is an extreme  measure\r\n\r\ntaken   only  if  pushed  and  there  are  no  other  options\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Act in Singapore therefore has\r\n\r\ncomprehensive    provisions   for   collective    bargaining,\r\n\r\nconciliation  and  arbitration  of  trade  disputes.    These\r\n\r\nprovisions  have given us industrial peace with justice.   It\r\n\r\nhas  served us well.  Why does the Agency not want to use the\r\n\r\nexisting   laws   instead  of  imposing  new  and   seemingly\r\n\r\nunnecessary restrictions on trade unions and workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I said is whether we are giving the\r\n\r\nright  signals.  The Singapore worker is widely broadcast  as\r\n\r\nthe number one workforce in the world and the Singapore trade\r\n\r\nunion movement as a responsible one that is not afraid to put\r\n\r\nnational  interests  before that of sectoral  interest.   Our\r\n\r\nlegal   system  governing  employment  is  ranked   high   by\r\n\r\ninvestors.  We have a track record to show our responsibility\r\n\r\nas  a  movement and its workforce.  Only last year, Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers  accepted  a wage cut without any social  unrest.   I\r\n\r\nask:   in  these  provisions of the Bill, is  the  Government\r\n\r\ngiving  a  different signal in its trust  and  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore workers and the Singapore unions?  Is there  enough\r\n\r\nconfidence in our present legal system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to say the solution to ensure that\r\n\r\nwe have got the right people, highly motivated people working\r\n\r\nfor the Agency for the good of the country, is not by placing\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  people,  but rather  by  putting  in  place\r\n\r\nprocedures  in  which  grievances  can  be  handled  quickly,\r\n\r\neffectively   and  smoothly,  and  you  have  processes   and\r\n\r\nprocedures  to handle people's needs and aspirations.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be differences.  Any organisation will have differences\r\n\r\nbut  we must address them and resolve them fairly and justly.\r\n\r\nSingapore's proven way of treating people and workers  fairly\r\n\r\nby giving them reasonable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand good remuneration, listening to concerns, addressing them\r\n\r\nand involving them or using active citizenship, has worked in\r\n\r\nmost  places,  and there is a track record  to  it.   If  you\r\n\r\nfollow  these tested methods, then I am sure that the  Agency\r\n\r\nwill  have a highly motivated and committed workforce and  in\r\n\r\nthat  case,  there  is  no need to worry  so  much  of  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes  and  industrial actions. This is  a  challenge  for\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  I  urge the Minister to review  and  clarify\r\n\r\nthese points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the formation of the Agency as a consolidation of\r\n\r\nour  resources  in  the defence industry.  As  maintaining  a\r\n\r\nstrong   defence   capability  is  crucial  for   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontinuing peace and security, I am happy with its  evolution\r\n\r\nand the successes that occasionally appear in the news media.\r\n\r\nWhilst   the  formation  of  such  an  Agency  is  a  natural\r\n\r\nprogression, I am filled with some unease.  Perhaps,  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  watching too many science fiction movies  that  portray\r\n\r\nrenegade    defence   agencies   carrying    out    unethical\r\n\r\nexperimentations and developments.  Quite naturally, the work\r\n\r\nof  a  defence agency must generally be kept secret.   Clause\r\n\r\n32(3)  provides  the Minister with the power to  certify  any\r\n\r\ninformation  as  of  a secret nature and  as  stated  in  the\r\n\r\nclause,  such information or matter shall not be required  to\r\n\r\nbe  disclosed to Parliament or any such person.  There is  no\r\n\r\nprovision for a Committee to monitor the works of the  Agency\r\n\r\nto ensure that it does not breach any universal ethical rule.\r\n\r\nSince defence development may involve ethical issues, such as\r\n\r\nthe  development  of land mines, biological weapons,  etc,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that it would be too much to keep it purely within  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my belief that there is a need to have a\r\n\r\nmonitoring  body, comprising at least the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\ntwo  other Ministers from other Ministries, and in  fact,  it\r\n\r\nwould be my preference to include an independent person, such\r\n\r\nas the President of the Republic of Singapore. The setting up\r\n\r\nof such a Committee is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncritical   since  defence  matters,  by  nature,  cannot   be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  openly without compromising the national interest.\r\n\r\nAs  pointed  out earlier by Mr Ravindran, there is  really  a\r\n\r\nneed for secrecy to be independently verified.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I share the recognition of\r\n\r\nthe  importance of science and technology to  defence  and  I\r\n\r\nalso think that it is important to see that there can be spin-offs  from  such  research  which may  have  value-added  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore's technology and economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I support the Bill. And if the Minister says\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  for flexibility, I also think that starting  an\r\n\r\nAgency  to  deal  with the subject matter is also  worthy  of\r\n\r\nsupport.   My concern then is, like the others, more  on  the\r\n\r\neffects of creating such an agency quite independent  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and scrutiny of Parliament, and of the  effects  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point, Mr Speaker, is about something that I\r\n\r\nwas  a  bit  puzzled by and which perhaps  the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nexplain.   Of  the  departments that are to  be  incorporated\r\n\r\nwithin the Agency, looking at clause 2, I notice that one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Agencies  is Lands and Estates.  I am a little  puzzled.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  I do not understand the functions of this department\r\n\r\nwhy this should be part of our Defence Science and Technology\r\n\r\nAgency, rather than part of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I return my concern to clause 6(3) of the\r\n\r\nBill.   Clause  6(3) permits the Agency to undertake  certain\r\n\r\nfunctions  as  the  Minister  may  assign.  The  Agency   may\r\n\r\nundertake and, in so doing, the Agency shall be deemed to  be\r\n\r\nfulfilling the purposes of this Act.  This power to me  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  too  wide  and yet, at the same time,  a  little  too\r\n\r\nloose.   It  may be too wide in the sense that in  comparison\r\n\r\nwith this, clause 6(2) constrains the Agency much more to the\r\n\r\npurposes  that  the  Minister  has  explained.   Even  clause\r\n\r\n6(2)(l),  which  is the general one, allows the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nperform  such other functions as are conferred on the  Agency\r\n\r\nby  any  other written law.  In clause 6(3), we go much  more\r\n\r\nbroader as \"such other functions as the Minister himself  may\r\n\r\nassign\" and does not even say in writing.  But yet,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhile  the  power  is  so wide, I do not understand  why  the\r\n\r\nAgency  may  take  up such an instruction from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nrather than \"shall\".  Perhaps, the Minister can clarify  that\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point I share with many of the speakers before\r\n\r\nme  is with regard to clause 11(2) and (4).  I think I cannot\r\n\r\nimprove on what Mr Thomas, the NMP, has said on clause  11(4)\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the impact on trade unions and labour law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Let  me then focus on clause  11(2).   Here,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  have said before me, this provision is for  enforced\r\n\r\nemployment.  I would like to remind the Minister that Article\r\n\r\n10  of the Constitution actually prohibits forced labour.  If\r\n\r\nI may read Article 10:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) No person shall be held in slavery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All forms of forced labour are prohibited, but\r\n\r\nParliament  may  by  law provide for compulsory  service  for\r\n\r\nnational purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, of course, that the second part\r\n\r\n\"Parliament  may  by law provide\" is probably  where  we  are\r\n\r\ncoming  to  now.   But I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that this should be a power that is  exceptionally\r\n\r\nused.  Why is it such an exception?  It could be that this is\r\n\r\nan  essential  service such as police,  fire  protection  and\r\n\r\nother matters.  May I ask the Minister's assurance that  this\r\n\r\nclause  is  in  line  with  those other  essential  services.\r\n\r\nBecause we are in a bit of conundrum here.  If the service is\r\n\r\nso  essential, why should it be under an Agency  rather  than\r\n\r\ndirectly under the Ministry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point relates to the powers of the Agency to\r\n\r\nprocure.  Sir, as we know, powers to procure for defence mean\r\n\r\nlarge  sums of money and we have all heard nightmare  stories\r\n\r\nof  procurement  for  research in other countries  where  the\r\n\r\nsystem had led to overpriced procurement of what seems to  be\r\n\r\neveryday goods.  I want to be reassured that the Agency  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  follow  Singapore's  system  of  prudence   and\r\n\r\nscrutiny. What then may I ask the Minister, would the changes\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  Government  procedures for tendering and  accountability?\r\n\r\nWhat  are the likely increased financial costs? The Bill says\r\n\r\nthat   we   would  likely  incur  some  additional  financial\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  We do not know how much.  Particularly,  may  I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether Government will,  even  with  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of the Agency, stay within the existing  guidelines\r\n\r\non  our  military expenditure as part of the  GDP?   In  this\r\n\r\nregard, I too share a concern that the lack of accountability\r\n\r\nto  Parliament  and the Minister's powers to declare  certain\r\n\r\nthings  to  be a secret must be broadly shared by a Committee\r\n\r\nof Parliament such as the GPC or other Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, let me first declare\r\n\r\nthat  I  am an employee of the National Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\nand my views reflect that of the NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has had discussions with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nDefence  and Ministry of Manpower on the Defence Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Agency Bill because it touches on the fundamental\r\n\r\nright of trade unions, ie, the right to strike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in the NTUC, do not like to see the abrogation of\r\n\r\nsuch a right.  It is not that our unions are strike-happy  or\r\n\r\nthat  the industrial relations situation in Singapore  is  so\r\n\r\npoor  that  unions do not threaten companies with  industrial\r\n\r\nactions,  they  could not get management to settle  disputes.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, we have had no strike since 1977 except for a brief\r\n\r\none  in  1986.   But  no strike does not  mean  no  disputes.\r\n\r\nBecause  we have good relations with many employers,  we  had\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to settle these disputes mainly through bilateral\r\n\r\nnegotiations. When we run into difficulties, we  refer  cases\r\n\r\nto the Ministry of Manpower for conciliation.  Only rarely do\r\n\r\ncases reach the Industrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, the NTUC sanctioned a strike at Hydril, makers\r\n\r\nof  parts of oil rigs for two reasons.   First, to punish the\r\n\r\nmanagement for their anti-union actions. The company had  set\r\n\r\nunrealistically high productivity targets and  when  workers,\r\n\r\nincluding those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelected  as union leaders, failed to reach the targets,  they\r\n\r\nwere  sacked.  Such anti-union actions, if  unchecked,  would\r\n\r\nundermine the credibility of the labour movement. The  strike\r\n\r\nwas  over in two days. The management agreed to take back the\r\n\r\nBranch  Treasurer  and  to compensate  five  other  dismissed\r\n\r\nworkers who later declined offers to return to their jobs. So\r\n\r\nit  is  crucial that we have the means to take strike actions\r\n\r\nif  management were to adopt a decidedly anti-union stance in\r\n\r\na  labour strike.  But strike action is not the objective  of\r\n\r\nour unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, when Mr Ong Teng Cheong was Labour Minister, he\r\n\r\ngot  Parliament  to amend the legislation  to  re-define  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of trade unions.  Instead of having  unions  with\r\n\r\nsuch objectives as (1) imposing the restrictive conditions on\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  work, and (2) promoting  or  organising  or\r\n\r\nfinancing  of strikes or lock-outs, the new definition  would\r\n\r\ngive  these  as  the objectives of our trade unions:  (1)  to\r\n\r\npromote   good  industrial  relations  between  workmen   and\r\n\r\nemployers;  (2) to promote the working conditions of  workers\r\n\r\nor  enhance the economic and social status; and (3) to  raise\r\n\r\nproductivity  for the benefit of workers, employers  and  the\r\n\r\nnation's  economy.  One Opposition MP completely misread  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  He thought the amendment would spell the death of\r\n\r\ntrade unions.  How wrong he was!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have far more members in trade unions than in\r\n\r\n1982  and  our  trade  unions are stronger  and  influential.\r\n\r\nLabour MPs in 1982 fully supported the re-definition of trade\r\n\r\nunion objectives.  As they put it, a strike is a means to  an\r\n\r\nend and not an end in itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Bill before the House, we must ask\r\n\r\nthese questions.  What is the job of the DSTA?  Who are to be\r\n\r\nposted  there?  Why does MINDEF wish to stipulate a no-strike\r\n\r\nclause?  MINDEF is transforming its Defence Technology  Group\r\n\r\ninto  a statutory board to be called the Defence Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Agency.  This means staff working in  the  Agency\r\n\r\nwould be like employees of any statutory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboard.  They can join the union whereas as MINDEF  personnel,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot.   Through the DSTA, staff  will  operate  in  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  environment.  The  work  they  do   remains\r\n\r\nbasically  the  same.   It is defence-related,  for  example,\r\n\r\nlogistics  support,  ensuring that our  defence  systems  are\r\n\r\nfully  operational  at  all  times  and  providing  technical\r\n\r\nsupport for the SAF in peacetime and in war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence of our country is paramount. As such, we\r\n\r\naccept  the no-strike clause for DSTA employees.  A no-strike\r\n\r\nclause  is  not new  in Singapore or even the more  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  around the world.  In 1967, the Government  sought\r\n\r\nto  amend the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to  ban\r\n\r\nstrikes  by  workers engaged in the very essential  services,\r\n\r\nnamely, water, gas and electricity services.  While conceding\r\n\r\nthat  the  provision by itself would appear to be  a  drastic\r\n\r\nstep  in  curtailing  the rights of trade  unions  to  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike, the Government said that it was necessary for  it  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  public was not held to  ransom  by  a  few\r\n\r\nirresponsible elements.  The Government was referring  to  an\r\n\r\nillegal   strike  by  public  daily-rated  cleansing  workers\r\n\r\nearlier in the year. Labour MPs protested over the erosion of\r\n\r\ntrade union rights. They argued that there was already a  law\r\n\r\nto  prevent  workers from going on strike.  If the Government\r\n\r\nfelt  that  such action would be detrimental to the  good  of\r\n\r\nsociety,  the Government could refer a dispute to arbitration\r\n\r\nand  this  would  automatically  make  an  industrial  action\r\n\r\nillegal.   After  a spirited debate, the no-strike  Bill  was\r\n\r\npassed over strenuous objections by some labour MPs.  But, in\r\n\r\na  spirit  of  democracy, union leaders had to  persuade  the\r\n\r\nground to accept the will of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three years have passed. Since then, unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting water, electricity and gas workers have  secured\r\n\r\nbetter  terms  and conditions of service for  their  workers,\r\n\r\ndespite not having the strike weapon to use as a last resort.\r\n\r\nAll  these years, water, electricity and gas supply has  been\r\n\r\nflowing without interruption to our homes, our factories  and\r\n\r\nworkplaces.  Where necessary, our water, electricity and  gas\r\n\r\nworkers have turned to the NTUC\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor help to resolving conflicts with the management and, with\r\n\r\ngoodwill, problems have been resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need not be apologetic about giving up the right\r\n\r\nto strike for it is not a new idea and even adopted by unions\r\n\r\nin  developed  countries.  Now, let us take  a  look  at  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Britain.  Let me quote what Sir  Ken  Jackson,\r\n\r\nGeneral   Secretary  of  the  Amalgamated   Engineering   and\r\n\r\nElectrical Union (AEEU), had to say about industrial  action.\r\n\r\nHe  said,  \"I  want to see a strike-free future  for  British\r\n\r\nindustry.\"   As  he told the congress of the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nTrades  Union Congress (TUC) in September 1999, workers  want\r\n\r\nto work, not strike, and there could be \"no return to the bad\r\n\r\nold  days\".   Well, Sir Ken, leader of 732,000-member  union,\r\n\r\ncould  see his vision come true when the measures of the  new\r\n\r\nEmployment Relations Bill come into effect in the  summer  of\r\n\r\nthis  year.  The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union\r\n\r\nof  the  UK is a large and expanding union, and they are  not\r\n\r\nalone  in  promising no-strike agreements to attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  their  country  to  create  jobs  for  their\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growing number of unions in Britain have signed\r\n\r\npartnership agreements with companies since 1997 when the TUC\r\n\r\nproduced  a  document entitled \"Partners  for  Progress\"  and\r\n\r\nendorsed  the Labour Party's initiative of creating  a  union\r\n\r\npartnership with industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the Iron Workers Local 17 signed a\r\n\r\nno-strike    clause   with   the   Construction    Employers'\r\n\r\nAssociation.    When the contract expired in  May  1991,  the\r\n\r\nunion  and the employers' group extended the pact.  When  the\r\n\r\nunion  went  on strike, the employers took it  to  court  for\r\n\r\nviolating the no-strike clause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eastern Airlines and the union representing its flight\r\n\r\nattendants  told  an  American court in 1991  that  they  had\r\n\r\nreached an agreement that would prevent a strike over a three-year period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, General Motors told Wall Street investors that\r\n\r\nthe  United  Auto Workers (UAW) had given a no-strike  pledge\r\n\r\nbefore a new national contract was signed.  On its part,  the\r\n\r\nunion said that it had agreed to ban strikes at three plants,\r\n\r\nin  return for a company pledge not to shut down or sell  the\r\n\r\nplants for 16 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the unions in the West have agreed to give up the\r\n\r\nright  to  strike  -  for job security.  While we  may  think\r\n\r\nthat  Arthur Scargill of the coal miners union is  a  typical\r\n\r\nBritish  trade unionist, the fact of the matter is that  many\r\n\r\nunion leaders in Britain had for many years gone to Japan and\r\n\r\nother  countries to promise no-strike agreements in order  to\r\n\r\npersuade investors to come to Britain and to create jobs  for\r\n\r\nBritish workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, I would like to amplify what my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  said earlier, and more  so  for  me  as  an\r\n\r\nemployee of the National Trades Union Congress, that we  must\r\n\r\nemphatically call upon the management of DSTA to be  fair  to\r\n\r\nour  workers now that they have to forgo the right to strike.\r\n\r\nIn the case of DSTA, we are giving up the right to strike for\r\n\r\nan  even  more important reason, our national security.   One\r\n\r\nmay  say  that the workers at DSTA are non-combat  personnel,\r\n\r\nbut  their  jobs  are no less important  to  the  defence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore for they provide logistical support for the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should always remind ourselves about our\r\n\r\nvulnerability  and we must never compromise on  our  national\r\n\r\nsecurity.  I am sure Singaporeans have not forgotten that not\r\n\r\ntoo long ago, we were referred to as a \"little red dot\".   We\r\n\r\nmust give our SAF and our NSmen full confidence that they can\r\n\r\ncall on every resource without disruption and interruption to\r\n\r\ndefend this \"little red dot\" on the map.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the people in DSTA who will be able to join the\r\n\r\nunion?  The majority are non-uniformed SAF personnel who  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for logistics support for the  SAF.   There  are\r\n\r\n1,112  of  them.   There  are 440  civilians   -    engineers\r\n\r\nengaged in research and maintenance work and a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmall  number  in the clerical grades.  Then  there  are  137\r\n\r\nmilitary staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much work ahead of us. The NTUC will have to\r\n\r\nsell  trade unionism to those eligible for membership.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  glad  that  my  GPC  Chairman  has  called  upon   the\r\n\r\nmanagement to encourage workers to join the union.   We  will\r\n\r\nhave  to do the work to sell trade unionism to these workers.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot take for granted that since they can join a union,\r\n\r\nthose deployed to DSTA will want to become union members, but\r\n\r\nwe  hope  that the majority of those eligible for  membership\r\n\r\nwill  sign up.  We are confident that the DSTA will throw  up\r\n\r\nsome  good union leaders.  More importantly, we will need  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  DSTA union to work out a machinery  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nlabour-management relations.  In our discussions with MINDEF,\r\n\r\nwe  have  been assured that the DSTA management  will  accord\r\n\r\nfull recognition to the union and extend full cooperation  in\r\n\r\nresolving work related problems.  Let us hope that we can get\r\n\r\nDSTA unionised as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, unions representing statutory board\r\n\r\nemployees  have to be house unions.  I understand that  among\r\n\r\nthe civilian staff, there are about 40 who are members of the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE) before they were\r\n\r\nposted to MINDEF.  They have been allowed to keep their union\r\n\r\nmembership.  Now they have to trade their AUPE membership for\r\n\r\nthat  of  a  house  union.  I am sure AUPE will  accept  this\r\n\r\n\"loss\" as it will be a \"gain\" to the new union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forming house unions, the NTUC has its own set of\r\n\r\ncriteria.   First, there should be a sufficiently large  base\r\n\r\nof  a  house  union to be viable.  Second,  there  should  be\r\n\r\neffective leaders.  And, thirdly, labour-management relations\r\n\r\nmust  be  good.   In  the case of DSTA, the  first  criterion\r\n\r\nshould  be  met if they are able to persuade the majority  of\r\n\r\nemployees to be union members.  We are confident that  DSTA's\r\n\r\nstaff would throw up effective trade union leaders, who  will\r\n\r\nbe  a credit not only to their members but also to the labour\r\n\r\nmovement as a whole.  As for labour-management relations,  we\r\n\r\ntake MINDEF's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nword  that  DSTA's  management would  work  with  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement for the benefit of the workers and the DSTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill before the House notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe no-strike provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for\r\n\r\ntheir comments and their perceptive suggestions regarding the\r\n\r\nDSTA Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start off with comments regarding clause 11(4),\r\n\r\nthe  no-strike clause, which has been commented on by Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung,  Mr Ravindran, Mr Thomas Thomas  and  Mr  Hawazi\r\n\r\nDaipi,  and also the DSTA and the unions.  Let me  first  say\r\n\r\nthat  DSTA's staff will be allowed to join unions.   However,\r\n\r\nour  national  defence  is  of paramount  importance  to  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  and  prosperity of our nation and,  in  this  area,\r\n\r\nthere  cannot  be any compromise.  In times of  tension,  the\r\n\r\nDSTA,  being  the  agency in charge of  logistics,  equipment\r\n\r\nacquisition  and  technical improvisation  functions,  is  an\r\n\r\nintegral  part  of  MINDEF  and  the  SAF.   Currently,  such\r\n\r\nfunctions  are undertaken by non-uniformed personnel  in  the\r\n\r\ndefence  technology group in MINDEF who are not permitted  to\r\n\r\njoin  unions.  The move to legislate such personnel  over  to\r\n\r\nDSTA  is to allow for organisational flexibility to cope with\r\n\r\nfast  paced  technological advances in the field  of  defence\r\n\r\nscience.  The jobs these staff perform and the criticality of\r\n\r\nthese   functions  have  not  changed.   The  DSTA  and   the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of our national defence cannot be subjected  to\r\n\r\ncompromise  by industrial action, particularly  in  times  of\r\n\r\ntension and war and, for these reasons, the no-strike  clause\r\n\r\n11(4) is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF, in drawing up this clause, also looked to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  we  could achieve the same effect  under  other\r\n\r\nlegislation,   eg,  the  Emergency  Essential   Powers   Act.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Emergency  Essential Powers  Act  only  covers\r\n\r\nspecific groups of persons, and the DSTA staff would have  to\r\n\r\nbe included in the subsidiary legislation of this Act through\r\n\r\na  presidential  proclamation.   We  have  some  concerns  in\r\n\r\nregulating DSTA's staff\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough   this   particular  Act.    First,   the   essential\r\n\r\nregulations  are  intended  for  use  only  during   national\r\n\r\nemergencies.   It  may  alarm  the  public  and  bring  about\r\n\r\nundesirable   attention  to  the  fact  that   Singapore   is\r\n\r\ntechnically  in  a  state of emergency  and  that  the  other\r\n\r\narticles of subsidiary legislation could be brought  to  bear\r\n\r\nat any time.  Second, the existing essential regulations were\r\n\r\npassed  between  October 1964 and July 1996, and  would  seem\r\n\r\nextremely odd after a lapse of some 23 years to pass  another\r\n\r\nset  of  essential  regulations, arousing undesirable  public\r\n\r\nattention  and scrutiny of the regulations.  Also, passing  a\r\n\r\nset  of essential regulations now might send the wrong signal\r\n\r\nto  external  parties  and create unnecessary  political  and\r\n\r\ndiplomatic difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions currently in the Enlistment Act\r\n\r\nproviding  for exigencies of service have served MINDEF  well\r\n\r\nover   the  years  in  ensuring  that  our  national  defence\r\n\r\nreadiness is not compromised.  It will be prudent to continue\r\n\r\nthis   practice  through  the  inclusion  of  an   equivalent\r\n\r\nprovision in the DSTA Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to the other clause which has also been\r\n\r\ncommented by many Members including Dr Ong, Mr Ravindran,  Mr\r\n\r\nGerard Ee and Mr Simon Tay and this is why the DSTA will  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  submit  its  annual report to Parliament.   By  its\r\n\r\nnature,  the business of defence has to be conducted under  a\r\n\r\ncloak  of secrecy.  This includes the work that DTG is  doing\r\n\r\nnow.   The  change to a statutory board does not  remove  the\r\n\r\nrequirement for secrecy, and secrecy has to be maintained for\r\n\r\nmany  of the details of the activities and finances of  DSTA.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Bill, to provide an external check, the DSTA  annual\r\n\r\nreport  will  be  submitted to a committee appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the other points which have been\r\n\r\nraised  by the other Members of Parliament.  One is on clause\r\n\r\n11(2)  which is to require employees to work, a point  raised\r\n\r\nby Mr Ravindran, Mr Thomas and Mr Simon Tay.  MINDEF and DSTA\r\n\r\nknow that the last thing we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwant is to compel an unwilling employee to work because if an\r\n\r\nemployee does not want to work, then obviously  you  are  not\r\n\r\nlikely to get much useful service out of him.  But in certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  for  the  purposes  of  DSTA,  where  it   is\r\n\r\nessential  and  necessary for DSTA to require the  person  to\r\n\r\nwork, we  must have that provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked about the Lands and Estates\r\n\r\nOrganisation and why it comes under the DSTA.  The  ambit  of\r\n\r\nthe  DSTA is a very large one.  It includes not only  science\r\n\r\nand  technology but also providing logistics support  to  the\r\n\r\nSAF, and the Lands and Estates Organisation is required to be\r\n\r\nincluded in the DSTA for such purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the procurement powers of DSTA, a point\r\n\r\nraised  by  Mr   Simon  Tay,  we will  make  sure  that  DSTA\r\n\r\nexercises  its powers well and gets the best value for  money\r\n\r\nspent  in  our  defence effort.  I would like to  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse that even with the setting up of DSTA, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  abide  by the present guidelines we have for our  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure, and that is not to exceed 6% of our GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some MPs also raised a point about secrecy and\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is necessary to have another body  in  order  to\r\n\r\nrestrain  the powers of the Minister for Defence with  regard\r\n\r\nto  matters regarding DSTA.  Sir, many matters of defence, by\r\n\r\ntheir  nature cannot be revealed publicly, and in such  areas\r\n\r\nit is not possible to have another external body to supervise\r\n\r\nsuch matters in the DSTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have dealt with all the matters brought\r\n\r\nup  by  the  Members of Parliament.  I just want  to  end  by\r\n\r\nreassuring  the  Members, particularly Mr Hawazi  Daipi,  who\r\n\r\nspeaks  on  behalf  of the trade unions,  that  we  are  very\r\n\r\nconscious about the need to look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  DSTA.  I am confident that the  DSTA  management\r\n\r\nwill take this heavy responsibility with its full import  and\r\n\r\ndischarge it fully.  If they do not, Members can be sure that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence will compel them to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point I missed is the suggestion by Mr Simon\r\n\r\nTay  with regard to the formation of a board of directors and\r\n\r\nthat we should look for a wider representation.  I think that\r\n\r\nis a good suggestion and we will take that into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.33 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill  be now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for Third University</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early 1980s, the Government has been expanding\r\n\r\ncapacity  at the universities to meet the increased need  for\r\n\r\nhighly   trained  manpower  in  the  economy  and   to   meet\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' aspirations for more opportunities  for  higher\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two state universities, the National University of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Nanyang Technological University,  together\r\n\r\nadmitted  8,600  local students in the  academic  year  1999,\r\n\r\nincluding   some   900  local  polytechnic  graduates.   This\r\n\r\nrepresented a 231% increase from the 2,600 students  admitted\r\n\r\nin  1980.  University participation rate has risen from 5% of\r\n\r\nthe cohort in 1980 to 21% of the cohort in 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore competes in the first league of world\r\n\r\neconomies,  we need a population that is skilled,  innovative\r\n\r\nand entrepreneurial.  The Government has therefore decided to\r\n\r\nfurther expand university educational opportunities. The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncohort participation rate will increase from the current  21%\r\n\r\nto  25%  when the three universities have eventually  reached\r\n\r\ntheir capacities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of expanding NUS and NTU, which are already the\r\n\r\nsize  of  large state universities in the United  States,  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to  start a new university specialising in  business\r\n\r\nand  related disciplines.  The intention is for NUS, NTU  and\r\n\r\nSMU  to  develop their own unique characteristics and niches.\r\n\r\nNUS  will  continue to develop as a comprehensive university;\r\n\r\nNTU  will  have  a distinctive engineering, professional  and\r\n\r\nbusiness bent; and SMU will focus on serving the business and\r\n\r\nservices  sectors  of the economy.  This model  provides  for\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  yet  avoids  wasteful  duplication.    Each\r\n\r\nuniversity  has  enough  room to develop  its  own  areas  of\r\n\r\nexcellence, and enough competition to spur it on  to  greater\r\n\r\nheights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a new university also gives us the opportunity\r\n\r\nto make a fresh start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Management University has been conceived\r\n\r\nto be innovative and pioneering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Approach of the SMU Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide SMU with the flexibility and autonomy to\r\n\r\ninnovate  and break new ground, SMU will be structured  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  way  from  NUS and NTU.  While  NUS  and  NTU  are\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards each governed by an Act of Parliament,  SMU\r\n\r\nwill be structured as a private company limited by guarantee.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be a two-tier approach.  SMU's daily  operations\r\n\r\nare  governed  by the Memorandum and Articles of  Association\r\n\r\n(M&A)  of the company which was incorporated on 12th  January\r\n\r\nthis  year.    The  company called The  Singapore  Management\r\n\r\nUniversity is also subject to the provisions of the Companies\r\n\r\nAct.  This gives SMU as much operational autonomy as possible\r\n\r\nto innovate and to pursue excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the higher level, SMU's activities will be governed\r\n\r\nby  the  SMU  Bill. This is necessary because  of  the  wider\r\n\r\nnational\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrole  played  by SMU as an institution of higher learning  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  the  fact that SMU will receive  significant\r\n\r\npublic  funding.   The  SMU Bill will therefore  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  mechanisms  for  the  Government  to  guide  SMU's\r\n\r\nstrategic  development in the public interest, and  safeguard\r\n\r\nthe use of public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this two-tier approach and the desire to give\r\n\r\nSMU  maximum  flexibility, the SMU Bill is a  minimalist  and\r\n\r\nrelatively short Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The SMU Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMU Bill aims to serve four key functions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it gives SMU the right to confer and award\r\n\r\ndegrees,   diplomas  and  certificates,  including   honorary\r\n\r\ndegrees and other distinctions;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill allows for Government funding to be\r\n\r\nprovided  to the institution. This will help ensure that  SMU\r\n\r\ndevelops successfully, especially in the start-up phase,  and\r\n\r\nsignals to the public governmental support for SMU;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it permits the Government, when necessary, to\r\n\r\ninfluence the strategic development of SMU; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Bill permits the Government to monitor the\r\n\r\nuse of public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me to highlight the key clauses in the Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 sets out the function of the university\r\n\r\ncompany,  which  includes  the  conferring  and  awarding  of\r\n\r\ndegrees, diplomas and certificates;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes provision for Parliament to provide\r\n\r\nfunding for the university.  Clauses 3 and 6 therefore signal\r\n\r\nthe Government's support for SMU;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 5 and 7 provide safeguards in the public\r\n\r\ninterest. These clauses grant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education the power to appoint  and  remove\r\n\r\nTrustees and to give his consent for:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The admission of members of the company;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The disposal of the University's undertaking or\r\n\r\nproperty;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The voluntary winding-up of the University; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any alterations of the University's constituent\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 clarifies that the Societies Act applies to any\r\n\r\nstudent body in SMU unless otherwise exempted by the Minister\r\n\r\nresponsible for societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development of SMU</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to reflect the country's endorsement\r\n\r\nand  support  of  this major undertaking,  I  am  pleased  to\r\n\r\nannounce that the President of the Republic of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nagreed  to be SMU's Patron.  The Patron of SMU will encourage\r\n\r\nand support SMU in the fulfilment of its mission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to inform the House that Mr Lim Kim\r\n\r\nSan has agreed to accept the appointment of the Chancellor of\r\n\r\nSMU.   Mr  Lim,  who has distinguished himself as  a  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinister and in the private sector, is eminently suited to be\r\n\r\nthe  Chancellor of SMU, especially since SMU seeks  to  be  a\r\n\r\npremier institution of higher learning dedicated to the  high\r\n\r\nideals of scholarship, research and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU has been making good progress in its development. It\r\n\r\nhas   established  strong  links  with  the   University   of\r\n\r\nPennsylvania's Wharton School - the top business  school  for\r\n\r\nundergraduate   programmes  and the  MBA   programme  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States.   Professor Janice Bellace,  formerly  Deputy\r\n\r\nDean  of the Wharton School, has been appointed the President\r\n\r\nof  SMU.   In  addition, the Wharton-SMU Research Centre  has\r\n\r\nbeen established to advance research relating to business and\r\n\r\nmanagement in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, SMU will be admitting its first intake\r\n\r\nof  300  students  into its Bachelor of  Business  Management\r\n\r\ncourse.  I am heartened to note that there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  more than 1,000 applications for about 100 places  when\r\n\r\nSMU opened the course for early admission this year.  Some of\r\n\r\nthe applicants, I am told, are of very high quality and could\r\n\r\nhave secured places in the best universities anywhere in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  This augurs well for SMU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelled after the Wharton School's innovative\r\n\r\nundergraduate  curriculum, SMU's curriculum  is  broad-based.\r\n\r\nIn  addition to the core studies, students will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nchoose from a wide range of subjects such as IT and the  Law,\r\n\r\nPolitical Science, Music and Interpersonal Dynamics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer run, SMU may expand its course offerings\r\n\r\nto   related  disciplines.   There  will  also  be  a  strong\r\n\r\npostgraduate  and research focus in management  and  business\r\n\r\nissues related to Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU will be located temporarily at NIE's Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nCampus until its city campus at Bras Basah vicinity is  ready\r\n\r\naround  2005.  We can then expect SMU to become  an  integral\r\n\r\npart of the business and financial community and life of  the\r\n\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my hope that the Singapore\r\n\r\nManagement University, as Singapore's new university  founded\r\n\r\nat  the  start  of  this new millennium,  will  become  known\r\n\r\nthroughout  the world for the innovativeness and  quality  of\r\n\r\nits  academic programmes, management philosophy, research and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship. The SMU Bill, together with the  university\r\n\r\ncompany's M&A, will provide the necessary framework that will\r\n\r\ngive  SMU a high degree of autonomy and the required  measure\r\n\r\nof  public accountability that will allow it to excel as  the\r\n\r\nfirst major university of the 21st Century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As the Minister says,\r\n\r\nit is a minimalist Bill.  The two Acts are very comprehensive\r\n\r\ncovering  many  aspects of the operation of  the  University,\r\n\r\nincluding  addendum schedules listing University Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich specifies exactly how the University is to be governed,\r\n\r\nincluding  the roles and responsibilities of the officers  of\r\n\r\nthe  University from the Chief Executive Officer all the  way\r\n\r\ndown to the Bursar.  In contrast, the Bill simply established\r\n\r\na company operating the University.  Although this company is\r\n\r\ntermed as the university company in the Bill, for all intents\r\n\r\nand  purposes, it looks like a regular private  company.   It\r\n\r\nfeels  like  a  private company, and it is indeed  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany.   Other than a few clauses empowering the Government\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  the  assets, the Bill is  silent  on  how  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  to  be run.  So comparing the  two  tiers  of\r\n\r\nstatutes, it is indeed a very significant contrast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, the Government has chosen to\r\n\r\ngrant  SMU  as  much freedom as possible.  In  the  light  of\r\n\r\nrecent  announcement that the Government is  giving  the  two\r\n\r\nestablished  universities,  the  NUS  and  the  NTU,  greater\r\n\r\nlatitude when it comes to self-governance, this is indeed the\r\n\r\nright approach at this juncture in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have in mind is this. Since this is a\r\n\r\nbetter way to run university, should the Government not  also\r\n\r\nconsider repealing the current statutes governing NUS and NTU\r\n\r\nand  re-enact  similar Bills for these  two  universities  as\r\n\r\nwell,   if  not  now  but  maybe  sometime  in  the   future?\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  are  there  any  other  reasons  that  those  two\r\n\r\nuniversities need to be better safeguarded?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another impression that is left in the\r\n\r\npublic  mind  is that the establishment of the SMU  does  not\r\n\r\nseem to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  received  a  thorough deliberation   as  it  rightfully\r\n\r\ndeserves.   From  the  press report, it  seems  that  various\r\n\r\nproposals  for  the  SMU were tabled in  the  past  and  were\r\n\r\nseriously considered.  For instance, it was reported  earlier\r\n\r\nthat  the  NUS  Business School would henceforth  concentrate\r\n\r\nonly on the graduate programme as the undergraduate programme\r\n\r\nwould be transferred to SMU.  Obviously, that is not the case\r\n\r\nnow.   And I believe my colleague, the hon. Dr Tan Boon  Wan,\r\n\r\nwho  is  most familiar with the circumstances, will elaborate\r\n\r\non  this.  In view of this change at a relatively late stage,\r\n\r\none  gets a sense of see-sawing in decision making.   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion  I  have  is: Is the current arrangement  among  the\r\n\r\nthree universities truly the best for Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having said that, let me assure the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  I support the establishment of the SMU  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture   when   we  are  rethinking  the  whole   education\r\n\r\nphilosophy and adapting the education scene to the demand  of\r\n\r\nthe knowledge-based economy.  For a new university, an Act of\r\n\r\nParliament gives it an aura of permanence and stability.   It\r\n\r\ngives   the   SMU  a  stamp  of  approval,  ensuring   public\r\n\r\nrecognition and support.  More importantly, graduates of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  will  be  assured  that  their  degrees  will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised by the Government and their employability  by  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service and the statutory boards will be assured.   In\r\n\r\nthis  aspect,  I  am  indeed very  glad  to  learn  that  our\r\n\r\nPresident has agreed to be appointed to the position  of  the\r\n\r\nPatron and Mr Lim Kim San has accepted the appointment of the\r\n\r\nChancellor.  This will indeed give SMU greater status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also disclosed earlier\r\n\r\nthat  it  will be exploring the use of SAT as a supplementary\r\n\r\nmeasure  for  university admission.  This is  so  because  it\r\n\r\nfeels that its sole dependence on 'A' level examinations  has\r\n\r\nencouraged  certain study habits of our youths and  neglected\r\n\r\ncreativity and innovativeness which are important in the KBE.\r\n\r\nI am glad to note that SMU, with its stronger emphasis on the\r\n\r\nAmerican\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  is using SAT in its initial recruitment  of  100\r\n\r\nstudents out of close to 1,000 applicants.  Selection will be\r\n\r\ndone through personal interviews, review of essays written by\r\n\r\nthe  applicants as well as the SAT scores.  Judging from  the\r\n\r\npress  reports  of the students seeking admission,  they  are\r\n\r\nvery impressive indeed.  There is even one young lady with  a\r\n\r\nSAT score of close to 700 which is very outstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SMU were able to attract the better students, it will\r\n\r\nsignal  to the other two universities that they too  need  to\r\n\r\nenhance  their attractiveness.  It will be no longer business\r\n\r\nas  usual as there will be competition for students.   As  we\r\n\r\nall  know, a certain measure of competition is healthy in all\r\n\r\nfields  of  human  endeavours.   We  can  see  that  in   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our  polytechnics.  With  four  polytechnics\r\n\r\ncompeting  to  attract the better students, our  polytechnics\r\n\r\nhave  become  more  innovative in the  course  offerings  and\r\n\r\nindeed  more responsive to the changing time.  I believe  SMU\r\n\r\nwill have a similar impact on our local universities as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with all the flexibilities of a private\r\n\r\ncompany,  SMU  will have the maximum freedom to  attract  the\r\n\r\nbest faculty through a better remuneration package.  Already,\r\n\r\nit  has attracted several staff from NUS and in response, the\r\n\r\nstaff  in  NUS  Business  School  have  been  offered  better\r\n\r\ncompensation.   However, I would like  to  sound  a  note  of\r\n\r\ncaution here that the universities do not engage in a bidding\r\n\r\nwar  for staff, especially undergraduate teaching staff.   It\r\n\r\nwould  seem  to be a zero sum game if most of the  SMU  staff\r\n\r\nwere recruited from the other Singapore universities and  few\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas.  We should also bear in mind that what  makes\r\n\r\nuniversities excellent and famous has less to do  with  their\r\n\r\nundergraduate  programmes and everything  to  do  with  their\r\n\r\nresearch and graduate programmes.  It is a fact that  in  the\r\n\r\nAmerican universities, research talent is valued greater than\r\n\r\nteaching ability when it comes to the granting of tenures.  I\r\n\r\nstudied  at  Stanford University in the late  70s.   I  still\r\n\r\nrecall  many  Stanford University faculty  members  who  were\r\n\r\ngreat teachers, well beloved by students but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  denied tenure because their research ability was judged\r\n\r\nto  be  below  par even though their teaching abilities  were\r\n\r\noutstanding.  It seems to be the culture in NUS and NTU today\r\n\r\nas  well.  In this respect, Sir, I am heartened to learn that\r\n\r\nSMU has already acquired close to $22 million in its research\r\n\r\nfund and is collaborating with the Wharton Business School to\r\n\r\nestablish the Wharton-SMU Research Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the current enrolment of 400\r\n\r\nstudents per year, SMU will still have a total population  of\r\n\r\nno more than 2,000 students when it is fully established.  By\r\n\r\nall measures, it is indeed a small university and will remain\r\n\r\nso  unless  it  has ambition to develop into a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nuniversity.   The Ministry of Education typically  funds  the\r\n\r\noperation  of the universities on a fixed dollar  amount  per\r\n\r\nstudent  per year.  So if you take the total number of  2,000\r\n\r\nand multiply it out, it seems to be that the total budget for\r\n\r\nSMU   would  be  rather  small  compared  to  the  other  two\r\n\r\nuniversities,   probably  no  bigger  than  the   engineering\r\n\r\nfaculties of the two universities.  I am concerned that SMU's\r\n\r\nsmall size will pose a hindrance to its attractiveness  as  a\r\n\r\ncentre of scholarship.  Furthermore, to restrict to the field\r\n\r\nof  management would seem to be detrimental to the  emergence\r\n\r\nof  a truly great institution as many fields of research  are\r\n\r\nmulti-discipline in nature.  In my opinion, SMU would have to\r\n\r\ngrow  beyond the field of business and management studies  to\r\n\r\nevolve into a university of high esteem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  SMU.  I wish SMU great  success  and  look\r\n\r\nforward to its contributions towards making Singapore a world-class centre of academic excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for permitting me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me declare that I teach at the National\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore.  Sir, I support  this  Bill.   Our\r\n\r\nfuture  is  a  world  of information and  knowledge.   To  be\r\n\r\nrelevant in this new world, our people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust be even better educated and trained.  The new university\r\n\r\nwill   provide  more  opportunities,  as  mentioned  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister, for our young to be educated.  Many who now have to\r\n\r\ngo abroad at great expenses to study may no longer need to do\r\n\r\nso.   The  new  university  will also  make  the  market  for\r\n\r\nacademics more vibrant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to raise some issues and\r\n\r\nconcerns.  In future Singapore, our people have not  only  to\r\n\r\nbe  just  trained  and  educated, but they  need  to  develop\r\n\r\nqualities, values and skills that are now not yet emphasised,\r\n\r\nthings     like     creativity,     innovativeness,     being\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial, being thinking and problem-solving oriented,\r\n\r\na  willingness  to take risks and adapting to lifelong  self-learning.   Our existing education system has strengths  much\r\n\r\nadmired  by  the  world, but it must change  to  develop  the\r\n\r\nfuture   Singaporeans  we  need.   The  Prime  Minister   has\r\n\r\nidentified that this is one of the crucial and critical tasks\r\n\r\nfor  the  nation.  The Ministry of Education has embarked  on\r\n\r\nthis difficult and crucial task.  Many changes have been made\r\n\r\nin  the  education  system  - in the curriculum,  governance,\r\n\r\ntesting  and  measurement,  teachers'  training,  etc.    The\r\n\r\nchanges  have  taken place throughout the  education  system,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  pre-primary  level to ITE and  polytechnics.   Our\r\n\r\nuniversities must also  change.  Since the future  represents\r\n\r\na  paradigm shift, significant changes would be needed in our\r\n\r\nuniversities.  Can our universities meet the challenges?  Can\r\n\r\nthey change?  How should they change?  How can we ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  needed changes are made?  We know where we want  to  go,\r\n\r\nbut how to get there is less easy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concerns have been expressed regarding the quality\r\n\r\nof  degrees  to  be  conferred by the new  university.   This\r\n\r\nconcern  has arisen especially in the wake of the  discussion\r\n\r\nin  the Forum page of the Straits Times on the acceptance  of\r\n\r\nthe  OUDP  degree by the Ministry of Education for a teaching\r\n\r\ncareer.   Questions  have been asked if  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  would state openly the acceptance of SMU  degrees\r\n\r\nfor a civil service career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how you call SMU, that it is a private\r\n\r\ninstitution as opposed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNUS  and NTU as State institutions, like the OUDP, the public\r\n\r\nsees  the SMU as a Government institution.  If the SMU degree\r\n\r\nruns into any problem, the Government will be blamed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new university will raise the competition for\r\n\r\nstudents,  especially for the good ones.   As  GPC  Education\r\n\r\nChairman has stated, ideally the new institution should raise\r\n\r\nnational academic standards.  Good students would want to  go\r\n\r\nto  better  institutions.  But studying is hard  work.   Even\r\n\r\ngood  students  can  be persuaded by promises  of  a  quality\r\n\r\ndegree  with less effort.  Eventually, institutions that  use\r\n\r\nsuch  tactics  will be found out, but the damage  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen done and would endure.  This would be compounded by  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  talents,  especially for a small  nation,  are  a\r\n\r\nscarce  yet  crucial resource.  Furthermore,  our  needs  are\r\n\r\nvaried   and  wide.   We  must  also  ensure  that   in   the\r\n\r\ncompetition,  we also do not end up producing more  graduates\r\n\r\nin  any areas with corresponding scarcity in other areas.  If\r\n\r\nthe  tertiary education market should develop into  a  highly\r\n\r\ncompetitive one, we must pro-act to minimise this undesirable\r\n\r\nfallout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of the university sector has\r\n\r\nincreased  in  pace.   Explosion  is  perhaps  a   more   apt\r\n\r\ndescription.   Besides  NUS, NTU,  we  now  have  OUDP,  SMU,\r\n\r\nINSEAD, Chicago Graduate Business School, John Hopkins,  etc,\r\n\r\nand   other  long  distance  learning  outfits.   All   these\r\n\r\ninstitutions would increase the demand for academic manpower.\r\n\r\nDo  we  have enough of such manpower to go round?   Will  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  such manpower raise the spectre of  job  hopping\r\n\r\nwhose  attending ills are well known from experience in other\r\n\r\nsectors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quality of an academic institution depends much\r\n\r\non  its  staff.  In fact, a large proportion of the recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure of a university goes to staff pays.  Human beings\r\n\r\nwork  best  when they are committed to what they  are  doing.\r\n\r\nSince the capability of an academic lies in his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbrain,  his commitment will reflect the efforts that he  will\r\n\r\nput  in to make available the potential of its upstairs  grey\r\n\r\nmatter.   Therefore, how can we ensure that committed spirits\r\n\r\nrather  than  mercenary  bodies roam  the  corridors  of  our\r\n\r\nuniversities,   or   for   that  matter,    our   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions?    To get the best out from the academic  staff\r\n\r\nand researchers, universities should put more efforts in this\r\n\r\narea of human resource management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also ensure the proper use of staff. We should\r\n\r\navoid  the  use  of academic staff for administrative  duties\r\n\r\nthat  are not related to academic matters.  If academic staff\r\n\r\nare  so  used,  this is surely a case of misuse  of  manpower\r\n\r\nresources  and  funds,  especially  with  regard  to   senior\r\n\r\nacademic staff.  Academic staff are promoted and rewarded  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of their teaching and research, as professional and\r\n\r\nadministrative staff are trained, promoted and rewarded based\r\n\r\non  their  professional and administrative duties.   Each  is\r\n\r\nbetter suited and appropriately equipped for his tasks.   The\r\n\r\nuse  of academic staff for non-academic related functions not\r\n\r\nonly misallocates resources but the practice also demoralises\r\n\r\nprofessional   and  administrative  staff   who   see   their\r\n\r\npromotional prospects curtailed.  The good ones may choose to\r\n\r\nleave.  This will set in a destructive cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, research is all important to top universities in\r\n\r\nthe  developed  countries.  We would also like  to  emphasise\r\n\r\nresearch  in  our universities, but we must not go  overboard\r\n\r\nand  inadvertently run down the importance of teaching.   Our\r\n\r\nuniversities  are  unlike  top  overseas  ones.   With   many\r\n\r\nuniversities in the country, the top ones take  in  only  the\r\n\r\nbest  and can afford to focus on research.  This is a  luxury\r\n\r\nthat  our  universities do not have.  For  our  universities,\r\n\r\nproducing manpower across the board will remain a major role.\r\n\r\nWe neglect this role to our national and long-term detriment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also moving towards using the market to\r\n\r\nprice  the  value of academic staff.  This approach  has  its\r\n\r\nmerits,  but  the question is the extent to which  we  should\r\n\r\nallow  the market to dictate prices.  The market is an  ideal\r\n\r\nmechanism of a rational\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  perfectly competitive environment.  But the  real  world\r\n\r\nseldom fits this description. A small market also has its own\r\n\r\nconstraints.   There  are  academic  disciplines  with   less\r\n\r\napparent  or immediate market value, but the nation may  have\r\n\r\nneed   of   such  expertise  at  some  later  time,   perhaps\r\n\r\nunexpectedly.   How do we ensure that we have such  expertise\r\n\r\nat  our  call?   Will we be able to do so by relying  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the issues that I have just raised may appear to\r\n\r\ncontradict.  They  may be so over the long-term,  or  if  the\r\n\r\nmarket is perfect.  But the short-term effects are real,  and\r\n\r\na  market  is seldom perfect. Some issues already exist.   In\r\n\r\nany  case,  I  hope  the  concerns can  be  looked  into  and\r\n\r\naddressed, or disposed of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an uncertain future which increasingly portends a\r\n\r\nparadigm  shift,  we must take risk.  But we  must  also  not\r\n\r\nabandon  caution to the wind.  We should calculate our  risk.\r\n\r\nModeration   and   balance  may  still  be  relevant   words,\r\n\r\nespecially in the midst of euphoria and earnesty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the advent of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Management University augurs well  for  university\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore.  It adds an additional dimension  to\r\n\r\nthe  landscape  of  management  training  and  education   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As the Minister has said, it expands  university\r\n\r\nopportunities  and no doubt the collaboration  with  renowned\r\n\r\ninstitutions  from abroad will act as an additional  spur  to\r\n\r\ndomestic  competition in the area and  that  should  lead  to\r\n\r\nhigher  quality  all round.  Sir, for all these  reasons  and\r\n\r\nmany others, the Bill is worthy of this House's support and I\r\n\r\nfully endorse it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Explanatory Statement that accompanies this\r\n\r\nBill  asserts that the main object of the SMU is  to  provide\r\n\r\nundergraduate business education in Singapore and it is  with\r\n\r\nregard to this objective that I have certain issues of public\r\n\r\npolicy to raise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental question that I have is whether we\r\n\r\nindeed might be over-providing or over-allocating public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresources  in  the  provision of business  education  at  the\r\n\r\nundergraduate  level.  It is a point that  my  colleague,  Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai  Yuen,  has  also  alluded  to,  but  allow  me  to\r\n\r\nelaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SMU would be the third institution with public\r\n\r\nfunding  to provide such undergraduate business education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  NUS has traditionally done so and NTU is  already\r\n\r\ndoing  so.   This,  in  addition to the plethora  of  private\r\n\r\noutfits  that provide the same courses of a range in quality,\r\n\r\nalso  in  collaboration with overseas  universities,  and  in\r\n\r\naddition, Singapore students are known to go abroad  to  take\r\n\r\nup  post-graduate management courses.  So,  one  could  infer\r\n\r\nthat  both in absolute and, most probably, in relative terms,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of places available for university education  in\r\n\r\nmanagement has increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant concern that I have is that pertaining to\r\n\r\nthe  allocation of scarce talent, a perennial  question  that\r\n\r\nthis  House and, in general, Singapore policymakers  address.\r\n\r\nIf   we  have  three  credible  institutions  with  resources\r\n\r\ncompeting  aggressively,  then  it  is  undeniable  that  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the faculty and the quality of the courses  must\r\n\r\nrise  and with it, their ability to attract talented students\r\n\r\nto  their courses. So, will we end up with a disproportionate\r\n\r\nnumber  of young, talented Singapore students being drawn  to\r\n\r\nundergraduate management degree programmes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have in principle no problem with a management\r\n\r\ndegree but I have always felt, and I believe that many others\r\n\r\nin  this  House  would  agree, that a  management  degree  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  best  applied  when it is accompanied  with  another\r\n\r\ndegree   or   some  other  foundation  in  a  core   science,\r\n\r\nengineering  or other content-based subject.   Especially  in\r\n\r\nthis era where we emphasise a knowledge-based economy and the\r\n\r\nneed  to  acquire core knowledge in areas that would generate\r\n\r\ncreativity and innovation in the future, would our  resources\r\n\r\nbe  better  applied  to  create additional  opportunities  in\r\n\r\nengineering, in the sciences and in other basic core  content\r\n\r\nsubject areas and allowing more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate sector provision of management courses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these issues, I have a few questions to\r\n\r\nraise.  The  first, as I have already alluded to, is  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is a plan for the Ministry to scale back the provision\r\n\r\nof undergraduate business programmes, if not in SMU, since it\r\n\r\nis  a  new  institution  with  this  stated  objective,  then\r\n\r\ncertainly the so-called state universities, NTU and NUS.   As\r\n\r\nwas  mentioned earlier in this debate, at one  point  in  the\r\n\r\ndeliberations leading to the establishment of the SMU, it was\r\n\r\nsuggested  that in fact undergraduate business education  may\r\n\r\nbe discontinued in some of the state institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if indeed that is not the case, then is there\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a  policy  to help NUS and  NTU  differentiate\r\n\r\nthemselves  from  SMU?  One thought that  comes  to  mind  is\r\n\r\nwhether  NUS and NTU could provide business degree programmes\r\n\r\nin conjunction with a content-based programme leading to twin\r\n\r\ndegrees, in other words, a business degree would not stand on\r\n\r\nits  own  but  together with a content  degree,  such  as  in\r\n\r\nengineering  or  in science, and bio-chemistry.   This  would\r\n\r\nnaturally    contribute    to   creating    the    kind    of\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship  that  we  are  talking  about  and   these\r\n\r\nindividuals  would  have  both  core  skills  that  we   deem\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, if that is not the case, could greater emphasis\r\n\r\ninstead  be  placed  on  post-graduate  management  training,\r\n\r\nparticularly   in  our  state  universities,   allowing   for\r\n\r\nundergraduate training where it occurs to be largely taken up\r\n\r\nat the SMU level?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, this is a point that my colleague, Dr Wang, has\r\n\r\nraised and I would like to reinforce.  If we believe that the\r\n\r\nprivate  company model might better serve the development  of\r\n\r\nuniversity institutions like SMU, then perhaps we  should  go\r\n\r\nfurther  down  that  path with other  business  faculties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If we take the analogy of the United States,  the\r\n\r\nbusiness course is probably one of the few courses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere you can put almost at the start of the course the value\r\n\r\nyou  would  accrue  as  a student or as  a  graduate  of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   It  is  one  of the most likely  courses  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided  on  a private basis because students can  do  their\r\n\r\nnumbers at the outset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on from these general public policy\r\n\r\nquestions, I have some specific questions pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\nfunding  for the SMU which is mentioned in clause 6  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.   I welcome the Minister's statement that SMU would  be\r\n\r\ngiven  considerable  autonomy and  flexibility  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide management training and education creatively.  But it\r\n\r\nstill  begs the question of accountability, given that public\r\n\r\nfunds  would  be deployed.  And the questions I have  on  the\r\n\r\nfunding  principles are, first, I presume the funding formula\r\n\r\nwould  be  pegged to that used for the Business Faculties  of\r\n\r\nNUS  or NTU in order to ensure some degree of a level playing\r\n\r\nfield.   Second, as I listened to my colleague, Dr  Tan  talk\r\n\r\nabout the competition for talent to teach management courses,\r\n\r\nmy immediate concern is one of an inflationary spiral. We are\r\n\r\nprivatising the wage rates for those faculty staff  for  whom\r\n\r\nthere is a reasonably comparable market equivalent and if  we\r\n\r\nalso  add  on  to that the notion that there is going  to  be\r\n\r\ncompetition across institutions for limited talent, then some\r\n\r\ndegree  of  wage increases is inevitable.  The question  then\r\n\r\nis:  would funding to SMU be somehow capped, or would it rise\r\n\r\nin  tandem  with  any  projected wage increase  that  we  can\r\n\r\nanticipate or not anticipate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question I have is whether, in the spirit of\r\n\r\nkeeping   SMU   a   private  institution  with   considerable\r\n\r\nflexibility  and autonomy, there is a timeframe  after  which\r\n\r\nsuch  funding from the public sector would be phased  out  so\r\n\r\nthat the institution can indeed function, as it should, as an\r\n\r\nindependent,  autonomous and flexible  institution  providing\r\n\r\nquality management education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and  item  3  on the Order  Paper  for  today  be\r\n\r\nexempted  at  this  day's  sitting  from  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, like many of the colleagues who had spoken before me,\r\n\r\nbelieve that the SMU can and will have a place in Singapore's\r\n\r\neducation  landscape.   Before  I  proceed  further,  let  me\r\n\r\ndeclare  that I am an employee of the National University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, much has been made of the idea that the SMU\r\n\r\nis  to  be  a private university, different from the National\r\n\r\nUniversity   of   Singapore  and  the  Nanyang  Technological\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Much has also been talked about the fact that it\r\n\r\nis  a  public company limited by guarantee.  Let  me  briefly\r\n\r\nexplain this concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike its name, public company, whenever you mention\r\n\r\nthat  idea,  it immediately invokes the idea  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nlisted company for private gain. A public company limited  by\r\n\r\nguarantee is quite different.  It is for public purpose,  but\r\n\r\nin  some  ways, it is not part of the Government  and  it  is\r\n\r\nruled  by  the Companies Act.  And in this form of structure,\r\n\r\nthere  are  founder members who give a nominal guarantee  for\r\n\r\nthe  financial  credibility  of the  company.  This  form  of\r\n\r\nincorporation has been used for several institutions such  as\r\n\r\nthe   Institute  of  Policy  Studies  (IPS),  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational Foundation (SIF) and a number of other entities\r\n\r\nwhich  are  clear public in character, but for some  reasons,\r\n\r\nwish to have much more flexibility and freedom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important in thinking about how the light\r\n\r\nmanagement of the SMU can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndone.  I take the Minister seriously when he talks about this\r\n\r\nneed  for a lighter touch.  There is a need therefore  for  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  the autonomy of this  body,  which  by  its\r\n\r\nconstitution  is  governed  by a Committee  and  the  founder\r\n\r\nmembers  and  the accountability that might come  to  anybody\r\n\r\nthat  receives public money. With those thoughts, may I  turn\r\n\r\nto the particular clauses of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern is clause 4. Here, the Minister has\r\n\r\npowers  to appoint the entire Board. To me, this is  quite  a\r\n\r\nsweeping  power  if  we are trying to  keep  this  a  private\r\n\r\nuniversity, in the sense of understanding it to be driven not\r\n\r\nonly by the Government but by its founder members and by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  as  a whole.  And here, I think the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would then obviate the role of the founder  members\r\n\r\nof this institution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when I turn to clause 5(1)(d), I am also\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Here, the Ministry must approve of any change  to\r\n\r\na  constituent  document of the SMU.  For the earlier  parts,\r\n\r\n(a),  (b),  (c),   I am quite agreeable.  If the  company  is\r\n\r\nwound up, or if the company has disposed of its properties or\r\n\r\nother  major assets, I think the Government, having given  it\r\n\r\nits  land and money, needs to know this.  But I think  it  is\r\n\r\ntoo  wide  indeed  to  require that any change  receives  the\r\n\r\nMinister's approval.  It makes it just like a statutory body.\r\n\r\nIt  makes it just like amending the statute of the NUS or NTU\r\n\r\nand  I think this moves away from the idea of a lighter touch\r\n\r\nthat we seem to be looking for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is clause 8 and this comes to the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the  student  bodies.  And  here  again,  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of the student bodies in the SMU are  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe Societies Act and the Societies Act would allow the right\r\n\r\nto   refuse  certain  applications  and  the  right  to  view\r\n\r\naccounts,  etc. Why is this needed if we want  to  give  this\r\n\r\nbody a greater autonomy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned that a former Minister, Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Kim  San, has accepted the appointment of Chancellor  of\r\n\r\nthe new SMU.  I welcome this move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Lim has enjoyed a tremendous reputation in Singapore, not\r\n\r\nonly in the public sector but also in the governance of large\r\n\r\npublic  companies.  However, I would like to remind us  again\r\n\r\nthat  this is going to be a private university, and if it  is\r\n\r\ntruly  to  be private, I hope the Minister will clarify  that\r\n\r\nthe  role  of  the Chancellor is clearly non-executive.   The\r\n\r\nrunning of the SMU must be with its professional staff,  such\r\n\r\nas  the President and those under the Provost.  I am reminded\r\n\r\nof  this  particularly because when the NUS started  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the NUS is a state university, the then Minister  and\r\n\r\nnow  Deputy  Prime  Minister Tony  Tan  was  the  first  Vice\r\n\r\nChancellor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my last point, Mr Speaker, and this is\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the funding of the SMU.  I take it  seriously\r\n\r\nthat the SMU is to be a private institution. And as a private\r\n\r\ninstitution focusing on business, it should be able, after  a\r\n\r\nwhile, if it has enough reputation, to become privatised  and\r\n\r\nmore  or  less  self-sufficient in terms of its  funding.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister whether there are plans  over\r\n\r\ntime  to reduce the amount of funding given to SMU and,  with\r\n\r\nthat,  to  reduce  the amount of Government supervision  over\r\n\r\nthis new entity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am glad that a third\r\n\r\nuniversity  in  Singapore has finally come to  fruition.   In\r\n\r\n1984,  the Opposition called for the setting up of  a  second\r\n\r\nuniversity.   When the Nanyang Technological  University  was\r\n\r\nformed,  it  called  on  the  Government  to  start  a  third\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Now the third university is established,  albeit\r\n\r\na  rather  specialist  one, confining itself  mainly  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  only  disciplines confined to  the  subject  of\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is supposed to embark on a knowledge\r\n\r\nbased economy.  Yet, the number of universities that we  have\r\n\r\ncompared  to Australia or New Zealand is very low.  In  those\r\n\r\ncountries,  they  have  one  university  for  about   500,000\r\n\r\npopulation.    By  the  standard  of  those  two   countries,\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  have about six universities  now  and  not\r\n\r\nthree, since our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npopulation  is  about  three  million.   I  wonder   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is thinking of setting up more universities in the\r\n\r\nnear  future.   I  think  it  should  as  Singapore  is  also\r\n\r\nembarking  on  the policies of globalisation  and  attracting\r\n\r\nforeign talents.  The globalisation policy will require  more\r\n\r\nqualified  Singaporeans  to  travel  abroad  and  thus   more\r\n\r\nuniversity  graduates.  We should have  enough  graduates  to\r\n\r\nbuffer the impact of foreign talent or otherwise we shall  be\r\n\r\nswamped by foreign talents coming to work here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of foreign students, I understand that\r\n\r\nat  present,  the  Government's policy is rather  liberal  on\r\n\r\nforeign  students.  I think this is a good policy.   We  must\r\n\r\nnot shut out foreign students who qualify to be admitted into\r\n\r\nour  universities.   There are merits  to  encourage  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents  to  study in Singapore.  Having said that,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we  must  not deprive our  local  students  from\r\n\r\nobtaining a tertiary education by making the entry point  too\r\n\r\ndifficult  for them, or run short of places due to taking  in\r\n\r\ntoo many foreign students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, studying abroad is not cheap. It costs quite\r\n\r\na  lot  of  money  for a parent to send a child  overseas  to\r\n\r\nstudy.   Not  all  Singaporeans are that wealthy.   A  middle\r\n\r\nclass family may be able to send one child overseas to  do  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree,  but to send two for the  average  middle\r\n\r\nclass  family is not possible.  Therefore, provision to  make\r\n\r\nenough  university  places  for  locals  to  study  is   most\r\n\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I saw a TV programme about a 50-year old\r\n\r\nAustralian lady who is allowed to study in the NTU.  I should\r\n\r\nsay  that we should also not put an age limit on Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  wish to pursue a university degree in our local tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions, even if they have passed the normal  university\r\n\r\nentry  age.  We should not shut out mature students who  have\r\n\r\nmissed the boat in the first instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is we should ask ourselves what type of\r\n\r\nuniversities  we like to establish in Singapore.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we should establish another strictly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontrolled  university, one where the  majority  of  students\r\n\r\ndare not think independently.  They are mostly to become  yes\r\n\r\nmen,  and  also they dare not dissent or join the opposition,\r\n\r\nalthough   the   opposition   operates   strictly   by    the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  I do not think that we should set  up  another\r\n\r\nstrictly  controlled university, but a university  that  will\r\n\r\nproduce  students who dare to think differently and  who  are\r\n\r\ndynamic   and   who   have  leadership  and   entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nqualities.   I  am afraid the SMU shall not be one  of  those\r\n\r\ntypes of universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that under this Bill, when it becomes law, it\r\n\r\nshall  make  the SMU totally controlled by the Minister.   We\r\n\r\nsee that the Board of Governors shall be all appointed by the\r\n\r\nMinister.   If  that is the case, the Minister  surely  shall\r\n\r\nappoint  like-minded  people to the  Board,  and  like-minded\r\n\r\npeople  cannot promulgate new and daring ideas.  There  shall\r\n\r\nonly   be  inbreeding  of  ideas  and  there  is  no   cross-fertilisation  of fresh new ideas.  I urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nallow different sectors of the business community, the labour\r\n\r\nmovement   and  other  academic  professionals   to   appoint\r\n\r\nindependent trustees to the Board, so that daring  new  ideas\r\n\r\ncan  be  introduced into the SMU to make it produce  students\r\n\r\nwho  are not only technically competent but who are bold  and\r\n\r\ndaring  to  introduce new ideas and make  Singapore  a  truly\r\n\r\ndynamic place to do business in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be permitted\r\n\r\nto  seek a clarification from Mr Chiam?  He mentioned in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  that in Australia, there is one university for  every\r\n\r\n500,000 population.  That means if you look at the population\r\n\r\nof  Australia which is close to 17-18 million, he is  talking\r\n\r\nabout a total number of 300 universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 34 universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> 34 universities. Sir, I withdraw my\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My mathematics is not that bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Members have\r\n\r\nobserved, the Bill is, in fact, a minimalist one and it  does\r\n\r\nnot  contain  a lot in it.  Dr Wang has asked where  are  the\r\n\r\nprovisions   governing  the  operation  of  the   SMU.    The\r\n\r\nprovisions governing the operations of the SMU are, in  fact,\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the Memorandum and Articles of Association  of\r\n\r\nthe  company.   In  fact,  the  Memorandum  and  Articles  of\r\n\r\nAssociation  contain  how  the company  should  be  run,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and  the roles of the  Chancellor  and  the\r\n\r\nother  principal  officers of the university,  including  the\r\n\r\nPresident,  the  Provost, Secretary,  the  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nfaculty and the departments and so on.  So the Memorandum and\r\n\r\nArticles  of  Association,  in  effect,  functions   like   a\r\n\r\nconstitution of the NUS and the NTU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are starting up a new university, we decided to\r\n\r\nadopt  this  new  model  so that we can  leave  many  of  the\r\n\r\ndetailed  issues in the governance of the university  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany rather than to incorporate them into the Act and have\r\n\r\nto  come to Parliament if the company does want to change any\r\n\r\nof the ways in which it wants to govern itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is currently having a look at\r\n\r\nuniversity grants and funding and governance with a  view  to\r\n\r\ngranting   more   autonomy   but,   of   course,   with   the\r\n\r\naccountability.   The  university's  governance  and  funding\r\n\r\ncommittee  will  be ready to report its findings  later  this\r\n\r\nyear.   And  the experiences that we have from the management\r\n\r\nof  SMU  and also the experiences that we will have from  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  NUS  and  NTU under  any  new  structures  or\r\n\r\ngovernance  methods that we have will, of course, be  applied\r\n\r\nto improve the governance of all three of our universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has also asked why we have set up the SMU in\r\n\r\nthis  way  and  whether or not this is optimal  or  the  best\r\n\r\nsolution  for  the university sector in Singapore.   We  have\r\n\r\ntalked about this for quite some time and decided that if  we\r\n\r\nset  up three universities which were basically identical and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive, then they would compete with each other to the\r\n\r\ndetriment of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuniversity sector in Singapore.   Because all of them will be\r\n\r\ntrying too hard to be like each other, and some would win and\r\n\r\nsome would lose and that may not be the best positioning  for\r\n\r\nthe  small  number of universities that we have in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHence,  we  decided  that  it may  be  a  better  competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment  for the universities if each one  could  develop\r\n\r\nits  own  characteristics and niche areas of excellence,  but\r\n\r\nwith some overlap in the courses and programmes which each of\r\n\r\nthe universities offers, so that there will be a good balance\r\n\r\nbetween  competition as well as allowing each  university  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  an  area of specialisation and something which  they\r\n\r\nbecome known for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had initially intended to start SMU out of the NTU\r\n\r\nBusiness  School, as a seed for which to grow the university.\r\n\r\nBut  as we studied the matter further and as we were able  to\r\n\r\nconsider very close association with Wharton School, we  felt\r\n\r\nthat  we  would have the confidence to be able to  start  SMU\r\n\r\nafresh, on its own, and this would allow us to introduce many\r\n\r\nmore  new innovations and ideas than if we were to start  SMU\r\n\r\nout  of part of one of the existing universities.  And so  we\r\n\r\nchose to go in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will SMU be too small? This is one of the questions\r\n\r\nthat  Dr  Wang asked.  We are starting SMU at a  modest  size\r\n\r\nwith about 300 students in its first year, because we want to\r\n\r\nensure that the intake quality is good so that SMU will start\r\n\r\non  a  good  solid footing.  That also means that we  can  be\r\n\r\nquite selective about the staff that are recruited into  SMU.\r\n\r\nThat  again will assure high quality of SMU.  But  we  expect\r\n\r\nthat  SMU  will  grow over 5-7 years, perhaps to  3,000-4,000\r\n\r\nstudents, and together with its executive programmes and  its\r\n\r\ngraduate  programmes, that would be quite a nice size  for  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  already.  In fact, NTU and NUS  with  16,000  and\r\n\r\nover  20,000 students respectively are already quite  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  size and can be quite unwieldy to manage.  So  I  feel\r\n\r\nconfident  that SMU will be able to develop into a university\r\n\r\nwith enough critical mass to achieve excellence.  And in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime,  it  will expand its course offerings into other  areas\r\n\r\nrelated to business and management.  I do not expect that SMU\r\n\r\nwill  begin  to  offer  courses in heavy  engineering  or  in\r\n\r\nesoteric areas in science and so forth, because that  is  not\r\n\r\nan  area  in  which  we foresee SMU developing  its  area  of\r\n\r\nexpertise.  Hence, the name Singapore Management University.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang and Dr Tan Boon Wan have also asked about\r\n\r\nstandards  of  the university and the degrees.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nthings  that is happening in Singapore today in which Members\r\n\r\nof this House and members of the public have to understand is\r\n\r\nthat there is a variety of programmes in Singapore offering a\r\n\r\nvariety  of qualifications.  We have NUS, NTU, SMU, OUDP  and\r\n\r\nmany  other institutions offering twinning degrees of various\r\n\r\nkinds.    As   the   variety  and  number  of  qualifications\r\n\r\nincreases,  we must understand that employers will eventually\r\n\r\nbe   the  final  arbiter  of  whom  they  consider  as   most\r\n\r\nappropriate for the job that they are looking for a person to\r\n\r\nfill.  This eventually will have to be the situation.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible for the Ministry of Education to become a giant\r\n\r\naccrediting   agency  that  accredits  all   the   university\r\n\r\nqualifications in the world.  We already have enough  trouble\r\n\r\ntrying  to  maintain standards in our own  universities.   It\r\n\r\nwould not be possible for us to try to check on the standards\r\n\r\nof  universities all across the world over which we  have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol.   Hence,  it is really a matter for  the  individual\r\n\r\nemployers  to  decide what students and what  graduates  they\r\n\r\nwould  find most appropriate for the kinds of jobs that  they\r\n\r\nhave.  That applies to the Government as an employer as  well\r\n\r\nbecause  Government has a range of jobs  open  and  what  one\r\n\r\nstatutory  board may look for in an employee may be different\r\n\r\nfrom  what  another Government department or  another  agency\r\n\r\ndoes.   These are things which are best left to employers  to\r\n\r\ndecide  and  to  settle.  Students also have  to  decide  for\r\n\r\nthemselves whether to take up particular courses, whether  it\r\n\r\nsuits their needs or their career aspirations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mr Iswaran have asked about\r\n\r\ncompetition for students and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether there is over provision of places for management  and\r\n\r\nbusiness students. The overall allocation of places which are\r\n\r\nsubsidised  and  funded by the Government is settled  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Manpower  Committee chaired by my   colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Manpower, and in which the Ministry of Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry, the Ministry of Education, EDB and other interested\r\n\r\nparties  are present. We try to estimate as best we  can  the\r\n\r\ntypes  of  manpower that we need in the future, and  we  will\r\n\r\nfund  places in the institutions of higher learning to  train\r\n\r\nsuch  manpower.  So there should be no danger  of  us  willy-nilly increasing the training of business students way beyond\r\n\r\nwhat  we expect the economy to be able to absorb or what  the\r\n\r\neconomy  needs.  As a matter of fact, both NTU and  NUS  have\r\n\r\nreduced  their undergraduate intake and when SMU  begins  its\r\n\r\nfirst  intake this year, we expect that we will  continue  to\r\n\r\nadjust  the intakes of these three universities so  that  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  business students who will receive funding  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the form of subsidies to the  institutions\r\n\r\nof  higher  learning  will be within reason  and  within  the\r\n\r\nbounds of what we expect the economy will absorb.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan also asks about competition for\r\n\r\nprofessors.   If  the  economy  has  a  demand  or  need  for\r\n\r\ngraduates of this type, we will have to try to train them  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  this need.  If necessary, we will recruit  professors\r\n\r\nworldwide, not just from Singapore, who can augment  whatever\r\n\r\nteaching  and  professorial resources we have  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  has  always  been the approach in our  institutions  of\r\n\r\nhigher learning.  I do agree with Dr Tan Boon Wan that  there\r\n\r\nneeds  to be a good balance between teaching and research  in\r\n\r\nour  universities so that one does not suffer because we have\r\n\r\nover emphasised the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move to funding. Mr Iswaran asks about funding\r\n\r\nfor the SMU.  Yes, Government will fund capital and recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of the SMU, including its start-up  costs.   Our\r\n\r\nintention  is  to  fund it basically on  the  same  basis  as\r\n\r\nsimilar courses in NUS and NTU will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfunded.   Is there a time frame to phase out public  funding?\r\n\r\nWe  have not established such a time frame.  We want to  give\r\n\r\nthe  university a good start up so that it will  be  able  to\r\n\r\noffer  courses of high quality.  Of course,  we will be  very\r\n\r\nhappy  if  the university proves that it can raise a  lot  of\r\n\r\nfunding  and I will be more than happy to reduce the  funding\r\n\r\nto the university if it is able to fend for itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan raised a number of issues with regard to\r\n\r\npersonnel  deployment  and management, professorial  salaries\r\n\r\nand  so  forth.   These are matters which I  will  leave  for\r\n\r\nanother  time to answer when we have finished our studies  on\r\n\r\nuniversity governance and funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asks why clauses 4 and 5(1)(d) are needed.\r\n\r\nBasically, it is because we provide substantial public  funds\r\n\r\nto  the  SMU  and  we  have provided land and  buildings  and\r\n\r\nrecurrent funding to the university for a public purpose.  If\r\n\r\nI were not able to influence the direction of the university,\r\n\r\nand  I am providing funds to them, one of these days Mr Simon\r\n\r\nTay  may  well call me to account and ask me why I  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   running  the  university  properly  and  why  is   the\r\n\r\nuniversity wasting money and so forth.   So the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation has a responsibility to make sure that while public\r\n\r\nfunds  are being provided to the university, persons of  good\r\n\r\nreputation who are able to run the university well are put in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the  university  and  that  the  funds  that  the\r\n\r\nuniversity is given are well expended for the purposes  which\r\n\r\nwe have set out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about clause 8. Why is it necessary\r\n\r\nto  have this clause for the student bodies.  This clause  is\r\n\r\nalso contained in the NUS Act and the NTU Act and the purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  clause  is  to ensure that all student  bodies  are\r\n\r\nregistered with the Registrar of Societies who is granted the\r\n\r\npower  to  refuse to register societies if the rules  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety are insufficient to provide for its proper management\r\n\r\nand  control,  or if the society is likely  to  be  used  for\r\n\r\nunlawful  purposes  or it will be contrary  to  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest  for the society to be registered.  So this  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  from NUS or NTU.  We basically want to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  universities do not have student bodies  that  are\r\n\r\nformed  for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare  or\r\n\r\ngood  order  in Singapore.  But within those parameters,  the\r\n\r\nuniversities, as you know, NUS and NTU, have been  organising\r\n\r\nall  kinds of activities.  Mr Chiam, for example, has  spoken\r\n\r\nthere  a  number  of  times and I am  sure  that  if  he  has\r\n\r\nsomething  new and interesting to say, the students  will  be\r\n\r\nhappy to invite him back again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also raised a number of issues. If only\r\n\r\nstarting  a university were as easy as calling for it  to  be\r\n\r\nstarted, but it is not easy to start a university and we have\r\n\r\nhad  to think very, very carefully about starting up SMU  and\r\n\r\nhow  to start it, because a university lives and dies by  its\r\n\r\nquality and its standard.  You can start a university but  if\r\n\r\nit  does  not have the quality and standard, then it  is  not\r\n\r\nworth starting one up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also makes a mistake in comparing the number of\r\n\r\nuniversities  to  population, as  though  that  is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant thing.  The most important thing to compare is what\r\n\r\nis  the  cohort participation rate for higher education,  and\r\n\r\nnot  the  number  of  universities.  What percentage  of  the\r\n\r\ncohort  is able to attend higher education. That is  the  key\r\n\r\nnumber.   In  Singapore,  we have 20% going  to  universities\r\n\r\ntoday.  When SMU has reached full capacity, we expect that to\r\n\r\nbe 25%. We also have 40% going to our polytechnics, adding up\r\n\r\nto  some  60% to 65% of a cohort going for higher  education.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the highest percentages in the world.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom,  they  converted all their  polytechnics  to\r\n\r\nuniversities and they have attained 35% of a cohort going  to\r\n\r\nuniversity.   We  have  kept our university  and  polytechnic\r\n\r\nsector  separate  and we are attaining  60%  to  65%  already\r\n\r\ntoday.  In Hong Kong ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have a\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

So I can quite safely say that there\r\n\r\nare more than 20% who would want to go to university.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  very easy for Mr Chiam to say that we should have  more\r\n\r\nuniversities and it is easy for me, at the stroke of  a  pen,\r\n\r\nto  allow 100% of a cohort to go to university and issue them\r\n\r\nwith degrees.  But the question that Mr Chiam needs to answer\r\n\r\nis:  what  are  the  degrees worth?   That  is  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nquestion  when  you look at the university  qualification  or\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree.  NUS and NTU are held in  high  standing.\r\n\r\nOur polytechnics are held in very high standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have another\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister?  The Minister asks how  much\r\n\r\nis a university degree worth.  This question has been debated\r\n\r\nmany,  many  times.   In other words,  do  you  just  want  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree?   What  is the purpose  of  a  university\r\n\r\ndegree?  People say that the university is a training ground,\r\n\r\nnot just to get a degree.  But the point is the end result of\r\n\r\ngoing  to university is not just getting a university degree.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that one goes through three years of training,  one\r\n\r\nmay  do  100,  200, 300 or 400 assignments, essays,  reports,\r\n\r\nwhat  have you.  Just like in the United States, they  reason\r\n\r\nthat   a  student  going  through  such  training  will  gain\r\n\r\nsomething for life regardless of what sort of degree he  gets\r\n\r\nin the end.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I would not like to attend the\r\n\r\nuniversity which Mr Chiam starts, Mr Speaker.  But as I  have\r\n\r\nexplained,  we already have 60% to 65% of a cohort  going  to\r\n\r\nhigher  education.   Our  polytechnics  are  extremely   high\r\n\r\nquality  institutions.  If you take a comparison  again,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   Hong  Kong  too  converted  its  polytechnics   to\r\n\r\nuniversities and its participation rate in universities today\r\n\r\nis 18%.  We have a very, very high\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparticipation  rate in higher education, and by  keeping  our\r\n\r\nuniversities   as  universities,  and  our  polytechnics   as\r\n\r\npolytechnics, we have been able to provide education which is\r\n\r\nsuitable  for the aptitudes of a wide cohort of our  students\r\n\r\nwhile maintaining an extremely high quality in both types  of\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also asks about foreign students and he\r\n\r\nsupported  the  Government's  policy  of  admitting   foreign\r\n\r\nstudents  in our institutions.  I am glad that Mr Chiam  does\r\n\r\nsupport  this.   As I have explained, we have  increased  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of students and the cohort participation rate of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  students  in  higher education consistently  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   In 1980, there were only 5% of the cohort  going  to\r\n\r\nuniversities and 8% to polytechnics, ie, 13%.  In  1999,  20%\r\n\r\nwere   going   to   universities  and  40%  were   going   to\r\n\r\npolytechnics.  So there is no shortage of places for students\r\n\r\nwho  can  qualify for these institutions and who can  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom this education even with the intake of foreign students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also asks whether we would allow mature\r\n\r\nstudents  to go to university.  The answer is yes.  We  allow\r\n\r\nstudents to go to university by a number of routes today.  In\r\n\r\nfact, out of the 8,600 students who were admitted to NUS  and\r\n\r\nNTU  last  year, 900 of them came from the polytechnics.   In\r\n\r\nthe  new university admission system, we have explicitly laid\r\n\r\ndown three different routes by which students can qualify  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  universities: (1) from JCs and \"A\"  levels;  (2)\r\n\r\nthrough  the  polytechnics;  and (3)  from  mature  students,\r\n\r\ntaking  into account their SAT or reasoning test results  and\r\n\r\ntheir  work experience or whatever other qualifications  they\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the questions\r\n\r\nthat have been raised by Members.  I would like to thank them\r\n\r\nfor their interest in the subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> If I may ask the Minister for a\r\n\r\nclarification.  The Minister, in reply to me, has pointed out\r\n\r\nwhy   clauses  4  and  5  are  necessary  to  retain   public\r\n\r\naccountability.  But the other end of my question\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas: how does this allow SMU to indeed be autonomous, have  a\r\n\r\nlighter  touch  and  be  a private  university?   How  is  it\r\n\r\ndifferent from NUS and NTU?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> It is different from NUS and NTU in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that it is operating in a company  framework  and\r\n\r\ncompany environment rather than in the environment of an  Act\r\n\r\nof  Parliament.  So they have quite a lot more flexibility to\r\n\r\nmanage the company in the way that they deem fit, and also it\r\n\r\nis  easier to change the M&A of the company.  Even  though  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  approve,  it is easier to change  the  M&A  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany  than it would be to change the Act where we have  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  Parliament.   So there will  be  considerably  more\r\n\r\nautonomy and freedom of action and flexibility on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  Board of Trustees of the SMU than there will be for  the\r\n\r\nBoard of Governors or the Council of NTU and NUS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [RAdm Teo Chee Hean].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRISONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>4.18 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Act was last amended in 1997. Further\r\n\r\namendments  to the Prisons Act are now necessary  to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness of our Prisons Service and offer our penal\r\n\r\npopulation with more rehabilitation opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Community-Based Sentences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first cover the main set of amendments, which\r\n\r\nare  related  to the introduction of Tail-End Home  Detention\r\n\r\nfor penal inmates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, I asked my Minister of State to chair an Inter-Ministry Committee to examine the feasibility of introducing\r\n\r\nCommunity-Based  Sentences into our criminal justice  system.\r\n\r\nAmong  its  recommendations are the extension of the  use  of\r\n\r\nProbation to adult offenders, and the introduction  of  Tail-End  Home Detention, Boot Camp, Community Service Orders  and\r\n\r\nRe-integrative Shaming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is mindful that the use of Community-Based\r\n\r\nSentences must neither compromise the objectives of our penal\r\n\r\nregime, nor give the victim or the public the impression that\r\n\r\nour  system  is  becoming  lenient  towards  perpetrators  of\r\n\r\ncrimes.   Tough penalties would continue to be meted  out  to\r\n\r\ndeserving  offenders.  Community-Based Sentences  complement,\r\n\r\nnot   replace,   the  traditional  forms  of  punishment   of\r\n\r\nimprisonment, caning and fines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is scope, however, in Singapore's criminal justice\r\n\r\nsystem   for  lighter  sentencing  options  with  a   greater\r\n\r\nrehabilitative element for those who commit relatively  minor\r\n\r\noffences, and first-time offenders.  This is especially so if\r\n\r\nthere  are  mitigating circumstances.  That  is  why  we  are\r\n\r\namending  the  Prisons Act to provide for the  Tail-End  Home\r\n\r\nDetention Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tail-End Home Detention for Penal Inmates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail-End Home Detention is not new. Home Detention has\r\n\r\nbeen implemented at the tail-end of the detention period  for\r\n\r\ndrug   inmates  and  Criminal  Law  Detainees  as   well   as\r\n\r\nReformative  trainees  released onto  statutory  supervision.\r\n\r\nCountries like the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  implemented Home Detention.  It  serves  as  an\r\n\r\navenue  for  the earlier release of prisoners  who  are  most\r\n\r\namenable  to  rehabilitation.  Its  implementation  serves  a\r\n\r\nnumber of purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, allowing the offender to be closer to his\r\n\r\nfamily  and the community will help him to better reintegrate\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsociety after incarceration.  The deterrent element is  still\r\n\r\nretained  as offenders will be subjected to restrictions  and\r\n\r\nsurveillance  via  electronic  tagging.   Secondly,  as  this\r\n\r\nscheme allows offenders to remain in the community, it  keeps\r\n\r\nthe  families  intact and allows offenders  to  be  gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed.   Reaction  to  our  announcement  of  the  Scheme,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  from  families  of  offenders,  has   been\r\n\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill introduces a new Part IVA in the\r\n\r\nPrisons  Act  to  provide  for the  Tail-end  Home  Detention\r\n\r\nScheme.   The  Scheme will allow selected  offenders  serving\r\n\r\njail  terms of six months and above to be released  early  on\r\n\r\nhome  detention  up  to  a  maximum  of  six  months.   These\r\n\r\noffenders   must  have  served  at  least   half   of   their\r\n\r\nimprisonment term before they become eligible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of eligible inmates will be based on a\r\n\r\nstringent  set of criteria.  Only offenders who are  assessed\r\n\r\nto  be  least  likely  to  pose a risk  to  society  will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered   for   the   Scheme.   Prisoners   serving   life\r\n\r\nimprisonment,  offenders of serious or  violent  crimes,  and\r\n\r\ndrug and sexual offenders will not be eligible.  Clause 24 of\r\n\r\nthe Bill provides for a new Schedule which lists the type  of\r\n\r\nineligible  offenders.  In addition, eligible offenders  will\r\n\r\ngo   through   rigorous  assessments   to   determine   their\r\n\r\nsuitability   for   emplacement  onto  the   Scheme.    These\r\n\r\nassessments   will  be  conducted  by  the  internal   Prison\r\n\r\ncommittees as well as an independent Advisory Committee, made\r\n\r\nup  of  distinguished members of the community.  The conduct,\r\n\r\nattitude and response to rehabilitation and the risk  factors\r\n\r\nof eligible offenders will be scrutinised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Home Detention, offenders will be released on\r\n\r\nlicence  to  reside at home under strict regulatory  control,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes  mandatory reporting to the  authorities  for\r\n\r\ncounselling  and stipulated curfew hours of 10 pm  to  7  am,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be monitored via electronic tagging.   Offenders\r\n\r\nare  also  required to be gainfully employed or  involved  in\r\n\r\nacademic  pursuits.  Those who violate these  conditions  are\r\n\r\nliable to be recalled to prison while the breach is being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestigated.    Those  found  guilty  of  breach   will   be\r\n\r\nadjudicated  and  punished,  and have  their  release  orders\r\n\r\nrevoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Outsourcing of Prisons Escort Functions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to the proposed outsourcing of\r\n\r\nPrisons  escort functions and the consequential extension  of\r\n\r\nthe necessary powers to commercial security agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, armed prison officers escort and guard\r\n\r\ninmates  during trips outside prisons and drug  institutions.\r\n\r\nSuch outside escort duties include hospital and security ward\r\n\r\nduty,  escort  for  court attendance and  inter-institutional\r\n\r\nprisoner  transfer.   Outsourcing the escorting  of  low-risk\r\n\r\nprisoners  to a commercial security agency will free  trained\r\n\r\nprison  officers to take on more sensitive and  higher  value\r\n\r\nfrontline  operational  duties such  as  the  management  and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  of  inmates.  Prison  officers  will  however\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  escort high-risk prisoners.  Clause  7  of  the\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill introduces a new section in the Prisons Act to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Director of Prisons to employ auxiliary  police\r\n\r\nofficers  to serve as escorts and guards while the  prisoners\r\n\r\nare transported to, or from, any prison.  It also defines the\r\n\r\npowers  given  to  such auxiliary police  officers.   Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment  will take measures to ensure that  the  auxiliary\r\n\r\npolice officers meet strict security standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the outsourcing, Prisons will continue to be\r\n\r\naccountable for the safe custody of inmates both  within  and\r\n\r\noutside prisons and drug institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment of Committees of Inquiry</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Act will also be amended to allow the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs to appoint Committees of Inquiry to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into the death of any prisoner or look  into  any\r\n\r\nother  matters pertaining to the administration  of  prisons.\r\n\r\nClause  4  of  the  Bill introduces a  new  section  7  which\r\n\r\nempowers  the  Minister  to appoint such  Committees.   Among\r\n\r\nother things, these committees will be empowered to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsummon witnesses and to refer witnesses who lie or misconduct\r\n\r\nthemselves to the magistrates' court for prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Use of Weapons Against Persons Facilitating an Escape</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the current Prisons Act empowers our Prison\r\n\r\nauthorities to use weapons against prisoners who are escaping\r\n\r\nor  attempting to escape, it does not cover situations  where\r\n\r\nother persons are involved in facilitating an escape.  Clause\r\n\r\n6  of  the  Bill  amends the Prisons Act  to  empower  Prison\r\n\r\nofficers  to use weapons against any prisoner or  person  who\r\n\r\nattempts  or facilitates an attempt to escape or attempts  to\r\n\r\ndamage  or break open the enclosure of a prison or  a  prison\r\n\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removing  Prisons Visit Privileges of Members of  Cabinet  or Parliament</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the proposal to remove the Prisons\r\n\r\nvisit privileges of Members of Cabinet and Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, besides members of the Cabinet and Members of\r\n\r\nParliament,  the  Prisons Act already empowers  every  Judge,\r\n\r\nMagistrate  or Justice of the Peace, to visit any  prison  to\r\n\r\nexamine  the  conditions  of  the  prison  and  the  inmates.\r\n\r\nVisiting  Justices are Justices of the Peace  who  have  been\r\n\r\nappointed  for  the  specific  purpose  of  checking  on  the\r\n\r\nconditions of a prison and that of the prisoners on a regular\r\n\r\nbasis.   They  forward  their  observations  to  the  Prisons\r\n\r\nAuthorities  and  to the Minister.  As distinguished  private\r\n\r\ncitizens,  they  provide  a valuable  service  in  presenting\r\n\r\nreliable  and balanced feedback on the state of our  prisons.\r\n\r\nThe  Visiting Justices conduct monthly visits to  all  Prison\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to inspect the physical conditions  of  prisons\r\n\r\nand  to  hear feedback from prisoners during such  inspection\r\n\r\nrounds.  The roles of the Visiting Justices are clearly spelt\r\n\r\nout in the Prisons Regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there already exists an adequate check by neutral\r\n\r\nparties on the Prison authorities, the current provision  for\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament and members of the Cabinet is hence not\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysia removed its provisions relating to MP's visits  from\r\n\r\ntheir  new  Prisons Act enacted in 1995.  The United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nand  Hong  Kong  Prisons laws do not have such  a  provision.\r\n\r\nHence, my Ministry is proposing that the provision be deleted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Prisons Act.  Clause 22 of the Bill  seeks  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that prisoners are not left\r\n\r\nwithout any avenues to express any grievances they may  have.\r\n\r\nIn  addition  to  voicing  their  concerns  to  the  Visiting\r\n\r\nJustices, they can also forward any complaints or requests to\r\n\r\nthe Superintendent of their institution or write directly  to\r\n\r\nthe  Director  of Prisons.  They are also free to  let  their\r\n\r\nfamily members know of their grievances during prison visits.\r\n\r\nTheir  family members may then take the matter  up  with  the\r\n\r\nPrison authorities, who will investigate into every complaint\r\n\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill also proposes various amendments\r\n\r\nthat  are essential to facilitate the management of the penal\r\n\r\npopulation  and  to allow the Prisons Department  to  operate\r\n\r\nmore  effectively.   For example, clause 18(c)  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nregularises  the existing practice that, before the  offender\r\n\r\nis  punished  for any major breach of prison discipline,  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Prisons  is required to  confirm  or  vary  the\r\n\r\npunishments imposed by the Superintendents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also taking this opportunity to update\r\n\r\nthe  provisions which have become obsolete and outdated since\r\n\r\nits last major review in 1985.  For example, clause 14 of the\r\n\r\nBill  seeks to delete the provisions pertaining to the  terms\r\n\r\nof  engagement and discipline of prison officers  which  have\r\n\r\nbecome  irrelevant  as all terms and conditions  are  now  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  those  laid  down  by  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Related Amendments to the Intoxicating Substances Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Drug Rehabilitation Centres and the Inhalant\r\n\r\nAbuse  Centres are also under the jurisdiction of the  Prison\r\n\r\nauthority,  some  of the amendments made to the  Prisons  Act\r\n\r\nwill also be made to the Intoxicating Substances Act and  the\r\n\r\nMisuse  of Drugs Act.  Clauses 25 and 26 of the Bill seek  to\r\n\r\nmake  amendments to the Intoxicating Substances Act  and  the\r\n\r\nMisuse of Drugs Act to empower prison officers to use weapons\r\n\r\nagainst inmates and other persons facilitating an escape;  to\r\n\r\nappoint  auxiliary  police officers to serve  as  escorts  or\r\n\r\nguards  for inmates; and to convene Committees of Inquiry  to\r\n\r\nlook   into  and  report  on  matters  connected   with   the\r\n\r\nadministration,  functions,  inmates  of  these  centres  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is an important one relating to the running of\r\n\r\nprisons  and  the  treatment of  prisoners.   It  deals  with\r\n\r\nseveral  matters, but I wish to focus on two.  One refers  to\r\n\r\nthe  new Committee of Inquiry to investigate or inquire  into\r\n\r\n\"any matter connected with the discipline, administration  or\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  any prison or affecting any prisoner  .\"   The\r\n\r\nother  seeks  to  provide  a system and  procedure  for  home\r\n\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the establishment of the \"Committee of\r\n\r\nInquiry\" and even though a committee is usually understood as\r\n\r\na  group of persons, it is not unheard of to have a committee\r\n\r\nof one.  My only query here is: would it not be more sensible\r\n\r\nto  have  more than one committee member?  I say this because\r\n\r\nsuch a committee is likely to be appointed only when there is\r\n\r\nsome serious allegation made concerning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  running of a prison, or the treatment of a prisoner.   A\r\n\r\ngroup  of members, even of two, will add to the transparency,\r\n\r\nthe credibility and the general quality of the inquiry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point: who would be\r\n\r\nappointed  to  such  committees?   Or  more  precisely,  what\r\n\r\nqualifications must they have?  The Bill is silent  on  this.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope the Minister can let the House know who are likely\r\n\r\nto be appointed to such committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the proceedings of the inquiry are not open to\r\n\r\nthe  public  unless  the  chairman permits  or  the  Minister\r\n\r\ndirects.  I take this provision to mean that where a chairman\r\n\r\npermits,  such a hearing can be open to the public, but  that\r\n\r\nwhere  a  chairman does not give his permission, the Minister\r\n\r\nmay  direct him to do so.  Can the Minister confirm that this\r\n\r\nis the position?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, it is apparent that this committee of inquiry is\r\n\r\nintended  to  be a quasi-judicial institution,  that  is,  it\r\n\r\ntakes evidence on oath, has power to summon witnesses and the\r\n\r\nduty  to  keep  records  of  the inquiry.   Prison  officers,\r\n\r\nprisoners  and  others may be affected by  such  proceedings.\r\n\r\nMay  they  employ  counsel?  If not, why  not?   I  refer  in\r\n\r\nparticular to the proposed section 7J where a prison  officer\r\n\r\nwho  may  be  adversely  affected  by  the  findings  of  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  has  to  be notified, and given a  hearing  during\r\n\r\nwhich  he can give evidence as well as examine any witnesses.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, counsel may be desirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the record of the committee is confidential and\r\n\r\nnot to be released without the permission of the Minister.  I\r\n\r\nam  uneasy with this, not that I think the Minister will  act\r\n\r\nimproperly.  There may be situations where he may be left  in\r\n\r\na  difficult position.  For example, a committee finds that a\r\n\r\nprison  officer  has  used excessive  force  on  a  prisoner.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  action is taken and he is  dismissed  from  the\r\n\r\nservice.  He seeks redress for unfair dismissal and of course\r\n\r\nthe claim will be made against the Ministry.  In such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  situation, where the status and livelihood of a person  is\r\n\r\nat  stake,  and where he feels that there was, for  instance,\r\n\r\nbias,  should he not be entitled to a copy of the proceedings\r\n\r\nthat  may assist him in his case?  Will the Minister let  him\r\n\r\nhave the report, even though the report came from a committee\r\n\r\nappointed  by him?  I hope that there could be some procedure\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the committees of inquiry and their  records\r\n\r\nare available to interested and affected parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the provisions for Home Detention. Sir, I\r\n\r\nam not one to engage in semantics, but I do feel in this case\r\n\r\nthat  the  use of the phrase, \"Home Detention\" is  not  quite\r\n\r\nappropriate,  given the spirit and intent of the  scheme.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that this scheme was a recommendation of the Inter-Ministry Committee on Community-Based Sentences, and that its\r\n\r\npurpose  is  to  allow  prisoners to re-integrate  back  into\r\n\r\nsociety,  and  to his home environment.  Unless  we  want  to\r\n\r\npreserve  an  idea  that Home is Prison or detention  centre,\r\n\r\nusing  another  term, such as \"supervision\" might  have  been\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate.   From the point of  view  of  the  family\r\n\r\nmembers,  it may also be more palatable than to regard  their\r\n\r\nhome as a place of detention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case \"supervision\" more correctly describes this\r\n\r\nprocess.   The  supervisee is allowed  to  go  out  and  seek\r\n\r\ngainful employment within the period that he is allowed to be\r\n\r\nabsent from home.  The electronic tagging is really more like\r\n\r\na  supervisory or surveillance process - triggered only if he\r\n\r\nabsents  himself  from home during the restricted  hours.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Minister will take the first opportunity  to\r\n\r\nassure   Members  that  the  intention  of  this  scheme   is\r\n\r\nrehabilitative,  and  not  just a measure  to  reduce  prison\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the eligibility of prisoners for the Home\r\n\r\nDetention Scheme, the Bill proposes that he has to have  more\r\n\r\nthan  six  months' imprisonment left, and not be disqualified\r\n\r\nfrom  being considered.  The disqualifications are  contained\r\n\r\nin  the  Second Schedule.  The disqualified category includes\r\n\r\noffences against the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperson, especially sexual offences.  Curiously, however,  the\r\n\r\noffences  of  extortion, robbery and armed  robbery  are  not\r\n\r\nwithin the disqualified category.  These are serious offences\r\n\r\n-  robbery,  for  example, attracts a minimum  of  two  years\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and  a maximum of ten and with  caning.   Gang-robbery,  an aggravated form of robbery, is included  in  the\r\n\r\ndisqualification list.  May I therefore ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nlet this House know why prisoners who are sentenced for armed\r\n\r\nrobbery,  robbery  or  extortion  are  not  disqualified  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  technically  eligible for consideration  for  home\r\n\r\ndetention?   It must be remembered that even in the  case  of\r\n\r\nextortion,  the crime involves instilling fear of  injury  or\r\n\r\neven death to the victims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill proposes the establishment of an\r\n\r\nadvisory  committee to advise the Director on the suitability\r\n\r\nof  the  prisoner  for release under the scheme.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister clarify how such a committee would work?  Who  would\r\n\r\nbe  appointed to this committee?  Will it interview potential\r\n\r\nsupervisees to assess their suitability for release, or  will\r\n\r\nit simply rely on the recommendations of the Director?  Since\r\n\r\nit is called an advisory committee, I assume that there is no\r\n\r\nsubstantive power of review, but can it insist that it  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  interview prisoners applying for the Home Detention\r\n\r\nScheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in general, the Prisons (Amendment) Bill contains\r\n\r\nuseful institutions and measures that, if implemented wisely,\r\n\r\nwould undoubtedly improve our system of criminal justice.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Bill stands, I would certainly support it, but hope that\r\n\r\nthe Minister would address the issues that I have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I am happy that the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs is embarking on this Home Detention Scheme (HDS)  for\r\n\r\nprisoners at the tail end of their prison sentence.  I assume\r\n\r\nthat  MHA  has had considerable success in its implementation\r\n\r\nof  the scheme with drug supervisees who were placed on  drug\r\n\r\nsupervision via this electronic tagging.  If this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  was  successful, then I am happy.  But if there  were\r\n\r\nproblems, perhaps the Minister could share with us what  were\r\n\r\nthe  problems  that they had faced in its implementation  and\r\n\r\nhow  these problems had been overcome.  For example,  I  have\r\n\r\nlearned  that  in the United Kingdom some of these  prisoners\r\n\r\nwere  placed  on  electronic tagging.  When  they  came  into\r\n\r\ncontact  with  some big equipment or objects in their  house,\r\n\r\nthe tagging system failed and many of them had to be returned\r\n\r\nto  prison.   So  I  want to know whether we  have  any  such\r\n\r\nproblems in the past implementation of this scheme here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the present Bill, I have the following\r\n\r\npoints  to  raise,  Sir.  Is this scheme  being  extended  to\r\n\r\nprisoners  as  a  means  to alleviate  over-crowding  in  the\r\n\r\nprisons,  as  was  the case in the United  Kingdom?   If  so,\r\n\r\nwhether steps are being taken to expand the capacity  of  our\r\n\r\nprisons.  I would also like to ask the Minister whether over-crowding in our prisons is because of our enhanced sentencing\r\n\r\nfor  many offences and whether the Minister intends to relook\r\n\r\nat the sentencing regime in place at present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the scheme's intention is that there are\r\n\r\nprisoners  who are suitable and have shown good behaviour  to\r\n\r\ndeserve  to be placed on the HDS, could there be a  mechanism\r\n\r\nwhereby such prisoners are released earlier than having to go\r\n\r\nthrough  this HDS process?  Are we too rigid in  sticking  to\r\n\r\nthe  present  process  whereby we  give  remission  for  good\r\n\r\nbehaviour  which  is usually about one third  of  the  prison\r\n\r\nsentence?  Sir, if the prison authorities and the counsellors\r\n\r\nwho  are  counselling the prisoners are of the  opinion  that\r\n\r\nthis  prisoner is one who deserves to be given a  chance  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  has behaved well and should be released to society,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  need to even amend the Act to provide  that  the\r\n\r\nPrisons Director, or even the Minister, should have the power\r\n\r\nto  release this prisoner back into society so that he can be\r\n\r\nrehabilitated into society even without this HDS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next issue is the question of who bears the\r\n\r\ncost  of  this tagging and monitoring system because this  is\r\n\r\nsomething\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  remains unanswered in the Bill.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether the cost of the HDS Scheme is lesser  or\r\n\r\ngreater in relation to keeping the prisoner in prison at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.   Sir,  I  would also like to ask  the  Minister  the\r\n\r\ncriteria applied to disqualified offenders.  Paragraph (7) of\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule basically is too restrictive.  It tries to  lay\r\n\r\ndown  a  list  of  criteria which basically  covers  sex  and\r\n\r\nviolent  offenders.  But looking at the provisions  that  are\r\n\r\nlaid  there, I think the authorities who drafted the Schedule\r\n\r\nhave  in  a way tied down their hands.  Because for a  start,\r\n\r\nthere  are  some  offences  which  are  not  even  specified,\r\n\r\noffences  under  the Vandalism Act, the Armed  Offences  Act,\r\n\r\nCorrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act.\r\n\r\nThese are offences which are not specifically mentioned.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, there are offences like rioting  which  are\r\n\r\nmentioned.  I would say that the list ties the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  because  offenders commit  offences  in  various\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  For example, an offence of rioting.  If  five\r\n\r\npersons  participate in an offence which  involves  violence,\r\n\r\nthree  of  them could merely be standing there but  they  may\r\n\r\nhave the intention, but they did not actually participate  in\r\n\r\nthe violent offence, beating up somebody or rioting.  But  by\r\n\r\nputting specifically here that such a person is disqualified,\r\n\r\nindividuals  who  may actually qualify  for  the  scheme  may\r\n\r\ninadvertently be left out and may be disqualified  under  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to see whether the Schedule\r\n\r\nand the criteria for disqualification can be reconsidered and\r\n\r\nworded in a wide manner whereby individuals who may be caught\r\n\r\nunder  crimes, whether it is an attempt, or abetment or  just\r\n\r\nmerely  being present, are also given a chance  to  go  under\r\n\r\nthis HDS scheme and are not automatically disqualified as the\r\n\r\nway the present disqualification has been written.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister as to why\r\n\r\nshort-term prisoners cannot be placed under the scheme.   The\r\n\r\nway   the  Bill  is  drafted  in  the  proposed  section  38B\r\n\r\nspecifically  says  that one cannot  be  qualified  for  home\r\n\r\ndetention for a period\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexceeding  six  months  and also that  those  who  are  given\r\n\r\nsentence  must  have a minimum imprisonment sentence  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths  of  which  he may not have served three  months.   So\r\n\r\nbasically,  those who are going to qualify for  this  offence\r\n\r\nmust have been given a prison sentence of six months or more.\r\n\r\nMy  question is: could this scheme be also extended to  those\r\n\r\nwho are given even shorter prison sentences?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sweden, for example, Sir, short-term prisoners are\r\n\r\ngiven  home  detention as an alternative to prison  sentence,\r\n\r\nthat  means, they do not even go to the prison in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.   Such an alternative sentencing minimises  the  risks\r\n\r\nfor  social dislocation by allowing the offender to  maintain\r\n\r\nhis employment and family contacts.  It also reduces the rate\r\n\r\nof  new  criminal behaviour being learned during  periods  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment.   It is something which will be  very  suitable\r\n\r\nfor  young  offenders who are studying or offenders  who  may\r\n\r\nneed  regular  medical  treatment.  The  way  the  sentencing\r\n\r\nscheme  exists  at the moment, for example,  for  a  youthful\r\n\r\noffender  is he either gets probation or he goes  to  prison.\r\n\r\nThere  may  be  cases where some youthful offenders  fall  in\r\n\r\nbetween, and I think HDS may be more appropriate for them  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  are not exposed to prison environment where  they\r\n\r\npick up bad habits and may become more difficult to turn over\r\n\r\na new leaf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fifthly, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry would be taking responsibility and would\r\n\r\nalso be exposing itself to be liable for any crimes that  may\r\n\r\nbe  committed by such prisoners who are released  under  this\r\n\r\nHome Detention Scheme.  For example, if a person who is under\r\n\r\nthe  HDS commits an offence where he causes economic loss  or\r\n\r\ninjures  somebody in commiting another crime, then naturally,\r\n\r\nunder the law, perhaps the Ministry may be exposed.  I do not\r\n\r\nsee  a  clause in the Bill itself which exempts the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwhich is trying out this scheme from being liable under  this\r\n\r\nscheme.  Perhaps, we have to look at this carefully because I\r\n\r\nam  quite sure that there will be some offenders who may  end\r\n\r\nup committing offence and the person\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  is  hurt  or  who suffers economic loss may  be  looking\r\n\r\ntowards the Ministry for compensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy because I was concerned whether the person\r\n\r\nwho  is  placed on this HDS scheme will be forced to  go  for\r\n\r\ncounselling.  I was happy that the Minister in his speech had\r\n\r\nmentioned that there will be mandatory counselling  for  such\r\n\r\npeople who are placed on this HDS Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know whether, among the\r\n\r\nconditions  to  be  imposed, there will be a  condition  that\r\n\r\nthese  offenders  are  to  completely  refrain  from  alcohol\r\n\r\nconsumption during their period of home detention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the consent of all\r\n\r\nadults living in the same residence as the detainee would  be\r\n\r\nobtained prior to placing him under the HDS.  Similarly, I am\r\n\r\nalso  wondering  whether the Minister would insist  that  all\r\n\r\nindividuals  who  are placed on this HDS  must  be  gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed  or  must  be  undergoing  some  sort  of  a   study\r\n\r\nprogramme. Otherwise, whether they would be released on  this\r\n\r\nHDS scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would also ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nwould  consider  extending the scheme  to  various  types  of\r\n\r\ncategories  of prisoners and various types of schemes.   This\r\n\r\nis very interesting because there are cases where during pre-trial certain individuals who are unable to put up bail,  are\r\n\r\nnow  at the moment placed in the remand prison.  This is  one\r\n\r\noption  which  could be experimented by the Ministry  whereby\r\n\r\nindividuals  who are unable to raise money could  perhaps  be\r\n\r\nplaced under this electronic tagging so they are not sent  to\r\n\r\nprison and be contaminated by other prisoners while they  are\r\n\r\ndetained there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, whether this HDS scheme could also be\r\n\r\nconsidered  for  pregnant offenders,  handicapped  offenders,\r\n\r\nprimary family care providers and juvenile offenders.  Sir, I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister would see how the scheme could be made\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflexible   enough   to   ensure  that  we   provide   various\r\n\r\nalternatives   in  rehabilitating  our  crime  offenders   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Deputy Speaker for the opportunity to speak.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to raise one main concern on the Bill under the section\r\n\r\non home detention order in Part IVA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard Prof. Chin just a while ago and I agree that\r\n\r\nmaybe  \"home  detention\" may not be  a  good  term.   If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  ever seeks to change the term, let me  add  to  the\r\n\r\nconfusion  by  suggesting  two other  terms.   One  is  \"home\r\n\r\nsupported  rehabilitation order\".  The other  is  \"community-based rehabilitation order\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in full support of the Community-Based\r\n\r\nSentences  but  overcrowding, as MP, Ravindran suggested,  is\r\n\r\ncertainly not the issue and should not be the concern and the\r\n\r\ncause  for  why we are doing home detention.  Literature  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  offenders  recover well  and  best  in  familiar\r\n\r\nsurroundings  and among loved ones.  But I do agree  with  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran  that  there  should  be  different  sentences  and\r\n\r\ndifferent  durations of home detention for various categories\r\n\r\nof   offenders.   He  mentioned,  for  example,   handicapped\r\n\r\noffenders,  pregnant offenders, etc, and some flexibility  to\r\n\r\nbe  given  for different forms of sentences.  I  am  all  for\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a Director may, by order, release a prisoner who\r\n\r\nis eligible for home detention for a period not exceeding six\r\n\r\nmonths,  I  would  like  the  Minister  to  clarify  if   the\r\n\r\nauthorities will do the following four things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to carry out an intensive in-depth interview and\r\n\r\nassessment  by  experts before the release to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of readiness of the prisoner in facing the real  world\r\n\r\nagain.  I heard from the Minister just now that this will  be\r\n\r\nprovided and an assessment will be carried out objectively by\r\n\r\nexternal  consultants and internal experts  including  senior\r\n\r\nofficers.  But this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis only meaningful if the baseline has first been established\r\n\r\non  the  cognitive and emotive orientations of  the  prisoner\r\n\r\nwhen he first arrived so that the final assessment before the\r\n\r\nrelease   could   measure   the   changes   in   him   during\r\n\r\nincarceration.  I hope, therefore, findings upon  arrival  in\r\n\r\nprison and before he leaves prison will be gathered and  that\r\n\r\nthese  findings  be  weighed against the order  made  by  the\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second condition is to prepare family members on the\r\n\r\nobjectives and significance of the home detention  order  and\r\n\r\nwhat they must all do responsibly if the prisoner shows signs\r\n\r\nof  recidivist behaviour. A study on the after-conduct  of  a\r\n\r\ncohort  of probationers conducted by MCD in 1999 showed  that\r\n\r\nthe recidivism rate for the probationers from intact families\r\n\r\nis  lower than those from non-intact families. That means, in\r\n\r\nfamilies  where  the  parents are still  married  and  living\r\n\r\ntogether,  the  chance of re-offence by the  probationers  is\r\n\r\nreduced compared to those from non-intact families or  broken\r\n\r\nfamilies.  As the family is significant in the rehabilitation\r\n\r\nof the offender, an assessment of the readiness of the family\r\n\r\nin  receiving  the  prisoner home should be  carried  out  by\r\n\r\nspecialists  on  family therapy.  Their  findings  should  be\r\n\r\nweighed against the order made by the Director.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is to mandate continuing counselling sessions for\r\n\r\nthe  prisoner under home detention.  Rehabilitation is a long\r\n\r\nprocess and the chance of recidivism is less if the offenders\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  receive  consistent and  scheduled  counselling\r\n\r\nsessions.  I hope the Minister would consider mandating this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, if the objective of Community-Based Sentences is\r\n\r\nto  allow  the community to collaborate in the rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprocess  of offenders, I hope that the Minister, in the  next\r\n\r\nBudget debate, will also commit to more resources being given\r\n\r\nto the community for carrying out this work effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to raise one query on the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Committee of Inquiry in Part IIA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister clarify the meaning in new section 7B\r\n\r\nthat  every member of a Committee of Inquiry appointed  shall\r\n\r\nbe  deemed to be a public servant within the meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code?    Please  elaborate  and  help  us  understand.\r\n\r\nSecond,  in  the event that an institution is being  inquired\r\n\r\ninto  or  the family of an aggrieved prisoner should petition\r\n\r\nfor their own representation to the Committee of Inquiry,  is\r\n\r\nthere a provision to ensure a balanced hearing of views?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these points which I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nclarify, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in support\r\n\r\nof this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous and violent criminals deserve to be\r\n\r\nincarcerated for long periods of time.  But for less  serious\r\n\r\noffenders, I see the merit in applying correctional treatment\r\n\r\nto  re-integrate them into the community.  I see  the  social\r\n\r\nvalue  in  having  a home detention scheme  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nnegative socialisation that occurs in prison.  It is assuring\r\n\r\nto  know  offenders  placed  on  Electronic  Monitoring  (EM)\r\n\r\nschemes  in other countries register lower recidivism  rates.\r\n\r\nBut the success rate varies, and the EM may be more effective\r\n\r\nwith  some groups of offenders and at certain stages  of  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  process.   A group  of  American  researchers\r\n\r\nfound  that  EM works better with offenders who  have  had  a\r\n\r\ntaste  of  prison detention.  Apparently, juveniles  seem  to\r\n\r\nrespond  better to EM than adults.  EM also seems to be  more\r\n\r\neffective  among  targeted groups of  non-violent  offenders,\r\n\r\nsuch as drunk drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of such findings, there is merit in\r\n\r\ninsisting that home detainees should be non-violent offenders\r\n\r\nand  have  spent at least six months in prison.   Justice  is\r\n\r\nupheld  as  they  have  at least been minimally  punished  in\r\n\r\nprison.  Thereafter, they should not be mixed too  often  and\r\n\r\ntoo  long with hardcore criminals.  If it is bad company that\r\n\r\nled  some  misguided  offenders into  prison,  why  test  the\r\n\r\npenitent's  resolve by confining him further with proven  bad\r\n\r\ncompany? Why suffer him to be corrupted even further while in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprison?   It  is  in  the public interest to  give  deserving\r\n\r\ncontrite  hearts a second chance.  We should grant  them  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to redeem themselves so long as they do not  pose\r\n\r\na  risk to the public.  It is a fact I wholeheartedly applaud\r\n\r\nthe  spirit of the Bill.  Nonetheless, I would like to  raise\r\n\r\nseveral points for the Minister's clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, can the Minister clarify the types of inmates\r\n\r\nwho  can qualify and benefit most from the scheme?  It is  in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest that the selection guidelines rule  that\r\n\r\nviolent and dangerous criminals, murderers, rapists and other\r\n\r\ninmates  convicted of serious crimes should be  automatically\r\n\r\ndisqualified from the scheme.  They deserve the  full  prison\r\n\r\nsentence.   There should be no exception to this.   But  what\r\n\r\nare  the  other  criteria  -   family  support,  good  prison\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  age?  Will these criteria be transparent  to  the\r\n\r\ninmates?  Are there studies to indicate that certain targeted\r\n\r\ngroups of offenders will benefit most from the scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the home detention scheme can help\r\n\r\nto  steer  misguided offenders back to the right  path.   But\r\n\r\nwhat numbers are we referring to here?  This leads me to  the\r\n\r\nsecond  point of clarification.  Can the Minister provide  us\r\n\r\nwith   an  estimate  on  the  percentage  of  prisoners   who\r\n\r\npotentially qualify for the home detention scheme?  How  many\r\n\r\ndetainees,  fitted  with  the EM device,  can  the  community\r\n\r\nexpect  at  any  one  time?   Does  this  number  affect  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's plan on the number of prisons to be built in the\r\n\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what will the detainees do at home? The scheme\r\n\r\nprovides the offenders with a measure of freedom.  My concern\r\n\r\nis  that  when they are taken off the discipline  of  regular\r\n\r\nphysical exercise, prison chores and solitude, what are  they\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  with  their  free time  at  home?   We  cannot\r\n\r\nlegislate to deny a home detainee the pleasures of  his  home\r\n\r\nfor  what  is  there  to  prevent an affluent  detainee  from\r\n\r\nenjoying  movie after movie on an ultra modern high-tech  big\r\n\r\nscreen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhome  entertainment system together with his family, or hours\r\n\r\nand  hours  of Internet surfing, or a nice sun  tan  after  a\r\n\r\nleisure swim in his private pool, or a home party on Saturday\r\n\r\nnight with his and his family friends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not exaggerating. Some years back, a son of a\r\n\r\nformer  Amercian  Vice-President candidate was  sentenced  to\r\n\r\nfour  months of house arrest for selling cocaine.   The  home\r\n\r\ndetention  was  as  good as an extended resort  holiday.   He\r\n\r\nlived in a luxury apartment, with maid service, cable TV  and\r\n\r\nmany  other expensive amenities.  This led his prosecutor  to\r\n\r\nobserve  that  the drug felon was living in  conditions  that\r\n\r\n99.9%  of the people in the area could not afford.  Too  much\r\n\r\nfree time can be bad for the less affluent detainees too.   A\r\n\r\nhome  detainee cannot roam the streets.  But in the  confines\r\n\r\nof  his  small HDB flat, he is exposed to the temptations  of\r\n\r\nthe streets through his friends, family media.  Some of these\r\n\r\ninfluences  and friends may not be good for  him.   They  may\r\n\r\nnumb  him  to  forget that he is still serving his  sentence,\r\n\r\nalbeit  at home.  While there are devices to ensure  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  leave his home, we cannot legislate  against  such\r\n\r\ninfluences from entering his home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new freedom can be a dangerous thing. When we\r\n\r\nfeed  idle minds with bad influences, they will breed crooked\r\n\r\nschemes.   Restricted  freedom strengthens  the  resolve  for\r\n\r\nsome, but for others, it propagates jealously, resentment and\r\n\r\nbitterness.  To put it simply, home detainees should  not  be\r\n\r\nleft to their own schemes.  Thus, detaining offenders at home\r\n\r\nis  only part of the rehabilitated solution.  The other  part\r\n\r\ninvolves  providing  structured programmes  to  occupy  their\r\n\r\ndaily  routine.   Meaningful activities should  be  included,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  skill  upgrading  to help  the  detainees  to  find\r\n\r\nsuitable  jobs  later on.  Perhaps, the activities  also  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  community so that there  will  be  a  pay  back\r\n\r\nredemptive effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point of clarification to the Minister then is\r\n\r\nhow  much  free time do home detainees have.   What  kind  of\r\n\r\nrehabilitative programmes would there be?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  leads  to  my fourth point regarding community  service\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Community service programmes can supplement  the\r\n\r\nhome  detention scheme and acts as an additional intermediate\r\n\r\nsanction.  Any  minor  offender, not  necessarily  just  home\r\n\r\ndetainees,  can be put on community service programmes.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  minor offenders can be made to help out  in  places\r\n\r\nlike  nursing homes or centres for the disabled. They can  be\r\n\r\nassigned  simple  tasks that require some degree  of  contact\r\n\r\nwith the elderly or disabled.  Minor offenders may find it to\r\n\r\nbe  extremely therapeutic when they are exposed to the pride,\r\n\r\nstrength and character of the elderly and disabled.   It  may\r\n\r\neven  help to change their value system for the better.   But\r\n\r\nsuch a programme must be managed properly and discreetly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, as part of their sentence, certain\r\n\r\noffenders have to conduct talks in schools or advise troubled\r\n\r\nteens.   Some  convicted sports personalities conduct  sports\r\n\r\nclinics  followed  by  counselling  sessions  for  juveniles.\r\n\r\nAlong  this  line, is it not better for a convicted  computer\r\n\r\nhacker  to  help non-profit organisations to create websites,\r\n\r\ndesign  software programmes, conduct basic IT training rather\r\n\r\nthan  for him to rot in prison for the entire period  of  his\r\n\r\nsentence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is a corrective work order for litterbugs,\r\n\r\nwhy cannot there be a corrective social work order for social\r\n\r\nbugs?   Not  all  social  bugs are  social  menaces.   Social\r\n\r\nmenaces  should  be  put away from arm's  reach.  Some  minor\r\n\r\nsocial  bugs can perhaps be disinfected of their  ills  by  a\r\n\r\ndosage of corrective social work order.  In this light, may I\r\n\r\nask   the   Minister  whether  he  will  consider  broadening\r\n\r\ncorrectional  sanctions further to allow minor  offenders  to\r\n\r\nperform community services?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, should the home detention scheme always take\r\n\r\nplace  at home?  The home environment is not necessarily  the\r\n\r\nbest  rehabilitation centre.  Some offenders  are  in  prison\r\n\r\nprecisely because of the lack of guidance at home.  The  lack\r\n\r\nof  parental  support has driven some   to  bad  company  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently to prison.  If the root of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  problem  is at home, why send them back to their  homes?\r\n\r\nIn  such cases, putting them back to their homes is likely to\r\n\r\nbe counter productive.  But does this mean that the offenders\r\n\r\nmust  have a supportive home environment in order to  qualify\r\n\r\nfor  the scheme?  I hope not.  If penitent offenders  do  not\r\n\r\nhave a favourable home environment to return to, perhaps they\r\n\r\ncan be detained in some established half-way houses instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that some of these half-way houses are\r\n\r\nfounded by ex-convicts.  They know what it takes to turn over\r\n\r\na new leaf and want to help others to do so.  The environment\r\n\r\nin  these half-way houses can be more rehabilitative than the\r\n\r\nhome  environment.   The  sharing  of  positive  experiences,\r\n\r\nbonding  and encouragement can do these detainees a world  of\r\n\r\ngood.   But there must be a review of the programmes, funding\r\n\r\nlevel  and management practices of half-way houses.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause the performance standards, services and facilities of\r\n\r\nhalf-way  houses may vary too significantly.  A  benchmarking\r\n\r\nof  the  standards  of half-way houses is important  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.   Some degree of recognition and support for half-way\r\n\r\nhouses   is   also  in  order.    For  my  fifth   point   of\r\n\r\nclarification, may I ask the Minister whether an extension of\r\n\r\nthe  home  detention scheme to relevant half-way  houses  has\r\n\r\nbeen considered?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the family home detainees who are\r\n\r\ngenerally  supportive.  The family is  one  of  the  critical\r\n\r\nsuccess factors for the scheme.  It may not be so in the West\r\n\r\nbecause,  given  their cultural practices, it is  conceivable\r\n\r\nthat  many  home  detainees there  do  not  live  with  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   But  this is generally not the case  here.   Home\r\n\r\ndetention  here  can literally mean being detained  with  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   A family may seem to be supportive, but we have  to\r\n\r\nrecognise that it is one thing to express support and another\r\n\r\nto  be able to deal with the difficulties and shame of living\r\n\r\nwith  a  detainee.   The family has to learn  to  adjust  and\r\n\r\naccept the concomitant stigma, but not all family members can\r\n\r\nmanage that successfully.  The mother may accept but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  father may resent.  The sister may bear with it but  the\r\n\r\nbrother  may find it embarrassing and disgraceful to stay  at\r\n\r\nhome  with  the detainee.  And when a family dispute  erupts,\r\n\r\nthe detainee cannot run off to cool himself down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all neighbours can accept living near a detainee\r\n\r\neither.   It is possible for the family to conjure up excuses\r\n\r\nto  explain  to their neighbours and relatives regarding  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of the prisoner from home.  But having the  detainee\r\n\r\nlocked  up  at  home  is altogether a very  different  thing.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  the  spot checks on home detainees  will  not  be\r\n\r\nconducted  by uniformed law enforcers.  Otherwise, the  whole\r\n\r\nneighbourhood will soon know about it.  When tongues are  set\r\n\r\nwagging,  some home detainees and their family  members  will\r\n\r\nfail  to deal with the stigma.  When this happens, the scheme\r\n\r\nwill  backfire  and become dysfunctional.  Instead  of  being\r\n\r\nreintegrated, the scheme may end up disintegrating the  whole\r\n\r\nfamily.   In this regard, may I ask the Minister whether  any\r\n\r\nsteps  will be taken to minimise the stigma of home detention\r\n\r\nand  to  help home detainees and their family members  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for the social and psychological stigma  associated\r\n\r\nwith the scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I support the Bill\r\n\r\nand  would like to raise a matter of concern that has  arisen\r\n\r\nover  the  years  in  my dialogues with residents,  and  this\r\n\r\nrelates to employment opportunities for ex-prisoners and  ex-inmates of rehabilitation centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is well-known to be tough on crimes and\r\n\r\nother forms of deviant behaviour.  This is an admirable stand\r\n\r\nand has served us well in making Singapore a country safe for\r\n\r\nvisitors and residents.  However, there is a segment  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  albeit  a small one, who had  previously  served\r\n\r\nsome time in prison or in various rehabilitation centres  for\r\n\r\nerrors  made in their youth who require help.  And  there  is\r\n\r\nalso quite a high incidence of repeat offenders who have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  granted the opportunities of reintegration into society\r\n\r\nat large.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschemes in prison and rehabilitation centres and now homes to\r\n\r\nequip  some  of these individuals with skills and  values  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  adjust  back to society.  However,  it  is  often\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  such  individuals to find gainful  employment\r\n\r\nonce  they are tarnished with a criminal record.  We run  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of developing by default an underclass who is not given\r\n\r\na second chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Singapore society is not a very forgiving one.\r\n\r\nWe are very tough on failure, whether it is financial failure\r\n\r\nin  the  form of bankruptcy or social failure in the form  of\r\n\r\npoor judgment and influence resulting in criminal activities.\r\n\r\nEx-prisoners  and  ex-inmates of rehabilitation  centres  are\r\n\r\noften  labelled and are not given opportunities  that  normal\r\n\r\nindividuals  have despite having served out their punishment.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that often they fall back into bad company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that we, as Singaporean employers and\r\n\r\nGovernment, are not doing enough to give these individuals  a\r\n\r\nchance to assimilate back into society and become responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  have  the ability to fully contribute  to  our\r\n\r\nnation's progress.  If we are indeed attempting to be a  more\r\n\r\ncompassionate  and  gracious society  which  is  tolerant  of\r\n\r\nfailure,  then  we  have to give such  individuals  a  second\r\n\r\nchance  in  life.   And this is in keeping with some  of  the\r\n\r\nobjectives of Singapore 21, as we will provide a real  avenue\r\n\r\nfor all Singaporeans to be the best that they can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government may have to go beyond providing\r\n\r\neducation  and skill training to help rehabilitate  prisoners\r\n\r\nor inmates.  I am not advocating something as radical as what\r\n\r\nis  practised in some European countries where it is  illegal\r\n\r\nfor  employers to ask if prospective job applicants have  had\r\n\r\nprevious criminal records.  However, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  could  consider  using  some  of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies as vehicles to enable the integration  of\r\n\r\nthese  people  into  society,  by  providing  an  avenue  for\r\n\r\nemployment  for  a  period of, say, 1-2  years,  after  their\r\n\r\nrelease  from prison or rehabilitation centres so that  these\r\n\r\nex-prisoners have a chance to start life\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafresh.   Also, I would like to urge the Minister to ask  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies,  in particular,  the  airport  and  the\r\n\r\nseaport  police authorities, to review their policy to  allow\r\n\r\nex-prisoners and ex-inmates of rehabilitation centres to work\r\n\r\nin their premises, with the thrust of Singapore 21 in mind as\r\n\r\nwe  move towards becoming a more gracious, compassionate  and\r\n\r\nforgiving society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a positive move to introduce home detention.\r\n\r\nWhilst  it  is  new  to Singapore, it is  not  new  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  It is a tested system and it can work well in the\r\n\r\nSingapore environment.  I hope that with the introduction  of\r\n\r\nhome  detention, more studies can be made to extend the scope\r\n\r\nwhereby  home detention could be considered as an alternative\r\n\r\nsentencing.   Detention  in prisons  or  any  institution  of\r\n\r\ndetention  should be prescribed only where the offence  calls\r\n\r\nfor  it.   Where an offender can be sufficiently punished  by\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  freedom, perhaps home  detention  should  be\r\n\r\nprescribed.  More studies should follow because I am not sure\r\n\r\nthat  there  can  be any easy answer as to whether  the  home\r\n\r\nenvironment is better for rehabilitation, or that the  prison\r\n\r\nenvironment  is  preferred  where  the  home  environment  is\r\n\r\nconsidered hostile.  I  think the permutation would vary  and\r\n\r\nit requires studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home detention is a new method. It is new to Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  we  should rush into  making  conclusions.\r\n\r\nEarlier  speakers  have suggested the possibility  that  home\r\n\r\ndetention  could  be used for people who are suffering  from,\r\n\r\nsay,  some disability or even a state of pregnancy.  I  would\r\n\r\nhave  thought  that the mode of punishment  should  suit  the\r\n\r\noffence rather than the individual's condition itself.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot sure that it is so clear cut that one could just come out\r\n\r\nwith a guideline in a moment without more detailed studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Prisons Act and amendments to the\r\n\r\nIntoxicating  Substances  Act and the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act\r\n\r\npermit the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuse  of  any weapon including firearms.  I am concerned  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be adequate safeguards to ensure that  weapons,\r\n\r\nespecially firearms, are used only when absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nA  committee of inquiry should consider every occurrence of a\r\n\r\ndischarge of firearms or where a prisoner is injured  by  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  a  weapon.  I am not sure whether the  committee  of\r\n\r\ninquiry  under  new  section 7A(2) of  the  Prisons  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintended  to cover such occurrences, because it states,  \"any\r\n\r\nmatter connected with discipline, administration or functions\r\n\r\nof  any  prison  or affecting any prisoner .\".   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister could clarify on this.  And if it is not intended to\r\n\r\ncover  such  occurrences, whether there will be  someone  who\r\n\r\nwill look into such occurrences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking\r\n\r\nin  support of the Bill, and I shall try to answer as many of\r\n\r\nthe questions as possible and as detailed as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Prof. Chin Tet Yung's question about whether it\r\n\r\nwould  be  better  to  have  more  than  one  member  in  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.   Certainly, it is, and it is not my intention  to\r\n\r\nhave only a one-member committee. Otherwise, it does not make\r\n\r\nmuch  sense,  except that the law, as it is drafted,  is  not\r\n\r\ninconsistent with the provisions in other laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would be appointed to such committees for the\r\n\r\ncommittee of inquiry?  As I have said in my speech, prominent\r\n\r\ncitizens,  non-prison officers, senior officers in Ministries\r\n\r\nand  the  Government, and people who can help us  to  inquire\r\n\r\ninto  a  particular matter.  All expertise  would  be  sought\r\n\r\nwhere  necessary.  This is not the first time  that  we  have\r\n\r\ncommittees of inquiry for matters that happen in the  prison.\r\n\r\nWe  have  appointed  a  few  of  them  and,  invariably,  the\r\n\r\ncommittees  have members who are not from the civil  service,\r\n\r\nlike  Justice of the Peace, for example, or someone  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen involved as a Visiting Justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the proceedings are not open to the public, and if\r\n\r\nthe chairman decides not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  open  it  to  the  public,  would  the  Minister  decide?\r\n\r\nCertainly, I will so decide if there is a public interest  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  If there is not, then I think we should leave it  to\r\n\r\nthe  committee to do its work.  Otherwise, the committee will\r\n\r\nfeel  encumbered  and its job is to get to the  root  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  It is not a prosecutorial agency, neither is it  an\r\n\r\nagency  to  decide what sort of charges to make  out  against\r\n\r\npeople  who  commit any particular offence.  That  should  be\r\n\r\nleft to the proper prosecutorial authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a person who may be implicated adversely arising\r\n\r\nfrom  a committee of inquiry may employ counsel?  Yes, to  be\r\n\r\nfair  to  him.  If the person is likely to be implicated,  he\r\n\r\nmay  engage  counsel  to represent him.  Eventually,  if  the\r\n\r\ncommittee's report adversely affects him and his career,  eg,\r\n\r\nit  involves a prison officer, as Prof. Chin says,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  will look at the grounds for a request  for  the\r\n\r\ncommittee's report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three suggestions on the term of \"home\r\n\r\ndetention\",  eg,  why  do  we not  try  something  else  like\r\n\r\ncommunity-based detention and home supervision and so on.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there are various alternatives that we can consider,\r\n\r\nbut the term \"home detention\" is not an original term that we\r\n\r\nhave coined.  Rather, it is a term used by other countries as\r\n\r\nwell  including the United Kingdom.  So I see  no  particular\r\n\r\nreason  why we should favour one term over another when  that\r\n\r\nparticular  term is easily  understood by the  rehabilitative\r\n\r\nor prison authorities in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ravindran and Prof. Chin asked whether this home\r\n\r\ndetention scheme is more rehabilitative or perhaps  merely  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  to  reduce over-crowding in prisons.   We  know,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  that  there  is an over-crowding  situation  in  the\r\n\r\nprisons,  but that is because many of our prisons' capacities\r\n\r\nare  designed based on the old norms and we do not have  many\r\n\r\nnew  prisons  lately.   So  there is  some  aspect  of  over-crowding, but that is not the reason why we are providing for\r\n\r\nhome  detention.  The reason, as I have said earlier, is that\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narose from a study that I have asked my Minister of State  to\r\n\r\nmake  together with other interested parties on what are  the\r\n\r\nother  alternative  sentencing options  that  could  be  made\r\n\r\navailable in our criminal justice system.  We found that this\r\n\r\ntail-end  home detention is one of them.  Mr Ee and Mr  Noris\r\n\r\nOng  also  asked whether we should not consider  that  as  an\r\n\r\nalternative  instead  of having the person  served  a  prison\r\n\r\nsentence  and then put him on home detention.  The  Committee\r\n\r\nthat my Minister of State chaired did indeed consider such an\r\n\r\noption,  but I think we should take things one at a time  and\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  rush into implementing every  recommendation\r\n\r\nthat has been put up by the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked why some offences which we\r\n\r\nconsider to be serious such as armed robbery or extortion are\r\n\r\nnot  included in the disqualification list.  We can  have  an\r\n\r\nexhaustive  list  which can run into many  pages  or  we  can\r\n\r\nconsider  some  of  those offences which we  think  are  very\r\n\r\nserious  and  which we should exclude them.  For the  others,\r\n\r\nthey  could  be included provided they satisfy  the  criteria\r\n\r\nthat  I  have made out.  The criteria being that the  inmates\r\n\r\nare  amenable  to re-integration and rehabilitation  and  the\r\n\r\nfamily  members  are  prepared to support  them  in  the  re-integration effort, and the good behaviour of the person  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   So it is not an exhaustive list and we will  review\r\n\r\nthe  list  from  time  to time and, if necessary,  update  or\r\n\r\ninclude or exclude other offences which are currently not  in\r\n\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked about the Advisory Committee for\r\n\r\nHome  Detention, how such a Committee will work and who  will\r\n\r\nappoint  the  Committee  and whether the  Committee  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Minister and whether it will have  its  own\r\n\r\ninternal procedures. Of course, the internal working will  be\r\n\r\nsuch  that  the  internal Prisons Committee will  review  all\r\n\r\neligible  inmates  for  home  detention  and  those  who  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  suitable or even not suitable, but  if  they  are\r\n\r\neligible,  they will be put up periodically to  the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  who  will then make its recommendations.   In  the\r\n\r\nprocess of making its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecommendations, the Committee can call up  the  inmates  and\r\n\r\nask  questions and review their records.  That power is given\r\n\r\nto  the Advisory Committee.  In the end, a decision has to be\r\n\r\nmade and that will be made by the Director of Prisons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked specifically whether the overcrowding\r\n\r\nin  our  prison  is  the  result  of  the  strict  sentencing\r\n\r\nguidelines that have been imposed for offences.  There are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of reasons which I have explained earlier.  We always\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  sentencing  regime to  see  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nadequate or not.  Of course, if they are not, we will  review\r\n\r\nthem.   On whether we could release prisoners in the  process\r\n\r\nearlier instead of just having the standard remission period,\r\n\r\nI think the remission of one-third of the prisoner's sentence\r\n\r\nis  already quite generous.  Now we are providing the balance\r\n\r\nof  up to six months for the person to serve his sentence  at\r\n\r\nhome  and I think for a start we should just go for that  and\r\n\r\nnot do anything more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoners need not pay for the cost of the\r\n\r\nelectronic  tagging and the cost of monitoring  because  this\r\n\r\nwill be borne by the prison authorities.  Home detention with\r\n\r\nelectronic  tagging is not a new thing that  the  prison  has\r\n\r\nimplemented.   As  I have said, it has been  implemented  for\r\n\r\ncriminal law detainees, reformative trainees as well as those\r\n\r\ndetained   under  the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act.   So   Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment already has enough experience in dealing with such\r\n\r\npeople,  including  the process of examining,  assessing  and\r\n\r\ninvestigating whether a person is suitable for home detention\r\n\r\nor  not.   That  process will be quite exhaustive,  including\r\n\r\ntalking  to professionals and counsellors if necessary,  and,\r\n\r\nin  particular,  for home detention, family support  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.   Without family support, there is no  purpose  in\r\n\r\nreleasing  that inmate back to society because  we  need  the\r\n\r\nfamily  to  also play its role in rehabilitating the  inmate.\r\n\r\nGetting  the half-way house to do the job is not good  enough\r\n\r\nbecause  we  should not just pass the responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\nhalf-way  house.  But we can get the half-way house to  help.\r\n\r\nFor example, in counselling, we can get SANA, VWOs, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  Aftercare Association to help in the  counselling.\r\n\r\nCounselling  would indeed be one of the conditions  that  the\r\n\r\nprison would impose on anybody who is on home detention.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, by not incarcerating the prisoner, it will be cheaper\r\n\r\nin  the  process  to put a person under home  detention.   So\r\n\r\nindeed the answer is yes, it is cheaper to put a person under\r\n\r\nhome detention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran also asked whether the Ministry or the\r\n\r\nprison  authorities or the Government will be liable for  any\r\n\r\noffence committed by an inmate who is on home detention.  The\r\n\r\nprison  authorities will be liable if it is shown that  there\r\n\r\nis  criminal  negligence on its part.  If there  is  criminal\r\n\r\nnegligence in releasing the person, yes, certainly they could\r\n\r\nbe sued.  But in the end the whole process has to be examined\r\n\r\nand  see  whether prison has indeed been criminally negligent\r\n\r\nin  releasing the prisoner.  The final decision on that  will\r\n\r\nbe,  of  course,  the courts which will take that  case  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  and  decide  whether  there  is  any  criminal\r\n\r\nnegligence based on evidence and facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One condition which Mr Ravindran asked the prison\r\n\r\nauthorities to consider is whether we can prohibit such  home\r\n\r\ndetainees  from  consuming alcohol.  I think we  should  only\r\n\r\nhave  conditions which can be enforced or seemingly  possible\r\n\r\nto  enforce.   It  is very difficult to enforce  a  condition\r\n\r\nwhich requires a person to be a teetotaler at home unless, of\r\n\r\ncourse, if a person is out on a drink driving charge, and  an\r\n\r\noffence is committed, that person will be in deep trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other suggestions Mr Ravindran talked about in\r\n\r\nextending   the   scheme  to  the  different  categories   of\r\n\r\noffenders, indeed those he mentioned would be covered  except\r\n\r\nthose  who  are on pre-trial or pre-sentencing.  Because,  if\r\n\r\nthe case has not been heard yet, how could we put a person on\r\n\r\nhome  detention?  What power do the prison authorities  have?\r\n\r\nIf  he cannot post bail, then he goes on remand.  That is it.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine a person who cannot post\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbail but at the same time commits a serious offence and there\r\n\r\nis  no  way  of  assessing the bahaviour of the  person,  the\r\n\r\nprison authority is called upon to decide whether that person\r\n\r\nshould  be  on home detention.  I think that is an impossible\r\n\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang asked about different home detention\r\n\r\nperiods for different types of prisoners like, for example, a\r\n\r\nperson who is handicapped.   The prison authorities will look\r\n\r\nat all eligible inmates and release them for up to six months\r\n\r\non  home detention if they are suitable.  That is the kind of\r\n\r\nflexibility that we should have.  We should not put too  many\r\n\r\nconditions   and   criteria  into  the  assessment   process,\r\n\r\notherwise it will complicate the whole running of the scheme.\r\n\r\nEven  for intensive interviews, that will be done.  As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  counsellors will be used.  We will talk to  the  right\r\n\r\npeople,  including the family members, to make sure that  the\r\n\r\nperson  is indeed amenable to home detention.  But  the  more\r\n\r\nmoney  we  invest in this, the less we will  have  for  other\r\n\r\npurposes, including rehabilitation in the prison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong asked what is the potential number of\r\n\r\nprisoners who will qualify for home detention.  I do not have\r\n\r\nthe  numbers  but I believe it will be a significant  number.\r\n\r\nOf course, not the majority of them, because many of them are\r\n\r\nin  the medium and high security prisons.  So we will have to\r\n\r\nconsider  all those eligible cases and then take  a  look  at\r\n\r\nthem.  Offhand, I would say that prisons will start off  with\r\n\r\n30  to 40 a month.  It will try this out and see the pace  of\r\n\r\nit.   If  it  can cope with it, and if our Advisory Committee\r\n\r\ncan deal with it, then more can be released.  We have to take\r\n\r\nit one step at a time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who is on home detention is not likely to be\r\n\r\nwasting his time.  If he wants to do that, I do not know what\r\n\r\nelse  we  could  do.   We  could  recall  him.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions  for home detention would be that  the  inmate  be\r\n\r\ngainfully employed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  studying.  We will try our best to find him a  job.   But\r\n\r\nthat  may  not be easy.  There could be a time when a  person\r\n\r\nmay  not  be able to find a job.  That does not mean we  will\r\n\r\nrecall  the inmate back from home detention immediately.   We\r\n\r\nought to have some flexibility on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we can help them to reduce the stigma and\r\n\r\ntheir  friends knowing them as prisoners or not, I think  the\r\n\r\nmoment  he goes to prison, the neighbours will already  know.\r\n\r\nThe  prison authorities have been quite discreet in designing\r\n\r\nthe tag.  The tag is a little item that is put on the leg and\r\n\r\nif  he  wears long pants, it can be covered.  Unless he wants\r\n\r\nto  go  for a swim, that is a different matter.  I think  the\r\n\r\nperson has to take a chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether we should be more\r\n\r\ncompassionate to ex-prisoners. That is a view which  we  will\r\n\r\ntry  to encourage people to have, particularly employers,  to\r\n\r\nemploy  these people.  Of course, some employers are wary  of\r\n\r\nemploying ex-prisoners.  What SCORE and ISCOS, which are  MHA\r\n\r\nstatutory board and company, have done is that they have been\r\n\r\nhelping these people to find jobs.  If employers are prepared\r\n\r\nto  employ  them, we will be happy to match the prisoners  or\r\n\r\nthose under home detention for jobs.  In certain places, like\r\n\r\nairport  and seaport, security is very important.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  standards  that the authorities expect  of  people  with\r\n\r\ncriminal  records are much higher. We should not be  too  lax\r\n\r\nabout that, otherwise we will bring ourselves more trouble by\r\n\r\nbeing too lax over security standards in the airport and  the\r\n\r\nseaport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Gerald Ee asked about the use of firearms,\r\n\r\nand  whether  firearms  would only be  used  when  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary.  That must be the case.  I do not think our people\r\n\r\nare  trigger-happy  to  shoot whenever somebody  attempts  to\r\n\r\nescape. They will employ all measures to restrain the  person\r\n\r\nand  to  stop  the  escape  from happening  and  if  that  is\r\n\r\nimpossible, then orders to shoot will be given by a  superior\r\n\r\nofficer.  If firearm is actually used, and it is necessary to\r\n\r\nhave a Committee of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nInquiry,  we  will inquire into it.  In any case,  the  right\r\n\r\nauthority to investigate into any discharge of firearm is the\r\n\r\npolice.   If there is a discharge of firearm, even innocently\r\n\r\nor  accidentally, by an officer on duty, the matter will also\r\n\r\nbe  investigated by the police.  Members can be rest  assured\r\n\r\nthat we do not just shoot unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have dealt with all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I seek an answer from the\r\n\r\nMinister on the status of the members in the Committee.  What\r\n\r\ndoes he mean by \"being deemed public servants\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I have not looked at the particular\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  Penal Code, but from my  recollection,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that it applies to people who are not civil servants\r\n\r\nwho help us and we consider them to be public servants in the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  their duties as members  of  the  committee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we assume that they do their job in good faith and\r\n\r\nwhatever decisions, recommendations or actions that they take\r\n\r\nwould not be subject to any suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Two points of clarification for the\r\n\r\nMinister.   The  first point is on the issue  of  imposing  a\r\n\r\ncondition on the offender for not consuming alcohol.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure,  as part of the condition for  release,  the\r\n\r\nprison  authorities  will  be  imposing  certain  conditions.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  one  of it will be that he cannot consume  drugs.\r\n\r\nNaturally,  the  officers will be making surprise  visits  to\r\n\r\nmeet this offender.  By imposing a condition that they do not\r\n\r\nconsume  alcohol imposes on them a condition that  they  stay\r\n\r\nsober  and  also makes sure that this is not a  luxury  which\r\n\r\nthey  enjoy  at home but it would be monitored.  So  I  would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister  to impose it as a  matter  of  condition\r\n\r\nbecause  this is something that is even introduced in  Sweden\r\n\r\nand they have found that it can be successfully monitored  if\r\n\r\nyour  officers are keen.  If the condition is there, I  think\r\n\r\nthe offender will know that there is such a condition.  If he\r\n\r\ninfringes it, he goes back\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  prison.   So I hope that the Minister would include  this\r\n\r\ncondition into the terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is on the question of pre-trial\r\n\r\noption to go on electronic tagging.  My concern is that there\r\n\r\nare  cases  where individuals, who come from  poor  families,\r\n\r\nbefore  they  are  determined  whether  they  are  guilty  or\r\n\r\ninnocent,  because they are unable to raise the  bail  money,\r\n\r\nthey  end  up  being  in the remand prison.   And  these  are\r\n\r\ninstances which I consider sad cases.  An option can be given\r\n\r\nto  them  to  opt for electronic tagging, so that they  avoid\r\n\r\ngoing  to  prison.   I  think it is an  option  that  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered,  and it is also being considered  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  in certain districts.  So perhaps this is  something\r\n\r\nthat the Minister could consider implementing, so that people\r\n\r\nwho  are determined subsequently to be innocent would not end\r\n\r\nup  serving in the remand prison just because they are unable\r\n\r\nto raise the bail money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the prison authorities will look\r\n\r\nat whatever condition that is necessary to be included in the\r\n\r\nenforcement of this home detention scheme.  It is  easier  to\r\n\r\ndetect  drug consumption than, say, alcohol.  When  you  take\r\n\r\nalcohol,  whatever  drink it is, and  overnight,  it  can  be\r\n\r\nwashed  away.  But as for drugs, you can actually do a  urine\r\n\r\ntest,  and  you can determine whether the person  has  drugs.\r\n\r\nBut we will still look at the Member's suggestion and see  if\r\n\r\nit is necessary to have the condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pre-trial cases, I think right now it is definitely\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  scope of this particular review,  and  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntotally different thing altogether.  I am not ruling  it  out\r\n\r\ncompletely,  but right now we have other considerations  that\r\n\r\nwe  have to take into account in implementing this particular\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LIBERALISATION OF THE SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.34 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the long\r\n\r\ntitle  of  my motion is \"Issues related to the liberalisation\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Stock Exchange in the midst of the boom  of\r\n\r\nInternet  Stocks\".  I would like to declare  my  interest  as\r\n\r\nDirector of several listed companies, including I-one.net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the departure of Mr Koh Beng Seng from the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS), the  Singapore  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange used to be a bastion of conservatism.  After the Pan-Electric  episode,  the SES had adopted a regulatory  mindset\r\n\r\nand  attempted to protect both the gullible investors and the\r\n\r\nreckless  speculators  in essentially a buyer-beware  market.\r\n\r\nFrom  time to time, rules for listed companies were made even\r\n\r\nmore  stringent with new requirements such as the requirement\r\n\r\nof  an  independent  Audit Committee and full  disclosure  of\r\n\r\ndirectors' fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing requirements of Initial Public Offering (IPO)\r\n\r\nwere very stringent, especially those seeking to list on  the\r\n\r\nmain  board.  These companies must have proven track  records\r\n\r\nof profitability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the SES became a comparatively calm equity\r\n\r\nmarket  where  speculations  were  minimal.   It  acquired  a\r\n\r\nreputation  of being a safe market, in so far  as  an  equity\r\n\r\nmarket  could  be made safe.  The collective  memory  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  is  that SES is a strict taskmaster.  When a  company\r\n\r\nobtained  the  approval  from the SES  to  list,  the  public\r\n\r\nassumed  that  someone  had done the due  diligence  and  the\r\n\r\ncompany's fundamentals had been certified sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This public image has remained unchanged today, even\r\n\r\nthough in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npost-Koh  Beng Seng era, the SES, recently renamed  SGX,  has\r\n\r\nmodified its stance, moving away from its regulatory role and\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  a  stock exchange like  the  New  York  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.   Companies  seeking IPO no  longer  need  a  track\r\n\r\nrecord of proven profitability.  In fact, MediaRing, when  it\r\n\r\nwas being listed, had projected to continue its multi-million\r\n\r\ndollar  losses  for  the  next few years!   In  essence,  any\r\n\r\ncompany  with  a  market capitalisation  of  more  than  S$80\r\n\r\nmillion post-IPO and could find a merchant banker prepared to\r\n\r\nunderwrite the IPO exercise, could tap the market for funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these\r\n\r\nrelaxations are appropriate if SGX were to remain viable  and\r\n\r\nrelevant   in   an   increasingly  dynamic   equity   market.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, more and more market players will bypass  SGX  and\r\n\r\ninvest  in  other stock markets in the world, an  undertaking\r\n\r\nmade  easier because of Internet trading.  Unfortunately,  as\r\n\r\nthe  liberalisation has been quite recent, the fact that  SGX\r\n\r\nis  now a less regulated market and hence a more risky  place\r\n\r\nhas not yet dawned in the collective memory of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, in the liberalisation process, a new kind\r\n\r\nof companies has burst onto the scene worldwide: the Internet\r\n\r\ncompanies.   High-tech companies and Internet companies  have\r\n\r\nbeen  the darlings of the US capital market for several years\r\n\r\nnow.   Companies, which lose money consistently, continue  to\r\n\r\nsee their share prices appreciate.  Traditional indicators of\r\n\r\ncompany's  performance no longer seem to  be  relevant.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  P/E  ratio  has become  meaningless  or  non-applicable.   The famous example is Amazon.com.   This  fever\r\n\r\nhas  spread  to other major stock markets in the  world.   In\r\n\r\nJapan,  Softbank and Hikari become investment companies  with\r\n\r\nthe  Midas' touch.  With the success of China.com and Pacific\r\n\r\nInternet in the NASDAQ market, the Internet fever has  spread\r\n\r\nto Hong Kong Stock Exchange, SGX, KL Stock Exchange, and even\r\n\r\nthe Bombay Stock Exchange.  In Hong Kong, Pacific Century\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCyberworks almost single-handedly leads the charge  into  the\r\n\r\nbrave new world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, taking advantage of the relaxed\r\n\r\nlisting requirements, three dot.com companies were listed one\r\n\r\nafter  another  since  June  last  year,  namely,  I-One.net,\r\n\r\nMediaRing  and  Horizon.com.   All  these  three  IPOs   were\r\n\r\nspectacularly successful with prices peaked at multiple times\r\n\r\nof  the issue prices.  The scramble is on.  Let me quote from\r\n\r\nHock  Lock Siew column of 19th February issue of the Business\r\n\r\nTimes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There is big money to be made from the Internet craze\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The window of opportunity could be closing as\r\n\r\nmore and more Internet firms get listed.  Time is of essence.\r\n\r\nThe  faster  to  market,  the higher  an  Internet  startup's\r\n\r\nvaluation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are indeed many dot.com companies in the pipeline vying\r\n\r\nto  go  IPO.  Gotcha, Nececity, iProperty, GeoAsia,  just  to\r\n\r\nname a few.  Many companies, in fact, with very little to  do\r\n\r\nwith  Internet  are  now frantically transforming  themselves\r\n\r\ninto dot.com companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are not alone in this. The scene in Hong\r\n\r\nKong   is  even  scarier  as  traditional  brick  and  mortar\r\n\r\ncompanies scramble to join the bandwagon.  Mr Li Ka-Shing has\r\n\r\njust launched his Tom.com hoping to raise HK$762 million.   I\r\n\r\nam quite sure many of those dealmakers do not really know the\r\n\r\ndifference between \"bytes\" and \"bites\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the valuations of dot.com companies in the US\r\n\r\ncontinue to escalate, the dot.com phenomenon is beginning  to\r\n\r\nlook like an asset bubble.  The Internet sector in the US has\r\n\r\na  valuation  of  around US$550 billion or 4%  of  the  total\r\n\r\nmarket  capitalisation.  As an indication of the lofty height\r\n\r\nNASDAQ  has  reached, it is pertinent to note that  Microsoft\r\n\r\nalone has a market capitalisation of around US$600 billion, a\r\n\r\nfigure  larger  than the GDP of Canada!  The danger  of  this\r\n\r\nasset  bubble is that all the stock markets in the world  are\r\n\r\nnow  pegged to the fortune of NASDAQ.  It also means that  if\r\n\r\nNASDAQ  crashes, this would bring about a simultaneous  crash\r\n\r\nworldwide.   The  scenario is indeed very scary.   In  recent\r\n\r\ndays, while Dow Jones has been declining, the NASDAQ has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  power ahead moving in the opposite  direction.\r\n\r\nDespite all the talk of the new economy, nothing can defy the\r\n\r\nlaw of gravity ultimately.  What goes up must come down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we shall embrace the new economy. Senior Minister\r\n\r\nin  his  Chinese  New  Year's speech  at  the  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nCommunity  Club urged that young men and women  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  bright  ideas should be encouraged  to  take  risks  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  their ideas could be brought to fruition.   The\r\n\r\ninvesting public must be encouraged to give their support  to\r\n\r\nthe risk-takers so that a new entrepreneurial group could  be\r\n\r\nproduced that would give Singapore's economy that extra zip.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is how Singaporeans can participate\r\n\r\nin  the  Internet boom without being sucked  into  the  asset\r\n\r\nbubble.    Had  our  market  been  known  for  its  high-risk\r\n\r\ninvestment  environment where investors go  into  the  market\r\n\r\nwith their eyes open, I would be less inclined to be alarmed.\r\n\r\nAs  it  is,  most people still believe that so  long  as  SGX\r\n\r\napproves an IPO, the company would have been vetted by one of\r\n\r\nthe  toughest regulators in the world.  As such, sometimes  I\r\n\r\nfeel  great unease standing by as the speculative fever sucks\r\n\r\nin  the  wise  and  the worldly as well  as  the  greedy  but\r\n\r\nignorant.   I  am  sure  that in our environment,  if  things\r\n\r\nultimately  go  wrong, our Government will  be  blamed.   And\r\n\r\nscenes   of   the   Taiwanese  speculators  petitioning   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  assistance to recover  their  lost  fortunes\r\n\r\nflash in my mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, should the current Internet boom burst, and\r\n\r\nburst it seems to be sooner or later, would the investors  be\r\n\r\nturned   off  by  all  dot.com  companies,  including   those\r\n\r\ndeserving ones, thereby depriving the young and the promising\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs the lifeline for success?  My own preference is\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government  to express stronger  words  of  caution\r\n\r\nregarding  new  IPOs of dot.com companies.   Perhaps  we  can\r\n\r\nfollow  the  practice of cigarette companies  printing  words\r\n\r\nlike  \"Smoking  is hazardous to your health.\"   But  in  this\r\n\r\ncase,  maybe  words  like \"Profit stream of  the  company  is\r\n\r\nuncertain.  Invest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  your  own risk.\"  On the other hand, on a more  realistic\r\n\r\nnote,  I  would  prefer to see that companies  with  unproven\r\n\r\ntrack  records,  such as dot.com companies,  be  confined  to\r\n\r\nSESDAQ,  our secondary market, rather than be listed  on  the\r\n\r\nmain exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though this is an unenviable and difficult task, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Minister to strike a balance  between\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of our stock exchange and the  protection  of\r\n\r\nour  retail investors, especially in view of the bull run  of\r\n\r\nhigh-tech and Internet stocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I thank Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen  for  his\r\n\r\nintervention.   It  is  a timely reminder  of  the  risks  of\r\n\r\ninvesting in the stock market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two years, we have liberalised and\r\n\r\nmodernised our capital markets.  We have changed the  listing\r\n\r\nrules  on  SGX  to  allow a wider range of  companies  to  be\r\n\r\nlisted,  including start-up companies with short  but  strong\r\n\r\nprofit  records, and companies which have not  yet  made  any\r\n\r\nprofits at all because of heavy reinvestment needs.  The  new\r\n\r\nrules  are comparable to the rules in other established stock\r\n\r\nmarkets in the world for their main boards.  The changes have\r\n\r\nbeen  necessary  to enable capital markets to  fund  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy, because the main purpose of the equity market is not\r\n\r\nto enable investors to make a quick buck, but to be an avenue\r\n\r\nfor  channelling funds and resources as equity to  invest  in\r\n\r\ncompanies and enable companies to draw equity in order to  be\r\n\r\nable  to grow.  So the changes have been necessary to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  capital  market  to fund this new economy,  particularly\r\n\r\nincluding   companies   in  high-tech   and   knowledge-based\r\n\r\nindustries.  If we do not allow high-tech companies  to  list\r\n\r\non  the  Stock Exchange, then either they will be choked  off\r\n\r\nfrom equity capital and we will miss out on their growth,  or\r\n\r\nthey  will  list  overseas, for example, on NASDAQ,  and  our\r\n\r\nstock market will wither.  So we are in this business.   This\r\n\r\nis again for professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have changed the regulatory\r\n\r\nphilosophy - from a merit-based one, what Dr Wang called  Koh\r\n\r\nBeng  Seng's approach, although it was not just Mr  Koh  Beng\r\n\r\nSeng,  it was the Government's approach, or what the Business\r\n\r\nTimes  called \"the Confucian approach\", to a disclosure-based\r\n\r\none.   Previously, we would assess the merits of  a  proposal\r\n\r\nand  decide whether it is a good or a bad company.   Now,  we\r\n\r\nhave  basic  criteria and as long as there is full disclosure\r\n\r\nand  all  the  facts are put up, we allow the company  to  be\r\n\r\nlisted and allow investors to go in.  This has been necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  finally, investors have to make their own  decisions\r\n\r\nand   to   take  responsibility  for  them.   No  merit-based\r\n\r\nregulator  can guarantee that only successful companies  will\r\n\r\nbe listed and that investors will definitely make a profit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We changed the listing rules last September. Since\r\n\r\nthen,  five  companies have been listed under the  new  rules\r\n\r\nwhich would not have qualified under the old rules.  Only two\r\n\r\nare  dot.com companies, as Dr Wang pointed out, MediaRing and\r\n\r\nHorizon.com.  The other three are China Toll Bridges &  Roads\r\n\r\nLtd,   ST   Assembly   Test  Services   Ltd   and   Chartered\r\n\r\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Ltd, of which STATS and  CSM  are\r\n\r\nalso listed on NASDAQ and are by no means start-up companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our changes coincided with the great effervescence in\r\n\r\nthe  technology  sector and tech stocks in  the  US  markets.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  new  frontier, there is a gold rush  mentality.\r\n\r\nSome  people  have made it big, others hope to make  it  even\r\n\r\nbigger.   They are going in, they are trying as if  the  last\r\n\r\ntrain is about to leave the station.  Not all will succeed  - many will certainly fail.  The excitement is for real reasons\r\n\r\nbecause the Internet is a dramatic breakthrough in technology\r\n\r\nwhich  is  going to change the lives of billions  of  people.\r\n\r\nBut,  of course, in all this excitement, we start with a good\r\n\r\nthing  and  get carried away by its momentum.  There  is  the\r\n\r\npsychology of a speculative bubble, particularly in  the  US,\r\n\r\nin  tech  stocks.  And this has buoyed other markets  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, including Hong Kong, Bombay, KL and to a lesser extent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At some point, the American market will come back\r\n\r\nto  earth, the law of gravity will reassert itself and  which\r\n\r\nwill affect markets everywhere else.  How or when, nobody can\r\n\r\ntell.  If Dr Wang could be quite confident that this is going\r\n\r\nto  happen  within  this year, contrary to  what  many  other\r\n\r\npeople  expect,  he could become very rich  by  shorting  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  On the other hand, if he misjudges, he might not  be\r\n\r\nrich at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I cannot comment whether the Singapore market is too\r\n\r\nhigh or too low, much less on the merits of individual stocks\r\n\r\nor  companies which are listed on the Stock Exchange.  But  I\r\n\r\ncan tell you that not every company that calls itself dot.com\r\n\r\nis   naturally  and  automatically  an  Internet  company  or\r\n\r\ndestined  for  fabulous success.  Investors  have  to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether to buy the shares in these companies, or in any other\r\n\r\ncompanies.  You have got to know the risks.  You have got  to\r\n\r\nbe prepared for the downside.  And you have got to judge what\r\n\r\nyour  risk  appetite  is.   If you are  an  investment  fund,\r\n\r\npicking  winners  for  your portfolio,  with  many  potential\r\n\r\nwinners  in  a big portfolio, that is fine.  One  goes  sour,\r\n\r\nanother  one  will turn out right.  But if you  are  a  widow\r\n\r\ninvesting  your last CPF dollar, and you put it on  a  single\r\n\r\ncompany  in the hope that you will get rich, then  maybe  you\r\n\r\nare  better  off keeping that money in a fixed deposit  in  a\r\n\r\nbank instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think overall, our new rules and philosophy are\r\n\r\ncorrect.   The  Government cannot stop companies  from  being\r\n\r\nlisted  on  SGX because we think that their business  is  too\r\n\r\nrisky, or because we think their shares are priced too  high.\r\n\r\nRisk  taking  is the essence of business and particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe new economy.  But we will educate the public on the risks\r\n\r\nso  that people know what they are doing and go in with their\r\n\r\neyes open.  Whether they are actually looking or not, that is\r\n\r\nanother  matter.  But we will not spare any effort to explain\r\n\r\nand  to  point  out, and speeches by Dr Wang, MPs  and  other\r\n\r\nleaders will also be helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, even with tight rules, as in the past, you\r\n\r\nmust remember that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies are not guaranteed to succeed.  Whatever our rules,\r\n\r\nthey can fail either for business reasons or because of fraud\r\n\r\nor  crime, as Pan-El failed and Amcol ran into trouble.   And\r\n\r\neven  if  a  company is sound, its share price can  still  be\r\n\r\ninflated  and  not  justified by the company's  earnings  and\r\n\r\nprospects.    And   indeed,  Microsoft   itself,   which   is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly a very good company with its share price at about\r\n\r\n$100,  that is about 70 or 80 times its price earnings ratio.\r\n\r\nAnd  Steve Balmer himself, who is now the CEO, had said,  \"My\r\n\r\nprice  is  inflated, over-valued.\"  As a result of which,  it\r\n\r\ncame down three or four dollars, but it is still over-valued.\r\n\r\nSo  I  do not think it is possible for the Government to make\r\n\r\nsure that the Stock Exchange is a safe place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway it is difficult to prevent people from taking\r\n\r\nrisks,  by keeping what we think are risky companies off  the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange.  People who want risky investments find  many\r\n\r\nways  to  make them.  They can invest overseas.  In  the  old\r\n\r\ndays,  when  the Malaysian stocks were listed on  CLOB,  they\r\n\r\ninvested  on CLOB, which is a different environment from  the\r\n\r\nSingapore stock market.  Or sometimes, if they cannot  invest\r\n\r\non  the stock market, they put money on horses or many  other\r\n\r\nthings,  or  football,  or even watch two  raindrops  on  the\r\n\r\nwindscreen  and  see  which  goes  faster.   That  is   their\r\n\r\ninstinct.   Our  job is to encourage a more professional  and\r\n\r\nsophisticated share market, not controlled by people  looking\r\n\r\nat the screen through the window and hoping to guess the next\r\n\r\nmove  that the share price will make, but people who  analyse\r\n\r\nthe  fundamentals, understand the business, know the way  the\r\n\r\nindustry is going and put bets in for the long term.   So  if\r\n\r\nyou  do  not know about stocks, do not buy and sell based  on\r\n\r\nthe  latest rumour or rely on hot tips from friends.   Better\r\n\r\nentrust  your money to a reliable fund manager,  buy  a  unit\r\n\r\ntrust,  or  leave  your money in the  bank.   It  is  not  as\r\n\r\nexciting,  but it is much safer.  Not totally risk-free,  but\r\n\r\nmuch safer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government can do is to enforce the rules of\r\n\r\nthe  market  -  have  proper disclosure,  have  tight  market\r\n\r\nsurveillance, have quick action against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany  price  manipulation, any monkey  business  means  severe\r\n\r\npenalties  for offenders.  Recently, we changed  the  law  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a new civil penalty for insider trading, to make it\r\n\r\neasier  to  punish or to obtain compensation from  those  who\r\n\r\nmake improper use of insider information to trade and benefit\r\n\r\nthemselves at the expense of others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors cannot just invest in a company based on the\r\n\r\nname  of  that company. They have to know what the  company's\r\n\r\nbusiness  is,  how the company is doing, what  its  prospects\r\n\r\nare,  how much the company is realistically worth.  For  IPOs\r\n\r\nand  share  issues, all this information  should  be  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany  prospectus.   We will change  our  requirements  for\r\n\r\nprospectuses  to ensure that they contain all that  investors\r\n\r\nreasonably  expect  to  find  it.   And  this  will   include\r\n\r\ninformation   which  is  known  to  the  directors   of   the\r\n\r\ncorporation,   or   known  to  the   persons   performing   a\r\n\r\nprofessional or advisory function in relation to the issue or\r\n\r\nproposed issue of securities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a move away from a \"one-size-fits-all\"\r\n\r\nprospectus.   We  will accommodate the greater  diversity  of\r\n\r\ncompanies being listed on SGX, and create an environment  for\r\n\r\nintermediaries,   like  stockbrokers,   investment   bankers,\r\n\r\naccountants, even lawyers, are expected to play their part in\r\n\r\nensuring  that  proper disclosure is made.   But  of  course,\r\n\r\nwhile we can print a good prospectus, this will only help  if\r\n\r\npeople  actually  read  the prospectuses,  and  do  not  just\r\n\r\nblindly subscribe to IPO shares confident that they will make\r\n\r\na profit on the first day.  And in fact, it is known in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome markets, you go to the stockbroker's office, you get the\r\n\r\napplication form with the prospectus, you go out,  you  throw\r\n\r\naway the prospectus in the dustbin and you just take the form\r\n\r\nand  hope  that the shares are worth some money.   Sometimes,\r\n\r\neven the form is worth some money.  But that is not the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained the Government's approach towards\r\n\r\nliberalising  and regulating the stock market,  and  set  out\r\n\r\nwhat  the Government can and cannot do.  It is in the  nature\r\n\r\nof  stock markets and human psychology that the markets  will\r\n\r\ngo up and go down through cycles.  These cycles are linked to\r\n\r\nthe  real  economy,  but often overshoot.   They  last  seven\r\n\r\nyears,  10  years,  sometimes, like now  in  America,  a  bit\r\n\r\nlonger.  My suspicion is they are driven by young people  who\r\n\r\nare  seeing  the cycle for the first time.  They  have  never\r\n\r\nlost  before, they have never seen the blood on  the  ground.\r\n\r\nIt  is exciting and exhilarating.  It is their last chance to\r\n\r\nget in.  They ramp it up.  And then something goes wrong,  it\r\n\r\ncomes  down again.  And they have learned their lesson.   But\r\n\r\nin  10  years' time, a new generation of greenhorns is  born.\r\n\r\nSo  we  should know this.  We have been through this  before.\r\n\r\nThe  stock market will not always go up.  Sometimes, it  will\r\n\r\ncome  down.  So Singaporeans who want to invest on the  stock\r\n\r\nmarket should know this and invest prudently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Three Minutes to Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE CABLE VISION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Information\r\n\r\nand  the  Arts if he will show separately the utilisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  paid  TV  and the Internet-access services  provided  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  Cable  Vision  by  the  following  categories   of\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  namely Housing and Development Board apartments,\r\n\r\nprivate  apartments  and condominia,  terrace  houses,  semi-detached houses, bungalows and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Subscription rate for SCV</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 31st January 2000, the overall subscription rate\r\n\r\nof  SCV  has  increased to 23% (or 214,000 households).

However,  along  with  her  regional\r\n\r\nneighbours,  Singapore  was  not  spared  from  the  downturn\r\n\r\ntriggered by the currency crisis in mid-1997.  The impact  of\r\n\r\nthe economic slowdown on the labour market was, however, only\r\n\r\nlargely  felt  in  the second half of 1998 with  unemployment\r\n\r\nreaching  a high of 4.4% in the later half of the  year.   By\r\n\r\n1999, the labour market began to show some signs of recovery,\r\n\r\nwith  the unemployment rate declining throughout most of  the\r\n\r\nyear.  The 1999 unemployment figure will be available on  the\r\n\r\n24th  February  2000  when  the  Annual  Economic  Survey  is\r\n\r\nreleased.  Full details on the unemployment profile  will  be\r\n\r\navailable  in  the  quarterly  Labour  Market  Report  to  be\r\n\r\nreleased in mid-March 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All workers, regardless of gender, age and race are\r\n\r\ngiven  opportunities to retrain and upgrade their skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.   Female  workers can benefit and  have  benefited\r\n\r\nfrom  retraining programmes such as the Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  (SRP).   Among the 21,700 workers  who  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained  or  are undergoing training under the SRP,  40%  are\r\n\r\nfemales.  In fact, during the early stages of the SRP when it\r\n\r\nfocused primarily on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector, an even greater percentage  of  females\r\n\r\nwere  trained.   Most of the trainees were female  production\r\n\r\nworkers.  Today, the SRP has expanded into many other sectors\r\n\r\nsuch  as  childcare, healthcare, banking, travel and tourism,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, etc, so female workers of many  different\r\n\r\noccupations are being trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courses being offered by national training\r\n\r\nprogrammes are varied.  They include preparatory courses such\r\n\r\nas  Basic  Education for Skills Training  (BEST)  and  Worker\r\n\r\nImprovement through Secondary Education (WISE) which  aim  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  workers'  proficiency in language  and  numeracy.\r\n\r\nOther  courses  include Certificates of  Competencies  (CoC),\r\n\r\nNational Technical Certificates (NTC) levels 2 and 3, as well\r\n\r\nas  other certificate courses offered by the polytechnics and\r\n\r\nthe  ITE.   These  courses are relevant to various  different\r\n\r\nindustries  in  both the manufacturing and services  sectors.\r\n\r\nThe  duration  of the courses also varies.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nduration of a CoC course or 1 module of NTC course is usually\r\n\r\n120 hours.  The duration of an NTC 3 course is 480 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, MOM started a scheme to improve the\r\n\r\nemployability of retrenched workers through skills upgrading.\r\n\r\nThis  was done under the SRP and spearheaded by the self-help\r\n\r\ngroups,  which  acted  as  surrogate  employers.   Under  the\r\n\r\nscheme,  retrenched  workers who were unable  to  secure  re-employment  went  for skills upgrading under  the  SRP.   139\r\n\r\nsponsored  retrenched  workers  graduated  under  the  scheme\r\n\r\nbetween  August and November last year.  Of the 114  whom  we\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  contact during a recent survey,  89  (78%)  have\r\n\r\nfound employment and 25 (22%) are still unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is not only relevant to retrenched workers. It\r\n\r\nis  just  as  important  in  raising  the  skill  levels  and\r\n\r\nproductivity  of those who have a job.  In a study  conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  Skills Development Fund in 1998, about  90%  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  surveyed indicated that training  had  significant\r\n\r\nimpact   on  the  level  of  service  quality,  followed   by\r\n\r\nproductivity  growth  and level of  product  quality  of  the\r\n\r\norganisations.   The  extent of  increase  in  the  level  of\r\n\r\nservice  quality ranged from 11% to 20%; and 1%  to  10%  for\r\n\r\nproductivity growth and level of product quality. As for  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  training  on individuals, 80%  of  the  companies\r\n\r\nsurveyed   indicated  that  there  was  an   enhancement   in\r\n\r\nemployability after an employee had gone through  certifiable\r\n\r\ntraining.  More than 60% of the organisations also said  that\r\n\r\nemployees who had undergone training received a wage increase\r\n\r\nranging from 1% to 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINIMUM AGE FOR CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development (a) what is the rationale  for  fixing\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  age for criminal responsibility at seven  years\r\n\r\nold; (b) whether in the past 10 years the Court has convicted\r\n\r\nany  child  between 7 and 10 years old and for what offences;\r\n\r\nand  (c)  if he will consider reviewing this issue, including\r\n\r\nseeking  expert and community opinions on this, by organising\r\n\r\na public and private forum. .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Penal Code has made it clear that nothing is an\r\n\r\noffence  which is done by a child under 7 years  of  age,  or\r\n\r\ncommitted by a child aged between 7 and 12 years who has  not\r\n\r\nattained  sufficient maturity of understanding to  judge  the\r\n\r\nnature and consequences of his/her conduct on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This minimum age of 7 years is inherited from the common\r\n\r\nlaw  of England.  This minimum age provides a safety net  for\r\n\r\nyoung  offenders  and  protects  them  from  exploitation  of\r\n\r\nunscrupulous adults who may want to make use of  children  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  illegal  activities.  It also  allows  for  early\r\n\r\nintervention by social and other authorities before  a  child\r\n\r\nprogresses into a hardened offender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the minimum age of culpability is 7 years old,\r\n\r\nchildren  are  not  subject to the  same  justice  system  as\r\n\r\nadults.

In  addition,\r\n\r\nthere  is an inherent safeguard as children between the  ages\r\n\r\nof  7 and 12 years who do not have adequate understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  crimes  they have committed will not be held  criminally\r\n\r\nresponsible.   Criminal sanctions can  therefore  be  applied\r\n\r\nonly  to young children who are aware of the nature of  their\r\n\r\nconduct, while protecting those of a similar age who have not\r\n\r\nyet reached a sufficient level of maturity, from prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all persons arrested for committing offences will be\r\n\r\ncharged in court.

The raising of childcare personnel's qualification\r\n\r\nwas widely welcomed by early childhood practitioners as it\r\n\r\nrecognised the importance of childcare personnel in the lives\r\n\r\nof the young children in their care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EDUCATION SCHEME OF SERVICE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n(a)  what is the rationale and special justification for  the\r\n\r\nrecent  upward  salary revision for the  teaching  profession\r\n\r\ndespite  the  current  need for wage restraint  in  both  the\r\n\r\npublic and private sectors; and (b) whether his Ministry  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  any new or innovative measures other than  salary\r\n\r\nincreases to enhance the status, working conditions  and  job\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of the more deserving school teachers so  as  to\r\n\r\nattract the right individuals to join the teaching profession\r\n\r\nas a long-term career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions made to the Education Scheme of Service\r\n\r\nsince  1st  January 2000 was not a general  salary  revision.\r\n\r\nInstead,  new  intermediate salary grades were added  to  the\r\n\r\nscheme  of  service.   The  objective  was  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nstructure  of  the  service  to  allow  enhanced  promotional\r\n\r\nopportunities  and more timely promotional  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nimprove retention.  These changes were part of civil service-wide  changes  to the structure of Division 1  services.  New\r\n\r\nsalary  grades were introduced for both the General Education\r\n\r\nOfficer  (GEO) and the Senior Education Officer (SEO)  salary\r\n\r\nschemes.   Previously, classroom teachers were only  eligible\r\n\r\nfor  one promotion to the career grade of GEO 1A and GEO  2A.\r\n\r\nWith the new intermediate GEO salary grade, they now have  an\r\n\r\nadditional  promotion opportunity, ie, 2  promotions,  before\r\n\r\nthey  reach the career classroom teacher grade.  GEO officers\r\n\r\ncan also look forward to faster and earlier first promotions.\r\n\r\nThe  new  SEO  grade  was introduced to offer  better  salary\r\n\r\nprogression  in  the Upper Timescale levels  before  officers\r\n\r\nreach the Superscale levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry agrees that we need to provide an overall\r\n\r\nconducive  environment to help attract and  retain  teachers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  salaries  and promotions  alone  that  determine\r\n\r\nretention  ability.  We have a strong focus on  training  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   The  Ministry  encourages  and  supports   its\r\n\r\nofficers  to upgrade themselves professionally.  The National\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education has recently announced a comprehensive\r\n\r\nframework  for continual training of teachers.  We have  also\r\n\r\nimplemented  various schemes such as the Study  Leave  Scheme\r\n\r\nand  the  Professional  Development Leave  Scheme  to  enable\r\n\r\nofficers to upgrade themselves academically through full-time\r\n\r\ngraduate  and postgraduate programmes.  Financial  assistance\r\n\r\nin the form of sponsorships, half-pay leave and interest-free\r\n\r\nstudy  loans  are available.  Since 1998, an average  of  230\r\n\r\nteachers  per year have been granted study leave to pursue  a\r\n\r\nfirst degree or a Master's degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, various awards have been instituted by\r\n\r\nseveral organisations and the nation to recognise outstanding\r\n\r\nteachers.   These  awards,  viz  the  Outstanding  Youth   in\r\n\r\nEducation  Award,  the  Caring Teacher Award,  the  Inspiring\r\n\r\nChinese  Language Teachers award and the pinnacle award,  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Award  for  Teachers -  are  reflective  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity's recognition and nation's regard for the important\r\n\r\nrole that teachers play.  There is no greater affirmation for\r\n\r\nour many dedicated teachers than when the community seeks  to\r\n\r\nrecognise their good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also implemented several measures to alleviate\r\n\r\nteachers'  workload.  These include the  creation  of  School\r\n\r\nAdministrator and Operations Manager posts at all schools  to\r\n\r\nperform administrative support functions, the streamlining of\r\n\r\nwork procedures (e.g. payment of school fees by GIRO, central\r\n\r\nissuing of student identification passes), and leveraging  on\r\n\r\nIT to improve work efficiency.  Since 1998, MOE has allocated\r\n\r\nmore  than 1,500 additional teaching posts and more than  380\r\n\r\nadministrative and support posts to schools.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
