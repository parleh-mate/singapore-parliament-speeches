In a general\r\n\r\nresponse  to his question, there is a Ministerial Committee  set\r\n\r\nup  to  oversee  very large investments exceeding  $500  million\r\n\r\nacquisitions,  and  this is chaired by  DPM  Lee,  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  is a member of the Committee, DPM Tony Tan  is  also  a\r\n\r\nmember, the Minister for Trade and Industry and BG Yeo are  also\r\n\r\nmembers.   But  this Committee only concerns  itself  with  very\r\n\r\nlarge acquisitions of $500 million or more and particularly with\r\n\r\nreference  to overseas investments where  there may be political\r\n\r\novertones.  Other than that, the companies themselves have their\r\n\r\nown  boards  and  they  are responsible  for  making  their  own\r\n\r\ndecisions  on  a  commercial basis.   It  is  not  feasible  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to nanny every company it owns.  Do not forget  that\r\n\r\nTemasek  Holdings,  which is a Government-holding  company,  has\r\n\r\nshareholders'  funds totalling $34 billion,  and  it  is  making\r\n\r\nprofits  averaging $1.6 billion per year over the last 10  years\r\n\r\nand  it  includes a huge stable of companies of large size,  eg,\r\n\r\nSIA, DBS, and so forth, and they all have responsible boards who\r\n\r\ntake  investment  decisions on their own after  consulting  with\r\n\r\ntheir professional advisers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister on the issue of Micropolis.  The loss, I  believe,\r\n\r\nin  the  reply  he gave me yesterday, amounts to  about  half  a\r\n\r\nbillion  dollars.  I would like to ask whether any of  these  is\r\n\r\ncoming  from CPF or is it some other source that has drawn  into\r\n\r\nour reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The answer is no. The acquisition\r\n\r\nwas funded from ST's internal resources plus bank loans.  So CPF\r\n\r\nis not involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether after it was\r\n\r\ndecided to wind up Micropolis, a statement was made or a  report\r\n\r\nwas  submitted  to  this Ministerial Committee  to  examine  the\r\n\r\nacquisition of Micropolis by Singapore Technologies?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The position has been reviewed by\r\n\r\nthe  holding  company, which is Temasek Holdings,  and  that  is\r\n\r\nwhere the matter rests.  No report has been made to Cabinet, nor\r\n\r\nis it required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It may not be required. But if you have a\r\n\r\nMinisterial Committee, is it not the function of the Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee, chaired as he said by BG Lee, to inquire closely into\r\n\r\nhuge  losses  suffered by Government-owned companies?   Here  we\r\n\r\nhave a case of half a billion dollars gone down the drain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Ministerial Committee, as I\r\n\r\nexplained   earlier,   is  basically  responsible   for   making\r\n\r\nacquisitions and would of course be interested in the details of\r\n\r\nany  major losses which Temasek would in due course, after their\r\n\r\nown  study,  advise.  However, I would like to  point  out  that\r\n\r\nalthough in absolute terms, the loss looks very large, the sizes\r\n\r\nof  the  operations are also huge and our companies  anyway  are\r\n\r\nventuring into the high-tech areas.  I think you should  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the  nature  of the business is highly volatile  and  very\r\n\r\ncapital-intensive, and if you are going to be in  that  business\r\n\r\nat  all, you have to accept the consequences.  I will refer  you\r\n\r\nto  a  report  - I think it was yesterday or before  yesterday's\r\n\r\npapers  - about Seagate, the largest disk drive company  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  incurring  a first quarter loss of over  US$300  million\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the downturn in this business.  So  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  requires high risk, you make money,  you  lose  money.\r\n\r\nBut  overall,  Temasek group of companies has been  accumulating\r\n\r\nassets  at  a rate of, as I mentioned earlier, $1.6 billion  per\r\n\r\nyear  over the last 10 years and without drawing on Government's\r\n\r\nequity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A final question, Mr Speaker, Sir. Is the\r\n\r\nMinister  saying  then  that even  if  there  is  a  high  risk,\r\n\r\nGovernment-owned companies will still go into the acquisition or\r\n\r\ntake-over, in the hope that they can turn round the company  and\r\n\r\nmake  profits?

They were\r\n\r\ntherefore more attractive and command higher prices compared  to\r\n\r\nthose offered for the 1st Quarter 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second part of the question, flats in the North-East Zone enjoy greater popularity than flats in the North and\r\n\r\nWest  Zones.  This is reflected in the higher resale  prices  of\r\n\r\nthe  flats as well as the demand for these flats.  In the  queue\r\n\r\nfor the new HDB flats, 57% of the applications are for flats  in\r\n\r\nthe  North-East  Zone. In view of this, flats in the  North-East\r\n\r\nZone  are priced relatively higher compared to similar units  in\r\n\r\nthe other zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister saying\r\n\r\nthat  if  the flats in any specific area are more popular,  they\r\n\r\nwill  accordingly be priced higher?  Is that one of the  factors\r\n\r\nthat the HDB prices its flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If an area is more desirable, this\r\n\r\nshould be reflected in the higher land prices.

HDB purchased land from Land Office at  the  market\r\n\r\nrate,  based  on  the  location, size and density  that  we  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  build.  So every year, HDB will buy land  from  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office and the land prices will reflect the attributes  of\r\n\r\nthe site and location.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister agree that most of the\r\n\r\nland  for HDB flats was acquired three or four decades ago at  a\r\n\r\npittance?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The Government has a land bank built up\r\n\r\nof  land  from  different  sources.

The average selling price of a 5-room flat,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, is about $285,000.  Would the Minister explain further\r\n\r\nand  give details as to how HDB flats are being priced?  Besides\r\n\r\nthe  construction cost, how much is the land cost, and  whatever\r\n\r\ncosts like design that command a premium?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> What the Member is quoting probably\r\n\r\nconstitutes the building contracts that we gazette or  publicize\r\n\r\nupon  receipt of the tenders.  There are several components that\r\n\r\ngo  into the pricing of HDB flats.  First,  the land cost  which\r\n\r\ntoday  constitutes about 50%-60% of the total cost of HDB flats.\r\n\r\nSecondly,   infrastructure to build up the town.  Before  we  go\r\n\r\nfor   building  contract  tender,  HDB  acts  as  an  agent  for\r\n\r\nGovernment,  putting in the major roads, major  sewerage  pipes,\r\n\r\nmajor  water pipes, etc.  The Government gives a grant  to  HDB.\r\n\r\nSo  HDB acts like the PWD for the Government, building the roads\r\n\r\nand  all  the facilities.  Once the land is prepared,  then  HDB\r\n\r\nwill tender the land.  And what the Member is quoting now is the\r\n\r\nbuilding contract prices.  Beyond that, of course, will  be  the\r\n\r\nadministration  cost.   HDB  also  employs  architects,  project\r\n\r\nmanagers,  etc.  and that would add another  5%-7%  of  building\r\n\r\nsupervision  and administration costs.  So that will  constitute\r\n\r\nthe total development cost of the HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister mentioned land cost of 50%-60%. Would it not be lower in terms of unit price calculated\r\n\r\nbased  on  land cost?  Because the plot ratio is now  higher  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  HDB flats compared to previously, and also  the  floor\r\n\r\narea of HDB 5-room flats is relatively smaller now.  Would it be\r\n\r\na cost saving in that case?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second supplementary question is: does the HDB also take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  infrastructural development,  for  which  it\r\n\r\nreceives  a  grant from the Government? Is it a  factor  in  the\r\n\r\npricing of HDB flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The approximate contribution of the land\r\n\r\ncost that I quoted just now, 50%-60%, is on a per square foot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt-up area basis.  The HDB operates as an agent of Government\r\n\r\nand  the  infrastructure cost is part of the work to  develop  a\r\n\r\ntown.  As you know, most HDB towns are green field sites.   Some\r\n\r\nare  even  sea  that  we have to reclaim  and  put  in  all  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  And from there, a town is built up.  All  these\r\n\r\nconstitute the total development cost of  HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Has the infrastuctural development\r\n\r\ncost  of the town been all the while taken into account as  part\r\n\r\nof  HDB's  selling  price of flats?  Or was there  a  change  in\r\n\r\npolicy for taking that into account?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The costing of HDB flats and the way the\r\n\r\nHDB accounts are built up have been in place since 1985.  As you\r\n\r\nwill remember, we had consultants like Price Waterhouse, etc, to\r\n\r\ncome  in  and build up the HDB accounts.  There has not  been  a\r\n\r\nchange since that basic structure was built up in 1985.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What about before 1985? Was the\r\n\r\ninfrastructural development cost of the town taken into  account\r\n\r\nas a factor in the pricing of HDB flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As you know, before 1985, HDB operated\r\n\r\nmore like a  Government department by using cash accounting.  In\r\n\r\n1985, we decided that the HDB should present its accounts on  an\r\n\r\naccrual  basis, like most statutory boards.  And on that  basis,\r\n\r\nwe  moved  from  cash accounting to accrual accounting,  and  we\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  the  cost structure of HDB and how to  determine  the\r\n\r\ntotal  development of each HDB flat on that basis with the  help\r\n\r\nof outside consultants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I clarify with the Minister whether\r\n\r\nbefore 1985 the infrastructural development cost was taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  in the pricing of HDB flats?

And  the  pricing of HDB flats was  based  on  how  much\r\n\r\nsubsidy you want to give out.  So there was no clear attribution\r\n\r\nof how much each HDB unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  cost.   Because  like all cash accounting,  whatever  you\r\n\r\nspend that year, in 1979, you would expense it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that after\r\n\r\n1985,  once you take the full costing of the flat, the price  of\r\n\r\nthe  flat  would  increase because of the different  factors  in\r\n\r\ncosting?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is not so. I think the whole\r\n\r\nobjective  of  the 1985 exercise was to give HDB management  and\r\n\r\nGovernment   a   better  evaluation  of  what  goes   into   the\r\n\r\nconstruction and the development of  HDB flats.  As you know, we\r\n\r\nhad  a big debate between Mr Chiam See Tong and the late Mr  Teh\r\n\r\nCheang  Wan  in  the  early  days on how  much  HDB  flats  were\r\n\r\nsubsidised.  And there was no way you could explain to Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nunless  the  accounts were presented every year in  a  generally\r\n\r\naccepted  practice  of accrual accounting.  Today,  whether  you\r\n\r\nlike it or not, the cost that goes into each HDB flat is clearly\r\n\r\nreflected,  clearly  explained  and  totally  accountable   for.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  what it costs, what we sell the flats for,  and  how\r\n\r\nmuch subsidy per unit  are reflected in HDB accounts every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

An educated person, in addition to acquiring skills and\r\n\r\nknowledge,  should  be  morally  upright,  socially  adept,  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  to  his  family, community and country.   Imparting\r\n\r\nvalues   and  inculcating  social  responsibility  are  integral\r\n\r\ncomponents of the education process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member knows, we have recently introduced the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Involvement Programme in our schools.  This programme\r\n\r\nwas  introduced earlier this year to drive home the  point  that\r\n\r\ncaring  for the less privileged in society is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  every Singaporean, not just of those with a special calling.\r\n\r\nThis  complements existing community service efforts by  schools\r\n\r\nand  tertiary  institutions, like the fund-raising projects  and\r\n\r\nblood donation drives which these institutions regularly do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, choosing a profession is a matter of individual\r\n\r\nchoice.  Education policies cannot dictate what professions  our\r\n\r\nstudents eventually choose.  Choices are influenced by a variety\r\n\r\nof factors,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding  perception  of  monetary  and  non-monetary  rewards,\r\n\r\ninclinations of the individuals and, in particular,  a  person's\r\n\r\naptitudes and values.  By providing sound moral education, as we\r\n\r\ndo  in  our  schools,  we may encourage more  of  our  young  to\r\n\r\nconsider the caring professions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much that education can do to shape the values of\r\n\r\nthe  society.   But what we can do in the schools  and  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  must  be reinforced by the  home  and  society  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  It is a shared responsibility to encourage people to  go\r\n\r\ninto the caring professions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I agree that\r\n\r\nit  is  a  shared responsibility.

So it is not\r\n\r\njust  aptitudes.  It is really providing at the curriculum level\r\n\r\nand meeting the needs of manpower in the social services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Yes, indeed at the polytechnic level, about\r\n\r\nfive years ago, at the Nanyang Polytechnic we set up a School of\r\n\r\nHealth   Sciences  in  the  areas  of  nursing,   physiotherapy,\r\n\r\noccupational therapy, radiography and so on.  This programme has\r\n\r\nmet with substantial success and we were able to attract quite a\r\n\r\nlarge number of people into nursing.  But this was after quite a\r\n\r\nlot  of efforts on the part of the professional associations and\r\n\r\nthe  polytechnic.   So  now we are having  a  steady  stream  of\r\n\r\npolytechnic students doing these allied health courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Member's information, in July 1997, the Nanyang\r\n\r\nPolytechnic also introduced a 3-year full-time diploma course in\r\n\r\nCommunity  Services Management.  This has attracted 44 students.\r\n\r\nThe  course  aims  to train students to operate  community-based\r\n\r\norganisations and also work in other types of organisations with\r\n\r\na  humanistic orientation in society.  The expected career paths\r\n\r\nof  these  diploma  holders include youth development  officers,\r\n\r\nprobation    officers,   social   development    officers    and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  officers.

I must stress again  that  no  amount  of\r\n\r\neducation   planning  can  force  people  to  take   a   certain\r\n\r\nprofession.  There is a whole host of factors being  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  by the students and parents.  So  it  depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  over the years our society changes its attitude towards\r\n\r\nthe position, the status and the worth of the work of the caring\r\n\r\nprofessions.

We make sure we know  what\r\n\r\nthe  workers  want  and  what they are worried  about.   As  our\r\n\r\neconomy is closely linked to the world economy, we have  to  pay\r\n\r\nclose  attention to outside forces.  We must anticipate  changes\r\n\r\nand not be overtaken by events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, the NTUC used scenario planning tools to\r\n\r\nplan for the next few years.  We have identified a number of key\r\n\r\nconcerns.   I  will share with this House today  our  top  three\r\n\r\nconcerns, and how we propose to deal with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key concerns</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our first key concern is how to make our trade unions\r\n\r\nmore useful to our members, to companies and to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay relevant, we must have programmes that workers find\r\n\r\ninteresting and of practical value.  We must mobilise workers to\r\n\r\nmake their companies more competitive.  We must always consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational interests before taking any action.  In other words, we\r\n\r\nmust add value - to workers, to companies and to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers are better-educated and many have travelled\r\n\r\nquite a bit.  They are more sophisticated, more discerning,  and\r\n\r\neven  more  demanding.  And they have different needs  which  we\r\n\r\nmust  cater  to.  We must find new ways to recruit members,  and\r\n\r\ndeal  with workplace problems.  That is why we must respond well\r\n\r\nto  the changes.  That is why our membership has been going  up.\r\n\r\nIn  many  parts  of  the world, where trade  unions  operate  in\r\n\r\ntraditional ways, membership has declined sharply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies, too, have to cope with rapid changes. They have\r\n\r\nto  become  more productive, innovative and nimble.   If  we  as\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  hamper  their efforts to restructure,  to  become\r\n\r\ncompetitive, then they will resent our presence.  But if we  can\r\n\r\nwork with them to move ahead of competition, they will accept us\r\n\r\nas  partners.  Indeed, there are some employers who have  openly\r\n\r\ndescribed unions as useful partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our unions have helped make Singapore a better place to\r\n\r\nlive  in  and  do  business.  Because we prefer negotiations  to\r\n\r\nstrikes, our streets are no longer battlegrounds.  Indeed,  each\r\n\r\nyear  brings  in more investments - to create more, and  better-paying jobs.  Our cooperatives help moderate the cost of living.\r\n\r\nOur  NTUC Club has several outlets.  We have resorts and country\r\n\r\nclubs.  So workers can now spend their leisure in style, and  at\r\n\r\nprices  well  within  their reach.  We  must  continue  to  help\r\n\r\nworkers  stretch  their hard-earned dollars,  where  it  matters\r\n\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second key concern is whether workers can stay\r\n\r\nemployable through their working lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 40% of our workers have low education, only up to\r\n\r\nlower secondary.  They are older, many above 40 years.  They  do\r\n\r\nlow-skilled jobs which create low value.  It is hard for them to\r\n\r\nupgrade.   But  Singapore is restructuring.  It  is  becoming  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  So the low-skilled jobs will go.  Yes,\r\n\r\nEDB has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking  very hard.  It brings in new investments.  But the  new\r\n\r\nfactories  require workers with high skills.  Look at the  wafer\r\n\r\nfab, petrochemicals, and the pharmaceuticals.  They need workers\r\n\r\nwith  at least `A' levels.  So when workers are retrenched  from\r\n\r\nlow-skilled  jobs, can they find work in wafer  fabs?   If  not,\r\n\r\nwhat can they do?  How can we help them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some workers may remain unemployed, not because there are\r\n\r\nno jobs, but because they do not have the skills for these jobs.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what  we  call structural unemployment.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nimprove our workers' skills.  But this is something that  unions\r\n\r\ncannot  do  on their own.  It requires the combined  efforts  of\r\n\r\ngovernment, employers and unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third concern is how to cope with foreign labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had foreign workers for many years. So far, they\r\n\r\nare  found  only  in certain industries, and at certain  levels.\r\n\r\nBut,  in his National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Goh  Chok\r\n\r\nTong  spoke  of  the  need to bring in more foreign  talents  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  our  limited local talent pool.  We  in  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  support this move, as long as Government and employers\r\n\r\nwork  with us to retrain and upgrade our workers.  We will  make\r\n\r\nthese  foreign talents feel at home in Singapore.  If the better\r\n\r\nones  want  to stay and make Singapore their home, so  much  the\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Critical uncertainties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we face critical uncertainties which can affect our\r\n\r\nfuture development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, will our workers stay employable? In 1996, NTUC\r\n\r\nlaunched  the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) to  help  our\r\n\r\nworkers  upgrade their skill levels.  We are encouraged  by  the\r\n\r\nresponse  of our workers and are grateful for the support  given\r\n\r\nby  Government and some employers.  We must do more.  We need to\r\n\r\nmake  SRP  a national programme.  It is not enough to  run  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes  only for the unionised sector.  Government  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared to invest more in worker training.  So, too, employers.\r\n\r\nWorkers must accept lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the PAP Convention on 11th January, Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\nsaid  he thought it was a good idea to have a new ministry  that\r\n\r\ncould  focus  on  manpower development.   So  workers  can  look\r\n\r\nforward to even more systematic training programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I was in an NTUC team that made a study tour of\r\n\r\nthree  highly  developed  countries -  Switzerland,  France  and\r\n\r\nGermany.   What  did  we  find?   We  found  a  high  level   of\r\n\r\nunemployment: 5.3% in Switzerland, 12.6% in France, and 11.1% in\r\n\r\nGermany.   Seven  out of 10 unemployed in these three  countries\r\n\r\nwill  remain unemployed or without a job for a long, long  time.\r\n\r\nThey  are  caught in structural unemployment.  They do not  have\r\n\r\nskills to take on high-paying jobs that are being created.   Can\r\n\r\nwe  upgrade  our workers' skills fast enough to avoid structural\r\n\r\nunemployment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another critical uncertainty: Can we continue to attract\r\n\r\nquality investments?  Practically all countries in the world are\r\n\r\nnow  pursuing  the market economy, with slight variations.   And\r\n\r\nmany have two factors which potential investors find attractive:\r\n\r\na  large domestic market and an abundant natural resources.   We\r\n\r\ndo  not have such advantages.  Business and wage costs are  also\r\n\r\nhigher  in  Singapore.  Of course, we have many plus  points  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  going  for  us.   We  have  political  stability  and\r\n\r\nindustrial harmony.  Our workers are more skilful than those  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries.  But these countries are improving  their\r\n\r\ncapability.  We are also competing with developing countries for\r\n\r\nquality investments.  Can we continue to get such investments?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third concern is whether NTUC's symbiotic ties with the\r\n\r\nPAP  will  remain strong.  PM Goh touched on the symbiotic  ties\r\n\r\nwhen he addressed the PAP Convention.  He said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We should strengthen our symbiotic relationship with the\r\n\r\nNTUC  and  the unions.  Union members and workers have benefited\r\n\r\nfrom the policies and the attitude of the PAP towards them.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the PAP Government has helped workers to enjoy  similar\r\n\r\nleisure   facilities   as   their  employers,   management   and\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  Union members, in turn, have supported  the  PAP\r\n\r\nin implementing its programmes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To underline this symbiosis, he has asked the PAP and the\r\n\r\nNTUC to jointly organise a seminar to discuss the impact of  the\r\n\r\nregional  currency  and economic turmoil.  During  our  scenario\r\n\r\nplanning sessions, we did consider various joint efforts by  the\r\n\r\nNTUC and the PAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbiotic ties will be maintained, only if the young in\r\n\r\nboth  the  unions and the PAP forge a close understanding.   The\r\n\r\nyoung  have  not  had the kind of shared experiences  the  older\r\n\r\ngeneration  had  - in working together to overcome  crisis.   We\r\n\r\nhave  a difficult year ahead of us.  It would be useful for  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists and PAP activists to work together to  overcome\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP-NTUC symbiosis has led to Singapore making good\r\n\r\nprogress.  This symbiosis is based on trust, on mutual  benefit.\r\n\r\nMembership  of the two organisations will remain and  depend  on\r\n\r\npersonal choice, as it has been all along.  There is no law that\r\n\r\nsays that the NTUC and the PAP must work together.  For example,\r\n\r\nif  the Government were to ignore workers' interests, there will\r\n\r\nbe  calls  from  the labour movement to review the  relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the Party.  Also, if unions act irrationally, there is  no\r\n\r\nreason  for  Government to offer a helping  hand.   So  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue to nurture the PAP-NTUC symbiosis, and not take chances\r\n\r\nwith  it.  Without this symbiosis, it is not possible for us  to\r\n\r\noperate the tripartite system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Towards Stronger Tripartite Links</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet the challenges ahead, we have to review our\r\n\r\ncurrent  approaches.   We  will strengthen  methods  which  have\r\n\r\nworked  to  our advantage and discard old mindsets  and  methods\r\n\r\nwhich are no longer relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite framework has served us well. Our objective\r\n\r\nas  trade  unions is to safeguard the interests of workers.   We\r\n\r\ncan  do  so effectively only if companies become more productive\r\n\r\nand  competitive.   Government must  continue  to  provide  good\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, transparent regulations and stable conditions to\r\n\r\nattract investors.  Then workers can continue to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave good jobs and look forward to fair wage increases.  This is\r\n\r\nthe basis of our tripartite relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has succeeded so far because Government,\r\n\r\nemployers  and  workers have worked together.   Where  there  is\r\n\r\nindustrial  harmony,  there is social and economic  development;\r\n\r\nwhere there is constant strife, it is difficult for businessmen,\r\n\r\nlocal  or foreign, to make long-term plans.  A strong tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship is not just critical in maintaining this industrial\r\n\r\nharmony.   It  is also a key competitive advantage  to  help  us\r\n\r\nbecome a developed economy early in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tripartism has worked uniquely for Singapore in the\r\n\r\npast.   For the future, Singapore needs a vision, a view of  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  that  is  only possible with a synergetic  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween Government, union and employer.  We need to envision and\r\n\r\nshape  the future together in a proactive manner.  Rose coloured\r\n\r\nglasses  and a complacent hope that the future will work  itself\r\n\r\nout  will  never guarantee jobs, neither will it  guarantee  the\r\n\r\nhigh  morale,  productivity and skills level of workers  and  to\r\n\r\nsupport the economy in bad times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we stand at a crucial point in our economic\r\n\r\nhistory  amidst the regional currency crisis.  If steps are  not\r\n\r\ntaken to further strengthen the tripartite partnership, we  will\r\n\r\nnot  withstand  the  onslaught of change.   The  time  can  come\r\n\r\ninstead  when  a  lot  of finger pointing will  take  place,  as\r\n\r\neveryone  blames someone else for the mess, and no  one  accepts\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   Key  issues in the  economy  and  business  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  to  be  addressed  before  they  become   major\r\n\r\nproblems.   Only then can we realise the interests  of  workers,\r\n\r\nthe  needs of companies, and the hopes of the Government for the\r\n\r\nnation's future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three partners in this relationship must continue to\r\n\r\nfunction  like  the legs in a tripod to support each  other  and\r\n\r\nensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  each  leg  remains  standing  firmly  so  that  the  whole\r\n\r\nstructure is stable.  However, a tripod does not exist as an end\r\n\r\nin  itself.   It supports a greater entity; in the case  of  the\r\n\r\ntripartite partnership, the entity being the nation itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the hopes for tripartite partnership in the\r\n\r\nfuture?   Tripartism  can  be  described  as  kaleidoscopic.   A\r\n\r\nkaleidoscope  is primarily made of three strips of mirrors  that\r\n\r\nare  equilaterally  situated to reflect the  best  of  patterns,\r\n\r\nshapes  and  colours.  The kaleidoscope always makes fascinating\r\n\r\nviewing.   The  positioning of the mirrors is  strategic.   Even\r\n\r\nwhen  the  different \"stones\" in the kaleidoscope get  relocated\r\n\r\nand  mix  with other \"stones\", the views are always  interesting\r\n\r\nand  appealing.  Needless to say, all these views are impossible\r\n\r\nwithout  the strategic alignment of the mirrors.  In fact,  when\r\n\r\none  of  the  three strips of mirrors gets damaged,  the  entire\r\n\r\nkaleidoscope  is  ineffective and thus ruined.   Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nidea  of tripartism is to create the best pattern of cooperation\r\n\r\nand bring out the best in each worker, with the collaboration of\r\n\r\nthe  employer and the union, with government.  The end  product,\r\n\r\nthe  beautiful  pattern, represents the  wonderful  nation  that\r\n\r\nresults  from a true tripartite partnership.  However, when  any\r\n\r\nstrip of mirror, representing the employer, union or government,\r\n\r\nis  ruined, the damage is felt by each partner in the tripartite\r\n\r\nalliance, and the end product is a nothing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartite partnership must be strengthened for the primary\r\n\r\nreason  that  the international business world is  going  to  be\r\n\r\nconstantly changing and increasingly competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, I would like to focus my speech on three key\r\n\r\nareas.   The first two will touch on how the PAP Government  can\r\n\r\nfurther  add value to the labour movement and the third area  on\r\n\r\nhow the labour movement can further add value to companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has been just pointed out by the NMP, life long\r\n\r\nemployability is a key concern of our workers.  About 700,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  or  about 43% of our workforce have at best  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nSecondary Two education or less, and many of them are above  the\r\n\r\nage  of  40.   So  they  are relatively  slower.   It  would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult for them to cope as we become a knowledge-based and IT-plugged economy.  Keen competition demands that our workers  are\r\n\r\ntrained,  retrained and are multi-skilled.   Jobs  are  becoming\r\n\r\nintertwined   and  inter-dependent  that,  for   instance,   the\r\n\r\ntraditional lines between the blue-collar and white-collar  have\r\n\r\nblurred.   Jobs  are fast becoming a pale-blue  or  bluish-white\r\n\r\nkind of work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the regional economic crisis, the neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  are  becoming  significantly more  cost  competitive.\r\n\r\nWhile  Singapore  can still succeed in attracting  higher  value\r\n\r\nadded  investments  and white-collar jobs  into  Singapore,  our\r\n\r\nproblem will be the hastened pace at which low value-added  dark\r\n\r\nblue-collar jobs will disappear.  What this means for Singapore,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  lower educational profile of the Singapore workforce\r\n\r\nis,  as Mr Cyrille Tan has pointed out, structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to take preventive action before it bites our economic\r\n\r\njugular  veins  like a werewolf.  Europe has  been  bitten  very\r\n\r\nbadly.  Seven out of 10 workers face structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home, just look at what has happened to Hong Kong's\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector.  I am not sure whether it  is  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment, but it is a very serious job displacement problem.\r\n\r\nIn  1990,  the colony's burgeoning manufacturing sector employed\r\n\r\nmore   than  a  million  people.   Due  to  restructuring,   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industry shrunk drastically in 1995 and shed  two-thirds  of  the workers and only employed 350,000  workers.   We\r\n\r\ncould  potentially face a more serious situation than  what  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  lesson  has  shown.   Smaller  economies  under  the\r\n\r\npressure  of  rising  costs  due  to  resource  constraints  can\r\n\r\nrestructure  their  industrial  base  much  faster  and  deeper.\r\n\r\nPresently,  the manufacturing sector's share of Singapore's  GDP\r\n\r\nand employment is 27% and 23% respectively.  In other words, GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribution  from manufacturing sector, 27%, number  of  people\r\n\r\nemployed   in  the  manufacturing  sector,  23%  of  the   total\r\n\r\nworkforce.   Given  the  lack of focus on skills  upgrading  and\r\n\r\ngiven  the  present  gloom and doom, it is  not  an  unrealistic\r\n\r\nscenario  to  imagine the manufacturing employment in  the  next\r\n\r\nfour  years shrinking from 23% of the workforce to 12%, in other\r\n\r\nwords,  halving in four years' time, which would result  in  job\r\n\r\nlosses of at least 200,000 workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no glance at the crystal ball. It is a very real,\r\n\r\nhighly  likely possibility, if nothing is done.  And the workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are already starting to see the first  signals  of\r\n\r\nthe `looming storm'.  In yesterday's Business Times, a survey of\r\n\r\n100  companies indicates that job security rather than  pay  now\r\n\r\ntops  workers'  concerns.  And,  Members  also  must  have  read\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  Seagate Technology, Singapore's second  largest\r\n\r\nprivate sector employer, will announce major layoffs this  week.\r\n\r\nAs  industry rumours have it, 20% of its staff will  be  cut  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and that this is only but the `tip of the iceberg' for\r\n\r\nall Singapore manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is most worrying is that the most vulnerable\r\n\r\ngroup  amongst the 700,000 less-educated Singaporean workers  is\r\n\r\nthat  more  than  220,000 of them are male  bread-earners  whose\r\n\r\nhousehold  incomes are less than $2,000.  These are workers  who\r\n\r\nlive  in  3-room  HDB flats, or maybe 2-room, or  1-room  rental\r\n\r\nflats  and they are working as production workers or as cleaners\r\n\r\nin commerce and services industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question that the Members of this House have to\r\n\r\nask  is: how are these workers going to cope with the storm that\r\n\r\nis  looming when it hits them and their families?  And they  are\r\n\r\nno  less  Singaporeans than all of us in this House.  They,  and\r\n\r\nthe  many more thousands of workers, urgently need the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  frontbench, and not just the sympathy of the frontbench\r\n\r\nor the backbench.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the clarion call is for the Government to focus more and\r\n\r\ninvest much more funds on skills redevelopment of the workforce.\r\n\r\nWhile  Government  talks about `Thinking  Schools  and  Learning\r\n\r\nNation', it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  given  a disproportionately low attention to the  education\r\n\r\nand  training  of  the less educated mid-career  adults  in  our\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me illustrate why. In the Budget for FY 97, there\r\n\r\nwere  a  combined total of about 470,000 students in our primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary schools.  The Government allocated $1.83  billion\r\n\r\nto  educate  these 500,000 students.  In addition, it  allocated\r\n\r\n$78  million in Edusave bursaries and scholarships and for other\r\n\r\nscholarships.   And it has set aside over a number  of  years  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $5  million  from  our  surpluses  into  the  Edusave\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stark contrast, very little has been spent on educating\r\n\r\nor skilling our workforce.  The Government funds worker training\r\n\r\nmainly through the Skills Development Fund (SDF).  In FY 97,  it\r\n\r\nhas  only disbursed something like $47 million to companies  and\r\n\r\nof  this $47 million, $22 million was actually collected through\r\n\r\nthe  Skills  Development  Levy  from  companies.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could have spent a few more millions of dollars  here\r\n\r\nand  there through some other training programmes.  But that  is\r\n\r\nthe amount allocated for worker training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 700,000 workers out there with less than\r\n\r\neight  years  of  formal education and yet what  the  Government\r\n\r\ninvests  on  them  sounds like `peanuts'  compared  to  what  is\r\n\r\ninvested  in  our school children.  So they say peanuts  attract\r\n\r\nmonkeys.   Perhaps in good times, the workers  may  be  swinging\r\n\r\nfrom  job  to job, but in bad times, they will have  no  job  to\r\n\r\nswing to.  They may have to swing from tree to tree.  Sir, these\r\n\r\nworkers too need schemes like the Edusave.  How about initiating\r\n\r\n`Train-Save' Schemes and training bursaries and scholarships for\r\n\r\nworkers?   What about emulating the $5 billion Edusave Endowment\r\n\r\nFund  with a Worker Training Endowment Fund which could  go  far\r\n\r\nbeyond  the scope of the Skills Development Fund as the SDF  has\r\n\r\ngot many limitations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please do not get me wrong about spending money on our\r\n\r\nchildren.  I support every cent that is spent in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducating  our  school going children.  We must invest  on  them\r\n\r\ntoday  to reap the benefits tomorrow.  But what I am also saying\r\n\r\nis that the Government must spend just as much, if not more, and\r\n\r\nspend  it  today  for workers who missed out on their  education\r\n\r\nyesterday  for various reasons.  And if we do not do enough  for\r\n\r\nthem today, then there may be no tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is really committed to life-long\r\n\r\nemployability   and  implementing  the  concept   of   life-long\r\n\r\nlearning,  it must recognise that it has to go beyond  investing\r\n\r\nin  the education of the young.  It must develop a comprehensive\r\n\r\nnational   infrastructure  to  develop  and  coordinate   skills\r\n\r\nupgrading, continuing education and training.  It must provide a\r\n\r\nmechanism,  a  nexus,  beyond the schools  for  continuation  of\r\n\r\nlearning from the school to the workplace.  It must provide  the\r\n\r\nflexibility to ensure life-long employability of workers so that\r\n\r\nit  can  respond  effectively to the  changing  skill  needs  of\r\n\r\nindustry   and   business.   It  must  provide  incentives   and\r\n\r\nmotivation for workers to want to upgrade and learn a new  skill\r\n\r\neven in good times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with great hope, anxiety and high expectations that\r\n\r\nthe workers look forward to the establishment of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower,  as announced by our Prime Minister.  It is  also  our\r\n\r\nhope  that the new Ministry will coordinate the work of  various\r\n\r\nagencies   to  develop  a  comprehensive  continuing   education\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   A  wide range of Government-funded  programmes\r\n\r\nthat  allow  for  modular  learning,  and  the  accumulation  of\r\n\r\ntraining  credits  leading  up to  various  levels  of  national\r\n\r\ncertification   should   be  conceptualised,   implemented   and\r\n\r\ncoordinated.  A tripartite National Training Committee needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  formed  to coordinate these efforts and to provide feedback.\r\n\r\nSchemes  like  the  ITE's  Company  On-the-Job  Training  Centre\r\n\r\n(COJTC)  and  NTUC's  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme  must  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened  and beefed up to become national programmes.   And\r\n\r\nas  I  have said earlier, Edusave concepts must be extended into\r\n\r\nTrain-Save Schemes for workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, we need a paradigm shift in the way that we\r\n\r\nlook  at continuing education and skills upgrading.  We need  to\r\n\r\ntake a holistic approach to succeed.  We need the Government  to\r\n\r\nact  and  act fast.  We in the labour movement keenly await  the\r\n\r\nformation of the Ministry of Manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Symbiotic relationship between PAP and NTUC</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now like to move on to the second area in which the\r\n\r\nGovernment can further add value to the labour movement and that\r\n\r\nis the symbiotic relationship between the PAP and the NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PAP has always had the support of workers. In\r\n\r\nfact,  trade unionists were amongst the convenors of the  Party.\r\n\r\nAt  the  inauguration of the PAP, most of those who were present\r\n\r\nwere  union  members.   Half  the Protem  Committee  were  trade\r\n\r\nunionists.  Once in power in 1959, the PAP Government set  about\r\n\r\nto  implement  its election pledges - to strengthen  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement.   Laws  were  passed to check  employers  from  taking\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  workers.  Trade unions were given their  rightful\r\n\r\nplace in society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, the labour movement was split into two, with one\r\n\r\ngroup  (the  NTUC)  backing  the PAP and  the  other  supporting\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.  The NTUC stood shoulder-to-shoulder with  the\r\n\r\nPAP  in the struggle against colonialism, then against communism\r\n\r\nand,  subsequently, against communalism.  It is  this  symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship  that  has  enabled us to  weather  the  storms  in\r\n\r\nearlier  decades.   With  the support of organised  labour,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been able to take tough decisions to overcome one\r\n\r\ncrisis after another.  Let me state here and now that we in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement stand fully behind the Government as  it  takes\r\n\r\nsteps to minimise the impact of the regional currency crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may ask why this unflinching support. Because the\r\n\r\nworkers  know that their destiny and that of the nation  depends\r\n\r\non good and effective government.  Without good government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe could not have full employment, 90% home ownership, universal\r\n\r\neducation, medical and other social benefits.  But I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  a  growing number of younger Singaporeans take  this  good\r\n\r\nlife  for granted, and this good relationship for granted.   The\r\n\r\nold  guards  in the NTUC and the PAP have made way  for  younger\r\n\r\nleaders  who  have  not  gone through the  same  experiences  in\r\n\r\ntackling life-and-death issues.  So will the symbiotic relations\r\n\r\nbetweeen the PAP and NTUC remain strong in the years ahead?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Cyrille Tan has mentioned, we have to continually\r\n\r\nnurture  this special partnership which is so unique to  us  and\r\n\r\nnot  take  chances.  Last Sunday, the Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nPAP,  PM Goh has called for closer ties between the PAP and  the\r\n\r\nNTUC.  This call has certainly reassured the labour movement  of\r\n\r\nthe  continued commitment of the PAP and particularly under  the\r\n\r\nyounger leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to move to this area where unions can\r\n\r\nadd  value to companies.  While we pride ourselves in having the\r\n\r\nworld's  best  workforce, there is still  tremendous  scope  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.   One  area  where  we  lag  behind  as  a  nation,\r\n\r\nespecially as seen in the BERI survey, is in workers' attitudes.\r\n\r\nWorkers'   attitudes  are  shaped  largely  by   the   workplace\r\n\r\nrelationship  with management and therefore the level  of  their\r\n\r\nmotivation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an excellent working relationship at the top level,\r\n\r\nbetween  the  CEOs of companies and the NTUC leaders.   But  the\r\n\r\narea that needs further strengthening is at the middle level and\r\n\r\nat the workplace where better  rapport needs to be built between\r\n\r\nbranch  union  officials  and  the middle  management.   Greater\r\n\r\neffort  is  needed to build mutual trust and understanding.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to develop shared vision and show that if the relationship\r\n\r\nis  stoked the right way, the unions can galvanize the workforce\r\n\r\nto contribute significantly and add much, much more value to the\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the unions, there is a need to perhaps\r\n\r\nreview  the  traditional  way that  we  do  things  and  conduct\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  In Japan, for example, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining process which is done in  the  months  of\r\n\r\nspring  is  called  the  \"Spring  Offensive\".   It  sounds  very\r\n\r\nconfrontational and I am sure Mr Matthias Yao will agree that it\r\n\r\nsounds  like  a military maneouvre. While collective  agreements\r\n\r\n(CAs)  still serve a very important role for unionised  workers,\r\n\r\nwe have to change the modus operandi.  For example, a collective\r\n\r\nagreement (CA) is a document that captures what compensation and\r\n\r\nbenefits that the company will provide for the workers.  But, in\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, it is one sided.  Time has come for us to move from\r\n\r\ncollective agreements to partnership agreements -  from  CAs  to\r\n\r\nPAs.   A  partnership agreement can go beyond the CA and include\r\n\r\nthe  commitment of the union and workers to a shared vision  and\r\n\r\nadd  value to the company.  One of the key ways in which  unions\r\n\r\ncan  add  value  to the company that they work  for  is  through\r\n\r\nproductivity improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many scientific ways in which we can\r\n\r\napproach productivity improvement, to me, the fundamental factor\r\n\r\nthat  contributes to productivity is human attitude.  The  right\r\n\r\nwork   attitudes   of   staff  can  do  wonders   in   enhancing\r\n\r\nproductivity.   Therefore, if branch unions and  management  can\r\n\r\nforge  a  closer working partnership, there can be so much  more\r\n\r\nvalue added to companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC and the PSB have set up a task force to find ways\r\n\r\nfor  unions to add value to their companies.  The NTUC will move\r\n\r\nits  emphasis  from  productivity  awareness  to  developing  an\r\n\r\nintegrated and action-oriented approach to push productivity  at\r\n\r\nthe  unionised workplace.  These could include training, quality\r\n\r\naction programmes, job redesign and enlargement.  The details of\r\n\r\nthese programmes will be announced in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let us reaffirm our commitment to tripartism\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of  the  present regional  scenario.   The  most\r\n\r\nscintillating  views  on  the  kaleidoscope  are   obtained   in\r\n\r\nbrilliant sunlight.  With sunlight, the views sparkle and gleam.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  in  boom  times,  the  tripartite  relationship   is\r\n\r\nobviously  working  well.   In  the  absence  of  sunlight,  the\r\n\r\npatterns of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolour   and  light  are  still  a  fascinating  sight  in   the\r\n\r\nkaleidoscope,  because  the mirrors  are  still  reflecting  all\r\n\r\navailable  light off each other.  The economic climate  that  we\r\n\r\nare in now is like the weak rays of sunshine.  The financial and\r\n\r\ncurrency  turmoil in the region is casting a shadow of pessimism\r\n\r\nand  caution.  The situation that we are in now is all the  more\r\n\r\nneedy of a tripartite partnership so that the three partners can\r\n\r\nreflect  and  bring  out the best in each  other,  to  create  a\r\n\r\nbeautiful pattern, a lovely society.  In the absence of a strong\r\n\r\nsunlight,  when  the economy is down, we must  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nmirrors  of  tripartism  pick  up the  best  of  colours,  hues,\r\n\r\nbrilliance and intensity of productivity, so that we  can  yield\r\n\r\nthe maximum of benefit for the worker, employer and nation as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern of the NTUC, as Mr Cyrille Tan put it,\r\n\r\nis:  how can trade unions add value to their members and to  the\r\n\r\ntripartite partners?  Really, the fundamental question  is:  how\r\n\r\ncan  trade  unions remain relevant?  To remain  relevant,  trade\r\n\r\nunions  will  have  to add value to workers,  employers  and  to\r\n\r\nsociety at large.  It cannot keep on doing what it used  to  do,\r\n\r\nbut to do what is useful today and in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of any movement depends on the quality of its\r\n\r\nleaders.  We have been fortunate that our unions have thrown  up\r\n\r\ngood leaders.  In the past, unions could draw from more than 90%\r\n\r\nof  the workforce for members, and hence leaders.  In 1970,  84%\r\n\r\nof  all  workers  at best had primary school education.   Today,\r\n\r\nthat  same group of workers with that kind of qualification  has\r\n\r\nshrunk to 39%, which means the rest have better education.  That\r\n\r\nhas been the success story of Singapore.  And drawing from that,\r\n\r\nif  the traditional way in which we think about union membership\r\n\r\nremains  the same, then unions must draw from a poorer  pool  of\r\n\r\nmembers  or  grassroots leaders.  So the difference between  the\r\n\r\npast leaders who still continue today and what we may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndraw on in the future would be the quality.  If we are going  to\r\n\r\nhave  the same balanced relationship that we have had all  these\r\n\r\nyears,   then   we   should  re-examine  the  scope   of   union\r\n\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest worry today, as Mr Cyrille Tan and Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan said, is whether our workers will remain  employed\r\n\r\nthroughout  their active working life.  This is the  second  key\r\n\r\nconcern  mentioned by Mr Cyrille Tan.  Conventional thinking  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  is the duty of the State to educate the young  to  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  their  ability,  until they go  to  work.  Thereafter,\r\n\r\nfurther  education, or upgrading of skills is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  individual, or his employer.  With faster technological\r\n\r\nchange,  is  this still valid?  Each worker now has to  re-learn\r\n\r\nskills  three to five times in his working life.   The  cost  of\r\n\r\nkeeping workers employable with relevant skills throughout their\r\n\r\nworking lives has gone up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Sinnakaruppan mentioned that the Government\r\n\r\nthrough the SDF spent only $47 million in 1996.  That is not the\r\n\r\nfull story.   For every dollar which the SDF funds, another  $10\r\n\r\nis  paid for either by the employer or the individual.   So  our\r\n\r\ntotal  spending  on continuing education and training  today  is\r\n\r\nmore of the order of $400 million to $500 million.  And yet this\r\n\r\nis  not enough.  Therefore, the cost of upgrading the skills  of\r\n\r\nour  workers in the light of the changes around us will be very,\r\n\r\nvery  high.   So this means that we cannot rely on old  thinking\r\n\r\nabout how we deal with continuing education and training.  There\r\n\r\nshould  be  a central agency to plan the manpower needs  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,   coordinate  a  national  infrastructure  for   skills\r\n\r\nupgrading,  and  to devise programmes to support the  individual\r\n\r\nand the employers.  Without this, we will be trapped in the rut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers will say that they do not know what courses to take\r\n\r\nup,  or that they have no time for training, since they have  to\r\n\r\nearn  a living.  On the other hand, the employers will say  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot afford to train if the worker will leave  for  some\r\n\r\nother employer at the end of the training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  this period of uncertainty, there will be a natural tendency\r\n\r\nto  cut  back on spending.  To the employers, I say, \"Don't  cut\r\n\r\nback  on  training.\"  If you do so, you will  be  making  a  big\r\n\r\nmistake.   Of course, you can make training more cost effective,\r\n\r\nbut  we  should  not  stop training and upgrading.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nquality of the workforce that will give you the cutting edge  in\r\n\r\ncompetition.  And one more point: It is not enough to train only\r\n\r\nthe young.  You need to train the not-so-young and also the old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training has to be a national effort, a shared\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   We  need  to  find  more  effective  ways   of\r\n\r\nupgrading and channeling workers from the declining sectors (for\r\n\r\nexample, consumer electronics) to new growth sectors like  wafer\r\n\r\nfabrication.   If  not, Singaporean workers will  become  under-employed  while new growth sectors will be overly  dependent  on\r\n\r\nforeign skilled workers.  This is not desirable.  It is also not\r\n\r\nsustainable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the structural unemployment in Europe. New jobs\r\n\r\nhave been created, but large numbers of workers do not have  the\r\n\r\nskills  that  these  jobs require.  Each government  knows  that\r\n\r\nretraining has to be done, if structural unemployment is  to  be\r\n\r\novercome.   But  money  is scarce.  And  even  the  billions  of\r\n\r\ndollars they squeeze out of tight budgets will make only a small\r\n\r\ndifference.   This is the price they pay for the  past  thinking\r\n\r\nthat  the  upgrading  of  skills is the  responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual  and  the employers.  It is now  a  problem  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and there is just not enough money.  If we take care\r\n\r\nof  the  continuous  retraining of workers now,  whilst  we  can\r\n\r\nafford  it,  then the development of new sectors in our  economy\r\n\r\nwill be successful, because our workers will truly feel that  it\r\n\r\nhas all been done for their benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I welcome the proposal to expand the functions\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of Labour into a Ministry of  Manpower.   When\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  lead  agency to deal with  the  matter,  then  the\r\n\r\nindividual  efforts of different agencies will  move forward  in\r\n\r\nthe right direction.  Workers will know that there is a Ministry\r\n\r\nlooking after the development of our own workers.  It will be  a\r\n\r\nclear focal point.  Continuing education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand training will then be coordinated.  Our workers' skills will\r\n\r\nbe  upgraded  continuously, so they will remain employed  as  we\r\n\r\nbring  in  new  investments.   Otherwise,  some  may  think  the\r\n\r\npolicies  we are putting in place to attract new growth  sectors\r\n\r\nare for the benefit of foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as we move more and more into the knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, we need more knowledge workers.  What is more, we  need\r\n\r\na  critical  mass of skilled workers in a sector before  it  can\r\n\r\ntake off.  So we need foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the financial services sector. If we\r\n\r\nare  to  grow  the business in new financial services,  we  must\r\n\r\nbuild up a critical mass of expertise, with a heavy injection of\r\n\r\nforeign talent.  It is one thing to look at this from the  macro\r\n\r\nview.   What  is  the impact, seen from the perspective  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual  Singaporean?   Let  me  cite  an  example  from  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  services sector.  Just a few days ago,  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nemployees  in  this  sector told me that some Singaporeans  feel\r\n\r\nmarginalised,  or sidelined.  A foreign boss will  recruit  more\r\n\r\nforeigners, and Singaporeans are shut out.  There does not  seem\r\n\r\nto  be a transfer of expertise.  We should expect such problems.\r\n\r\nA critical mass of talent versed in new areas has to be built up\r\n\r\nfrom recruiting foreigners.  The volume of business at the start\r\n\r\nis  not  large,  so  they  do not employ so  many  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do not seem to be given a role.  They have  yet  to\r\n\r\nbe  trained in the skills.  It is only when the business  volume\r\n\r\ngrows  big  enough  that Singaporeans will be brought  into  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.    So  on  the  one  hand,  we  need  to  explain   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  what to expect, and at the same  time  monitor  to\r\n\r\nensure that competent Singaporeans are also given the chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be aware of social problems when large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  foreign  workers from the same source  country  are\r\n\r\nconcentrated in one place.  I am not referring only  to  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad or Serangoon Road, but also in the factories.  They tend to\r\n\r\nstick  together  as  a  social group.  This  leads  to  friction\r\n\r\nbetween foreign workers and Singaporean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers,  in the same factory.  Fortunately, these problems  are\r\n\r\nnot serious so far.  But we should be mindful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the turbulence in the East Asian economies,\r\n\r\nthere  is  some fear among Singaporeans of lay-offs.   Yesterday\r\n\r\nmorning,  as Mr Sinnakaruppan said,  for the first time  one  of\r\n\r\nour  papers  reported, in a long while, that the key concern  of\r\n\r\nour  employees is now job security.  Little wonder.  We read  in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers that over two million Indonesians have lost their\r\n\r\njobs  as a result of the current crisis.  They may be joined  by\r\n\r\nanother   million   whom   Malaysia  intends   to   send   home.\r\n\r\nUnemployment  in  Malaysia  itself  among  Malaysians  is   also\r\n\r\nexpected  to  rise.   There  are already  more  than  a  million\r\n\r\nunemployed  in Thailand.  Another million jobs will be  lost  in\r\n\r\nKorea  through the restructuring required to restore its economy\r\n\r\nback to health.  When our workers read or hear of such problems,\r\n\r\nnaturally they are a little bit worried.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite naturally, employers are concerned about prospects in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  months.  Management will be thinking of  strategies\r\n\r\nfor survival.  How to weather the next year or two and cost will\r\n\r\nhave to be trimmed.  One option is to retrench workers.  We have\r\n\r\nfaced  such  situations  before.  We  have  worked  together  to\r\n\r\novercome  problems.  What is more, we have  also  put  in  place\r\n\r\nsystems which should allow us to face downturns with less  human\r\n\r\ncost.  Companies should thus be better prepared to cope with the\r\n\r\ndownturn.  We did this through the practice of tripartism.   Let\r\n\r\nus not forget that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we put in place, as a result of the last\r\n\r\nrecession?   We wanted a system which should allow employers  to\r\n\r\nreduce wage cost without having to resort to retrenchment  as  a\r\n\r\nfirst  measure.   We  have put in place the  flexi-wage  system.\r\n\r\nWhat is this flexi-wage system?  In the flexi-wage system, there\r\n\r\nare  two  basic  components: the monthly wage and  the  variable\r\n\r\nbonuses.  The variable bonuses should make up about 20%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  annual  wage.   So in a downturn the company  can  reduce\r\n\r\nannual wage cost by up to 20% and still pay their workers the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull monthly wage.  Employers should therefore trim wage cost by\r\n\r\nreducing  the  variable bonus before they consider retrenchment.\r\n\r\nWe  put in place a flexi-wage system, not a flexi-worker system,\r\n\r\nto  allow companies to cope with downturns.  It is cut wage cost\r\n\r\nfirst,  not  cut workers first.  Unions accept that retrenchment\r\n\r\nis   a  management  prerogative.   But  if  after  working  with\r\n\r\nemployers to implement the flexi-wage system, employers  do  not\r\n\r\nuse it, but resort to retrenchment when the company shows losses\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  time in one quarter, it will  not  be  fair  to\r\n\r\nworkers and the unions who represent them.  If in making use  of\r\n\r\nthe  flexi-wage system and other cost cutting measures are still\r\n\r\nnot  enough, then we can accept retrenchment to keep the company\r\n\r\nviable  and to save jobs.  So I urge all employers not to resort\r\n\r\nto  retrenchment at the first sign of trouble.  If  we  have  to\r\n\r\naccept retrenchment, who goes first?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is popular to say that in a downturn, the foreigners\r\n\r\nshould be retrenched first.  But when a company has to retrench,\r\n\r\nit  should retain the best team, to be competitive.  So when  it\r\n\r\ncomes to deciding who should go, we should adopt the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two persons, the one who is clearly better than the\r\n\r\nother  stays while the weaker one is retrenched.  If the  better\r\n\r\nworker  is a foreigner, the Singaporean is retrenched.   If  the\r\n\r\nbetter worker is Singaporean, then the foreign worker goes.   If\r\n\r\nboth  are  equally  good,  then the Singaporean  stays  and  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker goes.  This is a sound basis to protect the  jobs\r\n\r\nremaining.  Most of these jobs will be held by Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchment, we hope, will be a short term problem. The\r\n\r\nwell-being of our workers depends on our ability to attract  new\r\n\r\ninvestments.  It has to be knowledge intensive, and high  value-added  investments.  We have to be more productive  to  overcome\r\n\r\nour  lack  of  a  large  domestic market  and  lack  of  natural\r\n\r\nresources.   That  is  why closer cooperation  among  the  three\r\n\r\nsocial  partners  will be more important.  Our past  success  in\r\n\r\nattracting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestments  is  not  something we can take  for  granted.   The\r\n\r\ncompetition  today is much more intense than it has  ever  been.\r\n\r\nWe   are  competing  with  developed  countries  for  high   end\r\n\r\ninvestments.  We have to make Singapore a profitable place to do\r\n\r\nbusiness  despite our lack of a large domestic  market  and  our\r\n\r\nlack of natural resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a valued partner of employers, our unions must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  do what they have done well in the  past:  working\r\n\r\nwith  employers  to  foster  a harmonious  industrial  relations\r\n\r\nclimate,  and ensuring that the labour  market remains  flexible\r\n\r\nand workers employable, as my colleagues have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining a flexible labour market means the critical re-examination of hard-won terms of employment. We cannot assume\r\n\r\nthat what we put in place in the past are still right today.  We\r\n\r\ncannot assume that they have not become rigidities that make our\r\n\r\nlabour  market less flexible than other economies.  It will  not\r\n\r\nbe  easy to discard these hard-won terms of employment.  Some of\r\n\r\nthese may have been regarded in the past as essential to prevent\r\n\r\nemployers  from exploiting workers.  So how can  such  terms  be\r\n\r\nvaried  or modified without allowing abuse?  That is a  question\r\n\r\ntogether we must address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions can also add value to employers through\r\n\r\nhelping  to implement programmes to raise productivity -  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading,  promotion  of  Quality  Circles,  setting  up  Total\r\n\r\nQuality  Management Programmes, 5S programmes,  and  suggestions\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do this, we will not be the only union movement\r\n\r\nwhich  helps management, although conventional wisdom may  think\r\n\r\notherwise.  Toyota, for example, acknowledged in the 1980s  that\r\n\r\nit  was  union  support that helped them to  develop  what  they\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Toyota Production System, a highly regarded  system\r\n\r\nwhich  other  car  manufacturers wanted to also  put  in  place.\r\n\r\nToyota  knows  that  it is through the years  of  close  working\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  management and unions  and  workers  that\r\n\r\nmakes the system possible.  So it is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neasy for any other company to replicate.  So Toyota welcomes  GM\r\n\r\nand  the like to look at their system.  This shows how at  least\r\n\r\nin one company, management regards cooperation with the union as\r\n\r\na critical factor for success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our present circumstances, union support for\r\n\r\nmanagement is most important today in the area of reducing  unit\r\n\r\ncosts,  to  enhance  competitiveness and then  it  will  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference to how well we weather the storm ahead.  The NTUC and\r\n\r\nthe  unions aim to be a valued partner of employers.   When  the\r\n\r\ncompanies are profitable, then jobs are secure, and the  economy\r\n\r\nas a whole benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what other ways can unions add value to society? In the\r\n\r\npast  30  years, the labour movement had embarked on  two  major\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   The  first is the development of  the  cooperative\r\n\r\nmovement,   which  has  benefited  consumers,   especially   the\r\n\r\nconsumers  from  the working class.  The second is  in  bringing\r\n\r\nsocial  and recreational facilities previously enjoyed  only  by\r\n\r\nthe higher income within the means of the lower income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, there are two areas where our unions\r\n\r\ncan   play  a  social  role.   The  first  concerns  the   aging\r\n\r\npopulation.   This will create new needs, such as the  care  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly.   With smaller families and nuclear families,  the\r\n\r\nlower  income will require help most, because both  husband  and\r\n\r\nwife  have got to go to work.  Such assistance will fall outside\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  volunteer  welfare  organisations.   The  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  can,  and should, play a part, with support  from  the\r\n\r\nother two social partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is the effects of globalisation.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation  means  that  the  labour  market   becomes   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive, indeed a global one.  High end wages will be set by\r\n\r\nthe  world-wide shortage of such talent, whilst the  low-skilled\r\n\r\nwages  will  be  depressed by the overwhelming surplus  of  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  workers.  This widening of the wage  gap  can  create\r\n\r\nsocial  problems.  It can create social tensions.   So  far,  we\r\n\r\navoided those problems.  Why?  Because our education, health and\r\n\r\nhousing policies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  kept the real net gap narrower than if let to pure  market\r\n\r\nforces.   You  take housing - a perennial subject of  debate  in\r\n\r\nthis House.  Our home ownership policy has given each one a roof\r\n\r\nover  their heads, and nine out of 10 own their homes they  live\r\n\r\nin.   We take this for granted now.  But this is one reason  why\r\n\r\nwe  do not have people sleeping on the sidewalks, as the jobless\r\n\r\ndo in the cities of the developed nations.  For Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nhave  been  prudent with their home buying decisions, they  need\r\n\r\nnot fear being turned out into the streets through unemployment.\r\n\r\nYou  see  in the developed countries, a high proportion of  rent\r\n\r\naccommodation.   When they lose their jobs and  cannot  pay  the\r\n\r\nrent,  the  landlord who is from the private sector will  demand\r\n\r\nthe keys back to their apartments.  That is why every winter you\r\n\r\nhave  photographs  of people sleeping on the  sidewalks  in  New\r\n\r\nYork.   We should build on what we have built up so far and  try\r\n\r\r\nto  narrow the wealth gap further.  So, in this, we will have to\r\n\r\nbe  more creative to ensure that the asset enhancement programme\r\n\r\nbenefits the lower income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unions can play a role and add value to society with the\r\n\r\ncontinued  support of employers and Government.  But  will  this\r\n\r\nclose  partnership  built up over the past 20  years  last  -  a\r\n\r\nquestion  which Mr Sinnakaruppan asked.  Will it grow  stronger?\r\n\r\nThis will depend on what each of the social partners does.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partnership between the NTUC and the PAP Government is\r\n\r\nbuilt on personal relationships, on trust, on shared beliefs and\r\n\r\nshared goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at each general election, there is leadership\r\n\r\nrenewal  in the PAP Government.  We also have leadership renewal\r\n\r\nin    the   unions   through   periodic   elections.    Personal\r\n\r\nrelationships cannot be handed from one generation  to  another.\r\n\r\nIt  has to be forged anew by the successors.  Therefore, to keep\r\n\r\ntripartism  strong,  the interaction among leaders  of  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the NTUC and the unions has to be  managed.   It\r\n\r\ntakes  time  for  trust to develop.  Therefore, we  welcome  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's suggestion on Sunday that joint  seminars  for\r\n\r\nthe PAP be held with the NTUC.  It is as much an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity for the PAP to better understand the workers  as  it\r\n\r\nis  for  union  leaders to influence PAP leaders  who  form  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   so   that  national  policies  remain   pro-worker.\r\n\r\nStrengthen  the  links, and we can be assured that  the  working\r\n\r\nrelationship,  which has been one of our unique strengths  as  a\r\n\r\ncountry, will continue well into the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, quite clearly the key concern of everyone is how\r\n\r\nsoon  the  current  economic problems  in  the  region  will  be\r\n\r\nresolved.  These problems are external but they affect  us.   To\r\n\r\nsolve this problem, international cooperation is critical.   Let\r\n\r\nus  hope  that there will be close cooperation and the  will  to\r\n\r\naccept the remedies however painful they may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response internally, in our country, must be to follow\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have done before.  We have weathered different  crises\r\n\r\nbefore, through everyone pulling together.  We overcame the 1985-86  recession  through  the practice of tripartite  cooperation.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to reinforce this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, let me\r\n\r\nfirst  state  that  I have been a member of the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil for two years.  The NWC is one of the key instruments of\r\n\r\ntripartism in Singapore and I have therefore had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto observe the workings of tripartite partnership at first hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make four points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make is that I agree that\r\n\r\ntripartism has been a key competitive advantage.  It is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  main  socio-economic institutions that has  contributed  to\r\n\r\npeaceful industrial relationship in Singapore and has helped  to\r\n\r\nachieve  labour  market reforms in order to lower  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business  and  increase  productivity.   This  tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership  has served Singapore well in three  respects.   The\r\n\r\ngood  industrial relations that we have had in Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\njust be attributed to our labour laws alone which permit workers\r\n\r\nto  strike only after recourse to arbitration.  Rather it is due\r\n\r\nto the meeting of minds of unions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness   and   Government  representatives,   achieved   after\r\n\r\nconsiderable  discussions and negotiations.  This  tradition  of\r\n\r\ndialogue  is now well established in Singapore.  Its  anchor  is\r\n\r\nthe  NWC  which meets intensively for several months  each  year\r\n\r\nprincipally  to negotiate wage increases.  In its  25  years  of\r\n\r\nexistence, the NWC has indeed contributed significantly  towards\r\n\r\npeaceful industrial relations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, during the 1985-86 recession, the most important\r\n\r\npolicy  change  that turned the economy around was  the  one-off\r\n\r\nreduction  in total labour cost when employers' contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  was  cut from 25% to 10%, reducing total  labour  cost\r\n\r\novernight  by 12%.  Without the push from the labour unions  and\r\n\r\nGovernment, this would not have occurred peacefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, NTUC and tripartism have also been instrumental in\r\n\r\nencouraging labour market reforms, such as the switch from fixed\r\n\r\nto  flexible wages that Minister Lim Boon Heng mentioned, and in\r\n\r\nraising the retirement age from 60 to 62.  It is often difficult\r\n\r\nto  change  established practices.  But tripartism  has  enabled\r\n\r\nthese adaptations to be made to the Singapore labour system  for\r\n\r\nthe good of workers and employers alike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to make is that Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge  in  the  future will  increasingly  entail  a\r\n\r\ngreater  dependence  not  on  the  hardware,  such  as  physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure but on the software.  This includes an innovative\r\n\r\nculture, quick response time and continued flexibility to  adapt\r\n\r\nto  rapidly  changing circumstances.  All these attributes  have\r\n\r\none  denominator - the ability to bring about change in society.\r\n\r\nThe  speed  of change is crucially dependent on the organisation\r\n\r\nof  that  particular  society and in particular  on  its  socio-political institutions.  That society which is organised in such\r\n\r\na  way  that  desired changes can be brought about  rapidly  and\r\n\r\npeacefully  will  be  that society that can survive  shocks  and\r\n\r\nadapt, even ride on trends in the external environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to outline some of the forces which are\r\n\r\nrelevant to the labour market and how tripartism as a key labour\r\n\r\nmarket  institution  can  help us  to  successfully  meet  these\r\n\r\nchallenges  head-on.   The cutting edge  issues  in  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  have  to do with responding to three key trends  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  today  - technological change, globalisation  and  aging.\r\n\r\nTechnological  change  and  globalisation  both  accelerate  the\r\n\r\nobsolescence  of  skills  and  make  re-training  essential  for\r\n\r\ncontinued  productivity.  An aging society has to  consider  the\r\n\r\ninstitutional  arrangements for health care  and  employment  of\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  These two have already been elaborated  by  the\r\n\r\nunion speakers before me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In labour-short Singapore, we have yet to attain that\r\n\r\nbalance  of encouraging women to work on the one hand, while  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time enabling them to continue to look after not  just\r\n\r\nchildren  but  also  aged  parents on the  other.   Also,  since\r\n\r\nforeign  work  permit  holders constitute  a  not  insignificant\r\n\r\nproportion  of  our workforce, we need to think of  how  we  can\r\n\r\nincrease  the productivity of foreign work permit holders.   The\r\n\r\nsolutions  to  these  issues are not easy because  they  involve\r\n\r\nchanges to established norms and practices. They will take time,\r\n\r\ndetermination and much effort.  Government cannot  handle  these\r\n\r\nissues  alone, nor can business, nor can unions.  They are  best\r\n\r\nhandled  and discussed, implemented in the tripartite framework.\r\n\r\nThe  benefit of tripartism is that it forges a common vision and\r\n\r\na  common determination to implement change for the common good.\r\n\r\nI  therefore agree that there is a need to strengthen tripartism\r\n\r\nto meet the challenge of change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to make is to raise a proposal\r\n\r\nas  to how tripartism can be strengthened.  At present, the main\r\n\r\ninstrument of tripartism is the National Wages Council.  The NWC\r\n\r\nwas  established in 1972 with the objective of recommending wage\r\n\r\nincreases.   Over  the years, it has shifted  from  recommending\r\n\r\nquantitative wage guidelines to qualitative wage guidelines.  It\r\n\r\nhas  also  been  active in encouraging other aspects  of  labour\r\n\r\nmarket reform, such as the flexible wage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem,  and there has been discussion on co-payment  of  health\r\n\r\ncare  cost  and increasing the female labour force participation\r\n\r\nrate.  In the light of the labour issues which have come to  the\r\n\r\nforefront and the need to raise tripartism to a higher plane,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to propose that the mandate of the NWC be  broadened\r\n\r\nto  include a regular discussion and recommendation on  manpower\r\n\r\nissues,  such  as  skills  retraining,  health  care  financing,\r\n\r\nworking mothers and foreign worker productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is limited discussion within the NWC on\r\n\r\nthese  issues as the predominant topic is wages.  What  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  is an enlargement of the agenda  of  the  NWC  to\r\n\r\ninclude  manpower  issues  as well as wage  negotiations.   This\r\n\r\nwould  amount to a formalisation of the existing system  of  the\r\n\r\nNWC  supplemented by ad-hoc tripartite committees.  In order  to\r\n\r\nreflect its enlarged mandate, the Council could be renamed,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Tripartite Advisory Council  on  Manpower.   This\r\n\r\nCouncil  could  be  a body which the proposed  new  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower could tap for advice and recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point I would like to make is to reflect on the\r\n\r\nAsian  currency  crisis and its implications for  Singapore  and\r\n\r\ntripartism.  The Asian currency crisis has come as a  tremendous\r\n\r\nshock  to us in Asia because of its magnitude and the suddenness\r\n\r\nof  the  contagion  effect.  It reminds us of how  volatile  the\r\n\r\ninternational economic environment can be.  And that  no  matter\r\n\r\nhow  strong  a  country's economic fundamentals, interdependence\r\n\r\nmeans  transmission of this volatility.  It is in these volatile\r\n\r\nand  uncertain times that the strength of a country's social and\r\n\r\npolitical institution is tested.  The ability to rally a country\r\n\r\nin  times  of  crisis  is  primarily a  task  of  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership.  But that task is made easier if there were  already\r\n\r\nin  place mechanisms to achieve that common mindset to take  the\r\n\r\npain  and bite the bullet.  This is where the consensus building\r\n\r\npractice  of  tripartism has a significant role  to  play.   The\r\n\r\ntripartite  partnership, built up carefully over  the  years  in\r\n\r\ngood times, is there when you need it in bad times.  I therefore\r\n\r\nsee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntripartism  not  merely  in economic  terms,  not  merely  as  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive advantage.  I believe it goes beyond economics.   It\r\n\r\nis  an institution that contributes to the very fabric of socio-political stability in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that the Asian currency crisis has added an\r\n\r\nurgency  to  the task of productivity enhancement in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nRight now, we are affected by the crunch in regional demand  and\r\n\r\nliquidity.  However, it is during the recovery phase and  beyond\r\n\r\nwhen  the  affected  countries are on their  way  out  of  their\r\n\r\npresent  troubles  that  there will  be  a  stronger  effect  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitiveness.  We should therefore strengthen the\r\n\r\ntripartite  partnership  now  in  order  to  implement   further\r\n\r\nproductivity  enhancing  and  other  labour  market  reforms  in\r\n\r\npreparation for a more competitive future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I am optimistic about Singapore's future in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of the currency crisis not only because of our strong\r\n\r\neconomic  fundamentals but also because of strong socio-economic\r\n\r\ninstitutions, such as tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I also believe in\r\n\r\ntripartism  partnership  among  the  Government,  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers.   But tripartism to me must be real.  As I  see  it  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today,  tripartism  seems  to  be  dominated  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or the PAP.  We have a Minister who heads the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement and, as I look through the NTUC magazine, I notice that\r\n\r\nalmost  all or every one of the unions is headed by an MP  or  a\r\n\r\nMinister.   As an outsider who looks at the situation today,  it\r\n\r\nwould appear that the labour movement is controlled by the  PAP.\r\n\r\nTherefore, under these circumstances, I do not think that  there\r\n\r\nis  true  tripartism.  I hope that the NTUC can  be  given  more\r\n\r\nindependence, let it mature and let it have more leaders  coming\r\n\r\nfrom  the  ranks.   This in the long term would serve  Singapore\r\n\r\nwell  because if we have patriotic, honest, good and true  union\r\n\r\nleaders, the workers will surely follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, or at least the average Singaporeans seem to\r\n\r\nsee  it,  the NTUC seems to be more interested in doing business\r\n\r\nrather than taking care of the workers.  The NTUC leaders appear\r\n\r\nto  be entrepreneurs rather than union leaders.  So I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  union leaders are not too interested in the business aspect\r\n\r\nof NTUC but concentrate more on the interest of the workers.  An\r\n\r\nimportant  area  in  which the NTUC can do  is  to  improve  the\r\n\r\neducational  level of the workers.  The Minister has  said  just\r\n\r\nnow  that  the  education of the workers has  improved.   Twenty\r\n\r\nyears  ago, 84% of the workers had either primary or lower  than\r\n\r\nprimary  school  education. Today,  the  figure  is  about  39%.\r\n\r\nProbably, this is due to the fact that 89% comprises all the old\r\n\r\nworkers and they are just dropping out of the labour force,  and\r\n\r\nnot through the efforts of NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read the latest copy of the NTUC News, it says that,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  74%  of  Singapore's workforce in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector  are semi-skilled or unskilled and 43% of the workers  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  secondary education.  This does not  augur  well  for\r\n\r\nSingapore to go into the 21st century where technology,  as  you\r\n\r\nhave  heard many speakers say, would be advancing by  leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds.   Unless you have a basic secondary education,  how  are\r\n\r\nyou going to learn all these new skills?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign workers, apparently 93% of them are\r\n\r\nunskilled,  as  expected.  I do not think the foreign  countries\r\n\r\nwould be sending their skilled workers to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real big task of the NTUC is to improve the skills and\r\n\r\neducation of the workers and this is not an easy task.  This  is\r\n\r\nin  fact  a  tremendous task and is going to cost,  as  we  have\r\n\r\nheard,  about $400-$500 million.  So every possible help  should\r\n\r\nbe  given  to Singaporeans, ie, parents, young Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nworkers,  to  improve their skills.  This is a priority  of  the\r\n\r\nNTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other priority would be to improve the\r\n\r\nattitude of the workers, ie, to motivate them, to want  them  to\r\n\r\nwork and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  learn new skills.  I think these are the twin tasks of NTUC.\r\n\r\nOne, train and improve their skills.  Two, motivate the workers,\r\n\r\nchange their attitude and make them willing workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make a few suggestions as to how this can be done? I\r\n\r\nknow  the  NTUC  has suggested that the ceiling  of  the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Levy  be raised from $1,000 to $1,500,  to  collect\r\n\r\nmore  money  from the companies to train workers.  That  is  one\r\n\r\nway.   May I suggest other ways?  The NTUC should look  into  an\r\n\r\napprenticeship scheme to improve the skills of the  workers,  to\r\n\r\nmake  them skilled and semi-skilled workers, and not only  that,\r\n\r\nperhaps  also to craftsmen.  They should try to find a way  from\r\n\r\nthe   many  precedents  in  other  parts  of  the  world   where\r\n\r\napprenticeship  schemes  are  successful.   We  should  try   to\r\n\r\nimplement one in Singapore which suits our condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we should scrap early streaming in\r\n\r\nour schools.  This is not a good thing educationally, especially\r\n\r\nin  terms of motivating our future workers when these kids leave\r\n\r\nschool  to  enter  the workforce.  We should give  the  workers'\r\n\r\nchildren  an  equal chance in education.  In fact, I  have  been\r\n\r\nsuggesting for many years that we should build libraries in  all\r\n\r\nHDB  precincts.  As books are expensive, the children of workers\r\n\r\nare  not  exposed  to books, so they do not  have  a  chance  of\r\n\r\nlearning  the reading habit early.  So if the workers'  children\r\n\r\nare  taught to read from young, we will definitely get a  better\r\n\r\neducated workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is perhaps the HDB could help. I have\r\n\r\ntravelled to many countries and in fact, training is done not by\r\n\r\nthe  government  but by the private enterprise.   In  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  they have one advantage and that is they have  cheap\r\n\r\nrents.   Anyone who has the skill and wants to teach  it  for  a\r\n\r\nliving, he could do so because he could easily rent the premises\r\n\r\nto do it.  But in the Singapore context, rents are very high and\r\n\r\nso  small  institutions or schools cannot be started because  of\r\n\r\nthe  high  rents.  If HDB could give facilities to  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  have  some skills and who want to teach, we should  try  to\r\n\r\ncharge them at a lower rent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause,  in law, education is in fact considered to be charity.\r\n\r\nSo people who want to impart their skills to others, in fact, it\r\n\r\nis  a  charitable act and this cannot be clamoured for by  other\r\n\r\nprofessions or trade unless they can be proven to be a  charity,\r\n\r\njust  like HDB has already made a precedent by giving space  for\r\n\r\nchildcare  and  kindergarten centres operated by some  religious\r\n\r\nbodies.   They  should  also do that by giving  space  to  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who would like to teach some skills to workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the apprenticeship scheme, in fact, for many\r\n\r\ncenturies already, Europe has built up an apprenticeship scheme,\r\n\r\nin  particular  Germany has a very modern one.  Germany,  as  we\r\n\r\nknow,  has  very  skilful workers.  In fact,  their  engineering\r\n\r\nskills  are  the best in the world.  So perhaps, we  could  also\r\n\r\nlook  into this.  And England, of course, has a law to  regulate\r\n\r\napprentices.  Perhaps, we could look into all these  schemes  in\r\n\r\nthe  other countries.  In fact, in Italy, they are very good  in\r\n\r\nthe   crafts   and  skills.   They  also  have   a   very   good\r\n\r\napprenticeship  scheme  in regard to  handicraft.   I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould also look into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educationally, telling a child that he is a dud, a failure\r\n\r\nand that he cannot make it at an early age will in fact ruin the\r\n\r\nchild  for  the  rest of his life.  This is  probably  why  BERI\r\n\r\nreported  that the attitude of workers in Singapore is not  very\r\n\r\ngood.   From very young, we have already put them in a frame  of\r\n\r\nmind  that they cannot fit into society and thereafter, in fact,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot fit into society, even if you really want  to  give\r\n\r\nthem all the opportunities because it has already been implanted\r\n\r\nin  their minds. So how can they have the right attitude towards\r\n\r\nwork?  How can they be motivated?  I think the NTUC should  look\r\n\r\ninto  this area with the Ministry of Education.  There  must  be\r\n\r\nother  ways  of  educating our young, rather than  resorting  to\r\n\r\nstreaming  at  a  very early age.  I think  streaming  has  been\r\n\r\ndelayed from the third year to the fourth year.  But it is still\r\n\r\ntoo early educationally to stream a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is not willing to pay money to build\r\n\r\nlibraries  in  HDB precincts, I think they can get  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to do it.  If the private sector would like to cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government in building more libraries, I  think  this\r\n\r\nshould  be welcomed.  Again, I hope the NTUC will push for  this\r\n\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards educational facilities to be built in HDB\r\n\r\npremises, again, I think this should be looked into seriously by\r\n\r\nthe NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make a last comment? I heard from the Minister that\r\n\r\nif  we  do  have  a depression and workers are retrenched,  when\r\n\r\nthere is a skilful foreign worker and a Singaporean who has  got\r\n\r\nno skill, the Singaporean will go first.  From the point of view\r\n\r\nof  business, of course, this is right.  But from the  point  of\r\n\r\nview  of  leaders of a country, I  wonder whether we  should  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  it.  I have, in fact, made a comment  that  if\r\n\r\nthis  were true, I think it could easily lead to abuse.  Because\r\n\r\nI  have  already  heard of cases where companies  have  employed\r\n\r\nunskilled foreign workers and used our SDF funds or some kind of\r\n\r\nfunds  to train them.  In the particular case, I heard that  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  were trained to be crane operators,  and  they\r\n\r\nbecame  skilled  crane operators.  In fact,  instead  of  hiring\r\n\r\nSingaporean crane operators, they hired foreign crane operators,\r\n\r\nbecause  they were cheaper.   So if the Government were to  make\r\n\r\nknown that skilled foreign workers would be maintained and  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would be retrenched first, I am  afraid  companies\r\n\r\nwould start to train more and more foreign workers, so that they\r\n\r\ncan be retained at a cheaper rate when retrenchment comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Just  now,  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  said that many of the advisers of NTUC affiliated  unions\r\n\r\nare  controlled  by  PAP  MPs.  Maybe  Mr  Chiam  has  not  paid\r\n\r\nattention  to the development of trade unions in Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in the past few decades, a lot of union leaders want  MPs\r\n\r\nto  be  their advisers.  For example, for a new Member like  me,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  work  with the unions we get to know the feelings  and\r\n\r\nsentiments  of the workers and issues which concern  them  most.\r\n\r\nWe  can  bring  them  up  on their behalf with  the  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned and get things solved.  Similarly, because of the MPs'\r\n\r\nadvice and guidance, the unions are better operationally and the\r\n\r\nworkers get more benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam said that the NTUC has been doing too\r\n\r\nmany things.  We have been doing many things and more has to  be\r\n\r\ndone.   The  Secretary-General has already mentioned  about  the\r\n\r\ntraining  and retraining of workers, and we have discussed  this\r\n\r\nboth  in  and outside Parliament.  Maybe Mr Chiam has  not  paid\r\n\r\nattention  to this.  He does not quite understand  what  is  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of tripartite relations.  The Member for MacPherson,  Mr\r\n\r\nMatthias  Yao,  has described the working of  tripartism  and  I\r\n\r\nshall quote him.  He says, \"In the tripartite relationship, NTUC\r\n\r\ntakes  care  of  the workers' interest as well as  that  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement.   The management looks after their own  interest  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the national interest.  And the Government is concerned\r\n\r\nnot  only  with national interest but also the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers as well.\"  This is what we mean by tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give him another example. In 1967, when we were\r\n\r\nbusy  preparing  for the Lunar New Year, a few  thousand  public\r\n\r\ndaily-rated cleansing workers went on strike in response to  the\r\n\r\nunion's  call.  They were protesting against the Government  for\r\n\r\nnot adjusting their pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  claims.   Subsequently, the leaders of the  illegal  strike\r\n\r\nwere   arrested.   These  illegal  strikes  caused  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the people of Singapore.  The streets and  side\r\n\r\nlanes  were  full of filth and rubbish. Families without  modern\r\n\r\nsanitation had to clear their own night-soil buckets.  Today, 30\r\n\r\nyears  later, 100 workers who are engaged in cleansing work  and\r\n\r\nenvironment  protection have been selected as model workers  and\r\n\r\nthey  have received awards from the Prime Minister, Mr Goh  Chok\r\n\r\nTong.  They flew to Perth for a holiday.  I do not know how many\r\n\r\nof  these  100 people took part in this illegal strike 30  years\r\n\r\nago.   But to everyone of them, this is not only affirmation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  recognition of their contribution  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  garden  city,  it  is  also  affirmation  of   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  for  their work performance.  It is also  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion's recognition of their contribution.  One worker said that\r\n\r\nhe  can  never  imagine  receiving  the  award  from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   He has never thought of travelling to Australia  and\r\n\r\nthis is the first time he has travelled by air.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this example clearly shows that 30 years ago there was\r\n\r\nconfrontation between labour and management, but since  we  have\r\n\r\ntripartism, Singapore has turned from a filthy and chaotic  city\r\n\r\ninto a beautiful garden city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of Mr Cyrille Tan.\r\n\r\nThis  motion  reminds  us  that true tripartism  is  not  easily\r\n\r\nachieved.  It is worth our preserving it.  In the midst  of  the\r\n\r\nregional  currency  crisis and when we  are  entering  the  next\r\n\r\ncentury  facing keener competition, this is even more important.\r\n\r\nAs  a matter of fact, tripartism is a model that has been looked\r\n\r\nupon  as a point of reference by unions of other countries,  eg,\r\n\r\nbefore becoming Prime Minister of Britain, Mr Tony Blair came to\r\n\r\nSingapore to look at our model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for tripartism to succeed, we need a good\r\n\r\nGovernment,  an enlightened management, and responsible  unions.\r\n\r\nThere  must  also  be a commonality of purpose among  the  three\r\n\r\nparties.   The  trade  unions look after  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  by   giving them training, retraining and upgrading  to\r\n\r\nimprove their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality of life and this is consistent with the objective of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the self renewal of PAP MPs and leadership changes in\r\n\r\nthe  unions  and  industries,  it is  timely  to  reiterate  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of tripartism and further strengthen and consolidate\r\n\r\nthe spirit of tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give you another example to show that\r\n\r\ntripartism benefits everybody and that the trade union  movement\r\n\r\nwill  give  added value to society.  For example, to  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  shortage of bus drivers and to improve productivity\r\n\r\nand  save  cost, the bus companies implemented the  OMO  system,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  that the conductor's job has become redundant  and\r\n\r\ntaken   over  by  the  driver.   Without  the  cooperation   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the National Transport Workers Union,  it  will\r\n\r\nbe  difficult  to  implement this system.  The drivers  accepted\r\n\r\nretraining and the challenge.  They not only drive but they also\r\n\r\nenlarge  their  job  to cover the work of conductors.  They  now\r\n\r\ndrive longer buses, double-decker buses and as a result they get\r\n\r\nbetter  pay.   Both the passengers and bus companies  have  also\r\n\r\nbenefited.   The  bus  companies could contain  the  cost  while\r\n\r\npassengers enjoy the bus fares at an affordable level.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nwe  go to London and board a double deck bus, we can still  find\r\n\r\nconductors.   I  believe we can then really appreciate  our  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers for their increased productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will soon be in the Year of the Tiger. Tiger Year is a\r\n\r\ntougher year.  The regional monetary crisis has caused people to\r\n\r\nworry  about their job security, their income and in this period\r\n\r\nof  hardship, it is time for tripartism to give more play to its\r\n\r\nfunctions.  We have gone through the difficult period of the 70s\r\n\r\nand  the 80s.  We are confident that we can also go through this\r\n\r\ndifficult period in the 1990s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  be  exempted  from  this  day's  sitting  from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRIPARTITE PARTNERSHIP IN SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I support the\r\n\r\nmotion tabled by NMP Mr Cyrille Tan.  Please let me first of all\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the views of the Opposition Member,  Mr  Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong,  by  referring to a small incident at the meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nInternational Labour Organisation for the Asian region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this meeting, Singapore labour movement's representative\r\n\r\nat  the  tripartite meeting spoke on how NTUC and the  Singapore\r\n\r\ntrade unions have developed human resources through training and\r\n\r\nretraining  programmes for our workers. The report includes  the\r\n\r\nSkills   Redevelopment  Programme  initiated  by  the  NTUC   in\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with the employers and funded by the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  report  also touched on other areas of cooperation  in  the\r\n\r\ntripartite  partnership,  ie, the  workers,  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  report also drew attention of  the  ILO  when\r\n\r\nSingapore was named specially in this session report.  Normally,\r\n\r\nthe   session  report  of  ILO  will  be  more  general  without\r\n\r\nmentioning any country which had addressed the meeting. Why  was\r\n\r\nthis  so?   This  was  because ILO,  as  a  world  organisation,\r\n\r\ninvolving three parties, has an objective to develop cooperation\r\n\r\namong  the  three parties so that it will be beneficial  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in most other countries, tripartism is\r\n\r\nonly  a  wish  or  a  dream because the  parties  are  still  in\r\n\r\nconflict.   Therefore, the ILO often hopes that  all  the  three\r\n\r\nparties,  especially in the developing countries,  are  able  to\r\n\r\nwork  together.   In such a situation, I found that  the  speech\r\n\r\nmade  by  Mr Chiam is wayward and my colleagues in the NTUC  who\r\n\r\nhad  delivered their speeches earlier had already shown how  the\r\n\r\nNTUC  wants  to  add value for the employers and  also  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  so that this benefit from the value-added aspect may  be\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by the workers and the people.  But to carry  out  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  NTUC  has to appeal to the  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to make more contribution towards such an effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the interest of the Singapore workers which has\r\n\r\nbeen neglected now as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompared  to the period when there was no cooperation among  the\r\n\r\ntripartite partners?  Will Singapore be more capable to face the\r\n\r\npossible  economic crisis in Southeast Asia?   It  is  predicted\r\n\r\nthat there will be many incidents of riots in many countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  Asian region.  Are we able to face these problems if  there\r\n\r\nis  no cooperation among the NTUC and the Government led by  the\r\n\r\nPAP  and the employers?  On the other hand, contrary to what  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  said that the NTUC is dominated by the PAP, the  workers,\r\n\r\nthrough NTUC, have a voice in the Cabinet because its leader  is\r\n\r\na  member  of  the Cabinet.  Our workers also have  a  voice  in\r\n\r\nParliament  because its leader is a Members of Parliament.   The\r\n\r\nbenefits are many and obvious in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go back to the ILO meeting. In my opinion,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  successful experience in achieving this cooperation\r\n\r\nof tripartism as shown at the ILO meeting, lies in many benefits\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the workers, the employers and the Government.  We in\r\n\r\nSingapore are aware that the training programme, which  we  hope\r\n\r\nwill  become  a national programme, is not the only evidence  of\r\n\r\nthe beneficial cooperation enjoyed by the workers, the employers\r\n\r\nand  the Government.  My colleagues who have spoken earlier have\r\n\r\nalready  shown  how  the  partnership  has  helped  to  maintain\r\n\r\npeaceful  labour  relations, greater growth and a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nprogress  which the people have enjoyed.  For many countries  in\r\n\r\nthis world, the tripartite relationship is only a wish, if not a\r\n\r\ndream.  The challenge now is how the three partners are able  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen this partnership to meet the greater challenge of the\r\n\r\nfuture, especially in the short term, to meet the economic,  and\r\n\r\nin the long term, to meet the challenge of world globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short term, the economic crisis which has come\r\n\r\nabout  here  because of the economic crisis and slow  growth,  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   employers  and  the  Government   will   give   due\r\n\r\nconsideration to the interest of the workers.  I admit  that  in\r\n\r\nthis  economic situation there are many firms which will  reduce\r\n\r\nthe number of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers.   They  will  downsize their manpower  and  restructure\r\n\r\ntheir  operations.  As a result, many workers  will  lose  their\r\n\r\njobs.   For  this group, I hope the employers and the Government\r\n\r\nwill  work together with the unions to reduce the plight of  the\r\n\r\nworkers who will be suffering from the loss of jobs, by offering\r\n\r\nthem  alternative jobs and to find a way to avoid  retrenchment.\r\n\r\nThe  unions have been working together with some firms to assist\r\n\r\nworkers,  who  have  lost  their  jobs  recently,  to  take   up\r\n\r\nalternative jobs.  In future, when more workers lose their jobs,\r\n\r\nit is better for us to resolve this matter collectively with the\r\n\r\nunions, employers and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective way to face this global economic crisis\r\n\r\nand the keen competition in most countries, including Singapore,\r\n\r\nis  to  expand training and retraining opportunities, especially\r\n\r\nfor  those who are low-skilled workers.  Otherwise, most of  the\r\n\r\n700,000  workers who possess only Secondary 2 education will  be\r\n\r\nredundant  or  they will be displaced by their  company  or  the\r\n\r\neconomy  in  future.   For that reason, NTUC  has  launched  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme and this ought to be granted more\r\n\r\nfunds  by  the  Government,  and  should  be  supported  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers.    In   view  of  the  concern   of   possibly   more\r\n\r\nretrenchments,  we  require  the  tripartite  partners  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  to resolve the issue.  I support the plea made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Boon Heng that the employers should only retrench as a last\r\n\r\nresort  and  not  resort to it simply as a way to  reduce  their\r\n\r\noperations  by  terminating the services of their  workers  whom\r\n\r\nthey do not want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this motion tabled by the NMP, Mr Cyrille Tan,\r\n\r\na labour leader, shows how the NTUC and the labour movement want\r\n\r\nto  increase  their contribution for the benefit of the  workers\r\n\r\nand the community.  Therefore, the essence of this motion tabled\r\n\r\nby  him  and  my  colleague  is how  to  enhance  the  value  of\r\n\r\ncontribution to the members, the employers, and the community in\r\n\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC 21 is a long-term programme, consisting of five\r\n\r\nprinciples   which   were  mapped  out  by  the   whole   labour\r\n\r\norganisation.  It is an effort to contribute to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquality of the members and the community in general.  Our labour\r\n\r\nmovement announced details of NTUC 21 recently and I would  like\r\n\r\nto  remind Members about the five principles.  The first  is  to\r\n\r\nenhance  employability  for life for  our  workers;  second,  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen competitiveness through shared responsibility.  And I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  emphasise here that  the  key  word  is  shared\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Third, to build a healthy body, a healthy mind,\r\n\r\nbecause  a worker who aspires to perform well would not be  able\r\n\r\nto  do  it without good health.  Fourth, to care more and  share\r\n\r\nmore  with  the community.  And fifth, to strengthen the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these principles is not only to bring benefit to\r\n\r\nthe members of the unions, but it is also for the benefit of the\r\n\r\nemployers  and  the  community  in  general.   What  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement wishes to achieve is a better quality of life where the\r\n\r\nneeds of every Singaporean are given attention and support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the labour movement pays particular attention to\r\n\r\nthe  interest of Singaporeans generally and likes to  share  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  with others, and this can be achieved more effectively\r\n\r\nif NTUC and the members work together with the leadership of the\r\n\r\nPAP  more  earnestly.   And  on this basis,  our  unions  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  receive support from the social partners  of  this\r\n\r\ntripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC and the Singapore labour movement are the first to\r\n\r\nrespond to resolve the national issues involving the workers and\r\n\r\nthe  community.  Through child care centres, NTUC has helped  to\r\n\r\ncater  to the need for child care while the mothers are at work.\r\n\r\nThrough  NTUC FairPrice, our labour movement helps us to control\r\n\r\nincrease  in  prices  of  the daily necessities.   Through  NTUC\r\n\r\nIncome,  we  attempt  to  provide  insurance  for  our  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially  the low-income group who is not reached out  by  the\r\n\r\nother insurance companies.  Our labour movement also works  fast\r\n\r\nto  encourage more women to return to work.  And now,  realising\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans  have  a long life expectancy  and  that  the\r\n\r\nfamilies require help to take care of the aged and sick parents,\r\n\r\nour labour movement has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformed  a  new cooperative, that is, NTUC Eldercare Cooperative,\r\n\r\nwhich will be of great service to the low-income group.  At  the\r\n\r\nbeginning, NTUC Eldercare will set up a day-care centre for  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  especially those who are sick.  We are aware  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  the need for the care of the elders will be  a  greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility and it will overtake the responsibility of taking\r\n\r\ncare  of  children.  Therefore, to maintain this  centre,  which\r\n\r\nwill  soon  be set up, the cooperative will expand its services,\r\n\r\nfor example, by managing homes for the aged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in Singapore we have a concerned and caring\r\n\r\nlabour  movement.  NTUC and the Singapore trade unions  want  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to society.  Year by year, its members' contribution\r\n\r\nto social work and to the labour movement continues to increase.\r\n\r\nThis  includes services such as home adoption scheme, home visit\r\n\r\nscheme, blood donation and also meals for the needy.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso   plans  to  promote  volunteer  service  and  fund-raising\r\n\r\nprojects  to assist the welfare organisations.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  spirit of voluntarism is flourishing in NTUC and our labour\r\n\r\nmovement.   This is one way for our labor movement  to  increase\r\n\r\nits value to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when we are facing greater difficulty due to\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and economic crisis, our workers and  the  general\r\n\r\npublic  would  need more support.  Employers can  work  together\r\n\r\nwith  the  labour  movement  to promote  social  services  among\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the  general  public,  whether  in  the  form   of\r\n\r\ncooperation  within the companies or in the form  of  tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation at national level.  In this way, we can  extend  the\r\n\r\ncooperation in other areas for the public benefit, and  we  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to build up the people's confidence towards Singapore's\r\n\r\nintegrity.  In difficult times, we need the people's  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  for  our  leadership, so that we  can  preserve  and\r\n\r\nenhance social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at what had happened in South Korea where the\r\n\r\nworkers are often in conflict with their employers, they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  questioning the calibre of the newly elected President, who\r\n\r\nhas  been  elected  but  yet  to be  installed,  and  whom  they\r\n\r\npreviously  supported  during the  general  election.   In  this\r\n\r\nsituation,  the  nature of the labour relations in  South  Korea\r\n\r\nwill continue and certainly it will affect not only the national\r\n\r\ninterest but also the Korean community's interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, there is an anticipation that there will be\r\n\r\na wave of riots and crisis in Asian countries resulting from the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis which we are facing today.  So is it  time  now\r\n\r\nfor  us to discuss whether NTUC is dominated by PAP or not?   Or\r\n\r\nwhether we want to look into the future to step up our effort or\r\n\r\ncooperation between the NTUC and the PAP, not only enhancing the\r\n\r\nrelations  but  also to expand it, with the involvement  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  so  that we will have tripartite partnerships  which\r\n\r\nform a strong basis for Singapore.  In Singapore, a relationship\r\n\r\nbased  on trust should be strengthened, more so during difficult\r\n\r\ntimes,  like  what we are experiencing today.  The thrust  among\r\n\r\nthe  tripartite  partners  could  be  stepped  up  by  renewing,\r\n\r\nintensifying,  and  expanding  the  cooperation  which  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  Singapore's achievements in economic  and  trade\r\n\r\ndevelopment   are   attributable  to  the  joint   efforts   and\r\n\r\ncooperation  among the Government, employers and  trade  unions.\r\n\r\nIn  the  development  of this tripartite  partnership  based  on\r\n\r\npeaceful  co-existence, we have experienced many challenges  and\r\n\r\ndifficulties. Sometimes, we may have some disputes  and  we  may\r\n\r\nnot  fully understand or agree with certain Government policies.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the end of the day, we have always been able to sort\r\n\r\nout   our  differences  through  discussion,  consultation   and\r\n\r\ncompromises.  So,  it  is  correct to say  that  the  tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership's  approach  towards the  common  goal  and  problem\r\n\r\nresolution  is  a very important success factor  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the spirit of solidarity and unity, our unions,\r\n\r\nemployers  and Government have been able to cooperate  and  work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  maintain this long-lasting harmonious partnership.\r\n\r\nThe  resulting economic environment has enhanced the  confidence\r\n\r\nof  local  and  foreign investors. This is  also  the  strongest\r\n\r\nweapon  we  have  in dealing with the current regional  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis. Therefore, I agree with the views of Mr Cyrille Tan  and\r\n\r\nsupport his motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this tripartite partnership, the employers\r\n\r\nare  involved  in  two bilateral relationships.   The  first  is\r\n\r\nbetween  the  employers and the trade unions or  the  employees.\r\n\r\nThe  second is between the employers and the Government.  In the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the employers and the employees,  the  most\r\n\r\nserious  problems  faced by employers are: (1)  high  labour  or\r\n\r\npersonnel  costs, (2) job-hopping, (3) the quality and  training\r\n\r\nof staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three problems are inter-related. If the quality of\r\n\r\nan  employee  is  high,  a  higher pay is  justifiable.  If  the\r\n\r\nturnover  rate  is  high, the incentive for employers  to  train\r\n\r\ntheir workers will naturally be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the largest and most precious asset of\r\n\r\nSingapore is its human resource.  Training is very important  if\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  enhance the value of this asset.   If  the  labour\r\n\r\nturnover rate is too high, businesses will not be able to obtain\r\n\r\na  reasonable  return from their investment in  training.   This\r\n\r\nwill  undoubtedly lower their willingness to put in  efforts  to\r\n\r\ntrain their employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage employers to strengthen the training\r\n\r\nof  employees, the business sector has proposed in the past that\r\n\r\nthe  vesting  of  employer-contributed  CPF  be  linked  to   an\r\n\r\nemployee's  length of service. In other words,  if  an  employee\r\n\r\nleaves  the job before fulfilling the pre-set minimum length  of\r\n\r\nservice,  he  will  not be able to enjoy the whole  of  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  made by the employer during his  employment  with\r\n\r\nthat  employer.  The employee's entitlement should be pegged  to\r\n\r\nthe length of his service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of grasping the information technology\r\n\r\ncannot   be   underestimated.    There   is   no   doubt    that\r\n\r\ncomputerisation  will enhance the productivity  of  a  business.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many small and medium size enterprises still lack  the\r\n\r\nrequired  expertise to use computers and apply  the  information\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Therefore,  I would suggest  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nprovide  a  special fund to encourage employers  to  send  their\r\n\r\nemployees  for related training.  The use of the fund  could  be\r\n\r\nfor direct sponsorship, double tax allowances for employers,  or\r\n\r\ntax deductibility for employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the relationship between the employers and the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the employers face several problems, such  as  many\r\n\r\nregulations  and charges, resulting in ever increasing  business\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively speaking, our Government has a larger hand in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy.  As  a result,  many  Government  measures\r\n\r\ndirectly  affect  the  operating cost of  businesses,  including\r\n\r\npersonnel  cost,  cost of utilities, rentals  of  factories  and\r\n\r\nshops, all kinds of taxes and levies, etc.  Naturally, employers\r\n\r\nkeep  a  close eye on Government policies.  They very much  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Government will also look at the problems they have  to\r\n\r\nface seriously and provide assistance as and when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of personnel costs, I think it is fair to say that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is the largest employer in Singapore.  As  such,\r\n\r\nthe  pay  adjustment in the public sector sets the lead for  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.   Each year, when the civil  servants'  pay  is\r\n\r\nadjusted  upwards and the bonus is generous, the private  sector\r\n\r\nimmediately faces the pressure to follow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the Secretary-General of NTUC, Mr Lim Boon\r\n\r\nHeng, told the workers that they should not expect too much  pay\r\n\r\nrise  and  bonus this year unless productivity is  substantially\r\n\r\nraised.  Such openness and straight talk are much appreciated by\r\n\r\nthe business community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial results of our businesses\r\n\r\nmay  have  yet  to  reflect the impact of the current  financial\r\n\r\nstorm sweeping through this region.  So far, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel  of retrenchment may not have markedly increased.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust  not underestimate the impact this  financial turmoil  will\r\n\r\nhave  on our economy.  Therefore, I would like to appeal to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to appreciate the difficulties faced by the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  and take the lead in adopting austerity  measures  in\r\n\r\nterms of salary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of business cost, I feel that we should seriously\r\n\r\nconsider risk sharing between the Government and the businesses.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that business costs such as energy costs and the\r\n\r\nrental  of  factories,  offices and shops  be  linked  with  the\r\n\r\neconomic  condition.   This way, in times  of  slowing  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  the  Government would be able to flexibly  adjust  such\r\n\r\ncosts more quickly, helping businesses when they need such  help\r\n\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to stress that in the midst of\r\n\r\nthis  regional  financial crisis, the economic  difficulties  we\r\n\r\nwill soon face will be daunting.  I would like to appeal to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in keeping with its character of tackling  problems\r\n\r\nhead-on  without  being  rigidly  confined  by  conventions,  to\r\n\r\npropose  a  balanced  budget for the coming  year  to  help  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  to ride out the severe  difficulties  lying\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has no foreign debt. The foreign debt of\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector is not excessive either.   During  economic\r\n\r\ndownturns  when the private sector consumption drops, investment\r\n\r\nslows  down,  and  the net export is likely  to  fall,  the  net\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  the public sector is the only  factor  left  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  needed stimulus for the recovery of  the  economy.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  business community is busy weathering  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomic  storm, our economy will need the Government  to  adopt\r\n\r\nrelatively  expansionary fiscal policies such as  tax  cuts  and\r\n\r\nincreased development expenditure to mitigate the impact of  the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has always been extremely\r\n\r\nprudent.  It has always insisted on fixing the small holes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere and there during the sunny days.  Often, even though things\r\n\r\nappeared  all  right, the Government still wanted to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  roof,  the wall, and the pillars.  Some of us  indeed  felt\r\n\r\nthat the Government might have been too risk averse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was with such unparalleled prudence and\r\n\r\nconservatism  that, year after year, during the  time  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy  was  well and sound, Singapore was able  to  accumulate\r\n\r\nlarge  surpluses to generate the huge reserve we now have.   All\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  be  grateful to  the  Government  for  its\r\n\r\nforesight   and  discipline.   The  Government   was  absolutely\r\n\r\ncorrect  in  repeatedly stressing that we need to save  for  the\r\n\r\nrainy  days.  Well, seeing the financial turmoil blowing through\r\n\r\nthe  region, it appears that such rainy days have finally dawned\r\n\r\non us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said last Sunday that, if the\r\n\r\nregion's   economic   crisis   was   confounded   by   political\r\n\r\ninstability,  we  would  also be adversely  affected  and  could\r\n\r\nexpect more hard times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, given what has been happening in the stock\r\n\r\nand foreign exchange markets and the way events are unfolding in\r\n\r\nthe neighbouring countries these few days, I think the hard time\r\n\r\nis already with us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries which sought IMF assistance have no choice but to\r\n\r\nexercise  austerity. The business community I represent  however\r\n\r\nfeels that our Government should not propose an austerity budget\r\n\r\nat  this difficult time. On the contrary, the Government  should\r\n\r\nfill  the  gap  resulted from the private  sector's  cutback  by\r\n\r\nincreasing the development expenditure to stimulate the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY1987, we had a deficit of $1.16 billion. The year\r\n\r\n1987  was  the year of recovery following the 1985-86  recession\r\n\r\nand  the 2.6% (of GDP) fiscal deficit reflected the Government's\r\n\r\nmeasures to tackle the economic problem at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, what we are facing is a regional economic crisis\r\n\r\nwhich has the potential to blow up to a global scale. It will be\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplex  and  far more challenging than what we  faced  back  in\r\n\r\n1985. Therefore, it warrants a balanced budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly, as a very small country,\r\n\r\nSingapore  alone  cannot resolve the regional financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nThe  recovery  of our economy relies on the improvement  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  climate  of  the  regional  countries.  However,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can take certain suitable measures to give a shot  in\r\n\r\nthe  arm  to our domestic economy. This will be consistent  with\r\n\r\nour  cooperative  and harmonious tripartite partnership  spirit,\r\n\r\nwith which we can work together to ride out this extraordinarily\r\n\r\ndifficult crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, for giving me this opportunity to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to counter the comment by Mr Chiam, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Potong Pasir, that somehow the unions, the  NTUC  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  are controlled by the PAP and that for some  strange\r\n\r\nreasons  because  of  this, the tripartism  that  we  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  working  along this  while  is  somewhat  hollow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  he  forgot that many unionists have been  the  leading\r\n\r\nfounders of the PAP in the 50s and the working relationship with\r\n\r\nthe unions has always been a symbiotic part of the PAP political\r\n\r\nset-up.   He  made  the comment also that because  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwithout Portfolio is the Secretary-General of the NTUC, for that\r\n\r\nreason  the workers' interests are somehow compromised.   But  I\r\n\r\ntake  the  other  view that because we have a  Minister  in  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  who  knows  deeply the issues  facing  the  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  that the PAP Government shows concern and  value  the\r\n\r\ninput by the Secretary-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripartism has served Singapore well and Singaporeans, in\r\n\r\ngeneral, have benefited for the last 25 years.  And in the  face\r\n\r\nof  these new global challenges we are seeing in the new  global\r\n\r\nmarket  and the new open integrated economy that we are  facing,\r\n\r\nit  is  timely  that  we have this motion in  the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member of Parliament to urge this House to renew  and\r\n\r\nexpress our new commitment to this new tripartism.  This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntask  has  equal  urgency,  not just for  the  Government  whose\r\n\r\nresponsibility is to ensure good governance and improve the well-being  of  the people, but also to employers whose more  mundane\r\n\r\naim  is  of  course to ensure good profitability and growth  for\r\n\r\ntheir respective lines of businesses.  And in this respect, I am\r\n\r\nreally very impressed by the speech made by the Nominated Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament just before me who is also an employer  with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce for his very deep and very\r\n\r\nfruitful contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial market turmoil in the region does not detract\r\n\r\nus  from this over-riding task of renewing tripartism.     After\r\n\r\nthis  financial and currency turmoil is over and a new alignment\r\n\r\nof  the exchange rates takes place, the regional economies  that\r\n\r\nadjust   themselves   appropriately  to  further   deepen   this\r\n\r\nintegration with the open international economy, or  as  in  the\r\n\r\nwords  of the previous NMP who spoke, those who bite the  bullet\r\n\r\nto adjust will be the stronger than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite partnership forges this unique Singaporean\r\n\r\nunderstanding, an implicit social modus operandus,  short  of  a\r\n\r\nsocial  contract, whereby workers who are led by the  NTUC,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and employers, including the more enlightened foreign\r\n\r\nemployers,  work towards the common objectives of stability  and\r\n\r\noverall  economic growth within a more moderate  and  reasonable\r\n\r\nwage  system, in line with productivity growth in an environment\r\n\r\nof industrial peace and goodwill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tripartite model has served us well for the past\r\n\r\nquarter  of  a  century.  There are four main  factors  why  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation  is slightly different  or  quite  different.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the population is aging.  Within the next 10 years,  20%\r\n\r\nof our population will be aged 60 and above.  This is a sobering\r\n\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the economy being more mature will no more be\r\n\r\ngrowing at the high rate that we have been accustomed to.   With\r\n\r\na  more  mature  economy, emphasis on productivity  improvement,\r\n\r\nrather than just growing by adding more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeign  labour  and  capital,  will  become  more  crucial   to\r\n\r\nsustaining real growth to ensure a rising standard of living for\r\n\r\nour workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is the increasing use of information technology to\r\n\r\nall  areas  of business - in design, manufacturing and services.\r\n\r\nThose  countries  with the most appropriately relevant  type  of\r\n\r\neducation system will be able to produce the people to work  the\r\n\r\nnew  manufacturing design systems.  And a young flexible  modern\r\n\r\neducated workforce will be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the irresistible and irreversible drive of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  will  throw up new game rules  for  transnational\r\n\r\ncorporations, to invest, to reward management and workers across\r\n\r\nthe  globe,  and  to manage MNC business in an integrated  world\r\n\r\neconomy.  The foreign direct investments we are attracting today\r\n\r\nare  no  more the cheap labour investments 25 years ago.  Today,\r\n\r\nour investments are in high skill-intensive and high value-added\r\n\r\nindustries requiring high capital intensity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With further skill training needed for new jobs and more\r\n\r\nintensive global competition, all parties must re-examine  their\r\n\r\npart in this partnership to ensure their relevance.  Labour with\r\n\r\nskill and knowledge base will be in demand. Because of this, the\r\n\r\ngrowth  potential for wages in this high technology sector  will\r\n\r\nbe  relatively higher, commensurate with their growth and  their\r\n\r\ncontribution.  In the same way, there will be certain sectors of\r\n\r\nthe  labour  market  which  will  run  the  potential  risk   of\r\n\r\nstructural  under-employment or structural  unemployment.   This\r\n\r\nproblem is not unique and is not new.  The American and European\r\n\r\nworkers faced this problem in their economies more than 10 years\r\n\r\nago,  when  their  very own MNCs and businesses relocated  their\r\n\r\nfactories from their home countries to the developing countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we will see in the likely scenario will be unequal\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the labour market, and unequal  development  of\r\n\r\nwages  in  the  industrial  sector.   The  skill-intensive   and\r\n\r\nknowledge-intensive sector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill see a higher trend of growth.  The less skill intensive  or\r\n\r\nknowledge   intensive  or,  worse,  technologically  obsolescent\r\n\r\nsector, will see slow, no growth or decline,  At the lower  end,\r\n\r\nwe  may  even  have  the  risk  of structural  under-employment,\r\n\r\nespecially among our older and not-so-well trained workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem faced here is compounded by the rising aging\r\n\r\nworking population.  Also, the fact is that there are 700,000 in\r\n\r\nour  workforce of 1.8 million, ie, 40% who have less than  lower\r\n\r\nsecondary level of education.  This makes the retraining of this\r\n\r\ngroup of workers a daunting and challenging task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This call for a new commitment to tripartism, therefore, is\r\n\r\na  call  for  a  new awareness for all parties to recognise  and\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves  to  manage this ambiguity  in  the  not  too\r\n\r\ndistant future.  The policies we develop and pursue must  answer\r\n\r\nto  the  competitive needs of the global economy in  high  value\r\n\r\nadded,  high  productivity and high capital or  skill  intensive\r\n\r\nindustries.   They must also answer to the need to  upgrade  the\r\n\r\nskill of our workers by constant retraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for this tripartite partnership is not just\r\n\r\nto manage the threat of structural under-employment, but also to\r\n\r\nmanage the need for high skill and knowledge intensive labour in\r\n\r\nhigh  technology.  It is a paradox with a dual.  The neglect  or\r\n\r\nthe  failure  to  do  so in one will have  repercussion  on  the\r\n\r\noverall  economy, leading to friction in the social  integration\r\n\r\nof our people.  And as the Secretary-General of the NTUC said  a\r\n\r\nmoment  ago, solely relying on foreign labour is only a  partial\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, retraining and training are crucial elements\r\n\r\nin  the  solution.  I urge the tripartite partnership, with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment as the spearhead, to think of more ways and means  to\r\n\r\nprovide retraining for our lower skilled workers to enable  them\r\n\r\nto  carry on to contribute to the economy, which they have  been\r\n\r\ndoing  for so long up to now.  Various schemes are presently  in\r\n\r\nplace  - skill certification scheme, skill redevelopment scheme,\r\n\r\netc.    However,  more  are  needed.   More  support  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the employers is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appreciate this particular problem, I have just said\r\n\r\nthat 40% of our workers  of 1.8 million in the workforce have  a\r\n\r\nlower  secondary  education.   To  train  these  workers  in   a\r\n\r\nclassroom is not so effective.  But I believe these people  have\r\n\r\nplenty of commonsense if we can get the message to them in their\r\n\r\nown language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, the total amount of grants committed for skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment training was, according to the annual report that  I\r\n\r\nread,  $67.8  million  for  483,000  places  for  all  ages  and\r\n\r\neducation class.  The average training grant per training  place\r\n\r\nwas  therefore  about $140.  About 26% of the  grants  committed\r\n\r\ngoes  to workers with below secondary and NTC 3 education,  with\r\n\r\nthe  total grant for this category at $17 million.  The  average\r\n\r\ntraining  grant per training place in this category is therefore\r\n\r\nat  about $107.  If you work at a standard $6 per hour of  wage,\r\n\r\nthis  works  out  to  approximately 18 hours  of  training.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  at full cost, which means if you consider not just  the\r\n\r\nskills development funded but the other part of the cost that is\r\n\r\nborne  either by the trainee or by the employer, the  full  cost\r\n\r\ncould  well  be six to seven times, as was pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General.   I  believe that this  is  not  too  high  a\r\n\r\nfigure.  In other words, the urgency of the task is actually  to\r\n\r\nraise this amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe a hand holding kind of approach on-the-job\r\n\r\ntraining by the private sector with specific targets, monitoring\r\n\r\nand output evaluation according to performance criteria combined\r\n\r\nwith  a compensation scheme by the Government for the period  of\r\n\r\nhand holding OJT should be initiated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there is a scheme for On-The-Job (OJT) training\r\n\r\nadministered  by  the  Skills Development Fund  for  a  National\r\n\r\nCompetency  Certificate.  It is training about 2,000 places  per\r\n\r\nyear,  according  to the SDF Annual Report,  administered  by  a\r\n\r\nlimited number of companies.  I believe the urgency of the  task\r\n\r\nbefore  us  is so great that a more flexible OJT scheme  with  a\r\n\r\nwider net of companies is needed.  And time is not on our side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary manual workers can be retrained to operate control\r\n\r\npanels in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nautomated mechanical systems in modern factories and warehouses.\r\n\r\nI  have  seen  how  it worked at the SIA latest flight  kitchen.\r\n\r\nSenior citizens can be trained to operate user friendly Point of\r\n\r\nSales (POS) machines in retail outlets.  The next time you visit\r\n\r\nMcDonald  restaurant, please take a look at their POS  machines.\r\n\r\nThe  key  buttons that the senior citizen is punching the  order\r\n\r\nfor  you  are  all in pictures, not in words, to facilitate  the\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  who work there.  The days  of  the  macho  guy\r\n\r\noperating  the port container lifting crane, sitting on  top  of\r\n\r\nthe  world,  are  numbered, because modern port  cranes  can  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled on the ground, two at a time even by a female staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally it takes longer for confidence building and hand\r\n\r\nholding and familiarising with a new job environment.  Companies\r\n\r\nin  operation should be encouraged to retrain their staff and to\r\n\r\nhave  another option through this hand holding OJT.  They should\r\n\r\nbe compensated for the full cost of the retraining period, and I\r\n\r\nsuggest  even  including any under-productivity variance  during\r\n\r\nthis  period  of retraining.  I am here referring to  retraining\r\n\r\nassistance  for those genuine workers who are under-trained  who\r\n\r\ngenuinely need and seek work and to add value to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the World Development Report of 1995, Workers in an\r\n\r\nIntegrating  World, it was reported that the success  of  public\r\n\r\nretraining  schemes  generally,  in  the  experience   of   most\r\n\r\ncountries,  has not been very positive.  Hence, I am  suggesting\r\n\r\nwe should embark on more private retraining schemes, provided by\r\n\r\nemployers  and  support them, before the workers are  laid  off,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  become public retraining cases, which is always  too\r\n\r\nlate and not specific and targetted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Development Report 1995 reported that careful\r\n\r\ntargetting, monitoring and evaluation of retraining schemes  are\r\n\r\nkeys to ensuring their effectiveness and preventing the waste of\r\n\r\nscarce public resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tripartite partnership should reaffirm its commitment\r\n\r\nto the global integration of the world economy.  By virtue of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  openness,  Singapore  has no choice  but  to  compete.   By\r\n\r\ncompeting internationally, our businesses have to find their own\r\n\r\nniches   and  fortes.   Capital  investment  and  talents   will\r\n\r\ngravitate towards those areas most suitable to reward  them  and\r\n\r\nmost  efficient  to compete.  Fortunately, for a  small  country\r\n\r\nlike us, the world economy is only global; it is not all round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In embracing the reality of globalisation and our need to\r\n\r\nintegrate  into  it,  the NTUC is actually checking  itself  and\r\n\r\nensuring   its  own  relevance.   The  best  way  to  face   the\r\n\r\ncompetitive market challenge is to embrace it; to think and  act\r\n\r\nglobal,  and  not to claim to think global and act  local.   The\r\n\r\nNTUC  will also have to manage the stress and the strain of this\r\n\r\nemerging  duality  in  the  labour  market,  and  to   work   in\r\n\r\npartnership to come up with various retraining schemes in  place\r\n\r\nsooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the NTUC has been ever conscious of the\r\n\r\nlarger role that it can play and has played.  Under the guidance\r\n\r\nof  the PAP Government, it has developed successfully the social\r\n\r\ngoal.   It has developed successfully many NTUC cooperatives  to\r\n\r\nadvance  the  welfare  of  workers and  Singaporeans.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I must also say that we need to have no apologies  for\r\n\r\nit.   Just  now, Mr Chiam claimed that the NTUC is getting  more\r\n\r\nand  more  into business.  Definitely, with a social  aim.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the NTUC Fairprice has been a major player in the  food\r\n\r\nretailing scene to ensure stable and reasonable prices for basic\r\n\r\nconsumer  necessities.   INCOME  has  also  served  workers  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with  a  broad range  of  insurance  needs.   NTUC\r\n\r\nChildcare  is  also  a  leading childcare service  provider  for\r\n\r\nworking  mothers.  There are others such as FOODFARE, DENTICARE,\r\n\r\nHEALTHCARE  for pharmaceutics, and the latest, the  NTUC  Choice\r\n\r\nHomes  for executive condominiums.  These are all extensions  of\r\n\r\ncooperative  businesses which have the ultimate aim  of  serving\r\n\r\nthe interest and welfare of the workers.  Various NTUC Clubs and\r\n\r\nLifestyle Centres have also served workers' interests and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies' needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These social services that the NTUC provides through its\r\n\r\ncooperatives are all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  through the competitive markets.  The social role  of  the\r\n\r\nNTUC Cooperatives often go unsung and unnoticed.  They make  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  dollars stretch more and help raise their standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  by moderating the cost, and showing the private business\r\n\r\nsectors  and competitors, whether they are French, local,  Dutch\r\n\r\nor  Americans,  the  standard and the  benchmarks  in  cost  and\r\n\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC Cooperatives are meeting the tripartite challenge\r\n\r\non   equal   grounds.    If  the  NTUC  Cooperatives   can   run\r\n\r\nsupermarkets,   insurance,   childcare   services,    healthcare\r\n\r\nservices,   taxi  services,  recreation  clubs  or  golf   clubs\r\n\r\nsuccessfully, there is no reason why it cannot run buses, before-and-after-school  care,  eldercare  services,  or   HDB   estate\r\n\r\nmaintenance services equally well, if we choose to do  so.   The\r\n\r\nrole  of  the unions is not restricted to collective  bargaining\r\n\r\nfor  collective  agreements  and to maintaining  the  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.   That is the old mindset.  They have a social  role  and\r\n\r\ntoday  the  NTUC Cooperatives and the NTUC is even a launch  pad\r\n\r\nfor  information technology in a joint project with the  NCB  in\r\n\r\nlaunching  the  smart  card for electronic  cash  and  retailing\r\n\r\ntransactions for the unions and cooperatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new vision to tripartism, I urge the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  employers to join hand with the NTUC unions in widening the\r\n\r\nsocial  role  for all three parties. They meet on equal  ground.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must also shift towards a more social perspective  in\r\n\r\ntheir  longer range thinking.  After all, they can only  survive\r\n\r\nif  they  can  find  a customer whether the  businesses  are  in\r\n\r\ncomputers, software, IT or food retailing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One meaningful social role the employers and Government can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  join  hands with the NTUC in a redoubled  effort  at\r\n\r\nupgrading skills and retraining of our workers.  Broadening  OJT\r\n\r\nis  a  good  way.  I urge the Government to help by  encouraging\r\n\r\nmore  private employers as well to obtaining easier  grants  and\r\n\r\ncompensation in a more flexible skill retraining scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, before I speak\r\n\r\non  the  motion proper, allow me to say a few words on  what  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam had said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, we are in the midst of the fasting month\r\n\r\nand no matter how tempting it is to partake in a debate with  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam,  I  would rather opt for food for the soul.

Most\r\n\r\nworkers do and the results speak for themselves, be it in  terms\r\n\r\nof  continued  employability,  rising  standard  of  living  and\r\n\r\nquality of life for workers and a meaningful role for workers in\r\n\r\nshaping their own future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now see how best the workers have shaped their past,\r\n\r\nthrough  tripartism, and create their future, through  teamwork.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, tripartism is not only about understanding the  past\r\n\r\nbut also gearing for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the motion by NMP Mr Cyrille Tan,\r\n\r\na highly respected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleader  of  the labour movement.  First, allow me to declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest.   I  am  currently  the  Executive  Secretary  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Port Workers' Union (SPWU) and a member  of  the  PSA\r\n\r\nBoard of Directors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be allowed to share my personal experience.\r\n\r\nI  have  been  in management for about 25 years, but  my  recent\r\n\r\nimmersion  in  the  NTUC  and the SPWU is  most  educational  in\r\n\r\nappreciating  tripartism.  Not only is it alive  and  well,  but\r\n\r\nthriving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SPWU takes teamwork among the union, management and\r\n\r\nGovernment  very  seriously, for it benefits  the  workers.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  benefits all.  But I must hasten  to  add  that  this\r\n\r\nharmonious state of affairs did not appear like magic.  It  came\r\n\r\nthrough blood, sweat and tears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPWU, the oldest union in Singapore, had a colourful and\r\n\r\nchequered  past.   Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew  can  personally\r\n\r\nvouch  for  the tumultuous years the union went through  in  its\r\n\r\nearly  history.  There was so much distrust then that  no  union\r\n\r\nleader  worth  his  salt  dared even to  think  of  constructive\r\n\r\nengagement.  It was Mr Lee's strategic intervention  that  saved\r\n\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPWU never looked back since then. In many ways, the SPWU-PSA industrial relationship is exemplary now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When PSA corporatised last year, the spirit of tripartism\r\n\r\nshowed  its  human face. Whether during bargaining for  the  new\r\n\r\nCollective  Agreement  or when adjusting  the  former  statutory\r\n\r\nboard's  prerogatives to the Employment Act's requirements,  the\r\n\r\nunion and the management worked constructively well to secure  a\r\n\r\nwin-win  situation for all.  The Ministry of Labour  was  always\r\n\r\nthere  to  lend  a  hand.   In fact, a tripartite  workshop-cum-dialogue on the Employment Act proved very successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice of tripartite consultation and decision-making has been institutionalised in many key policy-making\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  for  example, in NWC, NPB  (now  the  PSB),  CPF,\r\n\r\nComChest,  HDB, IE, EDB, the polytechnics and the  universities,\r\n\r\neven in the ad hoc committees to review and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformulate recommendations on national and economic policies such\r\n\r\nas  the  Economic  Committee (1986), Wage Reform,  Cost  Review,\r\n\r\nFlexible Wage System and Employment Act of 1994.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a picture, and possibly it was the first NWC\r\n\r\nmeeting, where most participants looked very solemn, in fact, at\r\n\r\nfirst  very sullen, but compare it with the recent NWC  meeting.\r\n\r\nYou  can see very happy faces.  This is because they realise and\r\n\r\nthey  acknowledge  the contributions made by tripartism  through\r\n\r\ninstitutions like NWC.  I quote Prof. Lim Chong Yah:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The National Wages Council could not have been formed (in\r\n\r\n1972)   without   the   support  of   the   NTUC.    The   union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives were there to look after the workers' interests,\r\n\r\nbut  at  the same time they were also prepared to take  national\r\n\r\ninterests into consideration. There has always been cordial  but\r\n\r\ntough  bargaining  among the three parties  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\ncoming  to a consensus.  Over the years, the NWC has contributed\r\n\r\nto the building of tripartite cooperation and goodwill.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we look at the history of tripartism in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we will see that from the time when the economy  was\r\n\r\ncoming out of the doldrums in the early years of independence to\r\n\r\nthe  recession of the mid-80s and the many good years  following\r\n\r\nthat, tripartism had withstood the test of time.  I am confident\r\n\r\nit  will  continue  to  do so.  Whether in economic  turbulence,\r\n\r\ntranquillity or transition, tripartism triumphs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is effective communication and understanding of each\r\n\r\nother's  role,  even trust.  While each has its own  perspective\r\n\r\nand  interest,  when it comes to the crunch, national  interests\r\n\r\nprevail.  As SM Lee once said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Each generation of union leaders must earn afresh the\r\n\r\ntrust  and respect of the workers they lead and of the  managers\r\n\r\nthey  negotiate with.  Similarly, managers must  also  earn  the\r\n\r\ntrust and respect of their workers to do well, they must balance\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  their workers with those of management,  and  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   That  is  the  context  in  which  tripartism  can\r\n\r\nsucceed.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no masak masak or kelong of relations, like some\r\n\r\nMembers  may like to suggest that unions are controlled  by  PAP\r\n\r\nMPs or PAP personalities.  Tripartism has indeed succeeded.   In\r\n\r\nthe words of PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoh,  \"let's  not  change formulas which have  proven  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsuccess  and useful for us.\"  But obviously, we cannot  rest  on\r\n\r\nour laurels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just how important a close working relationship among the\r\n\r\nthree  parties  is will be clearly shown in the near  future  as\r\n\r\nSingapore, together with the rest of ASEAN, fight to restore the\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  stability shakened by the  current  turmoil  in\r\n\r\nregional  economies  caused  by plunging  currencies  and  stock\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three steps which we can take in preparing for\r\n\r\nthe 21st century, as far as tripartism is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Understand the lessons of the past and pass them down to\r\n\r\nsubsequent  generations  for tripartism went  through  different\r\n\r\nphases during difficult times and good times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Learn from other experiences and refine our models of\r\n\r\ntripartite relationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Find ways to strengthen workers' stake and role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about understanding mutually reinforcing roles.\r\n\r\nThere  is a need to try to bring aims and aspirations of  labour\r\n\r\nand  management to a happy middle ground.  Labour will  have  to\r\n\r\nwork   hard  towards  helping  businesses  succeed  via   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity and no unnecessary demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is after all basic commonsense. It is like a three-legged stool. It will stand if all three are strong. If any\r\n\r\nof  them  is weak, the stool will collapse.  It is therefore  in\r\n\r\neveryone's  interest  to  see  all  succeed.   It  is  like  the\r\n\r\n\"prosper-thy-neighbour\" concept.  All  must  pull  in  the  same\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also look at different models of tripartism working\r\n\r\n(or  not working) today, including those outside Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nimprove  ours where and when necessary.  The question of  giving\r\n\r\nworkers  a  bigger  stake, for example, the question  of  worker\r\n\r\nrepresentation on company boards can also be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a time when tripartism will be put to a test.\r\n\r\nWe  need to be creative to see how each party will have to  play\r\n\r\nits  role.  Take training and retraining, for example, not  many\r\n\r\ncompanies will be keen to do it during difficult times, when  it\r\n\r\nis all the more important.  Unions and the Government could help\r\n\r\nto  look  into  this and also the plight of those who  might  be\r\n\r\naffected by the likely economic turmoil in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to sound alarmist, but in these troubling\r\n\r\ntimes,  businesses will face difficult conditions and some  will\r\n\r\nfail.   Some,  if not many, workers will lose their  jobs.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will have a harder time charting the economic  course\r\n\r\nof  the country.  But if all work together, the damages would be\r\n\r\nlessened.   Fewer business failures, fewer retrenchments,  lower\r\n\r\nunemployment and fewer social and political problems.  And  when\r\n\r\nthe  time comes for sacrifice - on everyone's part - we must  be\r\n\r\nprepared to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have shown what we can do collectively in the mid-80s\r\n\r\nrecession, and we can do it again, if need be.  When things  get\r\n\r\nreally critical, as they could well turn out to be for Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the region in facing the current economic turmoil,  as  the\r\n\r\nsaying goes, we must hang together, or most assuredly, we  would\r\n\r\nhang separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have a\r\n\r\nclarification on the speech by the Member for Cheng San GRC?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Did he misunderstand any part of your\r\n\r\nspeech?

He says  that\r\n\r\nthis is the month of Ramadan and therefore he is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  tolerant,  otherwise his criticism  of  me  will  be  more\r\n\r\nsevere,  if I have got him right.  I must inform the Member  for\r\n\r\nCheng  San  that I am not a new MP.  If I had been taken  in  by\r\n\r\ncriticism,  I  would not be in this House.  This  is  my  fourth\r\n\r\nterm.  So he can criticise me as he likes, whether it is Ramadan\r\n\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clarification, Sir, in regard to this tripartism which I\r\n\r\nhave  attracted criticisms from the last four speakers.  To  me,\r\n\r\nprobably  to  any  ordinary  person in  Singapore,  you  have  a\r\n\r\nMinister from the political party, who is also the head  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement, how can there be true tripartism  if,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the trade union is controlled by a Minister?  A  Minister\r\n\r\nmust  abide by Cabinet's collective decision.  You cannot  stray\r\n\r\naway from it.  So if the political party has made a policy, when\r\n\r\nthis  Minister  goes  to  sit as the head  of  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement,  he  must abide by the decision of the Cabinet.   And,\r\n\r\ntherefore, if you look at it truly, this is not tripartism under\r\n\r\nthis  system, although it works well.  Whether it works well  is\r\n\r\nanother issue.  What I am talking about is just looking  at  it,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is tripartism or, in fact, it is dualism,  I  would\r\n\r\nsay.  It is not true tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, that is not a clarification\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want the speakers to see whether\r\n\r\nor not what I said is correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> We are running short of time.

But it is not easy to understand  what  is\r\n\r\ntripartism.  So a little boy asks his father,  \"Daddy,  what  is\r\n\r\ntripartism?  How does it work and how does it affect the life of\r\n\r\nthe people and their future?\"  The father says, \"Son, it is very\r\n\r\nsimple.  Look at this family.  I represent the capitalist.  Your\r\n\r\nmother,  she is the government.  You represent the people.   Our\r\n\r\nmaid,  she  represents the labour.

As the mother ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, that is not a\r\n\r\nclarification.

So the son asks the\r\n\r\nfather again, \"Yes, I understand all these components.  But  how\r\n\r\ndo  they link together?\"  So the father says, \"Son, don't expect\r\n\r\nme  to teach you everything.  Just observe how we interact among\r\n\r\nourselves  and  you  will  understand the  relationship.\"   That\r\n\r\nnight,  in the middle of the night, the son was trying to  sleep\r\n\r\nbut  could not, still thinking about tripartism.  Then he  heard\r\n\r\nhis baby sister crying very loudly for quite a while and somehow\r\n\r\nnobody attended to her.  Finally, he decided to call his mother.\r\n\r\nHe  went  to  the master bedroom.  His mother was sound  asleep.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing was that his father was not in the bedroom. He\r\n\r\nthought, \"Okay, since mummy is sound asleep, maybe I should call\r\n\r\nthe  maid  to attend to my sister.\"  He groped in the  dark  and\r\n\r\nwent to the maid's room.  Before he could knock on the door,  he\r\n\r\nheard  his father's voice in the maid's room.  And the maid  was\r\n\r\ntelling  his  father,  \"Sir, please leave  me  alone.   If  not,\r\n\r\ntomorrow morning I am going to report to your wife.\"  He went on\r\n\r\nto the baby's room and found that the reason why his baby sister\r\n\r\nwas  crying was because she did a big job.  Anyway, he went back\r\n\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, during breakfast, his father asked him,\r\n\r\n\"Son,  have you figured out what is tripartism?\"  His son  said,\r\n\r\n\"Daddy, it is very simple.  When the government is sleeping, the\r\n\r\ncapitalist will try to exploit the labour.  The people will have\r\n\r\nto grope in the dark, and the future will be in a big mess.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I use this story to illustrate the point that it is\r\n\r\nnot easy to achieve harmony in tripartism.  In fact, if you look\r\n\r\nat the world\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday, because of rising unemployment, tripartism today is under\r\n\r\neven  greater stress.  In June this year, I was in France.   The\r\n\r\nFrench  union recommended that the government should reduce  the\r\n\r\nworking hours from 39 hours to 35 hours a week by the year 2000.\r\n\r\nThe   socialist-led  government  endorsed  the  proposal.    The\r\n\r\nemployers'  federation  objected  violently  to  that  proposal.\r\n\r\nFinally,  the  head  of  the employers'  federation  decided  to\r\n\r\nresign.   His members called on him to stay on.  But his comment\r\n\r\nwas, \"What you need now is not a negotiator, not a collaborator.\r\n\r\nWhat  you  need now is a fighter to be your leader.\"  Basically,\r\n\r\nthe tripartite partners in France had decided to go to war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, I was in Japan to attend the biennial\r\n\r\nconvention of RENGO, which is the equivalent of NTUC, in  Japan.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  new  leader of RENGO was elected,  the  next  day  he\r\n\r\nappeared on the front page of a Japan newspaper and the headline\r\n\r\nwas  something along the line that \"RENGO new head calls on  SDP\r\n\r\nto  quit LDP.\"  Basically he was quoted as calling on the SDP to\r\n\r\nend  its  alliance with the LDP, so that the opposition  parties\r\n\r\ncan  go against the government.  Here is another example of  how\r\n\r\ntripartism is not working in a harmonious manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made use of these two examples to illustrate that at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the day, if the tripartite partners cannot work well\r\n\r\ntogether,  it is the people, the workers, who will  suffer.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  Singapore,  the  NTUC,  the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers' federation would always work closely together under a\r\n\r\nspirit  of  mutual support and mutual respect.   But  sometimes,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, this spirit is being misunderstood as the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  under the control of the Government.  I want  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to highlight, firstly, that within the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement,  the highest level of decision-making is  the  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee of the NTUC, comprising 21 members.  These 21  members\r\n\r\nare  elected  by the 260,000 union members that we have  through\r\n\r\ntheir  delegates  once every three years.  Of these  21  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee  members, a majority of them, in fact,  two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nthem, are grassroots leaders, leaders who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespected, like Cyrille Tan, and so on.  Basically, anybody  who\r\n\r\nwants  to  go into the Central Committee would have to gain  the\r\n\r\ntrust  and  the respect of the labour movement, of the  members,\r\n\r\nbecause  if they are not elected, they cannot be in the  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Secretary-General of the NTUC - I want to make it\r\n\r\nvery  clear  -  is  not appointed by the PAP  Government  to  be\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the labour movement.  He is elected by  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement and elected by the Central Committee to be  its\r\n\r\nSecretary-General.  Some may have the impression that if the MPs\r\n\r\nare  advisers to affiliated unions, the labour MPs  are  running\r\n\r\nthe  unions.  Here again, I would like to point out  that  under\r\n\r\nthe NTUC, we have 78 affiliated unions and the affiliated unions\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  to be affiliated to NTUC if they do not  see  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of being affiliated to the NTUC.  There is  no  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to say that unions must be affiliated to the NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the affiliated unions are run by the Presidents\r\n\r\nand  the General Secretaries.  Take, for example, the electronic\r\n\r\nunions.  NMP Cyrille Tan is the General Secretary of the  United\r\n\r\nWorkers of Electronic and Electrical Industries.  So he  is  the\r\n\r\nCEO  of the union, and therefore it is not right to say that the\r\n\r\naffiliated unions are being controlled or managed by the  labour\r\n\r\nMPs.  My main point is this - even though the labour movement is\r\n\r\nan  independent movement, it does not mean that we must adopt  a\r\n\r\nconfrontational approach towards tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have this symbiotic relationship with the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government is for very simple reasons, and  very  often  we\r\n\r\nforget about these.  We must always remember who are the members\r\n\r\nof the labour movement - they are the workers of Singapore.  And\r\n\r\nwho  are  the  workers of Singapore?  They are the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And if you think about it, when the labour  movement\r\n\r\ntalks  about  helping our workers to live a better life,  it  is\r\n\r\ncompletely in line with the PAP Government's objective of making\r\n\r\nSingapore the best home for all Singaporeans.  It is because  of\r\n\r\nthis  complete  alignment  of our interest  that  we  have  this\r\n\r\nsymbiotic relationship, this harmony in tripartism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the labour movement, we believe that the best way to\r\n\r\nserve the interest of our workers, as our Secretary-General  has\r\n\r\nsaid many times, the best welfare that we can give to any worker\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, is to give him a job.  The best protection we can\r\n\r\ngive  to our workers of Singapore is to achieve full employment.\r\n\r\nBecause  in  a full employment situation, no employer  would  be\r\n\r\nable  to try to exploit the workers even if he wants to.  Guided\r\n\r\nby  this  end  objective  of protecting and  looking  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  workers,  who  are  also  the  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the tripartite partners have always worked  together\r\n\r\nunder  this spirit of mutual support and mutual respect.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  let me remind this House that since 1973 to 1996,  over\r\n\r\nthis  period  of about 23 years, according to labour statistics,\r\n\r\nthe  real income of Singaporeans has gone up by 5.4% a year over\r\n\r\nthe  last  23  years.  I believe that this is an achievement  no\r\n\r\nother country is able to match.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having talked about how tripartism has succeeded up to\r\n\r\nnow, I would like to touch on the future.  Why do we debate this\r\n\r\nmotion in this House?  Because the Asia-Pacific is going to be a\r\n\r\nvery  different  Asia-Pacific by the year 2000.   And  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter, the whole world is going to be a very different world by\r\n\r\nthe  year 2000.  The reason is very simple.  Today, with  rising\r\n\r\nunemployment all over the world, with 35 million people  in  USA\r\n\r\nworking  on  part-time basis; 18 million in  Europe  unemployed;\r\n\r\n2.31  million  workers in Japan jobless, every  country  is  now\r\n\r\ntaking tough measures to reform themselves.  The OECD countries,\r\n\r\njust  two months ago, held a two-day job conference in Tokyo  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  how they can create employment for the youths  and  how\r\n\r\nthey  can  work together to retrain the workers.   In  Korea,  a\r\n\r\ntripartite  panel  has been set up to look  into  how  they  can\r\n\r\nlegalise  layoff of labour.  By the year 2000, I  am  very  sure\r\n\r\nthat  all  these countries are going to be much more competitive\r\n\r\nbecause they are prepared to bite the bullet.  They are prepared\r\n\r\nto  take tough measures.  In Singapore, today we are in  a  much\r\n\r\nbetter  position  than anybody else.  The question  is:  are  we\r\n\r\nprepared to take tough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  today  so that by the year 2000, we will  continue  to\r\n\r\nremain ahead in a more competitive world?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong disagreed with what the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nsaid  on the retrenchment sequence and I think his point is that\r\n\r\nforeign workers should go first and local workers ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I did not say that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> So you agree with Mr Lim Boon Heng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I said they can be abused.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> My apologies. Let me repeat again, if\r\n\r\nthere is such an idea, I like to explain why such an idea is not\r\n\r\nthe  right  idea.   Because the important issue  which  we  must\r\n\r\nunderstand is that the challenge facing Singapore today  is  not\r\n\r\nan  employment  problem.  It is an employability problem  and  I\r\n\r\nthink this is an issue most people do not understand fully.   If\r\n\r\nI  may  quote  an example and this is a real life  example.   In\r\n\r\nOctober  last year, a consumer electronics company  closed  down\r\n\r\ntheir  operation in Singapore.  They had 938 workers retrenched.\r\n\r\nOf  the 938 workers, a majority were unskilled workers.  So  the\r\n\r\nunion  talked to the workers and we identified 240 of them  whom\r\n\r\nwe  thought could have the potential to be retrained to go  into\r\n\r\nthe new growth sector, like wafer fabrication.  After six months\r\n\r\nof  hard work, we finally managed to channel about 40 of them to\r\n\r\ngo  into  the  wafer fabrication operation.  We found  them  the\r\n\r\nemployment.   We  provided the training  to  them.   Within  two\r\n\r\nmonths,  more than half of them had left the jobs.  And,  today,\r\n\r\nwe are down to about 15 of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point here is this. In\r\n\r\nSingapore today, we are not having an employment problem.   What\r\n\r\nwe  have  here is a problem of employability. If our  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers who are unskilled or semi-skilled and if they prefer  to\r\n\r\nremain as unskilled workers, then in time to come, they may find\r\n\r\nthemselves not able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  take on the job, not because there is no job in the economy,\r\n\r\nbut  because  they do not have the right skills to take  on  the\r\n\r\njob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB is now targeting to bring in about $8 billion to\r\n\r\n$10  billion worth of investments every year.  Our understanding\r\n\r\nis that, in the past, for every three jobs created through these\r\n\r\nforeign  investments, two jobs are semi-skilled  and  unskilled.\r\n\r\nToday, the situation has changed.  Today, and in the future, for\r\n\r\nevery  three jobs that will be created in the economy, only  one\r\n\r\njob will be unskilled and semi-skilled.  The other two jobs, two-third  of  the  jobs,  will require skilled manpower,  technical\r\n\r\nmanpower,  or  professional  manpower.   So  in  the   face   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment, many of our unskilled workers will be  retrenched.\r\n\r\nThe question is: can they move on to this new growth sector like\r\n\r\nwafer fabrication?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in the newspaper, we read about the speculation\r\n\r\nthat  Seagate was retrenching 20% of its workers.  But,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  in the same newspaper, we read about EDB announcing\r\n\r\nthat  the  tenth  wafer fabrication plants will  be  set  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Every wafer fabrication plant will  create  800  to\r\n\r\n1,000  jobs.   With 10 wafer fabrication plants, there  will  be\r\n\r\n8,000 to 10,000 jobs.  And over the next five to seven years, if\r\n\r\nwe  are able to remain competitive and if we are able to achieve\r\n\r\nthe  target  of having 25 wafer fabrication plants in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  employment opportunities for  about  20,000  to\r\n\r\n25,000  workers.   But  the catch is this.   Every  one  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  must at least preferably be a semi-skilled  or  skilled\r\n\r\nworker.   So the issue here is how fast can we move to help  our\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers  in Singapore to upgrade themselves  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can take on this better paying job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, here, I would like to propose that\r\n\r\nit  is  now  time  for  action.   We  have  been  talking  about\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment for the last one to two years.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeen  talking  about training and retraining for the  last  many\r\n\r\nyears.   But  the problem is that training does not  necessarily\r\n\r\nlead  to  enhanced employability.  According to SDF records,  of\r\n\r\nthe  training supported under SDF, less than 10% led  to  skills\r\n\r\ncertification,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeaning  that  the  majority  of  the  training  are  functional\r\n\r\ntraining,  ie,  helping workers to be more productive  in  their\r\n\r\ncurrent  jobs.   What we need now is to focus  on  training  our\r\n\r\nworkers for future jobs which will enable them to become skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  of  the  future.  So in that regard, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npropose  that  it  is about time that we brought  the  level  of\r\n\r\ntripartism in Singapore to a higher plane.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, the NMP, suggested the setting up of a\r\n\r\nTripartism  Advisory  Committee to advise  the  Government,  the\r\n\r\ntripartite  partners.  I would like to go one step  further.   I\r\n\r\npropose we set up a Tripartism 21 Action Committee because it is\r\n\r\ntime  for  action.  Time is not on our side.  With  the  current\r\n\r\nfinancial  turmoil, I think we are going to have even less  time\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Tripartism 21 Action Committee focus on\r\n\r\ntwo  areas.   The  first  area  is how  to  remain  competitive.\r\n\r\nSecondly, how to enhance employability.  For example, the Action\r\n\r\nCommittee,  through the collaborative efforts of the union,  the\r\n\r\nemployer and the Government, can firstly identify what kinds  of\r\n\r\nskills  are needed in our economy for the next five to 10 years.\r\n\r\nThese skills should include not just technical skills, but  also\r\n\r\nskills  relating  to technology, thinking skills,  interpersonal\r\n\r\nskills  and  language skills so that the workers will  be  well-rounded  workers.  Secondly, I propose that this committee  look\r\n\r\ninto  a  comprehensive skills certification system.  We need  to\r\n\r\nput  in  place  a skills certification system for  all  the  new\r\n\r\ngrowth  sectors,  in the manufacturing sector  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector, so that there will be a systematic roadmap  to\r\n\r\nguide  the  skills development of workers.  Thirdly, the  Action\r\n\r\nCommittee should work on the whole idea of skills redevelopment.\r\n\r\nWe  have said enough about 39% of the workforce being unskilled,\r\n\r\nunder-educated,  and so on.  The question is: how  can  we  help\r\n\r\nthem to go through this whole process of skills certification?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRP was launched in December 1996 at the initiative of\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC.  And, today, we have managed to convince 27 companies\r\n\r\nto  sign  up 3,100 workers and everyone of them is going through\r\n\r\ntraining that will lead to skills certification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy  next month, when we launch the third batch of SRP companies,\r\n\r\nwe  are targeting to have 50 companies supporting at least 5,000\r\n\r\nworkers.  The progress is promising and we believe that if  this\r\n\r\nprogramme is expanded into a national programme and if given the\r\n\r\nfull  support of the union, the employer and the Government,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  can  convince  enough  unskilled  workers  to  take\r\n\r\ntraining seriously so that they can enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Action Committee should seriously look into\r\n\r\nhow  we can channel workers from the downsizing sectors to  move\r\n\r\ninto  the new growth sectors.  The consumer electronics  sector,\r\n\r\nfor  example, is downsizing very rapidly.  In 1997, we saw a few\r\n\r\ncompanies moving their operations to other lower cost locations.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we are seeing many new operations being set up\r\n\r\nin    Singapore,    in    wafer   fabrication,    petrochemical,\r\n\r\npharmaceutical and other services sectors.  What we have  to  do\r\n\r\nis  to concentrate on these workers who are going to be affected\r\n\r\nby  the downsizing of the lower value, relatively speaking,  the\r\n\r\nmore  labour-intensive sector and move them into the new  growth\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area that we are going into is on the need to\r\n\r\nredesign the jobs in the industry.  The workforce is aging.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  many workers who are in their 40s have already  expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  that if and when they are retrenched, they do not  have\r\n\r\nthe  confidence of finding new jobs.  Because if you look at the\r\n\r\njob advertisements in the newspapers, quite a number of them  do\r\n\r\nspecify  that they are looking for workers who are  either  less\r\n\r\nthan  35  or 40 years old.  And, increasingly, we are  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  middle-aged  workers and not so  young  workers  may  have\r\n\r\ngreater  difficulties re-entering the job market should they  be\r\n\r\nretrenched.   Therefore, I think this is  an  area  whereby  the\r\n\r\ntripartism  committee  should look  into  and  see  how  we  can\r\n\r\nincentivise, and encourage the employers to restructure jobs  so\r\n\r\nthat they can be more suitable for the not-so-young workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has the Singapore 21 Vision.  For the NTUC, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave the NTUC 21 Vision. The employers' federation has the SNEF 21 Vision, \r\n\r\nand all of us are working towards the same objective,\r\n\r\nwhich  is to make sure that the economy will remain competitive,\r\n\r\nthe  companies will remain profitable and that the workers  will\r\n\r\nremain  employable.  We hope that this motion will  be  endorsed\r\n\r\nstrongly  by this House.  We hope that concrete action  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  bring the tripartite partners closer so that,  as  we\r\n\r\nmove forward into the future, we can continue to strengthen  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of Singapore, and continue  to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nemployability  of our workers so that in the 21st  century,  our\r\n\r\nworkers can live a better life in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nSir, for giving me this opportunity to speak.  I rise to support\r\n\r\nthis  motion.   In the face of very difficult circumstances  and\r\n\r\nthe bad times ahead, it is necessary for us to come together  to\r\n\r\ntackle  the  growing challenges.  I think there  will  be  tough\r\n\r\nchoices, probably tougher than the ones we had in 1985  when  we\r\n\r\nhad  a recession.  We survived that and I hope this one we  will\r\n\r\ndo better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to raise five issues, Sir. During the last\r\n\r\nrecession in 1985, the Government resorted to temporary  cutting\r\n\r\nof  the  employer's CPF contribution as a measure to revive  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   Given  that, nowadays, most people  have  drawn  down\r\n\r\ntheir CPF contribution to service their housing loans or to  buy\r\n\r\nshares, thus reducing the security nests for old age protection,\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Government consider cutting the CPF as still possible\r\n\r\nthis time round?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second issue. Employers are looking closely at cost\r\n\r\ncutting  and  cost  containment  strategies  to  ride  out  this\r\n\r\nturmoil.  One of the key factors in this exercise, and I am sure\r\n\r\nis the focus of this tripartite discussion, is wage control.  In\r\n\r\n1986,  the  Government  called for  wage  restraint  policy.   I\r\n\r\nremembered the protests of the workers and the applause from the\r\n\r\nemployers  at  the same time.  And I would like  to  know  if  a\r\n\r\nsimilar strategy is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered appropriate this time round to ease the cost  burdens\r\n\r\nof struggling enterprises.  And to reinforce Mr Tay Beng Chuan's\r\n\r\nproposal  earlier on, since the civil service sector is  by  far\r\n\r\nthe largest employer in Singapore and its wage policy inevitably\r\n\r\nsets  the  tone  for  the  employers  in  Singapore,  will   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  take the lead to set the example and impose  a  wage\r\n\r\nrestraint policy similar to the one in 1986, if possible with  a\r\n\r\nwage freeze?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue is about productivity and opportunity costs\r\n\r\ncaused  by the workers who job-hop.  We have heard Members  from\r\n\r\nthe   floor   today  who  propose  changing  workers'  attitude,\r\n\r\nincreasing productivity and upgrading skills.  As an employer, I\r\n\r\nask  who  is  going  to pay for all that.  I have,  as  a  Human\r\n\r\nResource  Director  in my company, trained a number  of  workers\r\n\r\nand, at the end of the course, they left for another company for\r\n\r\na few dollars more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some figures. According to a Business Times'\r\n\r\nreport,  the  average labour turnover in 1997  was  38.4%.   The\r\n\r\nhighest  turnover  rate  being 56.4%  in  the  commerce  sector,\r\n\r\nfollowed  by  the  clerical  and  sales  sector  at  50.4%,  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  and  technical  sector  at  28.8%  and  production\r\n\r\nworkers at 39.6%.  These figures were based on the first quarter\r\n\r\nof  1997.   I hope it was more encouraging in the last  quarter.\r\n\r\nThe  Political  and  Economic Risk Consultancy  report  in  1997\r\n\r\nmarked Singaporean workers, in terms of company loyalty, at 6.03\r\n\r\nin  a  scale  of  0-10  with 0 representing the  best  situation\r\n\r\npossible  and 10, the worst.  We are at 6.03.  In the sample  of\r\n\r\n12 countries, Vietnam is the worst, scoring a high 7; Japan, the\r\n\r\nbest  in  company loyalty, scoring 2.5; Singapore is  the  third\r\n\r\nworst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, Sir, that a lack of company loyalty among\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers  is  not  helpful  during  difficult  times\r\n\r\nbecause now more than before, employers need organisational  and\r\n\r\noperational stability to ride out the currency turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures could we consider to stem out workers' job-hopping behaviour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill  the  Government  support employers  by  returning  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany some portion of the personal CPF contribution of workers\r\n\r\nwho leave with no valid reasons within six months of employment?\r\n\r\nWill  the  Government consider not renewing the work permits  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  who job-hop within a few  months  of  service?\r\n\r\nThese  measures,  as  argued by some employers  and  by  Mr  Tay\r\n\r\nearlier  on, could serve as disincentives for job-hopping  while\r\n\r\nhelping  employers  regain  some payments  as  compensation  for\r\n\r\nproductivity loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may seem to skew towards the side of employers,\r\n\r\nbut  employers  here  argue that the model  of  tripartism  must\r\n\r\ninclude  in  it an ethos of mutual obligations, work  commitment\r\n\r\nand  company loyalty, which workers themselves must  commit  to.\r\n\r\nWithout these fundamental commitments to work and company, there\r\n\r\ncannot  be enduring worker and company growth and, in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun, sound economic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth issue, Sir, is helping employers lower overall\r\n\r\nlabour cost by tapping on a large source of labour for part-time\r\n\r\nemployment.   The  tripartite partnership in  1996  between  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour, in conjunction with  SNEF,  NTUC  and  the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and Standards Board, attempted to  get  women  and\r\n\r\nretirees  back to work.  However, despite the offer of  training\r\n\r\ncourses and grants and with 4,000 vacancies being created by  18\r\n\r\nemployers participating in this programme, the take-up rate  was\r\n\r\nlow.  If we look at our workforce today, while there are workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  going to be retrenched, there are already one  million\r\n\r\neconomically  inactive  persons.    They  form  35.4%   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation.   Among  these, there are  700,000  who  are  women,\r\n\r\n210,000  have  `O'  level, 77,000 have `A' levels,  diplomas  or\r\n\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1996 survey, 59,000 indicated that they wanted to\r\n\r\nwork.  Most of these people who had indicated that they intended\r\n\r\nto  work  were  women, most of them married, home-makers,  young\r\n\r\nbetween  20-49  years old, had secondary education,  had  worked\r\n\r\nbefore, but liked to work part time.  There were correspondingly\r\n\r\n11,700\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotential  male  entrants.  I hope the Ministry  will  tap  this\r\n\r\nlarge  labour resource, which is young, educated, trainable  and\r\n\r\nemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Business Times report from interviews they carried out\r\n\r\nin the back-to-work programme launched in 1996, there were women\r\n\r\nwho  liked  to work but they did not know where to work.   There\r\n\r\nwere also those who wished to work part time, but companies only\r\n\r\noffered  full-time work.  Others would like to set up  \"virtual\"\r\n\r\noffices  at home, but offers were very limited.  And there  were\r\n\r\ncomplaints about mismatch of skills and job vacancies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the tripartite partners in the back-to-work\r\n\r\nprogramme  will seriously review their strategy,  find  out  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  these employable, educated men and women  did  not\r\n\r\nrespond  to re-employment opportunities and create new  ways  of\r\n\r\nmobilising them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions: strengthen the mechanism for\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  part-time  workers in  the  Employment  Service\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Ministry, by serving as an effective  one-stop\r\n\r\nclearing  house  facility  to match worker  attributes  and  job\r\n\r\nspecifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second suggestion: launch regularly an awareness campaign\r\n\r\nisland-wide  through a variety of media channels  and  reinforce\r\n\r\nthis effort by offering a toll-free jobline information service.\r\n\r\nAnd  I think the National Helpline recently launched by CDC  may\r\n\r\nwant  to  consider  offering an information  and  job  placement\r\n\r\nservice to its constituents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, broaden up supply base to offer part-time work to\r\n\r\nindustries  such  as financial, insurance and business  services\r\n\r\nwith  proper pre-work training and orientation.  Currently, most\r\n\r\nof  the  part-time  work  is  still  concentrated  in  commerce,\r\n\r\ncommunity and personal services, and the manufacturing  sectors.\r\n\r\nThese  are low-end jobs and they are not attractive in the first\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, give specific attention to women workers'\r\n\r\nexpectations  by helping them get jobs within their  residential\r\n\r\nvicinity and design flexi-time schedule to help them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbalance   work   and   family  needs.    There   were   numerous\r\n\r\nrecommendations being made to the Institute of Policy Studies in\r\n\r\nSeptember   1997,   ranging   from   fiscal   measures,   labour\r\n\r\nlegislation,  family policies to management  practices.   Please\r\n\r\nconsult this report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of current and future labour shortages and our\r\n\r\nwish  to  cut  down on foreign labour cost for enterprises,  the\r\n\r\nability  to attract females who had left the workforce and  want\r\n\r\nto  work,  or to retain those who are already in the  workforce,\r\n\r\ntake on an economic significance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth and last point is a call for us to focus on the\r\n\r\nvulnerable  groups.   I would like to highlight  one  vulnerable\r\n\r\ngroup   who   needs,  during  these  difficult  times,   special\r\n\r\nattention.   These  are the single parents, largely  female  who\r\n\r\nhave  little  education,  low skill,  in  daily  paid  jobs  and\r\n\r\nirregular  work.   The 1990 census reported that  single  parent\r\n\r\nfamily   households  comprise  60,999  households  with  widowed\r\n\r\nparents   and   17,585   households   with   divorced   parents,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  approximately 10% of all family-based  households.\r\n\r\nThe  typical profile of a single parent who is a client  in  our\r\n\r\nFamily Service Centres is likely to be a divorced person in  her\r\n\r\nthirties, young, with low education, earning a monthly salary of\r\n\r\nless  than $1,000 per month and mother of at least two dependent\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a case of them being women that we need to\r\n\r\nprotect.   It is more a case of protecting our workers  who  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable, who happen to be women with young children.   Facing\r\n\r\nthe threat of retrenchment during these difficult times, how  do\r\n\r\nunions  and Government protect their capacity to generate income\r\n\r\nto  help them fend for their children and, eventually, their old\r\n\r\nage?   As  non-unionised workers, what recourses do  they  have?\r\n\r\nWhat  kind  of  special  community-based childcare  options  can\r\n\r\nunions   and  Government  offer  to  this  group  of  one-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds?  What kind of family-sensitive housing policies  can\r\n\r\nbe specially tailored to meet the needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof single parent households to offer them stable, affordable and\r\n\r\nadequate housing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tripartite policy agenda in restructuring, training and\r\n\r\nraising  productivity - all these suggestions brought up  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Swee Say earlier on were very convincing - but this has  to\r\n\r\nbe  balanced with a family policy agenda to minimise the strains\r\n\r\nand  stresses  our workers may face in the home front,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can concentrate in their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not need to over emphasise here that when we\r\n\r\nallow  family  life  to  become  weak,  the  society  begins  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate.   In the end, the strength of the  nation  will  be\r\n\r\nundermined.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing  in  the\r\n\r\nname of the Nominated Member of Parliament, Mr Cyrille Tan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too believe that tripartite cooperation between\r\n\r\nemployers, trade unions and the workers they represent  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  a key factor in our competitive  advantage.

Instead  of  wasting  our\r\n\r\nlimited  human  resources and efforts on divisive confrontations\r\n\r\nbetween  union and management, we have been able to  concentrate\r\n\r\nour efforts, our resources on common goals, teamwork, skills and\r\n\r\nproductivity improvements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our harmonious industrial relations over the past three\r\n\r\ndecades  were very different from the experience of  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  particularly those saddled with adversarial  labour-management relations. In fact, our strike-free environment  over\r\n\r\na long period of time may have resulted in harmonious industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  being  taken  for granted, especially  by  a  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, BERI, in its worldwide ranking of workers, had\r\n\r\nconsistently ranked the Singapore workforce as No 1, top of  the\r\n\r\nlist.  This is, to a large extent, due to the labour legislation\r\n\r\nwhich reflect the strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspirit and practice of tripartism.  Furthermore, the absence  of\r\n\r\nindustrial   unrest,  such  as  strikes,  work  stoppages,   had\r\n\r\ncontributed to the high relative productivity which has  further\r\n\r\nenhanced our strong ratings by BERI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like Mr Zainul before me, I too\r\n\r\nwould  like  to take this opportunity to remind the  House  that\r\n\r\nharmonious industrial relations cannot be taken for granted.  In\r\n\r\nthe   past,  Singapore  had  experienced  the  consequences   of\r\n\r\nconfrontational and adversarial labour-management relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 50s and 60s, strikes, work stoppages and other forms\r\n\r\nof  industrial action were common.  Just to remind  Members,  in\r\n\r\n1955 alone, there were 275 strikes, resulting in the loss of one\r\n\r\nmillion  man-days. In 1961, we had 116 strikes and we lost  more\r\n\r\nthan  400,000  man-days.  If BERI were to rank our workforce  on\r\n\r\nsuch  performance, I have no doubt that the Singapore  workforce\r\n\r\nwould be occupying a position quite near the bottom, and not  at\r\n\r\nthe top of the list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, frequent strikes not only disrupted the smooth\r\n\r\noperations  and  viability of companies; it also undermined  the\r\n\r\nwell being and livelihood of many workers.  More importantly,  a\r\n\r\npoor  state  of  industrial relations had scared away  potential\r\n\r\ninvestors, discouraged business expansion and adversely affected\r\n\r\neconomic growth.  So it was not surprising that in the  50s  and\r\n\r\nthe 60s, there was economic stagnation and massive unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the situation in Singapore is very different.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  consistently been  rated  as  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nattractive  places  to  invest  in  and  has  topped  the  World\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  ranking. We have enjoyed rapid economic  growth\r\n\r\nover  the  years, especially from 1987 to 1997, averaging  about\r\n\r\n8.9% GDP growth annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment is no longer an issue. In fact, we now face\r\n\r\nlabour shortage and tight labour market conditions.  We have  to\r\n\r\nadmit  more than 450,000 foreign talented professional  workers,\r\n\r\nskilled  and  even unskilled workers to supplement  our  limited\r\n\r\nindigenous manpower resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporean workers have enjoyed substantial wage increases  and\r\n\r\nsignificant  improvement  in  their  terms  and  conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment.   Standard  of  living  and  quality  of  life   are\r\n\r\ncomparable to that of many developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these have been made possible through the efforts\r\n\r\nof  a  hard-working workforce, sound economic  policies,  and  a\r\n\r\nstrong  and deep rooted relationship between employers,  workers\r\n\r\nand the Government, based on cooperation and shared objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that tripartite cooperation had\r\n\r\nserved  us  well, not just in times of success, economic  growth\r\n\r\nand  prosperity.  Tripartism had enabled workers, employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  work as a team in  times  of  adversity  to\r\n\r\novercome  difficulties.  Several other MPs have  spoken  on  the\r\n\r\nrecession  in  1985-86.  I think that was  a  real  test  and  a\r\n\r\nhallmark   of   the  depth  and  strength  of   our   tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship.  In 1985-86, we faced the first economic recession\r\n\r\nafter  nearly  20  years of steady economic growth.   While  the\r\n\r\nonset  of recession was sudden, the Government was equally swift\r\n\r\nin  its  response.   An  extensive package of  anti-recessionary\r\n\r\nmeasures was formulated and implemented successfully with strong\r\n\r\nsupport  from  the  employers, trade unions and  their  members.\r\n\r\nThese  measures included the drastic reduction in the employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution from 25% to 10%, and the acceptance of  severe\r\n\r\nwage  restraint  and  even wage cut.  The  prompt  and  thorough\r\n\r\nimplementation of the cost-cutting measures helped companies and\r\n\r\nthe  economy to turn around quickly.  Growth resumed in 1987 and\r\n\r\nsince  then,  Singapore has continued to enjoy  strong  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  workers  have been rewarded with  substantial  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  and  good  bonuses. Coupled with low  inflation,  the\r\n\r\npurchasing power of workers has risen significantly and  so  has\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  life.  This is reflected  in  better  housing,\r\n\r\nbetter health care, better education, access to more leisure and\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities and even the  means  to  travel  widely\r\n\r\nduring their holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tripartite cooperation has allowed us to adopt a\r\n\r\nproactive  approach in tackling difficult issues  affecting  the\r\n\r\neconomy,   businesses,  and  the  well-being  of  our   workers.\r\n\r\nNominated  Member of Parliament, Dr Lee, has observed  that  the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council (NWC) is a tripartite institution.  I too\r\n\r\nwould  like to highlight the NWC as an example of tripartism  at\r\n\r\nwork.    The  NWC  comprises  representatives  from  the  union,\r\n\r\nemployers' organisation and the Government.  It was  set  up  in\r\n\r\n1972  to formulate and recommend wage increase guidelines.   The\r\n\r\nguiding  principle was that workers should be rewarded equitably\r\n\r\nbut  wage increases should not undermine our competitiveness  in\r\n\r\nthe  global  market.   Each year, the NWC issues  wage  increase\r\n\r\nguidelines  taking  into  consideration  past  year's   economic\r\n\r\nperformance, future economic prospects, productivity gains  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  achieved  and  wage costs as  compared  to  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  For the past 25 years, NWC guidelines have  helped\r\n\r\nto  achieve sustainable wage growth and ensure that the  economy\r\n\r\nremains   on   track   with  increasing  regional   and   global\r\n\r\ncompetition.  In many countries, wage negotiation is one of  the\r\n\r\nmost  troublesome aspects of labour-management relations,  often\r\n\r\nresulting  in  very  violent  consequences  and  protests.    In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  tripartite cooperation has allowed us to  turn  this\r\n\r\nprocess  into a rational and forward-looking system of resolving\r\n\r\nthe needs of both the workers and the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from dealing with wage increases, the NWC also\r\n\r\nstudied  other  wage-related  issues  to  further  enhance   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   Hence,  in 1986,  the  NWC  proposed  that  a\r\n\r\nflexible  wage  system  be introduced to  address  the  problems\r\n\r\ncaused  by  a  rigid wage system which hampered  the  employers'\r\n\r\nability  to cope with changes in the business cycle.  Currently,\r\n\r\nmore  than  70%  of  companies in Singapore have  implemented  a\r\n\r\nflexible  wage  system  which  has  enabled  them  to  be   more\r\n\r\nresponsive to changing business conditions and to remain  viable\r\n\r\ndespite the emergence of more competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Secretary-General of NTUC has pointed out, the\r\n\r\nflexible  wage system has allowed companies to first  trim  wage\r\n\r\ncost instead of turning to retrenchment as the first response to\r\n\r\na  downturn  in business cycle.  I hope that all employers  will\r\n\r\nheed  this message and adopt this approach of using the existing\r\n\r\nflexible  wage  system as a measure to respond to slower  growth\r\n\r\nand to avoid turning to retrenchment of their workers as a first\r\n\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to quote yet another example of\r\n\r\nhow  tripartism  had  helped  us to  address  difficult  issues,\r\n\r\nespecially issues which are going to affect us in the future and\r\n\r\nwhich  may not be immediately apparent to workers in particular.\r\n\r\nIn  late  1995, we established the Tripartite Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nExtension  of  the  Retirement  Age.   The  Committee  comprises\r\n\r\nGovernment representatives and representatives from a wide cross\r\n\r\nsection of employers' organisations and, of course, trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders.   The  Committee set out to study  the  complex  issues\r\n\r\nrelating   to  our  ageing  workforce  and  came  out   with   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  and bold package of measures  to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  an ageing workforce on our economic vitality.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures included the introduction of the base-up wage system to\r\n\r\nreplace the existing seniority-based wage system, wage reduction\r\n\r\nfor  workers after the age of 60, an alternative medical benefit\r\n\r\nscheme  to  encourage more responsible use of medical  benefits,\r\n\r\nand  the  capping of retrenchment benefits to help companies  to\r\n\r\nremain  competitive. Some of these measures are major departures\r\n\r\nfrom  current practices and may not be well-understood  or  well\r\n\r\naccepted by workers and employers at this juncture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the Tripartite Committee, there was full\r\n\r\nconsensus  and commitment from union leaders and employers  that\r\n\r\nthe adoption of these measures is necessary if Singapore were to\r\n\r\novercome the problems created by a rapidly ageing workforce  and\r\n\r\nto ensure that the economy remains competitive in the future.  A\r\n\r\nTripartite Working Committee has now been formed to monitor  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of these recommendations and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelop  guidelines for unions and management to smoothly  raise\r\n\r\nthe retirement age from 60 to 62.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effectiveness of the NWC and the Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Extension of the Retirement Age would not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  possible  without  a high level of cooperation  among  the\r\n\r\nthree  social  partners  and the ability  to  work  together  to\r\n\r\naddress and solve issues that have national implications.   This\r\n\r\nis  the essence of tripartism which has served us well and which\r\n\r\nwe must continue to nurture and strengthen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as pointed out by Mr Hawazi and\r\n\r\nseveral  other  MPs, this debate on tripartism is  taking  place\r\n\r\nagainst  a deeply disturbing backdrop of economic crisis spawned\r\n\r\nby the regional currency and stock market turmoils.  Because our\r\n\r\nfiscal  policies  have  always  been  based  on  sound  economic\r\n\r\nprinciples,  we have not been affected to the same  extent  that\r\n\r\nour   neighbouring   countries   have.    Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals  remain  strong  despite  the  regional  upheavals.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  continue to adopt prudent financial  policies.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is also aware of the problems facing businessmen\r\n\r\narising  from the recent financial turmoil and economic slowdown\r\n\r\nin  the  region.  These factors will be taken into consideration\r\n\r\nin formulating the FY 98/99 Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore cannot completely avoid the adverse\r\n\r\nimpact from the regional economic crisis.  We cannot assume that\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able to sail through this critical period  without\r\n\r\nsome  pains. We must, in fact,  be prepared that the tidal waves\r\n\r\nwhich  are  lashing at our neighbours will also  cause  us  some\r\n\r\ndamage.  We must be prepared for more difficulties ahead of  us,\r\n\r\nas it will take quite a few years for our neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nto  resume their normal growth.  1998, in particular, will be  a\r\n\r\nmore  difficult year for Singapore and growth is  likely  to  be\r\n\r\nless than what we have enjoyed before. It is thus more important\r\n\r\nat  this juncture for workers, trade unions, employers, and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  work  closely  together  to  ride  the   storm.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Cyrille Tan and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  MPs  that  we need to further strengthen  the  tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership to enhance our competitiveness so that we  can  meet\r\n\r\nthe  challenges  in the years ahead of us as we enter  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, Sir, is what must we do and what new ideas or\r\n\r\nareas  of  cooperation  will help to strengthen  tripartism.   I\r\n\r\nwould  now  like to touch on some of the important and practical\r\n\r\nways of strengthening tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in moving the motion, Mr Cyrille\r\n\r\nTan  referred  to  the  need for the  labour  movement  to  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  focused on workers' needs.  This, I  believe,  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  necessary.  For tripartism to work  effectively,  we\r\n\r\nmust   have  a  strong  labour  movement  capable  of  providing\r\n\r\nleadership   and   constructive  input  to  strengthen   labour-management  relation.  This means a strong NTUC  receiving  full\r\n\r\nsupport  from workers, with a growing membership fully supported\r\n\r\nby employers and Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has referred in his speech to the labour movement\r\n\r\nbeing controlled by the PAP.  I think my colleague, Mr Lim  Swee\r\n\r\nSay, has ably rebutted that point.  What I would like to say  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture  is  that the NTUC is a fully  independent  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement.  The rights of workers to be a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nunion  is enshrined in the Employment Act.  It is provided  for,\r\n\r\nsubject to the laws on trade unions.  So any worker or group  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who thinks that an NTUC-affiliated trade union  is  not\r\n\r\nserving  their  interest  will always have  the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nforming  their own unions, if they believe that it  will  better\r\n\r\nserve  their  interest.  The fact is that out of  82  registered\r\n\r\ntrade  unions in Singapore today, 73 are NTUC-affiliated.  There\r\n\r\nare  nine unions that have chosen not to be affiliated to  NTUC.\r\n\r\nSo  there are plenty of opportunities for workers who feel  that\r\n\r\ntheir  interests  have  not  been  served  to  find  alternative\r\n\r\navenues.   The  truth of the matter is that NTUC  has  over  the\r\n\r\nyears  proven to have been an effective champion of workers,  to\r\n\r\nhave  served the interest and addressed the concerns of all  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   That  is  why  it has remained the  mainstream  union\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, trade unions are mainly concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  pursuit of sectional interest at the expense of the overall\r\n\r\nnational  objective. This has often given rise to conflict  with\r\n\r\nthe  management and the government, which has resulted in poorer\r\n\r\neconomic performance and inability to compete.  As a result,  in\r\n\r\nmany  of  these countries where there has been a strong tendency\r\n\r\nto  adopt a confrontational and divisive kind of approach, trade\r\n\r\nunions  have  become  increasingly  irrelevant  in  meeting  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  a  highly competitive global  environment  which\r\n\r\nactually requires a high level of teamwork and cooperation among\r\n\r\nall the social partners, rather than more confrontation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, our trade unions have always\r\n\r\nplaced national objectives before sectional interest, and  long-term benefits of workers over short-term gains. This has ensured\r\n\r\nthe continued relevance of the labour movement in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nhas  allowed  the  movement to play an  important  role  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic development for the benefit of all workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the constructive and valuable\r\n\r\ncontributions  made  by the NTUC. The Government  therefore  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  supportive  of the labour movement's  efforts  and\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to  improve the economic and social  well-being  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  For example, the Government has provided assistance to\r\n\r\nthe  labour  movement to set up many cooperatives so that  these\r\n\r\ncooperatives  can  provide more and better  benefits  for  union\r\n\r\nmembership.  The Government has also provided annual  grants  to\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC's  Research  and  Administration  Unit  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nresearch  and provide expert assistance to the trade  unions  in\r\n\r\ntheir  wage  negotiation and industrial relations  matters.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  assist  the unions in developing higher  quality  and\r\n\r\nhigher  level  leadership, the Government  had  provided  annual\r\n\r\ngrants to the Singapore Institute of Labour Studies (SILS) where\r\n\r\nthey  conduct  courses on leadership development and  leadership\r\n\r\ntraining.  To ensure that the Institute has sufficient resources\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  upgrade  the  quality  of  union  leadership,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  given a one-time grant of  $2  million  to  the\r\n\r\nInstitute's Endowment Fund in lieu of the annual grant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Government has also supported the\r\n\r\nlabour   movement  in  the  development  of  many   social   and\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities  such as the Orchid  Country  Club  and\r\n\r\nPasir  Ris  Resort  by  allocating  large  tracts  of  land   at\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rates  through  the Singapore  Labour  Foundation\r\n\r\n(SLF).  More significantly, the Government has allocated a prime\r\n\r\nsite in Marina South for the construction of a new NTUC building\r\n\r\nin place of its existing office in Shenton Way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government will continue to\r\n\r\ngive  strong  support to the labour movement in its  efforts  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the well-being of  workers and to enable it to  play  a\r\n\r\nconstructive  and  important role in  economic  development  and\r\n\r\nnation-building. I am confident that the NTUC will  continue  to\r\n\r\nbe   a   valuable  social  partner  in  our  non-confrontational\r\n\r\ntripartite framework.  Because the PAP and the NTUC have similar\r\n\r\nobjectives to improve the lives of Singaporeans, we have  worked\r\n\r\nclosely together for the past 32 years.  This is not surprising.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the same objectives, we want to do the same  thing  to\r\n\r\nbenefit   Singaporeans.   So  we  work   together.    And   this\r\n\r\ncommonality has evolved over the years into a distinct symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelation  between  the  PAP  and the  NTUC.   This  relationship\r\n\r\ncomplements the already strong tripartite relationship which has\r\n\r\nserved us so well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the People's Action Party will explore\r\n\r\nvarious  ways and means to strengthen its links with  the  NTUC.\r\n\r\nFor a start, as the Prime Minister has indicated last Sunday, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  organising joint seminars to discuss important  issues\r\n\r\nconfronting workers and the economy.  Such seminars can  provide\r\n\r\nadditional inputs for our economic policies to further reinforce\r\n\r\nour   tripartite   relations  and  also  to   enhance   workers'\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of key issues confronting the country.   We  hope\r\n\r\nthat through such interactions, we will be able to reinforce the\r\n\r\nsymbiotic relations between the PAP and NTUC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that the economy remains stable, on an even\r\n\r\nkeel,  in such troubled times, the needs of companies must  also\r\n\r\nbe  addressed and Government and workers must help employers  to\r\n\r\ncope  with increasing competition which follows from the  recent\r\n\r\nmassive  devaluation  of  regional  currencies.   The  Nominated\r\n\r\nMember,  Mr  Tay Beng Chuan, had asked Government to review  its\r\n\r\nlevies  and charges in order to assist businessmen and to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  costs  of  doing  business.   I  have  already  earlier  on\r\n\r\nmentioned  that Government will take the new economic conditions\r\n\r\ninto consideration in formulating its financial policies for the\r\n\r\ncoming  year.  Government will do what is  necessary  to  assist\r\n\r\nemployers to cope with the economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated Member, Mdm Claire Chiang, had said that in\r\n\r\n1985-86 we were able to reduce the CPF contribution from 25%  to\r\n\r\n10%, a 15% cut, and she asked whether it is still feasible today\r\n\r\nto  reduce  cost by cutting the CPF.  I would say,  yes,  it  is\r\n\r\nentirely possible and feasible, but the question is whether  our\r\n\r\nsituation is so serious and so severe that we need to take  such\r\n\r\na  drastic step.  In 1985-86, we were in recession with negative\r\n\r\ngrowth.   But presently, although we are facing serious economic\r\n\r\nchallenges  and drastic change in the economic environment,  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood  of  Singapore being able to achieve  growth  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming year is still very strong although, as I said earlier on,\r\n\r\ngrowth  will  be  slower and harder to  come  by.   So  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture,  perhaps  it  is  premature  to  talk  about  reducing\r\n\r\nworkers'  CPF,  but  certainly the  fact  that  each  worker  is\r\n\r\ncontributing 20% plus another 20% from the employer to  the  CPF\r\n\r\nrepresents opportunities for us to reduce wage cost, if there is\r\n\r\nabsolute  need  to  do so.  And it would be  considered  if  the\r\n\r\nsituation deteriorates to that level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Deputy Speaker, growth will be slower this\r\n\r\nyear,  and  perhaps  for quite a few more years,  before  normal\r\n\r\ngrowth pattern in the region resumes.  So here I want to make  a\r\n\r\npoint  that  in view of the new circumstances, the new  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  workers must moderate their wage expectations  and\r\n\r\nbe prepared to work harder and more productively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  current  regional economic crisis may also result  in  more\r\n\r\ncompanies having to downsize and retrench workers.  My  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  help  affected  workers to seek  re-employment.   We  will\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up  a  tripartite  panel  to  coordinate  re-employment assistance to retrenched workers.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  easing of tight labour market, in view of retrenchment  and\r\n\r\nslowing  down  of the economy, may well mean that  the  concerns\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Nominated Member, Mdm Claire Chiang, about job-hopping  will  solve itself.  Because job-hopping to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent is very much a phenomenon linked to a tight labour market\r\n\r\nand  a rapidly growing economy.  When jobs are scarce, not  many\r\n\r\npeople  are  likely to hop around.  The current surveys  by  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  reflect the thinking of the workers  on  the  ground\r\n\r\nthat  their  concern today is more on job security than  bonuses\r\n\r\nand  wage increase.  I think the problem of job-hopping may well\r\n\r\nbe  on its way out and that may be replaced with a more critical\r\n\r\nconcern on security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Cyrille Tan, in moving his\r\n\r\nmotion,  also  spoke in support of the need  to  bring  in  more\r\n\r\nforeign  talent to supplement our local manpower.  I think  this\r\n\r\nrequires  courage and it also highlights the far-sightedness  of\r\n\r\nour  trade union leaders.  In the present environment, to  stand\r\n\r\nup  and  say, we support the Government's move to bring in  more\r\n\r\nforeign  talents, requires courage.  Because as a union  leader,\r\n\r\nthe  standard  reaction would be to protect their members  first\r\n\r\nand  therefore keep foreigners out.  But here he is prepared  to\r\n\r\nargue  that  in  order  to ensure that the  economy  can  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive  in  the future, we should continue to  maintain  an\r\n\r\nopen-door  policy towards talent and to welcome more  talent  to\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore to supplement our limited manpower resources.\r\n\r\nI think this is the characteristic of the far-sightedness of the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement  in Singapore.   Instead  of  adopting  a\r\n\r\ndefensive  and sectional interest attitude, labour leaders  have\r\n\r\nalways embraced the national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperspective  and  taken  the stand of, for  instance,  welcoming\r\n\r\nforeign talents to supplement the local workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with limited manpower resources,\r\n\r\nit is essential for us to attract talent to Singapore. Foreign talent\r\n\r\nwill add experience and skills to our economy and enable us\r\n\r\nto achieve faster growth, create more jobs and add value\r\n\r\nto   the  economy.   The  availability  of  foreign  talents  to\r\n\r\nsupplement local talents will make us more attractive to foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors.  We must continue to open our society and economy  to\r\n\r\nforeign talents.  Some Singaporeans may not quite understand why\r\n\r\nwe  should give away jobs to foreigners, especially during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  economic uncertainty.  This is where a strong  NTUC,\r\n\r\nwith  strong  grassroots support, can help  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nemployers  to  reach  out to the rank-and-file  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nbenefits that foreign talents bring to us and how they can  help\r\n\r\nus  to become more competitive.  The trade union movement has an\r\n\r\nimportant role to play in explaining to workers the rationale of\r\n\r\nour efforts in attracting foreign talents and to allay the fears\r\n\r\nthat foreigners may displace some Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to an area which many Members have spoken\r\n\r\nabout,  that  of  employability and  skills  training.   Several\r\n\r\nMembers  have noted that inwith  an increasingly knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, workers with lower education who are currently employed\r\n\r\nin  low value-added industries, may not be able to take up  jobs\r\n\r\nin  the high value-added industries of the future if they do not\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills.  I think this is a very relevant  point.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  BERI  in its annual ranking of workforces  round  the\r\n\r\nworld  has  also noted that our workers are not well  placed  in\r\n\r\nterms of skills and work attitude.  These are areas that we have\r\n\r\nto  make improvements on.  If nothing is done, many of the  low-skilled  and  low-educated workers may not  be  able  to  remain\r\n\r\nemployed   asthe  economy  upgrades,  to  cope  with  increasing\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  countries with larger and lower-wage  workers\r\n\r\nforce  the pace of changelabour force.  As our economy upgrades,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  real  danger that lower educated and  less-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers would be displaced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  may  end  up  being the new unemployable in the  workforce.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  structural unemployment currently experienced  by\r\n\r\nmany  European countries, which has been observed by Mr  Cyrille\r\n\r\nTan and the other speakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, knowing that this can happen, we can, and we must,\r\n\r\ntake  steps to avoid or minimise this undesirable outcome.  What\r\n\r\nwe have to do is to upgrade workers' skills.  As several Members\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out, nearly 40% of the labour force have less than\r\n\r\nsecondary  education.  We will have to invest more  in  workers'\r\n\r\ntraining  and  skills upgrading.ence, it is crucial  for  us  to\r\n\r\nupgrade workers' skills.  This is another area where the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  tripartism can provide a synergistic effect. The  effort  to\r\n\r\nupgrade workers' skills requires changes in the attitudes of the\r\n\r\nworkers  and the employers.  It will require, in fact, a  strong\r\n\r\nspirit  of tripartism to achieve the best results.  On its  own,\r\n\r\nGovernment   would   have  great  difficulties   in   overcoming\r\n\r\nresistance from workers who may not be convinced of the need for\r\n\r\nskills upgrading or are just simply unwilling or unable to  find\r\n\r\ntime  to  undergo  such  skills upgrading upgrading.   Likewise,\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  also  have  difficulty  overcoming  employers'\r\n\r\nmindset,  such as unwillingness to release workers for  training\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are unsure of the benefits or unwilling  to  bear\r\n\r\ntheir  share of the cost.  A tripartite effort with inputs  from\r\n\r\nall three parties - Government, unionsworkers and employers - is\r\n\r\nmore  likely  to  succeed in making workers and  employers  more\r\n\r\naware of the importance of skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such example of a tripartite effort was mentioned by Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Swee Say.  This is the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)\r\n\r\nwhich  is initiated and administered by NTUC, supported  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and and the employers.  Under the SRP, workers  with\r\n\r\nlower education in low value-added industries are given training\r\n\r\nin   skills  that  are  needed  by  the  new  high-value   added\r\n\r\noperations.   SRP  will  enhanceIn the process,  these  workers'\r\n\r\nskills  and employability would be greatly enhanced to we  could\r\n\r\navoid the problem of structural unemployment.  SRP is an example\r\n\r\nof  how  tripartism can synergise the resources  of  Government,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and  employers to achieve the  objective  of  Our\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to  produce  a well-trained  and  highly  skilled\r\n\r\nworkforce.   This will enable us  toenable Singapore to  attract\r\n\r\nhigh quality investments which would create more and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  paying jobs for workers.  Government will expand on  the\r\n\r\nscope  and outreach of the SRP to reach out to more workers  and\r\n\r\nemployers.   We will develop, apart from the SRP, new programmes\r\n\r\nto  provide training and skills upgrading for mature workers  to\r\n\r\nhelp them to cope with the changes in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next I would like to touch on an integrated approach\r\n\r\nin manpower training.  Manpower is ourwill always be Singapore's\r\n\r\nonly resource - I think this was mentioned by the Nominated  MP,\r\n\r\nMr  Tay  Beng Chuan.  It canwill also be a major limiting factor\r\n\r\nin  our  growth and could become an impediment to  new  business\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  business expansion.  We must  therefore  fully\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  manpower resources so as to hone  our  competitive\r\n\r\nedge  and remain relevant in an increasingly competitive  global\r\n\r\nenvironment.   This  is  why, as Mr Lim  Boon  Heng,  Secretary-General  of  NTUC, and several other MPs before him  noted,  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  welcomed  the  suggestion  made  at  the   PAP\r\n\r\nConvention   last   Sunday  for  the  Government   to   consider\r\n\r\nestablishing a central national agency to undertake the task  of\r\n\r\nmanpower planning, development, and management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, these crucial economic functions are undertaken\r\n\r\nby several Ministries and Government agencies.  For example, the\r\n\r\nEDB  is responsible for anticipating meeting the manpower  needs\r\n\r\nof  new  investments; the Productivity and  Standards  Board  is\r\n\r\ntasked  with  skills and productivity upgrading; the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment is in charge of granting Employment Passes to foreign\r\n\r\ntalents;  whilst  the while the Ministry of Labour,  apart  from\r\n\r\nmany other duties, is responsible fortasked with regulating  the\r\n\r\ninflow of mainly unskilled foreign workers.  Such an arrangement\r\n\r\nis  not  entirely satisfactory and can result in a mismatch  and\r\n\r\nlackslack of coordination and an an overall strategic direction.\r\n\r\nWe  shouldneed to look at manpower issues from a total  national\r\n\r\nperspective  and adopt an integrated and comprehensive  strategy\r\n\r\nfor   meeting  the  national  manpower  needs  in  numbers   and\r\n\r\nquality.approach  to  achieve  better  results.   An  integrated\r\n\r\napproach  would ensure that manpower planning, development,  and\r\n\r\nmanagement remains well-coordinated and relevant to the needs of\r\n\r\nan evolving economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by adopting an integrated approach, we can develop a\r\n\r\nworld-class workforce with capabilities and skills to succeed in\r\n\r\nthe  new  global knowledge economy.  The development of  such  a\r\n\r\nworld-class workforce requires total commitment and  efforts  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  Government, trade unions, workers and  employers.\r\n\r\nThe Government, in considering the need for an enlarged Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour with manpower planning and development function, will\r\n\r\nalso study closely how to involve the participation rate of  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement and employers' organisation in the  formulation\r\n\r\nand   implementation  of  manpower  policy,  including  workers'\r\n\r\ntraining and skills upgrading programmes.  This is in line  with\r\n\r\nour tripartite approach in meeting the challenges ahead and will\r\n\r\nenable  us  to  reap  the  full  benefitssynergy  of  tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in summary, tripartite cooperation\r\n\r\nhas  benefited Singapore  in at least three major areas. It  has\r\n\r\nbrought  about  industrial harmony, thus creating  a  favourable\r\n\r\ninvestment climate for rapid economic growth. It has enabled the\r\n\r\nthree  social  partners  to work closely  together  to  overcome\r\n\r\nadversity  during  bad times and share the  fruits  of  economic\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  good  times.  Equally important, ourthe  tripartite\r\n\r\nframework ofor cooperation has enabled the three social partners\r\n\r\nto  participate in and contribute to the formulation of national\r\n\r\npolicies.    The   tripartite   partners'   participation    and\r\n\r\ncontribution have enabled us to more effectively tackle  complex\r\n\r\nand difficult national issues that have long-term implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the task ahead of us is to build on the already sound\r\n\r\ntripartite  foundation.  We must strengthen  the  bonds  between\r\n\r\nworkers,  employers  and Government,  so  as  to  build  a  more\r\n\r\nresilient  and  adaptable  framework  fornetwork  of  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  to prepare Singapore for the challenges of  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.  While existing approaches have served us well, we must\r\n\r\nconsciously  review  their relevance  as  the  world  around  us\r\n\r\nchanges  and the regional economic crisis begins to  affect  us.\r\n\r\nWe  must examine our mindsets and make innovative use of  theour\r\n\r\ntripartite framework to address national manpower issues.  My\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry,  therefore,  welcomes new ideas  and  suggestions  put\r\n\r\nforward  by MPs on how tripartism could be elevated to a  higher\r\n\r\nplane  to  help develop a more efficient and highly  competitive\r\n\r\nworkforce.   Hon. Members have made many suggestions.   We  will\r\n\r\nstudy   these  carefully  and  we  will  discuss  them  in   the\r\n\r\nappropriate tripartite fora, such as NWC, tripartite  committees\r\n\r\nand  working  groups that have been formed to  address  specific\r\n\r\nissues.   Where feasible, we will implement these new ideas  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  workers and employers.  We  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our  work for a stronger tripartite relationship  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions by exploring new areas for tripartite cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank all the Members who have spoken in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please let me state again clearly. Mr Lim Boon Heng was\r\n\r\nelected  as  the Secretary-General of the NTUC by the grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders,  ie, by myself and others.  Also, he has been appointed\r\n\r\nas the Minister because he was elected as a Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nand the Prime Minister finds him fit to be a Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs who are advisors to unions, to put it bluntly, have a\r\n\r\ntough  job.  Sometimes, when they have dialogues with our  union\r\n\r\nleaders  and members, they were scolded for explaining unpopular\r\n\r\npolicies.  And our leaders are very blunt because some  of  them\r\n\r\nfrom  the ground can be very rough.  But they are doing  a  good\r\n\r\njob and I think we should thank them for continuing to do a good\r\n\r\njob.   This  is  because  of  the PAP  and  the  NTUC  symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere in the world have unions taken the initiative to\r\n\r\nvisit developed countries to study unemployment problems.  It is\r\n\r\nbecause  40% of our workforce today are 40 years and above  with\r\n\r\nlow  education  and they have contributed significantly  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy  for  the past years.  It would be a waste if  they  are\r\n\r\ncaught in structural unemployment.  That is why Mr Lim Swee  Say\r\n\r\nsaid  that we need action now and it is very serious because  we\r\n\r\nknow the problems of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC-PAP symbiotic relationship has been an important\r\n\r\nfactor  in Singapore's progress.  With the support of the  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  the  PAP Government has been able to create  conditions\r\n\r\nfor  wealth creation.  This has benefited employers and workers.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has  helped workers in  many  other  ways,  ie,\r\n\r\nthrough home ownership schemes, savings in the CPF, good medical\r\n\r\nand  social  programmes.  As a result, workers have  seen  their\r\n\r\nassets  enhanced.  Because we have this symbiotic  relation,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to  forge a tripartite relationship  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  employers  and  unions  working  together  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore a better place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Lee Boon Yang, the Labour Minister, says, \"For\r\n\r\ntripartism  to  work effectively, we must have a  strong  labour\r\n\r\nmovement.\"  This means a strong NTUC receiving full support from\r\n\r\nworkers, employers and Government.   A strong labour movement is\r\n\r\none  of the five pillars of NTUC 21, our blueprint for the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   Without a strong labour movement, we  cannot  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  other  four  objectives,  which  are  to  enhance  workers'\r\n\r\nemployability for life, to help make companies more competitive,\r\n\r\nto build a healthy body and a healthy mind, and to care more and\r\n\r\nshare  more.  A strong NTUC needs constant infusion  of  leaders\r\n\r\nfrom  the rank and file as well as from other sources,  a  point\r\n\r\nmade by Mr Lim Boon Heng, Secretary-General of NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tripartism to succeed, there must also be strong\r\n\r\ngovernment and strong employers as well.  As a trade unionist, I\r\n\r\nknow  what  it  means  to  deal with  strong  as  well  as  weak\r\n\r\nmanagement.   With a strong management, you strike  a  deal  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  it.  With a weak management, you can never come  to  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  arrangement.  Likewise, if union leaders  are  not\r\n\r\nstrong  and  cohesive, then we cannot serve our workers'  needs.\r\n\r\nIf  we  bicker for power, we will not have time to plan for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Then  we  can forget scenario planning.   Dr  Lee  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  many  projects  of  the  labour  movement  that  have\r\n\r\nreceived strong support from the Government.  I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure  my  fellow  unionists  would want  me  to  thank  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment for this strong support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face a difficult year ahead because of the regional\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.   There will be more  retrenchments.   So  we\r\n\r\nwelcome  the proposed formation of a tripartite force that  will\r\n\r\nhelp  retrenched workers get alternative employment as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.   I  hope employers will also heed Mr Lim Boon  Heng's\r\n\r\ncall  on  training.  Mr Lim told the employers that they  should\r\n\r\nnot  cut  back on training just because they face  a  period  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty.  I also hope that employers will see money spent on\r\n\r\ntraining as an investment for their well-being.  Because we have\r\n\r\ntripartism  in  place, we have the mechanism to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems confronting us today, we need to face them in the  same\r\n\r\nway  as we did in the past.  Now is the time for all parties  to\r\n\r\nreaffirm their commitment to tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job as a labour movement is to safeguard workers'\r\n\r\ninterest.  We know we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  do  this  job well if we can work only in tandem  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and employers.  So I hope the House will support  my\r\n\r\nmotion.   We  have seen how tripartism helps us in  all  fields.\r\n\r\nWhat we are asking the House to do is to recognise tripartism as\r\n\r\na  key competitive advantage of Singapore.

On measures taken to prevent\r\n\r\nsuch recurrence, my Ministry is reviewing the management of  the\r\n\r\nHome  as well as its security.  Since an earlier incident  which\r\n\r\ntook place in the Home,  the Ministry has taken steps to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  security of the Home.

The profile of offenders admitted  into\r\n\r\nSBH   `A'  and  our  other  juvenile  institutions  has  changed\r\n\r\nparticularly  over the last three years.  SBH `A'  continues  to\r\n\r\nface  an  overcrowding  problem  with  an  increasing  rate   of\r\n\r\nadmission.  The current population of boys is more aggressive in\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% of them have committed violent offences such as\r\n\r\nrioting,  involuntarily  causing hurt,  robbery,  assault,  etc.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, the group constituted about 20%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises of SBH `A' are a century old and its premises\r\n\r\nhave  been  encroached  upon with the development  of  the  Open\r\n\r\nUniversity  next  to  it.   Current  facilities  and  space  are\r\n\r\ninadequate for the conduct of programmes and activities for  the\r\n\r\nboys.   Fortunately in 10 months' time, SBH `A' will  be  moving\r\n\r\ninto a new Boys' Complex in Jurong by the end of the year.   The\r\n\r\nnew  Boys'  Complex  with better security  features  and  better\r\n\r\nfacilities will provide a better and more secure environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STRENGTHENING THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS ACT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity Development how far has his Ministry progressed in its\r\n\r\ncommitment, after the Winnie Ho enquiry, to amend and strengthen\r\n\r\nthe Children and Young Persons Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMP Mdm Chiang has asked about the progress on the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  plan to amend the Children and Young  Persons's  Act\r\n\r\n(CYPA).   First, let me stress that the review of  the C&YP  Act\r\n\r\nis not prompted by the Winnie Ho case but came about as a result\r\n\r\nof   a   recommendation  of  the  Inter-Ministry  Committee   on\r\n\r\nDysfunctional  Families,  Juvenile Delinquency  and  Drug  Abuse\r\n\r\nwhich  was made in 1995.  This Committee among other things  had\r\n\r\nproposed that the C&YP Act should be amended to provide for more\r\n\r\nsentencing  options to be made available for the management  and\r\n\r\ntreatment of juvenile delinquents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C&YP Act had been quite extensively reviewed and\r\n\r\namended in 1993.  In the current exercise we will look at  three\r\n\r\nbroad areas, namely the:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- treatment of juvenile offenders and children and young\r\n\r\npersons who are beyond parental control;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- investigation and management of children and young persons\r\n\r\nin need of care and protection; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- administration and supervision of institutions for children\r\n\r\nand young persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of child welfare and protection, one of the\r\n\r\namendments proposed aims to strengthen provisions to obtain  the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of  parents or guardians in seeking  treatment  and\r\n\r\nhelp  for  themselves, other than the victims.   This  provision\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that  the perpetrators and  the  children  can  be\r\n\r\ndirected  for  necessary  assessment  and  treatment.   Such   a\r\n\r\nprovision is already available under the Women's Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to report that the review has been completed and\r\n\r\nan amendment Bill will be tabled later this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  (i)  what is the current status of the development  of\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce in Singapore and (ii) how this compares with\r\n\r\nthat in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Status of EC Development in Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Computer Board (NCB) has been working with\r\n\r\nother Government agencies and the industry to promote electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce (EC).

We should encourage such initiatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE ONE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  (i)  how  the households for the Singapore  ONE  pilot\r\n\r\nproject  were  selected  and (ii) whether  it  is  possible  for\r\n\r\ninterested households to request for a link-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore ONE pilot was launched in June 1997 and is\r\n\r\nstill in its pilot phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households can access Singapore ONE through two network\r\n\r\noperators:  Singapore  Telecom  (SingTel)  and  Singapore  Cable\r\n\r\nVision  (SCV).   Island-wide service is  not  available  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  but both operators are upgrading their systems  with  a\r\n\r\nview  towards  island-wide service by end  1998.

Hence, LTA has constructed\r\n\r\nrain  shelters  under flyovers for motorcyclists to  take  cover\r\n\r\nduring  heavy  downpour.  These are concrete bays  located  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the main traffic to ensure the safety of the motorcyclists\r\n\r\nand  other  motorists.   LTA will extend such  shelters  to  all\r\n\r\nflyovers where space permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will be improving the existing rain shelters, such as\r\n\r\nthe  one along East Coast Parkway at the Tanjong Katong Flyover,\r\n\r\nby  expanding  the  bays  to  allow  them  to  accommodate  more\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists.  However, this may not always be possible at some\r\n\r\nof  the  other shelters given the space and physical constraints\r\n\r\nat  some  of these locations.  LTA will explore how to  overcome\r\n\r\nthese  constraints  without  compromising  the  safety  of   the\r\n\r\nmotorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 15 such rain shelters. Two more will be\r\n\r\nadded  at  the  flyovers  at the junction  of  the  Seletar  and\r\n\r\nTampines Expressways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
