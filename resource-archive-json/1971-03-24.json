In\r\n\r\naddition,  section 46 (2) of the  Act  states  that\r\n\r\nnothing  in subsection (1) of section 46  shall  be\r\n\r\nconstrued   as  preventing  an  employer   at   his\r\n\r\ndiscretion  from  paying  as  bonus  or  ex  gratia\r\n\r\npayment  an  amount that exceeds the equivalent  of\r\n\r\none  month's wages as an incentive to his employees\r\n\r\nto  increase their productivity or as a reward  for\r\n\r\ntheir  services. Bonus up to one month's salary  is\r\n\r\nnow therefore a negotiable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitem  between employer and employee. And it is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary to request factory owners to set aside  a\r\n\r\ncertain   percentage  from  the  factory's   annual\r\n\r\nprofits  to  be given as an annual bonus incentive.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the wise factory owner will also  usually\r\n\r\nmake an allowance for incentive or reward bonus  in\r\n\r\nhis  calculations  without being  told  to  do  so,\r\n\r\nalthough  some  timely urging on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nunions always helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already stated in the debate on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  financial policy that when the  effects\r\n\r\nof  the  accelerated  military run-down  have  been\r\n\r\nclearly  overcome, we shall have  to  consider  how\r\n\r\nbest  workers  should be enabled to  share  in  any\r\n\r\nincreased  profits where they result from increased\r\n\r\nproductivity  or  from a general expansion  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  One  of the ways would be to  make  bonus\r\n\r\npayments  negotiable beyond the present  limitation\r\n\r\nof one month's salary. This has been legislated for\r\n\r\nin certain countries and is the practice in others.\r\n\r\nIn  our  own  situation,  however,  this  could  be\r\n\r\nagainst  our  main  policy  of  attracting   middle\r\n\r\ntechnology   industries.  We  want   more   capital\r\n\r\nintensive   high  skills  and  high   value   added\r\n\r\nindustries in Singapore. They come mainly from  the\r\n\r\nWestern  industrial countries where the payment  of\r\n\r\nbonus is not a practice. West European and American\r\n\r\ncompanies  prefer to pay higher wages  rather  than\r\n\r\nbonuses. They want concealed benefits reduced to  a\r\n\r\nminimum  so  that they know where they  stand  from\r\n\r\nyear to year. This philosophy treats profits as the\r\n\r\nresult  of efficient management, and losses as  the\r\n\r\nresult  of the ineffective use of expensive labour,\r\n\r\nsince all employers pay their workers the same rate\r\n\r\nfor  the  job.  We  shall  make  a  decision  after\r\n\r\ncarefully weighing the pros and cons. Our  decision\r\n\r\nmust  advance  our purpose, namely,  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nliving standard of Singapore workers through higher\r\n\r\nskills and higher productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, will the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance   consider   requesting   established\r\n\r\nfactories  which  have over  the  years  made  good\r\n\r\nprofits  to  make  ex  gratia  payments  to   their\r\n\r\nemployees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I have already stated that there\r\n\r\nis  in the law a provision for unions to take  this\r\n\r\nup.

The\r\n\r\nsuggestion was that it was desirable to emulate the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  in  their  personnel   management\r\n\r\npractices and that we should introduce more  modern\r\n\r\nmanagement techniques. Like all institutions, there\r\n\r\nis  room  for  improvement in our Ministry  and  we\r\n\r\nshall,  of  course,  try our best  to  improve  our\r\n\r\ntechniques.  In  fact,  my  officers  have  already\r\n\r\nstarted courses in modern management techniques  in\r\n\r\nthe  Staff Training Institute, and we shall try  to\r\n\r\ninclude  in  them personnel management courses.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, I think our officers are doing very\r\n\r\nwell, in spite of the shortage that we have in  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Administrative Service,  in  tackling  the\r\n\r\nvarious  problems  that  are  coming  in  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistries. I think it is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomparatively  less  complex  matter  to   be   the\r\n\r\npersonnel  manager of a firm with 10,  15,  100  or\r\n\r\neven  500  workers  than  to  be  in  charge  of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministry where the workers are  counted\r\n\r\nin  tens  of  thousands. Even if you  consider  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  when you come to  companies  like\r\n\r\nGeneral  Motors or Imperial Chemical Industries,  I\r\n\r\nthink you will find that the need for uniformity in\r\n\r\ntreatment,  in  service conditions  and  any  other\r\n\r\ncompany  practices are not dissimilar to  those  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government Ministries, and that the  decisions\r\n\r\nhave to be consistent, and if you have a precedent,\r\n\r\nyou must be prepared to apply that precedent to all\r\n\r\nother employees in the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a comment that the grievances of\r\n\r\nthe  various civil service organisations  were  not\r\n\r\nbeing  handled  expeditiously. It was  stated  that\r\n\r\nthere  was only one Executive Officer to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  daily-rated  workers. This  is  certainly  not\r\n\r\ncorrect.  If the Member will look at the Government\r\n\r\nDirectory,  he  will  see  that,  apart  from   the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary, the Deputy Secretary  is  also\r\n\r\nin  charge of service conditions, and there  is  an\r\n\r\nAssistant Secretary dealing specifically with daily-rated  workers, although a Higher Executive Officer\r\n\r\nalso handles them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the claims of grievances of\r\n\r\nworkers,  I  believe that last year we handled  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the technical services, as a result  of\r\n\r\nwhich  a  new  scheme  of  service  conditions  was\r\n\r\nimplemented in October last year.

Last night when\r\n\r\nhe  replied to my questions, he admitted  that  the\r\n\r\nprices  of daily necessities were actually  on  the\r\n\r\nincrease.  He  also did not agree that  a  loaf  of\r\n\r\nbread should be increased by five cents. He thought\r\n\r\nthat  actually  there should  be  only  a  one-cent\r\n\r\nincrease. I would like to ask him what measures  he\r\n\r\nwill take to check this spate of price increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that his reply rather\r\n\r\nconflicts with that given by his Minister of State.\r\n\r\nYesterday  his  Minister of  State  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would try its best to help promote  the\r\n\r\nsetting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  of a consumers' association in order to protect\r\n\r\nthe interest of the consumers, whereas the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself was not too keen to help set it up.

The answer, therefore, to the first question\r\n\r\n-  in  what  way  can we help? -  is  to  help  the\r\n\r\nconsumers' association help themselves.

Reference was also made  to\r\n\r\nthe  academic qualifications of civil servants.  My\r\n\r\nconcern is whether action is being taken to improve\r\n\r\nthe performance of our civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  on  the establishment  of  the  Staff\r\n\r\nTraining  Institute. He has given adequate  details\r\n\r\nin  his  speech  at the official  opening  of  this\r\n\r\ninstitute.  I note that the courses will  not  only\r\n\r\nbenefit  administrative  officers  but  also  other\r\n\r\nsubordinate  categories  of  staff  who   will   be\r\n\r\nincluded in this training scheme. The Minister  has\r\n\r\ngenerally  clarified the sort of courses that  will\r\n\r\nbe   provided.  If  I  may  ask  a  few  incidental\r\n\r\nquestions on this. Is it correct for us to  presume\r\n\r\nthat  the  instructors will come  from  within  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service itself as well as from  outside  the\r\n\r\nservice? I observe that a certain sum is designated\r\n\r\nas  allowance  to instructors. May I ask  what  the\r\n\r\nrates of allowance will be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamentally, may I suggest that a basic\r\n\r\nfull-time  staff be established for this institute,\r\n\r\nand that ancillary staff could be composed of part-time instructors, either from within or without the\r\n\r\ncivil  service? In this way it will be  easier  for\r\n\r\nintegrated packages of courses to be designed which\r\n\r\nwill  afford  training in depth  and  result  in  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  improvement in the  calibre  of  civil\r\n\r\nservice  officers in the various grades.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nby having a corps of full-time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaff,  it will be more convenient  and  more\r\n\r\neasily manageable for evaluation of the effects  of\r\n\r\nsuch courses to be made and for appropriate follow-up action to be organised. I hope also that courses\r\n\r\nwill  be  conducted  in creative  learning-teaching\r\n\r\nsituations without too much subscription  to  chalk\r\n\r\nand  talk  and rows of civil servants listening  to\r\n\r\nthe  guru  who  may happen to be a  senior  officer\r\n\r\nhanding it out to those who sit at his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not notice that even under O. C. A. R, there\r\n\r\nare  votes  for audiovisual equipment. I hope  that\r\n\r\nwhen  courses  are given, every appropriate  resort\r\n\r\nwill  be made to devices in terms of the format  of\r\n\r\nthe  course as well as in terms of equipment, which\r\n\r\nwill   facilitate  training  and  result  in  civil\r\n\r\nservants   considering   it   a   worth-while   and\r\n\r\ninteresting endeavour to have participated in  this\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would also like to know what is\r\n\r\nmeant by \"on-the-job training\". If it is considered\r\n\r\nthat on-the-job training is important to supplement\r\n\r\non-course training, what is being done to formalise\r\n\r\nor  institutionalise  such procedures,  apart  from\r\n\r\nflinging the Instruction Manual at a new incumbent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the courses\r\n\r\nwhich  are  being  run have been  mentioned  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech to which the Member for Katong has referred.\r\n\r\nIn  1971 we will begin with an intermediate  course\r\n\r\nin   Management   and  Public  Administration   for\r\n\r\nadministrative  officers, and  go  on  to  advanced\r\n\r\ncourses in Management and Public Administration for\r\n\r\nmore senior administrative officers. We will induct\r\n\r\nand  provide  intermediate courses for officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  General  Executive and Clerical  Services.  We\r\n\r\nwill   have   courses   for  Personal   Assistants,\r\n\r\nReceptionists,  Telephone  Operators,  and  Counter\r\n\r\nClerks. We have courses in the Outward Bound School\r\n\r\nand  in  the  National  Youth  Leadership  Training\r\n\r\nInstitute  for  officers in supervisory  positions.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  will  have Language courses  for  officers\r\n\r\nrequired to pass language examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructors for the courses will come from\r\n\r\nvarious  sources. I think the major  part  will  be\r\n\r\ndrawn  from the civil servants themselves, but  for\r\n\r\nthe  intermediate, advanced and induction  courses,\r\n\r\nexperienced  and  senior civil  servants,  together\r\n\r\nwith  officers  from statutory  boards,  will  give\r\n\r\nlectures. But we will also invite qualified persons\r\n\r\nfrom  the private sector and institutions  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  University  of Singapore, Nanyang  University,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Institute of Management,  and  other\r\n\r\nbodies   to   give  courses  in  their  fields   of\r\n\r\nspecialisation,   especially   in    relation    to\r\n\r\nmanagement practices and techniques which have been\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  Members  in relation  to  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowances which will be paid to instructors\r\n\r\nand  lecturers  vary  according  to  the  level  of\r\n\r\ninstruction and nature of the courses. Generally, I\r\n\r\nthink   the   intermediate  and   advanced   course\r\n\r\ninstructors  will be paid up to $25 an hour,  while\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  language instruction  there  are\r\n\r\nvarious  rates;  maybe  the Adult  Education  Board\r\n\r\nscale  of fees will be adopted. These vary from  $4\r\n\r\nto  $10 an hour. Staff members of the institute who\r\n\r\nalso  give lectures will not be paid any fee. There\r\n\r\nwill be some permanent members, but in view of  the\r\n\r\nvery wide field that we are going to cover, it will\r\n\r\nnot  be  possible  for us to have  full-time  staff\r\n\r\nlecturers in all the various courses that we want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to equipment, the Member for Katong is\r\n\r\nquite right - at the moment we have no audio-visual\r\n\r\nequipment, but we hope that as we go on this can be\r\n\r\nprovided. It is always possible, of course, to  get\r\n\r\nit  on  loan from the various organisations.  Until\r\n\r\nthe  need  is proved, I do not think we  should  go\r\n\r\nimmediately into the purchase of this equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to what is meant by on-the-job\r\n\r\ntraining,  it  means that, instead of just  getting\r\n\r\nnew recruits into the administrative service thrown\r\n\r\ninto  the  jobs,  as was the case before,  we  will\r\n\r\nprovide   a  more  supervised  kind  of  on-the-job\r\n\r\ntraining.  We have, therefore, in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance created a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary's post and the officer will be  in\r\n\r\ncharge of all matters relating to training as  well\r\n\r\nas supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer will see that the new recruits are\r\n\r\nproperly  looked after in relation to  the  courses\r\n\r\nattended.  It  is not so much a question  of  posts\r\n\r\nrequiring to be filled by officers as the  training\r\n\r\nof  the  administrative officers. Supervision  will\r\n\r\nmean   that  from  time  to  time  there  will   be\r\n\r\ninterviews   with   the   administrative    officer\r\n\r\nconcerned to see that he is making progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I referred\r\n\r\nto  the  possibility of a full-time  staff,  I  was\r\n\r\nthinking especially of the problem of evaluation.

His proposal was to change the\r\n\r\nuniform  for  one made of better refined  material.\r\n\r\nThe   then  Minister  for  Finance  said  that  the\r\n\r\nproposal  of the Member for Anson was an  excellent\r\n\r\none  and  that he would look into the matter.

I hope that at least\r\n\r\nby the end of the current year, the Government will\r\n\r\ndo  something  about changing the uniforms  of  our\r\n\r\nuniformed staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  raised the question of uniforms at the  last\r\n\r\nbudget  session and my predecessor had promised  to\r\n\r\nlook into the matter. In fact, action to change the\r\n\r\nmaterial  for the uniforms was taken in April  last\r\n\r\nyear.  However, as the supply of uniforms to office\r\n\r\nboys and other Division Four grades is a matter  of\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the Amalgamated  Union  of  Public\r\n\r\nEmployees,  we had to consult them to  see  whether\r\n\r\nthey  agreed on this matter.

Can the Minister\r\n\r\nlet me know the details of this expenditure item?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has\r\n\r\nfor  some  considerable time been able to construct\r\n\r\nmany  kinds  of  small ships -  tongkangs,  yachts,\r\n\r\nfishing vessels, tugs, water boats, patrol vessels,\r\n\r\ncustoms launches, barges, etc. It has no capability\r\n\r\nas yet of constructing large ocean-going vessels of\r\n\r\nthe   more  sophisticated  kind.  In  view  of  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of   the  shipbuilding   industry   in\r\n\r\nstimulating the very wide range of skills  required\r\n\r\nin   industrial  development  and  its  effects  on\r\n\r\nsupporting    industries    producing    machinery,\r\n\r\nequipment,  fittings and other  materials  required\r\n\r\nfor  the  ships, the Government has considered  how\r\n\r\nbest to acquire the capability of building these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarger  vessels. The answer would appear to  be  to\r\n\r\nstart  with the construction of standard-type cargo\r\n\r\nvessels.  Training  in  such construction  will  be\r\n\r\nsystematised  and  productivity  can   be   rapidly\r\n\r\nincreased  with the construction of each succeeding\r\n\r\nship  of the same kind. By this means, it is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  after  the  first  few  ships,  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  large  cargo  vessels  will  have  become\r\n\r\ninternationally competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier stages, however, it will be\r\n\r\nnecessary   for  Government  to  provide  financial\r\n\r\nassistance,  first, in training and,  secondly,  in\r\n\r\nsubsidising  the  difference between  international\r\n\r\ncosts  and  costs in Singapore arising out  of  the\r\n\r\ninitial  lower  productivity. The  Government  has,\r\n\r\naccordingly, jointly with Jurong Shipyard (Private)\r\n\r\nLimited,   Ishikawajima-Harima   Heavy   Industries\r\n\r\nLimited,  and  the Development Bank  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nestablished   the  Jurong  Shipbuilders   (Private)\r\n\r\nLimited   for  this  purpose.  The  shipyard   will\r\n\r\nconstruct Freedom-type cargo vessels which are  the\r\n\r\nstandard type of vessels and are versatile in  that\r\n\r\nthey  can take both general and bulk cargo with  an\r\n\r\napproximate deadweight of 15,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial assistance which has been provided\r\n\r\nfor  training  workers  is a  subject  of  a  later\r\n\r\nquestion  by  the Member for Whampoa,  and  I  will\r\n\r\nexplain it in that amendment. The subsidy financing\r\n\r\nfor  initially  lower productivity will  cover  the\r\n\r\nfirst  15 Freedom-type vessels and will be  subject\r\n\r\nto  a  limit of $14 million. For the year  1971-72,\r\n\r\nthe subsidy required and entered in the budget will\r\n\r\nbe   for   two  ships  and  will  cost  $6,030,000.\r\n\r\nSubsequent  subsidies will fall  very  rapidly  per\r\n\r\nship  in accordance with the learning curve of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, as I understand from the\r\n\r\nMinister's  reply,  this is going  to  be  a  joint\r\n\r\nventure with a Japanese shipyard. It seems that the\r\n\r\nprinciple of a subsidy, or a lump sum grant to  any\r\n\r\nindustry, is well taken provided that the  learning\r\n\r\nprocess has to be established and the technological\r\n\r\ncapability has yet to be learnt. In other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords,  the  people are totally new to  the  entire\r\n\r\nprocess. But here I gather we have a joint  project\r\n\r\nwith  well-known shipbuilders. So  I  am  wondering\r\n\r\nabout  the economics of the issue and whether  they\r\n\r\nreally deserve such a big subsidy - $14 million for\r\n\r\n15  ships,  if I understood the Minister correctly,\r\n\r\nwhich  amounts to a great deal even on a  per  ship\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the shipyard,\r\n\r\nof  course,  is  going to be run  by  Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy Industries as one partner, the Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard  as the second partner, and the Government\r\n\r\nand  the Development Bank of Singapore as the third\r\n\r\npartner  in equal shares. As far as the  I.H.I, is\r\n\r\nconcerned, there is nothing for them to  learn  and\r\n\r\nthe subsidy is not really in relation to the I.H.I.\r\n\r\nbut in relation to the training of our workers. The\r\n\r\ntraining,  as I have explained, will be on  another\r\n\r\nvote.  But in this particular case, the subsidy  is\r\n\r\nfor   the   lower   productivity   which   is   the\r\n\r\nproductivity  not  of I.H.I, workers  but  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  workers  who  are  sent  to  Japan   for\r\n\r\ntraining  and who, on their return, will still  not\r\n\r\nhave the same productivity as their counterparts in\r\n\r\nJapan.  So  in order that we can sell ships  at  an\r\n\r\ninternationally competitive price,  the  difference\r\n\r\nmust be made up in some way, and this is the way in\r\n\r\nwhich we are providing the difference by a subsidy.\r\n\r\nWhether this is the best way of going about getting\r\n\r\nthe  capability is a matter of opinion. But at  the\r\n\r\ntime when we entered into this agreement, there did\r\n\r\nnot seem to be an alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, can the Minister say\r\n\r\nwhether the alternative of providing a loan, albeit\r\n\r\non   softer   terms  than  commercial  loans,   was\r\n\r\nconsidered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> We tried to get the best terms\r\n\r\npossible  and,  in the end, it was found  that  the\r\n\r\nonly  way in which we could do this was by  way  of\r\n\r\nsubsidy.

But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, recently the senior staff in  charge\r\n\r\nof  the People's Association have been running  the\r\n\r\nAssociation in such a way that it has resulted in a\r\n\r\nlot  of heart-burning among the other staff.  There\r\n\r\nare  several points I wish to bring up now, because\r\n\r\nthe staff dare not speak up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is in relation to the transfer of\r\n\r\nstaff.  I  have  been  given  to  understand   that\r\n\r\nrecently  the supervisors of community  centres  at\r\n\r\nthe  headquarters of the People's Association,  who\r\n\r\nare  very  old  and  experienced staff,  have  been\r\n\r\ndemoted because they do not know English, and  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sent  to  take  up  the  post  of  Organising\r\n\r\nSecretaries in the various community centres. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand why the officers-in-charge  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  still harbour  the  colonial\r\n\r\nthinking  that the English language is supreme.  We\r\n\r\nknow   that   these  old  staff  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation have made a lot of sacrifices  for  the\r\n\r\nAssociation.  Their loyal contributions  have  been\r\n\r\nvery great indeed, in spite of their deficiency  in\r\n\r\nthe  English  language.  But,  instead  of  getting\r\n\r\npromotion  and recognition, they have been  demoted\r\n\r\nto  the  post  of  Organising  Secretaries  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious community centres. I do not object  to  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of bilingualism, but as far as I know,\r\n\r\nthe  senior  administrative staff at  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  are mostly monolingual. Most  of  them\r\n\r\nknow  English but not Chinese. How is it that these\r\n\r\npeople  are  not demoted? There should be  a  fixed\r\n\r\nprinciple and criterion to go by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the lack of\r\n\r\nunderstanding between the administrative staff  and\r\n\r\nthe    people.   The   People's   Association   has\r\n\r\ncontributed  much  to  our political  and  economic\r\n\r\nstability.   As   we  know,   in   the   past   the\r\n\r\nadministrative  staff  in the People's  Association\r\n\r\nwent to the masses to find out the feelings of  the\r\n\r\npeople, and to come into contact with the community\r\n\r\nleaders at grass-root\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel.  At  present,  perhaps   because   of\r\n\r\nreorganisation  in  the  People's  Association   or\r\n\r\nbecause  they have no time, a lot of administrative\r\n\r\nstaff  do  not go down to the grass-root level,  to\r\n\r\nthe community centres, or to the constituencies  in\r\n\r\norder  to  understand  the  actual  conditions  for\r\n\r\npolicy   administration.   For   example,   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  when recommendations were  made  for\r\n\r\nmembership  of  the  Women's Sub-Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nManagement  Committee, these administrative  staff,\r\n\r\nwho enjoy working in air-conditioned rooms, did not\r\n\r\nunderstand the actual problems involved and so they\r\n\r\nrejected   the   recommendations.   Instead    they\r\n\r\nrecommended somebody else who was about three miles\r\n\r\naway  from  my  constituency as  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Section of my Management Committee.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand the theory and thinking behind this\r\n\r\nkind  of  recommendation. I think  this  is  rather\r\n\r\nunrealistic and inapplicable to the community  work\r\n\r\nin  the  area.  I  wonder whether  such  a  way  of\r\n\r\nthinking  will make any contribution to  our  local\r\n\r\ncommunity  work.  I  am  not  blaming  anybody   in\r\n\r\nparticular  or  the authorities concerned.  What  I\r\n\r\nwant  them to do is to try to understand the  local\r\n\r\nconditions  of each constituency before  they  make\r\n\r\nany  decision. They should at least go and get  the\r\n\r\nviews of the M.P. concerned before they come to any\r\n\r\nfinal decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is in relation to the training of\r\n\r\nAssistant Organising Secretaries. Over the past  10\r\n\r\nyears  the People's Association has achieved a  lot\r\n\r\nof   success.  All  this  is  attributable  to  the\r\n\r\ncontributions   from  the  staff,   including   the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Organising Secretaries.  But  after  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  we  understand that  these  serving\r\n\r\nOrganising Secretaries have been forced to  go  for\r\n\r\nfurther  training  in the National  Youth  Training\r\n\r\nInstitute. Some of them are already quite  old  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  been asked to participate  in  rigorous\r\n\r\ntraining  in  various fields and subjects.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase   of  women  officers,  they  face  a   rather\r\n\r\ndifficult  situation. Actually  they  already  have\r\n\r\nenough experience in organisation and they understand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Over-enthusiasm  in  rigorous\r\n\r\ntraining is unnecessary. If, in the opinion of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association, all  the  officers  must  be\r\n\r\nqualified  as  well  as rugged, then  training  and\r\n\r\nselection  should be undertaken before  recruitment\r\n\r\nand  final  confirmation. Otherwise, if experienced\r\n\r\nold staff who have served for ten years have to  go\r\n\r\nfor  training,  perhaps the Minister will  consider\r\n\r\nstarting  such training for all, from the  Director\r\n\r\nhimself  down to the gardener below. Then  you  can\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  equal treatment; otherwise  those  new\r\n\r\nsenior staff will just sit down and enjoy the  ease\r\n\r\nand  peace  obtained and fought for  by  the  older\r\n\r\nstaff. Instead of thanking and promoting these  old\r\n\r\nstaff for their achievements, they are demoting and\r\n\r\nforcing  them to go for another course of  training\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of reorganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points that I have raised are, in my view,\r\n\r\nworthy of consideration by the Minister, and I hope\r\n\r\nhe will give a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  it is not  true  to  say  that\r\n\r\nInspectors in the People's Association are  removed\r\n\r\nfrom  their  posts  or  demoted  because  of  their\r\n\r\ndeficiency in English. In fact, as far as  I  know,\r\n\r\nthere was at least one person among those who  were\r\n\r\nso transferred who came from an English School. The\r\n\r\nposts of Inspectors in the People's Association are\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  promotional grade. They are  held  by\r\n\r\npromising  Organising Secretaries on trial  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  assessing their suitability for promotion\r\n\r\nto  the next higher grade of Assistant Supervisors.\r\n\r\nThe  duties of an Inspector involve the supervision\r\n\r\nof  a  number of community centres, giving guidance\r\n\r\nto the central staff, and representing the Director\r\n\r\nat   Management  Committee  meetings.   The   posts\r\n\r\nthemselves  carry  no  increment  except  that  the\r\n\r\nInspectors are all paid each an allowance of $30  a\r\n\r\nmonth  for  discharging duties  more  onerous  than\r\n\r\nthose  of  the  Organising Secretaries.  There  are\r\n\r\ninstances  where  Organising Secretaries  who  have\r\n\r\nperformed their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduties satisfactorily in the centres have failed to\r\n\r\nlive up to expectations in their new posting in the\r\n\r\nInspectorate.  As  a  result, communication  breaks\r\n\r\ndown between the Association's headquarters and the\r\n\r\nManagement Committees. The transfer of the staff in\r\n\r\nquestion  back  to  the  community  centre   is   a\r\n\r\nnecessary  step  in  the  reorganisation   of   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association's headquarters to ensure  that\r\n\r\nits  administrative machinery will  not  be  bogged\r\n\r\ndown.  It  is appreciated that the staff  concerned\r\n\r\nhave  given  many  years of loyal  service  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association, but it is also imperative  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that promotion is based on merit  rather\r\n\r\nthan  seniority, and that the ambition of the young\r\n\r\nand intelligent workers is not frustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar may be further informed\r\n\r\nthat the persons concerned have suffered no loss in\r\n\r\nsalary  as  a result of the transfer.  A  few  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  actually  working  in  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation's   headquarters  since   1969,   doing\r\n\r\nclerical  work since they were found  not  suitable\r\n\r\nfor their duties in the Inspectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the appointment of members in the Women's\r\n\r\nSub-Committee, the appointment of such  members  is\r\n\r\ngoverned by the rules of that Sub-Committee. One of\r\n\r\nthe rules is that the persons appointed must either\r\n\r\nlive  or  work  in the constituency  in  which  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre is situated. In the specific  case\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member, I was given to understand\r\n\r\nthat the person recommended by him was found to  be\r\n\r\nneither living nor working in the constituency. She\r\n\r\nwas  therefore not accepted. Subsequently a request\r\n\r\nwas  received  by the People's Association  from  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  worker  to  serve in  the  Women's  Sub-Committee of one of our community centres.  As  she\r\n\r\nwas working in the Paya Lebar constituency, she was\r\n\r\ntherefore recommended to the Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nfor  consideration, but unfortunately she  was  not\r\n\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Members need not bother about this now\r\n\r\nbecause the rules of the Women's Sub-Committee have\r\n\r\nbeen amended since last September to allow for more\r\n\r\nflexibility  in the appointment of members  to  the\r\n\r\nCommittee. So long as the Member of Parliament  for\r\n\r\nthat  constituency is satisfied that the person  is\r\n\r\nuseful  for  that  particular  area,  she  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed  to the Women's Sub-Committee  regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether  or not she is residing or  working  in\r\n\r\nthat area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also add that not all of the staff in the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association are working in air-conditioned\r\n\r\noffices;  only one or two of the more senior  staff\r\n\r\nhave this facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of sending the Assistant\r\n\r\nOrganisers  for  training  in  the  National  Youth\r\n\r\nLeadership  Training Institute, I  would  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  the proper thing to do in order to  widen\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  their perception so that  they  can\r\n\r\nperform their work better in the community centres.\r\n\r\nNo  doubt  those whom we have sent are rather  old,\r\n\r\nbut  not  all  of them are old. Many  of  them  are\r\n\r\nactually  under the age of 40 years. I  can  assure\r\n\r\nthe Member that the course in this Institute is not\r\n\r\nso  strenuous as to break them. The purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  they are given proper training  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  do their work well. There is  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying  Huo tao lao hsueh tao lao, which means  \"as\r\n\r\nlong  as  we live, we must take the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nlearn.\"  So these Assistant Organisers are sent  to\r\n\r\nthe  Institute for training. So what! Do you  think\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  stand the rigours of the training?  I\r\n\r\ncan  still remember that three years ago  I  myself\r\n\r\nwent  through certain training in the Army.  I  did\r\n\r\nnot find it too bad, although at times it was quite\r\n\r\nstrenuous.  I thought it was a very good  idea.  In\r\n\r\nfact, I regretted that this training was instituted\r\n\r\nat  such  a late stage. That is because there  were\r\n\r\nnot enough vacancies in the Institute. But since we\r\n\r\nhave   already  trained  almost  every   Organising\r\n\r\nSecretary in the People's Association, we therefore\r\n\r\nextend the training to Assistant Organisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to supplement what I have said and to\r\n\r\nraise a few more questions. I do not object to what\r\n\r\nthe Minister's contention is, that we must learn as\r\n\r\nlong  as we live. But we must learn what is useful.\r\n\r\nlf  we learn something which is useless, it is  not\r\n\r\nworth learning at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to stress is the fact that\r\n\r\nmost of the Organising Secretaries are females.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, biologically they are quite different  from\r\n\r\nour  Minister.  If,  after they  have  given  birth\r\n\r\nseveral  times,  they are made to  run  for  a  few\r\n\r\nmiles, it is very troublesome for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter I wish to raise with the Minister\r\n\r\nis  this.  He has said that those people  who  were\r\n\r\ndemoted have not lost anything by way of salary. My\r\n\r\npoint  is, if anybody has made a mistake,  then  he\r\n\r\ndeserves  to  be demoted. But I know at  least  two\r\n\r\npersons, and a few others who were affected but who\r\n\r\nhave  not complained to me, that although they were\r\n\r\nappointed as Inspectors, they have been sent to the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  as Organising  Secretaries.  So\r\n\r\nmorally it is wrong to put them in cold storage  by\r\n\r\ndemoting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not think the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Organising Secretaries are sent  to  the\r\n\r\nInstitute to learn something which is not  relevant\r\n\r\nto  their  work. The training in the  Institute  is\r\n\r\nquite relevant to their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for sending female workers to the Institute, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see why there should be any discrimination\r\n\r\nas  to  the sex. I do not want to mention  anything\r\n\r\nabout the female sex, but I think they are able  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  training given to them in the Institute.\r\n\r\nAs  I have already said, the inspector grade is not\r\n\r\na  promotional grade, but a transitional step. They\r\n\r\nare  put there on trial to see whether they can  be\r\n\r\npromoted  to  the next higher grade.  If  they  are\r\n\r\nfound  not suitable, they are posted back to  their\r\n\r\noriginal  grade. They cannot stay in the  posts  of\r\n\r\nInspectors forever, because these are not posts for\r\n\r\nthem to fill. This is just a scheme to assess their\r\n\r\nability and to see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  they can be promoted. There is no question\r\n\r\nof sending them to places where nobody wants to go.\r\n\r\nThe  community  centre is far  from  being  such  a\r\n\r\nplace. It is, in fact, a very lively place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister if he will  exempt  the  old\r\n\r\nfemale  Assistant Organising Secretaries  from  the\r\n\r\nvery difficult physical training that they have  to\r\n\r\nundergo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think most of them, whether\r\n\r\nmale  of female, are sent there for training  under\r\n\r\nthe age of 40.

It is even more curious  to\r\n\r\nnote  that this demotion has taken place after  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation. So you just cannot put a person  on\r\n\r\ntrial    for   eight   years   and   then,    after\r\n\r\nreorganisation,   and  after  the  English-educated\r\n\r\nsenior staff have taken over, say that he has  been\r\n\r\nput  on trial and it has been found that he is  not\r\n\r\nsuitable.

Junior  customs\r\n\r\nstaff  are required to declare the amount of  money\r\n\r\nthey  have  with them when reporting for  duty  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they go off duty.

The\r\n\r\nlast  known case was on the 28th of February, 1970,\r\n\r\nwhen  a  probationary customs  officer  was  caught\r\n\r\naccepting  a  bribe  of $20 and his  services  were\r\n\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, circulars were also handed to transport\r\n\r\noperators   warning  them  not  to  bribe   customs\r\n\r\nofficers.

In the newly  developed\r\n\r\nas well as old housing estates, the annual value of\r\n\r\nproperties has been increased by 100, 150 and  even\r\n\r\n200 per cent during the last two years. Some of the\r\n\r\nhouses  are  owner-occupied and some are  let  out.\r\n\r\nProperty  tax  for  owner-occupied  houses  becomes\r\n\r\nhigher  when the annual value goes up. The Property\r\n\r\nTax Division gives a concession to owner occupiers,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is  no guarantee that the property  tax\r\n\r\nwill remain the same. The Property Tax Division can\r\n\r\nwithdraw this concession at any time and can charge\r\n\r\nthe  property  tax of 36 per cent on the  increased\r\n\r\nannual value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rented houses, the landlords pass the\r\n\r\nincreases on to the tenants and the tenants suffer.\r\n\r\nIn  most cases in Sennett Estate, the rent has been\r\n\r\nincreased by 100 to 200 per cent. Can the  Property\r\n\r\nTax  Division  value properties at some  reasonable\r\n\r\nfigure?  It  seems  that  its  valuers  value   the\r\n\r\nproperties  at  any  rate they like.  In  the  same\r\n\r\nestate, some houses are valued at a higher rate and\r\n\r\nsome at a lower rate. I have known instances where,\r\n\r\nalthough  the properties are in the same area  with\r\n\r\nthe same floor space and the same type of building,\r\n\r\nthe values differ. The annual value of one property\r\n\r\nis  $2,000, but about three houses away,  the  same\r\n\r\ntype  of property is valued at $6,000 or $7,000.  I\r\n\r\nnotice  that the Minister of State for  Finance  is\r\n\r\nshaking  his head and saying that it is  not  true.\r\n\r\nBut I can produce the annual value notices to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point that I want to bring to the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the House is that, although  a  certain\r\n\r\nproperty  is  assessed at a certain  value  by  the\r\n\r\nvaluers  in  the  Property Tax Division,  the  same\r\n\r\nproperty  is  valued,  for  the  purposes  of  land\r\n\r\nacquisition, at half the rate or sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  lower than that. It seems the Government  has\r\n\r\ndouble   standards.  When  it  wants   to   acquire\r\n\r\nproperty,  it  wants to pay less for  it.  When  it\r\n\r\nwants  to  collect  property  tax,  it  values  the\r\n\r\nproperty at a higher rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister of State for Finance look into\r\n\r\nthese matters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

How many hundred per cent increase  is\r\n\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, what do you mean\r\n\r\nwhen  you  say  your \"estate\"?

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very sorry. When I say \"estate\", I mean the Windsor Park Estate. The Property Tax Division has increased the valuation of the houses in that estate. I think the Minister of State wants more money and therefore the property tax is increased. I hope to get a\r\n\r\nreasonable reply from him.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the general\r\n\r\nprinciple of valuation is fairly simple. The annual\r\n\r\nvalue of a house is the value of the rental that it\r\n\r\ncan  fetch in the open market. Of course,  in  time\r\n\r\nthe  annual  values  of  houses  go  out  of  date.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  a  revaluation  is  done  so  that  the\r\n\r\nproperty accurately reflects the rental that it can\r\n\r\nfetch. This is the general principle. In particular\r\n\r\ncases,  like those quoted by the Members for Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  and Anson, it simply means that the  rentals\r\n\r\nthat  these properties can fetch have gone up.  Let\r\n\r\nme take the case quoted by the Member for Anson. He\r\n\r\nsays  that  the annual valuation of his  house  was\r\n\r\nraised from $900 to $2,500. But let me also ask him\r\n\r\nthis question: If he were to let out his house now,\r\n\r\nwould he not get more than $200 a month for it?  If\r\n\r\nthe  answer is yes, the annual value of  his  house\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  raised  so that  it  will  accurately\r\n\r\nreflect that rental. I do, of course, realise  that\r\n\r\nthere  has been a big increase in rentals. However,\r\n\r\nfor owner-occupiers, there is a special concession,\r\n\r\nand  they  will not be asked to pay more than  what\r\n\r\nthey  previously  paid.  I  am  sure  this  can  be\r\n\r\nconfirmed  by  both the Member for  Anson  and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Potong Pasir who had some experience  in\r\n\r\nmy Ministry regarding this matter. I am in sympathy\r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own case, for example, the annual value of\r\n\r\nmy  house was originally only $1,320, and now it is\r\n\r\nraised  to  $4,200.  I cannot complain  about  this\r\n\r\nreally,  because the house in which  I  am  staying\r\n\r\ncould  fetch  up  to  $600 a month  with  furniture\r\n\r\nthrown in. But I do not pay anything more. I  still\r\n\r\npay  my  old  property tax because of this  special\r\n\r\nconcession.  There is, therefore, no  hardship  for\r\n\r\nowner-occupiers. However, I was told by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Potong  Pasir that it would be a hardship  for\r\n\r\ntenants because the landlords pass the property tax\r\n\r\nelement  on to them. I think the Member for  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  has  forgotten the cause and effect  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter. The higher valuation is only the effect  of\r\n\r\nthe  increased rental. Even if we were not to raise\r\n\r\nthe  annual value of the property, the tenant would\r\n\r\nstill have to pay the higher rent. In fact, what we\r\n\r\ndo  is to take away from the landlords in the  form\r\n\r\nof  property tax part of that higher rent  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  would not get the whole lot of the  increased\r\n\r\nrental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an example. If a house has been\r\n\r\nvalued  at $2,000 and is let out at $500  a  month,\r\n\r\nthe  proper annual value should be $6,000.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not increase the annual  value  of\r\n\r\nthe  house, the owner will still collect the $6,000\r\n\r\nbut  he will keep the difference between $6,000 and\r\n\r\n$2,000  to himself. Because the Government has  now\r\n\r\nincreased the annual value of the house to  $6,000,\r\n\r\nit  is  able  to collect tax on the higher  rental.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there should be no hardship either  for\r\n\r\nthe  tenant or the owner-occupier. So the landlords\r\n\r\nthemselves,  who have properties to let  out,  will\r\n\r\nget less return than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey would otherwise, but this is property tax  and\r\n\r\nwhen  landlords  let out their property,  they  are\r\n\r\nexpected to pay property tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, can the Minister of State\r\n\r\nguarantee  that  the concession granted  to  owner-occupiers  will not be withdrawn? He has said  that\r\n\r\nowner-occupier house-owners need not pay more  tax,\r\n\r\nbut  this  is  only just eyewash. At any  time  the\r\n\r\nProperty Tax Division can demand the full  rate  by\r\n\r\nwithdrawing the concession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has also said that the Property Tax Division has raised the annual value of properties because the landlords have collected increased rents. But the landlord did not raise the rents of the houses in Sennett Estate, which were built in 1952, until the Property Tax Division\r\n\r\nraised their annual value. Can the Minister tell us\r\n\r\nwhether   this  concessionary  rate   will   remain\r\n\r\nforever?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, can you guarantee that\r\n\r\nthis concessionary rate will remain forever?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it\r\n\r\nwould  be foolhardy of me if I were to give Members\r\n\r\nof the House that guarantee. What I can say is that\r\n\r\nso  long  as the economy is buoyant and the  growth\r\n\r\nrate  is  satisfactory, and there are other sources\r\n\r\nof  raising  revenue, we shall do our best  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  owner-occupiers get this concession. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is up to everybody in this country to work hard\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the economic growth of our  country\r\n\r\nis  at  a  rapid  rate so that we do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the concession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's second point, he says that the\r\n\r\nrent  of the houses in Sennett Estate, which is  in\r\n\r\nhis constituency, was not raised until the Property\r\n\r\nTax  Division raised their annual value.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether this can be true. The law, however, clearly\r\n\r\nstates   that  the  annual  value  must  accurately\r\n\r\nreflect  the  rental of the property  that  can  be\r\n\r\nfetched  in  the  open market. If, for  example,  a\r\n\r\nhouse  could be let out at $400 a month, I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee why a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse-owner  should let it out at  $100  unless  he\r\n\r\nrents  it  to  his own relative or  to  some  other\r\n\r\ndependants.  To  that extent it is  unfair  to  the\r\n\r\nRevenue.  So  the  Government comes  in  and  says,\r\n\r\n`Look, the market value is $400. Why do you let  it\r\n\r\nout  at  $100?  You  must  furnish  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nanswer.  Otherwise the annual value  of  the  house\r\n\r\nwill  go  up.\" I do not really see how in the  same\r\n\r\nrow  of  houses the annual value is $2,000 for  one\r\n\r\nhouse and $6,000 for another, as was earlier quoted\r\n\r\nby  the  Member. In that case I would  ask  him  to\r\n\r\nsupply   me  with  the  information  and   I   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely look into the matter. Perhaps the  lower\r\n\r\nannual value will go up by $4,000!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I will certainly supply the\r\n\r\ninformation concerning the disparity in the  annual\r\n\r\nvalues of the two houses to the Minister of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not well informed about the landlord\r\n\r\npassing  the  increase in the annual value  to  the\r\n\r\ntenants  in Sennett Estate.

This gives  the\r\n\r\nlicensee  ample  time  in  advance  to  renew   his\r\n\r\nlicence, as it can be renewed one month before  the\r\n\r\nexpiry date. Where a licensee has a good reason for\r\n\r\nfailing   to  renew  his  licence  in   time,   the\r\n\r\ncomposition can be waived. The payment of a sum  of\r\n\r\n$10  to  compound the offence of late  renewal  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  not  too harsh since the  licensee  has\r\n\r\nbeen reminded in ample time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion by the Member that the sum of the\r\n\r\ncomposition  be  reduced to $2  is,  I  am  afraid,\r\n\r\nunacceptable  because it would lose  its  deterrent\r\n\r\neffect. The non-receipt of a renewal form is mainly\r\n\r\ndue  to  the failure of the licensee to report  his\r\n\r\nchange  of  address  to the department.  Since  the\r\n\r\nlicence form clearly states that the licensee  must\r\n\r\nreport any change of address to the department, the\r\n\r\nnon-receipt of a renewal form by reason of a change\r\n\r\nof address cannot be accepted as an excuse for late\r\n\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 the total number of licences renewed was\r\n\r\n190,788,  and  the number of cases  compounded  was\r\n\r\n6,408, i.e., only three per cent. If 97 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe licensees could manage to renew in time, it  is\r\n\r\nclear  that  the three per cent had only themselves\r\n\r\nto  blame  for failure to renew in time, for  which\r\n\r\nthey  suffered  the penalty of the composition.  If\r\n\r\nthey  paid  the  composition,  they  would  not  be\r\n\r\nbrought to court. Of course, if they chose  not  to\r\n\r\npay, then court proceedings would follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the answer, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2063.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that the vote for Advertising\r\n\r\nCharges  under the Property Tax Division  has  been\r\n\r\nincreased  by  $13,240 over the previous  year.

It is true that the Property\r\n\r\nTax  Division  sends out notices of assessment  and\r\n\r\nthat these advertisements are not really essential.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is considered desirable to have  these\r\n\r\nreminders as an additional service to taxpayers  to\r\n\r\nmake it quite sure that they do not overlook having\r\n\r\nto  pay  in  time  to  reduce the  number  of  late\r\n\r\npayments, so that they need not have to pay a  late\r\n\r\npayment fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,500 shown in the 1970-71 estimates\r\n\r\nwas  provided  to meet advertising charges  in  the\r\n\r\npress  only.

In\r\n\r\npreparing  the estimates for 1970-71  the  Property\r\n\r\nTax  Division overlooked the fact that they had  to\r\n\r\nmake  provision  to meet advertising  charges  over\r\n\r\nradio   and  on  T.V.,  although  such  advertising\r\n\r\ncharges  had  been in force with  effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nAugust,  1969.

N. Govindasamy and Ng Yeow Chong)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Home Affairs is a new\r\n\r\nMinistry. It plays quite an important role  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Under this amendment, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nbring  up two questions. The first is in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  way in which police personnel carry out  their\r\n\r\nduties.  The  second is in regard to the  arrogance\r\n\r\nshown  by the police telephone operators in  Police\r\n\r\nheadquarters. In the last few years our  Government\r\n\r\nhas  tried its best to promote co-operation between\r\n\r\nthe police and the people in order to eradicate the\r\n\r\nimage of the police being bullies and oppressors of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Now  that we are an  independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign  republic,  the  police  should  be   the\r\n\r\nfriends  of the people, and the protector  of  life\r\n\r\nand  property. Therefore, it follows that they must\r\n\r\nadopt   a  proper  attitude  in  performing   their\r\n\r\nservices to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received complaints from certain\r\n\r\npeople. Let me quote an example. There was a hawker\r\n\r\nin my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency who, because he was willing to  devote\r\n\r\nsome  of  his  time to community centre  work,  was\r\n\r\nnominated  to  be the secretary of  the  Management\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  the community centre.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  he  was  also  a  committee  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee. Naturally he is a\r\n\r\nlaw-abiding citizen. One evening about a month  ago\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was  working at his stall  with  his  two\r\n\r\nassistants, a police inspector suddenly arrived  on\r\n\r\nthe  scene saying that he wanted to arrest his  two\r\n\r\nassistants. The hawker was very surprised and asked\r\n\r\nhim for the reason for the arrest. Unexpectedly the\r\n\r\npolice  inspector roughly said, \"Do not  talk  too\r\n\r\nmuch.  If  you want to find out, go to  the  police\r\n\r\nstation.\"  So  he  followed the  inspector  to  the\r\n\r\npolice  station  to  find out the  reason  for  the\r\n\r\narrest of his two assistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arriving at the police station the inspector\r\n\r\nasked some police constables to drive him away. The\r\n\r\nhawker  was  very angry then and protested  against\r\n\r\nthis course of action. He told the inspector not to\r\n\r\ncreate  unnecessary trouble. It was only then  that\r\n\r\nthe inspector realised that he was at fault himself\r\n\r\nand  released  the hawker's two assistants  because\r\n\r\nthey  were  innocent. Mr Speaker, Sir,  from  this\r\n\r\nincident  we can see that there is plenty  of  room\r\n\r\nfor  improvement in the way police personnel  carry\r\n\r\nout their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise some other points. The\r\n\r\npolice  should at all times be courteous to members\r\n\r\nof  the public. If they are rough and discourteous,\r\n\r\nthey  will  leave  an  unfavourable  image  amongst\r\n\r\nmembers of the public. In time to come a feeling of\r\n\r\nantagonism  will be created between the police  and\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the way in which police\r\n\r\ninvestigations    are    carried     out.     These\r\n\r\ninvestigations  are not thorough.  The  police  are\r\n\r\noften careless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  sometimes arrest the wrong persons.  This  has\r\n\r\nresulted in members of the public losing confidence\r\n\r\nin the way police personnel carry out their duties.\r\n\r\nI  would  urge the Minister to instruct the  police\r\n\r\nforce  to  carry out their duties properly  and  to\r\n\r\nassist our people in solving their problems and not\r\n\r\nto create unnecessary trouble and worries for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to reduce the incidence of crime and to preserve law and order, we must not only improve the discipline and working efficiency of the police force, but we must also seek to obtain maximum co-operation from the people. In order to do this, our police force will\r\n\r\nhave  to  show  that they are the  friends  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They  must  maintain a  friendly  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not lack people with public spirit in our society. For example, people who serve on the management committees of community centres are often public spirited. They are willing to devote their time to community work and try their best to help solve the problems of the\r\n\r\npeople. They are willing to assume these duties for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the people. Therefore,  the  police\r\n\r\nforce  must  adopt a co-operative attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthe people because only in this way can they expect\r\n\r\nto  carry out their work more efficiently. I  think\r\n\r\nconcrete steps should be taken to improve  the  co-operation  between the police and the  people.  For\r\n\r\nexample, some time ago, meetings were held  between\r\n\r\nthe  police  and the people in order to break  down\r\n\r\nthe  barrier  that existed between  them.  I  think\r\n\r\nmeetings of this kind are very useful and should be\r\n\r\nheld   regularly.   For  instance,   \"Unity   Week\"\r\n\r\norganised by the police and the public will help to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  and strengthen the links  between  the\r\n\r\npolice  and the people. Through the unity  and  co-operation of the public, the police will be able to\r\n\r\nwork  better  for the welfare and  benefit  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point relates to the telephone operators\r\n\r\nin Police headquarters. It is very difficult to put\r\n\r\ncalls  through at Police headquarters. Some Members\r\n\r\nraised this point last year. The Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreplied that he would investigate and take steps to\r\n\r\nimprove  the situation. However, after a  lapse  of\r\n\r\none  year, it is still very difficult to put  calls\r\n\r\nthrough  at Police headquarters. I do not know  the\r\n\r\nreason for this. I hope the Minister will carry out\r\n\r\nan immediate investigation into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received many complaints from people\r\n\r\nthat the telephone operators in Police headquarters\r\n\r\nare   arrogant  and  discourteous  and  that  their\r\n\r\nworking  efficiency  is low. Sometimes  a  call  is\r\n\r\nunanswered  for  a long time. Some members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  are wondering if the operators are \"playing\r\n\r\nthe  fool.\" I hope the Minister will carry  out  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  and  adopt  the  necessary  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang has raised many points, can  I\r\n\r\nwait until the Minister has replied and then I  can\r\n\r\nraise my question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noted\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Home Affairs was created  in\r\n\r\nAugust 1970. This new Ministry has the Police,  the\r\n\r\nImmigration   Department,  and  the   Registry   of\r\n\r\nSocieties under its portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our police force is one of the best\r\n\r\ndisciplined  and  most  efficient  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nauthorities  in  South-east Asia.  Because  of  the\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  dedication of the members  of  the\r\n\r\npolice  force,  crime in the  republic  is  not  so\r\n\r\nrampant  as it is in some other countries. Law  and\r\n\r\norder  is  indeed well maintained.  Therefore,  our\r\n\r\ncitizens   enjoy  living  in  peace  and  security.\r\n\r\nHowever, we cannot afford to have some black  sheep\r\n\r\nin the police force who take the law into their own\r\n\r\nhands  and  bring  disgrace and  discredit  to  the\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very unfortunate to have to mention\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police Department has recently  received\r\n\r\nbad  publicity with regard to some members  of  the\r\n\r\nforce  who  were involved in corruption,  abuse  of\r\n\r\npower, such as in rape cases, stealing property  in\r\n\r\nthe   course   of  investigation,  and   committing\r\n\r\nrobbery, etc, resulting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  dismissal of some officers and members  of\r\n\r\nthe  rank  and file. It would appear that  all  the\r\n\r\nabove  incidents  occurred  so  rapidly  one  after\r\n\r\nanother.  For instance, two detectives are  alleged\r\n\r\nto  have  removed personal articles  from  a  house\r\n\r\nwhere  they were assigned to investigate a case  of\r\n\r\nhousebreaking.  A patrol crew in a  radio  car  are\r\n\r\nalleged  to  have been found collecting money  from\r\n\r\nlorry  operators for a favour not to book them  for\r\n\r\ntraffic  offences. As a result of this, the Corrupt\r\n\r\nPractices  Investigation  Bureau  probed  into  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Branch  and some of the  police  personnel\r\n\r\nwere   transferred  out.  Again,  one  probationary\r\n\r\npolice  inspector  and  his  staff  sergeant   were\r\n\r\nsentenced to imprisonment for raping a woman and  a\r\n\r\ngirl  under threat. A detective corporal  was  also\r\n\r\nsentenced  to  imprisonment for committing  robbery\r\n\r\nwith his service gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to allow the acts committed\r\n\r\nby  these black sheep to affect the discipline  and\r\n\r\nmorale  of  the police force as a whole.  Normally,\r\n\r\nthe  public  turn to the police for  protection  of\r\n\r\ntheir  property and lives. But they will eventually\r\n\r\nlose  faith and confidence if some of the  officers\r\n\r\nin  the police force, instead of rendering valuable\r\n\r\nassistance,  take advantage of their  authority  to\r\n\r\nharm innocent persons, especially the females.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have a clean and efficient\r\n\r\npolice  force, these black sheep should  be  weeded\r\n\r\nout  without any mercy and sympathy.

In  contrast,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Armed   Forces  have   been   glamorous\r\n\r\nsubjects,  much  written  up  by  journalists   and\r\n\r\nwritten  about  by  parents  as  well  as  national\r\n\r\nservicemen themselves, until the latter were warned\r\n\r\nby the Minister of Defence that this practice was a\r\n\r\nbreach  of the Queen's Regulations. I have  nothing\r\n\r\nagainst  our  Armed Forces or against  glamour  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter. I am in favour of both. But think  we\r\n\r\nhave  been hard on our police force. For five years\r\n\r\nsince we became an independent republic, the police\r\n\r\nhas  been sandwiched in the M.I.D, between Ministry\r\n\r\nand Defence, with the result that Interior, or Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  as  it  is  now  known  today,  has   been\r\n\r\nrelegated   to   the   background   and   virtually\r\n\r\nforgotten.  The  police force has been  undermanned\r\n\r\nand  underpaid; sometimes misunderstood,  at  other\r\n\r\ntimes maligned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of students in an agricultural\r\n\r\ncollege  in  a  neighbouring country  who,  several\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  complained in  the  press  that  their\r\n\r\nprofession,  agriculture,  which  is  the   world's\r\n\r\nsecond oldest profession, was taken for granted and\r\n\r\nforgotten.  These students pointed out  that  their\r\n\r\nprofession  was  more  respectable,  probably  more\r\n\r\nuseful in an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic if not in a social sense, than the world's\r\n\r\noldest profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is time that our police force got\r\n\r\nthe  attention and appreciation which is their due.\r\n\r\nThe resurrection of the Ministry of Home Affairs is\r\n\r\na step in the right direction. The appointment of a\r\n\r\ncommittee  of inquiry into the terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof  service of the police force is another step  in\r\n\r\nthe   right   direction.  The  reduction   of   the\r\n\r\nallocation  in respect of this Ministry  is  not  a\r\n\r\nstep  in  the  right direction. In  recent  months,\r\n\r\nalthough  the police force has achieved  a  certain\r\n\r\nmeasure of notoriety as expounded by the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten,  it has, nevertheless, achieved  other\r\n\r\nnotable successes in crime detection and it  is  to\r\n\r\nbe    congratulated.   Perhaps    this    increased\r\n\r\nproductivity  on  the  part  of  the  force  is  an\r\n\r\nadditional reason for an overdue salary revision. I\r\n\r\nfeel  safe  and secure in Singapore and  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  most of us do as well. The crooks should not.\r\n\r\nThis safety and security cannot always be found  in\r\n\r\nmany  cities  of  the world. I hope  that  we  will\r\n\r\nalways  feel safe and secure in Singapore.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust  recognise that we will have to pay  for  this\r\n\r\nand,  therefore.  I  do  not support  the  proposed\r\n\r\nreduction in the allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, first let\r\n\r\nme  say how much I appreciate the interest shown by\r\n\r\nthe  Members for Sembawang, Mountbatten,  Bukit  Ho\r\n\r\nSwee  and  Ulu  Pandan in the  functioning  of  the\r\n\r\npolice  force. The police force, unlike  the  Army,\r\n\r\nhas  no other policemen to look after them: to  see\r\n\r\nwhether they do their work or not. For this reason,\r\n\r\nI  appreciate  so much more the interest  shown  by\r\n\r\nthese Members in the functioning of the force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has indicated quite\r\n\r\nclearly that the police force has, as a whole, done\r\n\r\nan  excellent  job  and  I  am  quite  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  this in figures. How can  we  measure\r\n\r\nthe  efficient performance of the police force?  It\r\n\r\nmay  astonish Members to know that there is no such\r\n\r\nthing  as  a crime-free society. In fact, the  only\r\n\r\nsociety  which  is crime free happens  to  be  very\r\n\r\nprimitive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety,  and  I  do not think any Member  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse wishes Singapore to move in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, our crime rate has been\r\n\r\nrather low, fluctuating around 10 crimes per  1,000\r\n\r\nof  the  population, and it has  not  substantially\r\n\r\nchanged. Last year there were a few cases of rather\r\n\r\nnotorious crimes, like the Chartered Bank  robbery,\r\n\r\nwhich happened to be the biggest in the history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But Members will note that  the  police\r\n\r\nwithin a rather short time caught the criminals. In\r\n\r\nfact, last year the number of offences per thousand\r\n\r\npersons  in  Singapore  was  9.56.  This  shows  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  about 0.7 per cent over the  rate  in\r\n\r\n1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the inadequacies? The Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten has quite rightly pointed out that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of instances where policemen committed  rape\r\n\r\nand  robbery  did show the police force  in  a  bad\r\n\r\nlight. However, by and large, our policemen are not\r\n\r\nlike  this. After all, there are good students  and\r\n\r\nbad  students.  There  are good  teachers  and  bad\r\n\r\nteachers.  There  are  good  and  bad  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament.  This  is  in  the  nature  of  things.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the important point is that we must  take\r\n\r\nthe  whole picture into consideration and  come  to\r\n\r\nthe proper perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rudeness and arrogance of police\r\n\r\nofficers,  I  myself think that such  instances  do\r\n\r\noccur,  because I have received complaints. I  have\r\n\r\ninvestigated and sometimes the complaints are  true\r\n\r\nbut  sometimes  they are not.  If  they  are  true,\r\n\r\ndisciplinary measures are taken, although I  cannot\r\n\r\ntell Members what they are. The police force is  an\r\n\r\ninteresting  force.  It  has  different  kinds   of\r\n\r\npunishment for different kinds of offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho  Swee  mentioned the  case  of  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer  in Parliament House who did not  recognise\r\n\r\nhim.  I  will  certainly take  very  stern  measures\r\n\r\nagainst this police officer if the Member will just\r\n\r\ngive  me  the  specific particulars. This  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant because I will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  tolerate  any member of the police  force  not\r\n\r\npaying  due  courtesy to Ministers, to  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament   and  to  members  of   the   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees. For, as  already  pointed\r\n\r\nout  by  the  Member for Sembawang, if  the  police\r\n\r\nforce is to function efficiently, it must have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the community, and discourtesy  is  one\r\n\r\nfactor  which  places the force  in  a  bad  light.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, having said all this, it is  also  my\r\n\r\nduty  to  explain  to  Members that  policemen  are\r\n\r\ninstructed   to  be  courteous  and  they   receive\r\n\r\nlectures  on  this. And judging by  the  number  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints that reach me, it would seem that  there\r\n\r\nhave been -occasional lapses in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards wrongful arrests. I am not quite sure\r\n\r\nwhether this sort of thing happens at all. In fact,\r\n\r\nI presume that people are called in for questioning\r\n\r\nand,  after that, they are asked to go home.  After\r\n\r\nall, whether a person is wrongfully arrested or not\r\n\r\nwill finally be decided by the law courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has suggested that the\r\n\r\nMinistry should consider having a \"Police Week\". In\r\n\r\nfact, I can reveal to Members that such a week will\r\n\r\nbe  planned this year and Members of Parliament and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  community centres  and  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative   Committees   will   be   asked    to\r\n\r\nparticipate.  This, I think, is very  necessary  to\r\n\r\nestablish good relations between the police and the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of difficulties of\r\n\r\ngetting  telephone calls through to the  police,  I\r\n\r\nhave  not looked up the debates last year and I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether my predecessor did, in fact, make\r\n\r\nsuch  a promise. But since the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nhas said that it was promised, I presume that it is\r\n\r\nso.  At  the  moment,  we are  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\ninstalling   a  P.A.B.X. system  which   will   be\r\n\r\noperational some time this year. We hope that  when\r\n\r\nthis is completed, communication will improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rudeness on the part of the telephone\r\n\r\noperators,  here  again I  say  that  it  is  quite\r\n\r\npossible  that such instances might have  occurred.\r\n\r\nBut, by and large, the operators are polite. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   quite  possible  that  there  might  be   some\r\n\r\nlinguistic  difficulties in this  connection.  When\r\n\r\nsomeone speaks another language, and not too  well,\r\n\r\na   person  well  versed  in  the  language   might\r\n\r\ninterpret the inadequacy as rudeness. Members  must\r\n\r\nunderstand that when an operator receives  a  phone\r\n\r\ncall,  he is confronted by people speaking  several\r\n\r\nlanguages and often dialects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten asked me some very\r\n\r\nspecific questions. Firstly, he asked whether I  am\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the police force. I have  indicated\r\n\r\nearlier  that  the  level  of  our  crime  rate  is\r\n\r\nrelatively  stable  and low, and  perhaps  that  is\r\n\r\nreally the best criterion of the efficiency of  the\r\n\r\npolice force. I think some kind of comparison  will\r\n\r\nbring  the  state  of efficiency of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice Force into proper perspective. I have stated\r\n\r\nearlier  that our crime/population ratio  has  been\r\n\r\nrelatively   stable  over  the   last   10   years,\r\n\r\nfluctuating  around 10 per one thousand  people.  A\r\n\r\ncomparison with Hong Kong will bring the  situation\r\n\r\ninto perspective. Hong Kong, like Singapore, is  an\r\n\r\nimmigrant  society with a similar social  structure\r\n\r\nand crime pattern. In 1968, the last year for which\r\n\r\nHong Kong's figures are available, in so far as the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is concerned, the crime/population  ratio\r\n\r\nstood  at  10.33.  For that year,  the  figure  for\r\n\r\nSingapore was 10. It is interesting to compare  the\r\n\r\nposition of the ratios for 10 major cities  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  another nation of immigrants.  For\r\n\r\n1969,  the  ratios  varied between  17.5  and  47.3\r\n\r\ncrimes  per  one thousand persons with Los  Angeles\r\n\r\ntopping  the list. I hope the figures will  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten with regard to the state\r\n\r\nof efficiency of our force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards corruption, naturally I cannot\r\n\r\ntolerate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Prof. Wong.

Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I\r\n\r\nexpress  my  misgivings about the police  force,  I\r\n\r\nwant to take this opportunity to congratulate them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the efficient manner in which they have tackled\r\n\r\nmajor  crimes,  as the Minister has mentioned  just\r\n\r\nnow,  and in apprehending the law-breakers  in  the\r\n\r\nrepublic. We can be proud of them, as the  Minister\r\n\r\nis,   for  effectively  giving  credence   to   the\r\n\r\nproverbial  long arm of justice and thus  deterring\r\n\r\nmore   anti-social  elements  from   indulging   in\r\n\r\nrobbery, kidnapping, raping and other reprehensible\r\n\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  Chartered Bank robbery case. The  recovery  of\r\n\r\nthe  money and the arrest of the criminals involved\r\n\r\nin   this  case,  and  the  apprehension   of   the\r\n\r\nkidnappers of a millionaire recently are  proof  of\r\n\r\nthe mettle and calibre of our police force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the police force, as a whole, appears to\r\n\r\nhave  made  a glowing impression on the  public  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  Minister himself, unfortunately  the\r\n\r\nmorale among the rank and file members seems to  be\r\n\r\nnot what it should be. What I am about to refer  to\r\n\r\nmay  be  considered as a serious reflection on  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  and dedication of our police force,  but\r\n\r\nit  is a matter of vital importance that I think it\r\n\r\nshould be aired in this House so that investigation\r\n\r\nmay be made into it and remedial measures taken  to\r\n\r\nrectify  it.  In the course of my constituency  and\r\n\r\ntrade  union work, I have come across remarks  made\r\n\r\nin  all seriousness, by responsible citizens to the\r\n\r\neffect   that  even  the  mata  mata  try  to   make\r\n\r\nthemselves scarce at the scene of traffic accidents\r\n\r\nor minor crimes. It seems that policemen also share\r\n\r\nthe  layman's  aversion to court  proceedings,  and\r\n\r\nintensely  dislike the amount of  paper  work  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  do in connection with any traffic offence\r\n\r\nor  minor  crime  they  may  have  witnessed.  Such\r\n\r\ndislike  may probably be accounted for by the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  minor offences do not count much in  relation\r\n\r\nto   the  promotional  prospects  of  the  officers\r\n\r\ninvolved.  I am also told that the additional  time\r\n\r\ninvolved  in making reports, and having  to  go  to\r\n\r\nhospital in accident cases, if done outside duty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhours,  cannot  be  taken  into  consideration   as\r\n\r\nworking  hours for the purpose either  of  overtime\r\n\r\npay  or  for taking time off. If this is so,  steps\r\n\r\nmust be taken to rectify this anomaly. If there  is\r\n\r\nany  truth  in  the  remark  that  policemen  avoid\r\n\r\napprehending  criminals because  of  the  attendant\r\n\r\ncross-examination  by  defence  counsel,  then  the\r\n\r\npoliceman  concerned should be  given  training  in\r\n\r\ncourt  craft. The fact that junior police  officers\r\n\r\nlack  confidence when it comes to court proceedings\r\n\r\nimplies that there is much room for improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe  training  programme devised  for  them.  Court\r\n\r\ncraft  and correct orientation to their duty should\r\n\r\nform  a  major part of the curricula of the  Police\r\n\r\nAcademy.  I wonder if this is being done, There  is\r\n\r\ntoo  much compartmentalisation of our police force.\r\n\r\nTraffic  officers  do  not  seem  to  worry   about\r\n\r\nanything else unless it is associated with  traffic\r\n\r\noffences. Other officers in uniform, even those  in\r\n\r\npatrol   cars,   pretend  not  to  notice   traffic\r\n\r\noffences.   These  are  problems   which   can   be\r\n\r\neliminated  by  correct orientation of  our  police\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to refer to another matter.\r\n\r\nRecently   traffic  compounded  fines   have   been\r\n\r\nincreased. This may give rise to a situation  where\r\n\r\nmany   traffic  offenders,  instead  of  paying   a\r\n\r\ncompounded  fine,  may think it  cheaper  to  offer\r\n\r\nbribes  to the traffic police. In other words,  the\r\n\r\ntemptation to bribe is made greater by the increase\r\n\r\nin  the  compounded fines. Can this be one  of  the\r\n\r\ncauses  for the recent investigation by the Corrupt\r\n\r\nPractices  Investigation Bureau into corruption  by\r\n\r\nour traffic police?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

It has been suggested that this  has\r\n\r\nsomething  to do with their salaries and conditions\r\n\r\nof  work. If this is true, I think the solution can\r\n\r\nonly  come  after  the Lee Soo  Ann  Committee  has\r\n\r\npresented its report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of court attendance\r\n\r\nof  police officers and their fear that they may be\r\n\r\ngrilled  in  the court and therefore  they  do  not\r\n\r\nperform their duty, let me first inform the  Member\r\n\r\nthat not all police officers are required to attend\r\n\r\ncourt to testify for the prosecution. They only  do\r\n\r\nso  when  the accused person claims trial. Even  if\r\n\r\nthey  do,  it is not very often that they  have  to\r\n\r\nundergo   severe   cross-examination   by   defence\r\n\r\ncounsel.  Generally, this happens only in cases  of\r\n\r\nserious crimes. With the training given to them  on\r\n\r\ncourt  procedures, there is no reason for  officers\r\n\r\nor  members of the rank and file to fear  narrating\r\n\r\nthe true facts of the case as required of them when\r\n\r\ntestimony is called for. Since it is just  as  much\r\n\r\ntheir  duty to testify - in court as to  attend  to\r\n\r\noffences  committed  in their presence.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nreally  subscribe to the view that failure to  take\r\n\r\ncognizance   of  the  crime  when  it  happens   is\r\n\r\nattributable to their fear to testify in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that officers off duty\r\n\r\nor  officers not asked to do a particular  job,  do\r\n\r\nnot attend to offences committed in their presence.\r\n\r\nThe  Police  Force Orders require that  any  police\r\n\r\nofficer  in  such  a situation should  perform  his\r\n\r\nduty. As I have said earlier, the police force  has\r\n\r\nno other people to check any negligence on the part\r\n\r\nof  its members in this matter. If anyone seriously\r\n\r\nbelieves  that a police officer has  not  done  his\r\n\r\nduty,  he  can  complain in writing to  the  Police\r\n\r\nCommissioner   and   he  will  do   the   necessary\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  However. I suspect this  is  really\r\n\r\nnot generally true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, may I ask just one more\r\n\r\nquestion?  Is  it true that if the police  officers\r\n\r\nperform  duty  over  and beyond their  duty  hours,\r\n\r\nthese hours are not taken into consideration? As a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresult,  they tend to close an eye to minor crimes,\r\n\r\nbut  not  major ones.

For police constables who go\r\n\r\nbeyond the usual tour of duties, normally they  are\r\n\r\ncompensated by a rearrangement in their  subsequent\r\n\r\ntour  of duty. For good work done, certificates  of\r\n\r\ncommendation  of various grades are given  to  both\r\n\r\nofficers and members of the rank and file.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of the latter, they also qualify for some form\r\n\r\nof  monetary  reward, depending  on  the  grade  of\r\n\r\ncertificate awarded. Subsidiary awards based on the\r\n\r\npresent  system  in  regard to the  rank  and  file\r\n\r\nmembers  qualify  them  for  certificates  and  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  monetary rewards on the basis  of  the\r\n\r\npoints accumulated over a given year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Extortion  is  also\r\n\r\nbeing  carried  out in the Kolam Ayer  district.  I\r\n\r\nhave  reported  this matter to the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice   but   without  much  result.  The   Police\r\n\r\nDepartment has replied to me saying that they  have\r\n\r\ntaken  action, but the cases of theft and extortion\r\n\r\nhave  not decreased in number. My constituency  may\r\n\r\nnot be like Toa Payoh, which my colleague refers to\r\n\r\nas  the \"Chicago of Singapore\". The incidents in my\r\n\r\nconstituency  are  not small in  number.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs overhaul the police force\r\n\r\nand  take  action on these incidents? I  have  a1so\r\n\r\ntried  my  best and have given some  clues  to  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police about the persons  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in extortion in the Kolam Ayer district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is about\r\n\r\ncorruption  in the traffic police. I am  told  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  take  bribes from lorry and  pirate  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers who commit traffic offences. I notice  that\r\n\r\nthough some people park their cars in certain areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not allowed for parking, they  are  not\r\n\r\nsummoned.  They commit the same offence  every  day\r\n\r\nbut  no action is taken against them. If any  other\r\n\r\ncar  is  parked at the same place, the  owner,  who\r\n\r\nprobably  does not bribe the traffic  police,  will\r\n\r\nget a summons very quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about ambulance chasing and\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  police. Whenever there is  a  traffic\r\n\r\naccident,  certain  legal  firms  who  normally  do\r\n\r\nambulance chasing are at the place of the  accident\r\n\r\neven  before  the  relatives know about  it.  These\r\n\r\nlegal  firms  are supplied with reports  and  other\r\n\r\nnecessary news -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does this come under the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Home Affairs, Mr Ramaswamy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir, the traffic police is\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, carry on.

I am trying to say that our crime position is\r\n\r\nnot alarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the school for detectives, a group\r\n\r\nof  people are working on the reorganisation of the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Investigation Department.  One  of  their\r\n\r\nproposals is that we should have such a school, and\r\n\r\nits  desirability and feasibility is at the  moment\r\n\r\nunder review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At various times Members of the House have\r\n\r\nreferred  to  cases of corruption  of  the  traffic\r\n\r\npolice. Investigation is still going on, and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it is proper for me to say anything  at\r\n\r\nthis  point  of  time. But I do want  to  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  say that if some  members  of  the\r\n\r\ntraffic   police  are  moved  out  of  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nDivision, there should be no conclusion at all that\r\n\r\nthey  are  involved,  because  some  of  them   are\r\n\r\ntransferred out merely as a matter of routine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  victimisation  on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  police. Last year alone there were 260,735\r\n\r\nreports  of traffic offences. I should have thought\r\n\r\nthat if a policeman wants to victimise anybody,  he\r\n\r\nwould be standing there and could not be doing  his\r\n\r\nduty  properly. But I think the traffic police  has\r\n\r\nbeen  enforcing the law impartially, and  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat there are so many cases of traffic offences is\r\n\r\nan  indication in that direction. However, this is\r\n\r\nnot to suggest that such a thing might not happen,\r\n\r\nas  in  the  instance mentioned by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir.  As  I  have already  said,  if  the\r\n\r\ninstance which was raised did, in fact, occur, will\r\n\r\nhe give me all the details so that an investigation\r\n\r\ncan  be  carried out? And if the Member is correct,\r\n\r\naction will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of ambulance-chasing, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this is a matter that has been brought  up\r\n\r\nmany  times in Parliament. As far as we know, there\r\n\r\nis no evidence to show that it is a serious matter,\r\n\r\nbut  if  there are any further instances I will  be\r\n\r\nglad  to  look into it. I think I should take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  say something  very  important.  A\r\n\r\npoliceman's job is a very difficult one, allegation\r\n\r\nof  corruption being an occupational hazard. I have\r\n\r\nreceived  numerous complaints and  every  complaint\r\n\r\nhas  been  investigated. More often than  not,  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation  suggests  that  the  complaints  are\r\n\r\nfounded  on  malice rather than on  fact.  And  the\r\n\r\nsurprising thing is that the police force has borne\r\n\r\nall these complaints with fortitude. This is really\r\n\r\na tribute to the force itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be\r\n\r\naccorded  the  same  privilege as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir to speak on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould   like to commend the Minister  for  having\r\n\r\ndealt  with all the questions that have been raised\r\n\r\nwith such courtesy and for having injected into his\r\n\r\nanswers  a  note  of sweet reasonableness.  If  his\r\n\r\nexample is followed by his officers and men in  the\r\n\r\npolice force, I am sure there will be a very,  very\r\n\r\ngreat improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that, Sir, I would like to make\r\n\r\none or two remarks, the main burden of which refers\r\n\r\nto  the  traffic policemen. Sir, I do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nmake matters more difficult for this unit than they\r\n\r\nalready  are,  but I feel that a few  observations\r\n\r\nhave  to  go on record. First, I do not think  that\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  the  Traffic  Division  has\r\n\r\nsufficient  personnel to tackle the  enormous  task\r\n\r\nwhich  it  faces. Reference has been made  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  the  administrative backlog  of  traffic\r\n\r\noffences.   Happily,  new  procedures   are   being\r\n\r\nintroduced to overcome these difficulties. However,\r\n\r\nthere remains other evidence to show that the  task\r\n\r\nof  the  traffic police has perhaps been found  too\r\n\r\nformidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  may  be pointed out, Sir, that the large amount\r\n\r\nof  fines  collected as a result of  police  action\r\n\r\nagainst traffic offenders indicates some success in\r\n\r\nenforcement. On the other hand, the fact  that  one\r\n\r\ncan  see  drivers  getting off with  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\ninfringements  of  traffic  offences,  despite  the\r\n\r\nlarge  number of bookings, testifies to the  dismal\r\n\r\nside of the picture. Sir, I am sure all of us would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see enforcement so successfully  achieved\r\n\r\nthat traffic offences are the exception rather than\r\n\r\nthe rule. But I am afraid that this is not so, that\r\n\r\nthe   traffic   regulations  are  not   universally\r\n\r\napplied,  not  because there is any  discrimination\r\n\r\nbut  because  there are not enough people  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  situation. The person  who  succeeds  in\r\n\r\ndrawing the attention of the traffic police to  his\r\n\r\ntransgressions feels aggrieved that he has had such\r\n\r\nbad  luck,  while others have got away.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  necessary to  detail  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\noffences that one can meet with when one drives  on\r\n\r\nthe  road.  But  what  is the  reason   for  this\r\n\r\nsyndrome?  I  think one can attribute this  to  the\r\n\r\npoor  quality also of traffic enforcers. I wish  to\r\n\r\nspeak  carefully, Sir, because I  do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nmake  any remarks that would reflect badly  on  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  are in charge, but there  is  a  large\r\n\r\npercentage  of  members of the traffic  police  who\r\n\r\nseem to me not to be adequately trained. It is  not\r\n\r\nunusual  when  passing a crossing  to  see  obvious\r\n\r\nbreaches  of the traffic regulations being  ignored\r\n\r\nby  people, by traffic policemen on points duty.  I\r\n\r\nhave also seen several instances of a slow motorist\r\n\r\nhugging the centre of the road or hugging the right\r\n\r\nside  of  the  road, holding up  a  whole  line  of\r\n\r\ntraffic,  and passing by on the left is  a  traffic\r\n\r\npoliceman on a motor-bike and he does not  pay  any\r\n\r\nattention  at  all.  He  is obviously  looking  for\r\n\r\nsomething else. [Interruption] Yes, I would like to\r\n\r\nknow what!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the main cause why there is this\r\n\r\nlawlessness  on the road in respect of breaches  of\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  regulations is that we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nenough people, and a lot of the people whom  we  do\r\n\r\nhave  have  not been adequately trained.  I  think,\r\n\r\ntoo, that it is possible for the traffic police  to\r\n\r\nplay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  greater  role in educating the public  regarding\r\n\r\ntraffic  regulations. There are  many  cases  where\r\n\r\npeople somehow or other seem to have forgotten  the\r\n\r\nrules  of  road courtesy, or they may  have  learnt\r\n\r\nthese  rules simply to pass their driving test  and\r\n\r\nhave  conveniently forgotten it afterwards.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary perhaps to institute some system  whereby\r\n\r\nif  a  person  has  committed a certain  number  of\r\n\r\noffences he has to take a test again, or some  such\r\n\r\nrule.  Again this would mean increasing the  number\r\n\r\nand   improving  the  quality  of  traffic   police\r\n\r\npersonnel.  [Interruption] Sir, lots of suggestions\r\n\r\nare  coming  from  the  Backbenches!

Of course, ideally if we\r\n\r\ncould  post a policeman at every street  corner  we\r\n\r\ncould   catch  every  one  of  them.  But   it   is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that the number of policemen  one  can\r\n\r\nhave  in  the  force is determined, first,  by  the\r\n\r\ncost, and, secondly, by the availability of men. As\r\n\r\nI  have  stated earlier, in connection with another\r\n\r\nquestion, last year alone 260,735 traffic  offences\r\n\r\nwere  committed.  This is a very high  figure.  The\r\n\r\nbest  way  to reduce the number of traffic offences\r\n\r\nwill be for the public to realise that they have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  that they  should  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible obey the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards commercial crimes, I believe a\r\n\r\nsomewhat  similar  question was  asked  last  year.\r\n\r\nSince   then  arrangements  have  been   made   for\r\n\r\npersonnel  in the Commercial Crimes Branch  of  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. and other police officers to attend courses\r\n\r\nconducted  by the Extramural Studies Department  of\r\n\r\nthe   University  of  Singapore  to  give  them   a\r\n\r\nbackground  in  banking  and  accounting   matters.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the fact that crime in this  field\r\n\r\nis  liable to vary and become more sophisticated as\r\n\r\nSingapore  becomes  more an international  business\r\n\r\ncentre, a separate bureau in the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers with experienced staff will be set  up  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  offences in connection  with  commerce\r\n\r\nand industry. It can be envisaged that the officers\r\n\r\nattached  to such a section will have the expertise\r\n\r\nand be trained for commercial crime detection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  view of the answers given to the  various\r\n\r\npoints   I   have  raised,  which  I   find   quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  and  acceptable,  I  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nanswers  that the Minister has given  will  be  put\r\n\r\ninto  practice by the police officers in  improving\r\n\r\nthe police force, and I believe that this will give\r\n\r\nbetter service to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of\r\n\r\nMessrs.

I\r\n\r\nhave been told that a great number of regular users\r\n\r\nof the services of the unit have recently had their\r\n\r\nservices  withdrawn  from them  without  sufficient\r\n\r\nwarning.   I   have  also  been  told  that   fresh\r\n\r\napplications  for  the services of  the  Guard  and\r\n\r\nEscort  Unit  are  no longer being  entertained.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to take the opportunity of asking  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what plans he has to expand the  services\r\n\r\nprovided by this unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of our inability to provide the\r\n\r\nservices  required,  I  would  also  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister  will  allow  private  firms\r\n\r\nproviding similar services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be adequately armed. I believe that the present\r\n\r\nposition  is  that  they are  not  allowed  to  arm\r\n\r\nthemselves.  So long as we allow valuable  property\r\n\r\nto  go  unprotected, it seems to me  that  this  is\r\n\r\nrather  a dangerous situation and we are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nindirectly encouraging the commission of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite\r\n\r\ntrue that of late the Guard and Escort Unit has not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  accede to a number of  requests  to\r\n\r\nprovide escort services. Let me put the position in\r\n\r\nits proper perspective. The authorised strength  of\r\n\r\nthe  Guard and Escort Unit is 13 officers and 1,227\r\n\r\nmen.  However, its actual strength is  12  officers\r\n\r\nand  1,034 men; that is to say, it is short of  one\r\n\r\nofficer  and  193  men. On every working  day,  the\r\n\r\nGuard  and  Escort Unit provides  services  to  151\r\n\r\nbanks, Government departments, statutory boards and\r\n\r\ncommercial  firms, in addition to providing  guards\r\n\r\nfor  specific duties in other places.  All  efforts\r\n\r\nare   being  made  to  accommodate  requests   from\r\n\r\nbusiness  houses  for  escort services.  In  recent\r\n\r\ntimes the demand for the services of the Guard  and\r\n\r\nEscort  Unit has increased largely because  of  the\r\n\r\nincreased  public  awareness of the  advantages  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  protection. At the  moment  the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity Centre is being asked to make a  study\r\n\r\nof  the  Guard and Escort Unit so as to render  its\r\n\r\nservices  more  businesslike  and  to  meet  public\r\n\r\ndemand.  It  is hoped that some time this  year  we\r\n\r\nwill  reorganise  this  unit by  recruiting  enough\r\n\r\npersonnel to provide the necessary services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards arming the private security firms, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  put  the position  in  its  proper\r\n\r\nperspective.  Let  me  give the  figures  of  armed\r\n\r\nrobbery in Singapore. In 1969, there were 26  cases\r\n\r\nof  armed robbery where firearms were used.  Last\r\n\r\nyear the number was 25. It has gone down by one. In\r\n\r\nrespect  of bank, goldsmith and pawnshop robberies,\r\n\r\nthere were 11 cases in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  10  cases in 1970.

Let me talk about\r\n\r\ntheir general behaviour at functions because I  had\r\n\r\nsome  experience  of this. I attended  a  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  function once and I was rather impressed  by\r\n\r\nthe  parade, especially the marching of  the  first\r\n\r\nfew columns. However, when it was all over and when\r\n\r\nthe  drinks  were served, I had to step aside  very\r\n\r\nagilely  in order not to get trampled in  the  rush\r\n\r\nfor these refreshments. Perhaps they need a certain\r\n\r\namount  of training in behaviour. This may be  just\r\n\r\nan  indication  of their behaviour.  I  think  some\r\n\r\nadvice  on  how  to behave under such circumstances\r\n\r\nmay be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish to raise some questions relating  to\r\n\r\nthe Vigilante\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorps.  As  far  as we know, they  had  a  glorious\r\n\r\nhistory  a  few  years ago when we were  confronted\r\n\r\nwith  the  problem of internal security.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nmany people responded to the call of the Government\r\n\r\nby  joining  the Vigilante Corps and  played  their\r\n\r\npart well in helping the police to preserve law and\r\n\r\norder   and  maintain  public  security.  In   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  we must express our appreciation  to  the\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who  took part in the  Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nactivities. However, as far as I know,  the  number\r\n\r\nof  volunteers has diminished greatly in  the  last\r\n\r\nyear  or  so.  At the beginning there  were  10,000\r\n\r\nvolunteers in the Vigilante Corps. In the last  few\r\n\r\nyears  the number has gone down to 2,000  or  3,000\r\n\r\nvolunteers. I would like to know the reason for the\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  the  number  of  volunteers  in   the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps. Is it because of the question  of\r\n\r\ntraining,  or  because we do not give  them  enough\r\n\r\nallowance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we know that the number of national\r\n\r\nservicemen  serving in the Vigilante Corps  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  exceeds  10,000.  This  is  quite  a  large\r\n\r\nfigure.   National  servicemen   serving   in   the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps have to undergo six months'  basic\r\n\r\ntraining. After that, they have to undergo training\r\n\r\nonce  or  twice a week. This is quite adequate.  My\r\n\r\nquestion  is  this. Have these national  servicemen\r\n\r\nbeen detailed for patrol duty so far? And have they\r\n\r\ncarried out their duties in the same manner as  the\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who were sent out in the  old  days  on\r\n\r\npatrol  and  to  assume  guard  duties  in  various\r\n\r\nplaces?  If they have been sent out, what  kind  of\r\n\r\nduties   have  they  been  performing?  Has   their\r\n\r\nperformance been satisfactory? I would like to know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  people  who  have  undergone    the\r\n\r\ntraining can perform their duties well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nexplain why I am speaking up for the police and the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps?

In  view  of what the Member  has  said,  I\r\n\r\nextend a ready welcome to all Backbenchers to visit\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante  Corps  headquarters  so  as  to  be\r\n\r\napprised  of the development and the progress  that\r\n\r\nwe are making over there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may attempt to answer the queries\r\n\r\nraised  by  the Member for Sembawang, the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps initially was founded upon volunteer manpower\r\n\r\nsix years ago. In 1967, the V.C. began its role  as\r\n\r\nan  organisation for national servicemen under  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps Ordinance. The concept of the Corps\r\n\r\nis  the  same  today as it was at the time  of  its\r\n\r\ninception. It is a youth training organisation.  It\r\n\r\ntakes  in our youthful citizens from various levels\r\n\r\nof  our  society.  National  servicemen  enter  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps  and are trained to  be  efficient\r\n\r\nindividuals,  good citizens, responsible  neighbours\r\n\r\nand    loyal   national   servicemen.   There   are\r\n\r\nlimitations  in a national servicemen  organisation\r\n\r\nlike   the  Vigilante  Corps.  But  despite   these\r\n\r\nlimitations,  I  am able to say that  the  officer\r\n\r\nlevels, both in the non-national servicemen  level and national servicemen level, \r\n\r\nare   doing  a  magnificent  job  in  training  our\r\n\r\nyouthful   citizens  to  become   disciplined   and\r\n\r\nresponsible members of a uniformed organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some development of late in the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps. Today the Corps is being  prepared\r\n\r\nfor  a  civil defence role, which means that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  reorganisation  of  the  schedule  of\r\n\r\nservice.  Where  previously  it  was  intended  for\r\n\r\nexample,  to assign members of the Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nto  constituency duties at the end of  their  eighth\r\n\r\nyear  of  service in the 42-year part-time national\r\n\r\nservice,  the  schedule of  service  has  now  been\r\n\r\naltered to provide for Vigilante Corps training  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  four years, civil defence training  for\r\n\r\nthe  second four years, after which members of  the\r\n\r\nCorps  will be assigned to constituency  duties  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  four-year  phase, which  is  termed  the\r\n\r\n\"reserve  phase'.  To that extent,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nschedule of service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Vigilante  Corps has been  changed.  Thus,\r\n\r\nanswering  the specific query raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang, Vigilante Corps members, therefore,\r\n\r\nwill  not be assigned to constituency duties  until\r\n\r\nafter  the eighth year on the present new  schedule\r\n\r\nof service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why volunteer members in the Corps are\r\n\r\ndiminishing  in number, the reason is  simply  that\r\n\r\nthe  Corps today is basically a national servicemen\r\n\r\norganisation.  And  the  number  of  volunteers  is\r\n\r\ndiminishing in view of this fact. I can inform  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang  that  all  members  of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante   Corps  receive  reasonable   rates   of\r\n\r\nallowance to assist them to attend parades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's query on the performance of\r\n\r\nthe Corps today, I am able to say that, considering\r\n\r\nthe  tremendous  size of the organisation  and  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  it takes, as I have said, our  youthful\r\n\r\ncitizens  from all levels of society, the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  is indeed performing a magnificent job,  and\r\n\r\nnot  least  the  officer levels  are  performing  a\r\n\r\nmagnificent  job in training such a vast  uniformed\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswering the Member for Katong, Sir, I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  that there could be occasions such as the  one\r\n\r\nhe  has  described where members of the Corps  have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated their over-enthusiasm for tea. But, in\r\n\r\nfact,  I  have  taken  note of such  incidents  and\r\n\r\nbrought them to the attention of the Commandant  of\r\n\r\nthe  Corps,  and he and his group of  officers  are\r\n\r\nattempting  to  gear  this  uniformed  organisation\r\n\r\nalong lines of gracious living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I trust that I have answered all the queries\r\n\r\nof Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that,\r\n\r\nas  a result of my raising what I confess now to be\r\n\r\na  relatively trivial issue, a great deal of  light\r\n\r\nhas been thrown on the more fundamental aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe work of the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2176.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what sort of courses have been\r\n\r\nconducted for officers and what sort of courses are\r\n\r\nanticipated which will incur expenses amounting  to\r\n\r\n$8,400?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, the provision of $8,400\r\n\r\nin  the 1971-72 estimates is for 100 teachers  from\r\n\r\nthe  secondary  schools who are  potential  officer\r\n\r\nmaterial  to  undergo  residential  basic  training\r\n\r\ncourses  at  the Police Academy.

Applications for visas are considered\r\n\r\nfor  a  very long time before decisions  are  made.\r\n\r\nMany  of  our  citizens apply  to  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  bring  in  their  wives,  children,\r\n\r\nfriends,  etc., for a visit to Singapore.  When  an\r\n\r\napplication  is  made,  supporting  evidence   like\r\n\r\nmarriage  certificates, birth  certificates,  etc.,\r\n\r\nare  called for. Even after the submission  of  the\r\n\r\nrequired  evidence,  it  takes  the  department   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  length of time before a  decision  is\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enquiries about the application evoke the reply\r\n\r\nthat   it   is  under  consideration.   When   this\r\n\r\nconsideration  takes  a long time,  one  begins  to\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the application  is  really  under\r\n\r\nconsideration  or  whether it  is  filed  away  and\r\n\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sore point concerns citizens with wives\r\n\r\nor  husbands born in Malaysia. In many cases  their\r\n\r\nmarriages  were  solemnised  by  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nMarriages in Singapore and yet permanent entry into\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  denied to them. In such  cases,  the\r\n\r\nwife  or  husband stays in Singapore on a visitor's\r\n\r\npass. They have to go for a fortnightly renewal  of\r\n\r\ntheir  visas  either at the Immigration check-point\r\n\r\nat  Woodlands  or at South Quay. Some  people  even\r\n\r\ntake  a fortnight's leave to Johore Bahru and  come\r\n\r\nback with a new chop. Sometimes this visitor's pass\r\n\r\nis extended to three months. One has to pay $10 for\r\n\r\nthe  renewal  of  a three-month visitor's  pass.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether it is cheaper to pay $10 and  get  a\r\n\r\nthree-month   visa   or  have  it   stamped   every\r\n\r\nfortnight.  To  all intents and purposes,  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  people  who  have their  wives  or  husbands\r\n\r\npermanently  staying in Singapore, with  periodical\r\n\r\nextensions of the visitor's pass, own shops or  are\r\n\r\notherwise  self-employed.  I  can  understand   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty of their not being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable  to obtain Singapore citizenship, but I cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  the difficulty of their not being  able\r\n\r\nto  obtain permanent stay here even though they are\r\n\r\nholding permanent jobs or are self-employed and are\r\n\r\ncapable  of maintaining their families. If you  say\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  earn enough and deny them  permanent\r\n\r\nstay,  they  will keep their wives here continually\r\n\r\non  a visitor's pass. I would like the Minister  to\r\n\r\ninform  the  House  why these people,  who  to  all\r\n\r\nintents  and purposes have been residing  here  for\r\n\r\nyears, are denied permanent stay in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  under  this subhead I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister one or two questions. The Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah has raised some questions, and I share  his\r\n\r\nsympathy for the people affected. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask   the   Minister   in  what  circumstances   an\r\n\r\napplication for permanent stay can be approved.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Telok Blangah has pointed  out,  if\r\n\r\nthe husband is a Singapore citizen and the wife  is\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia and there is a marriage  certificate\r\n\r\nto  prove  their relationship, and  also  there  is\r\n\r\nproof that their children are born in Singapore, in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  case  the  Immigration  authorities  would\r\n\r\nnormally give her only three to six months stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  instead of permanent residence.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  complaints  that  last  year  they   were\r\n\r\ngranted a stay here for as long as a year, but this\r\n\r\nyear  they have reduced the one year's stay to  six\r\n\r\nmonths, with a provision of renewal of their  pass.\r\n\r\nThis   causes   the  people  concerned  unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconvenience, because the husband would definitely\r\n\r\nhave  to  shoulder  his responsibility  in  looking\r\n\r\nafter  his own family, including his wife. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  point which our own Government should worry\r\n\r\nabout.   The  question  of  giving  such  a  person\r\n\r\npermanent  stay  here  is a  reasonable  matter  to\r\n\r\nconsider. I therefore ask the Minister what are the\r\n\r\nconditions to be satisfied before an application is\r\n\r\napproved for permanent stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nsupport  the comments made by the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah.  I  myself have come across a very  tragic\r\n\r\ncase.  A man had worked in a British hospital  here\r\n\r\nfor  16 years and had settled down here. He married\r\n\r\na Singapore citizen, had two children who were born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and bought a Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flat.  After his discharge from the  British\r\n\r\nArmed Forces, he was sent back to Malaysia, and his\r\n\r\nfamily  was left alone in Singapore. At the  moment\r\n\r\nhe  is  still shuttling back and forth to have  his\r\n\r\nvisitor's  pass stamped every fortnight.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister for Home Affairs  will  give\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration to such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that some\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament should raise this question of\r\n\r\nentry  of  wives and children of Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nis  to  be expected. In fact, I believe this is  an\r\n\r\nalmost annual affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaints of long delays, I have\r\n\r\nasked  the  Controller of Immigration how  long  it\r\n\r\ntakes to process an application, and he has replied\r\n\r\nthat  it  takes  about three weeks to  process  the\r\n\r\napplication, provided all the necessary information\r\n\r\nis  given. If it is not given, the processing takes\r\n\r\na longer period. This is the mechanics of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question asked by the Member for Sembawang is\r\n\r\nquite  a  pertinent one. This is  the  question  of\r\n\r\napplication of permanent residence. Let  me,  first\r\n\r\nof  all, state that getting permanent residence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  neither a right nor an  entitlement.\r\n\r\nThere   are   many  considerations  involved.   The\r\n\r\nrationale  is a very simple one. We have  only  224\r\n\r\nsquare  miles.  If  more  people  become  permanent\r\n\r\nresidents  in Singapore, we might relieve temporary\r\n\r\nhardship for a number of cases, but we are going to\r\n\r\ncompound the hardship for the next generation. This\r\n\r\nis the general criterion. When we consider cases of\r\n\r\nwives  and children of Singapore citizens,  we  ask\r\n\r\nourselves  very  basic questions. Can  the  persons\r\n\r\nconcerned support their families? If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey can, we admit them. If they cannot, we have to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  it is a very difficult case  and  we\r\n\r\nhave difficulty in approving the application.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh raised a very specific\r\n\r\ncase. I am not fully aware of all the details,  but\r\n\r\nI  presume  the man is not a Singapore citizen.  If\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  case, the general practice  is  that\r\n\r\nwives  and children follow the nationality of their\r\n\r\nhusbands. Therefore, he goes back to Malaysia if he\r\n\r\nis  a Malaysian citizen. That is how things are.  I\r\n\r\nknow  he has to undergo hardship, but getting entry\r\n\r\ninto  a  country  is  a very difficult  matter,  as\r\n\r\nanyone  who  tries  to enter another  country  from\r\n\r\nSingapore will know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has made a\r\n\r\nvery  important point, that is, whether the husband\r\n\r\nis able to support the wife. Sir, the wife has been\r\n\r\nhere for years on a visitor's pass, renewable every\r\n\r\nthree   or   six  months.  The  husband  has   been\r\n\r\nsupporting  her for two years, and  if  he  can  do\r\n\r\nthat, surely he can also look after her. Whether or\r\n\r\nnot  permanent entry is given to her, she is  still\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Renewal of a visitor's pass  is  not\r\n\r\ntoo  difficult. How do such people become a  burden\r\n\r\nto us? The husband is a Singapore citizen. His wife\r\n\r\nis  not asking for citizenship, but just a right to\r\n\r\nstay  with  him with official sanction, instead  of\r\n\r\ngoing  every  two  weeks to Woodlands  to  get  her\r\n\r\nvisitor's pass extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, such people are\r\n\r\npermitted to stay if they get the necessary  social\r\n\r\nvisit  passes. It is not necessary for them,  every\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks, to go all the way to Woodlands  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  visas  stamped.  If,  in  fact,  the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned can really support his wife and children,\r\n\r\nthat  is  the reason why they are here.  Getting  a\r\n\r\nsocial  visit  pass is very different from  getting\r\n\r\npermanent  residence. He might not be able  to  get\r\n\r\npermanent  residence,  but  he  could  still  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore on a social visit pass. Permanent  status\r\n\r\nleads to other questions of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.
