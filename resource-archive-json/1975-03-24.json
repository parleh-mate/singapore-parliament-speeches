But\r\n\r\nas  soon  as  the last Estimates were approved  by\r\n\r\nthis  House  last year, a Ministry circular  dated\r\n\r\n28th  March,  1974, was issued advising  that  the\r\n\r\nfunction  of the Development Control Division  was\r\n\r\nto  be transferred from the Planning Department to\r\n\r\nthe  Building Control Division under  the  overall\r\n\r\ncharge   of   the  Assistant  Director   (Building\r\n\r\nControl)  of  the  Public Works  Department,  with\r\n\r\neffect  from 1st April, 1974. No reason  had  been\r\n\r\ngiven for the transfer of functions. But one thing\r\n\r\nwas  clear. It was a hasty decision because it had\r\n\r\nrendered  the last Main and Development  Estimates\r\n\r\nout  of  date as soon as it was approved  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not against the transfer of the Development\r\n\r\nControl  Division to the Building Control Division\r\n\r\nof  the  PWD.  In fact, I thought it  would  be  a\r\n\r\nrather good idea if it could cut down red tape  by\r\n\r\namalgamating the two Divisions, both  having  very\r\n\r\nclosely  related functions regulating  almost  all\r\n\r\naspects  of  the  physical  development   in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic. Although almost a year has lapsed, it is\r\n\r\nnoted  that  there  is still an  obvious  lack  of\r\n\r\ncommunication  and coordination  between  the  two\r\n\r\nDivisions  within the same Department. It  is  not\r\n\r\nunusual to realise that one Division is not  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  decision  or action taken  by  the  other\r\n\r\nDivision  and  members of the public involved  are\r\n\r\noften  required to transmit information  on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf. This has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresulted in unnecessary loss of valuable  time  to\r\n\r\nboth the Department and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister is aware of this and\r\n\r\nwhether  immediate  remedial  measures  would   be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to rectify the situation in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve the intended objective of the transfer  of\r\n\r\nthe  function  or  part of  the  function  of  the\r\n\r\nPlanning   Department   to   the   Public    Works\r\n\r\nDepartment. I am sure the Minister will agree that\r\n\r\nthe  sooner  the working relationship  within  the\r\n\r\nDepartment is improved, the more expeditiously and\r\n\r\neffectively it will serve the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like to speak under\r\n\r\nthis  subhead is on demolition enforcement. It  is\r\n\r\nnoted  that the demolition enforcement policy  has\r\n\r\nbeen rather inconsistent and that the action taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Department has been rather unpredictable.\r\n\r\nThere  were  complaints that stringent action  had\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  against those who had  difficulty  in\r\n\r\ncommunicating  with  officers of  the  Department.\r\n\r\nThere  were also complaints that swift action  had\r\n\r\nbeen taken against those members of the public who\r\n\r\nhad   innocently  put  up  minor  extensions   and\r\n\r\nrepairs,  as  have  already  been  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Jurong and Paya Lebar. And  sometimes\r\n\r\neven awnings erected over windows to keep off  the\r\n\r\nweather  had  to  be demolished at  short  notice,\r\n\r\nwhile   other  unauthorised  erections  had   been\r\n\r\nallowed  to  remain. If this is not inconsistency,\r\n\r\nwhat is? What about unauthorised erections put  up\r\n\r\nby  Government agencies or statutory bodies?  What\r\n\r\naction has been taken against them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Most of these problems\r\n\r\nhave  now  been  resolved, but if members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic   encounter  inconveniences   because   the\r\n\r\ndepartments do not function efficiently, they  are\r\n\r\nrequested to write in to my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division's demolition enforcement officer by\r\n\r\nthe very nature of his work attracts an impression\r\n\r\nof  harshness and rigidity, while in effect he  is\r\n\r\nmerely  discharging the unpleasant duties  of  his\r\n\r\njob  which  is  really  not an  easy  one.  Actual\r\n\r\nphysical demolition represents the culmination  of\r\n\r\nvery  careful  consideration and decision  by  the\r\n\r\nDivision's  officers in every case. Demolition  is\r\n\r\nresorted  to  when  all avenues for  the  possible\r\n\r\nregularisation  or toleration of the  unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures  are exhausted. Members of  the  public\r\n\r\nshould  not erect unauthorised structures  in  the\r\n\r\nhope  of  escaping  official  detection.  Building\r\n\r\nprocedures  have  been  streamlined,  but  relaxed\r\n\r\nwherever  possible.

One section of the Planning Department  was\r\n\r\nto   deal  with  the  Master  Plan  and  long-term\r\n\r\nplanning,  and  the  other section  known  as  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Control Division is to operate  under\r\n\r\nthe PWD. As a result of the split, the position of\r\n\r\nthe professional planners is not clear. The morale\r\n\r\nof  the officers is low. They even fear to talk to\r\n\r\nmembers of the public, who from time to time  seek\r\n\r\npreliminary advice prior to submission  of  formal\r\n\r\napplications to the Development Control Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In overseas countries development control is\r\n\r\nalways  part  of the Planning Department  for  the\r\n\r\nefficient operation of planning control. What  was\r\n\r\nthe  reason  behind the split? Is  the  separation\r\n\r\ngoing to be permanent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how many resignations have\r\n\r\ntaken place since the separation? Are the planners\r\n\r\nwho   are  in  the  profession  happy  with   this\r\n\r\nseparation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether officers of\r\n\r\nboth  divisions are eligible to apply for a senior\r\n\r\npost  when  a  vacancy arises. At  the  moment,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  promotion  to  a  senior  post   is\r\n\r\nconfined  to  officers of the particular  division\r\n\r\nwhere  the  vacancy exists. This has caused  great\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  among  the  planners  because  of\r\n\r\nfrustration  and lack of promotion  prospects  and\r\n\r\nincentives.   This  was  what  I  was   given   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  from  a disappointed planner  who  has\r\n\r\nsince  resigned,  and  as you  know,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to recruit planners.

But instead of  the  tall\r\n\r\nbuilding  as expected, the site has been converted\r\n\r\ninto  a car park. Just imagine, a historic Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution  building demolished for  a  mere  car\r\n\r\npark!  May I know why the Planning Department  had\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts on the project in this  important\r\n\r\narea?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, another precious piece of land, the\r\n\r\nformer  Gemini Chit Fund site at Bras Basah  Road,\r\n\r\nhas  been converted into the best plot for growing\r\n\r\nlalang.  While there is acute shortage of land  in\r\n\r\nthe  city area for development, we find this place\r\n\r\nlying idle for growing lalang. I hope the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment will not be so fickle in its functions.\r\n\r\nEither  we develop according to schedule or  leave\r\n\r\nthe  place  to our citizens who are occupying  the\r\n\r\nland.

Building approvals\r\n\r\nhave  been  granted  for  some  areas  in  Wallich\r\n\r\nStreet,  which is indeed very good for the  uplift\r\n\r\nof  Anson constituency. However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  why there is some discrimination in the Tras\r\n\r\nStreet  area  where building approvals  have  been\r\n\r\ngranted for a certain section but not granted  for\r\n\r\nanother  section.  Can  the Minister  explain  the\r\n\r\npolicy of granting building approvals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the decision to split the long-term\r\n\r\nplanning  and  development control  functions  was\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  interest  of improving  efficiency.\r\n\r\nPrior  to  April,  1974, the  Development  Control\r\n\r\nDivision  which  deals  with  private  development\r\n\r\napplications was part of the Planning  Department,\r\n\r\nwhilst  the Building Control Division which  deals\r\n\r\nwith  building  plan approvals  was  part  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic    Works    Department.   Logically,    the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Control  Division  and  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Division  should be integrated  into  one\r\n\r\nunit  because building plan approvals are tied  up\r\n\r\nwith planning approvals and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Plan and long-range planning, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  embody  a  wider  area  of  planning\r\n\r\ncontrol   and   are  best  left  as   a   separate\r\n\r\ndepartment. This will save\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  long-range  planners from being  bogged  down\r\n\r\nwith  the  routine development applications  which\r\n\r\nentail  time-consuming interviews with  architects\r\n\r\nand   developers;  follow-up  action  on  planning\r\n\r\napprovals,  attendance  at  hearing  appeals   and\r\n\r\ntaking  enforcement action for  contraventions  of\r\n\r\nplanning permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the separation of functions, the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Control planners are  able  to  spend\r\n\r\nfull-time on the day-to-day applications  received\r\n\r\nfrom the private sector and are thus able to offer\r\n\r\nbetter  service to developers and architects.  The\r\n\r\nPlanning Department planners in turn are  able  to\r\n\r\ndo  a more thorough and uninterrupted job at long-range  and  block-planning and to  concentrate  on\r\n\r\npublic development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the transfer, there have been three\r\n\r\nresignations  of planners, two from  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  one from the Development  Control\r\n\r\nDivision.  All  three have resigned  for  personal\r\n\r\nreasons. Their resignations had nothing to do with\r\n\r\nthe transfer of the departmental functions. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  understood  why the Member for  Anson  should\r\n\r\nthink that the morale of the planners is very low.\r\n\r\nAdditional  senior posts have been  created  since\r\n\r\nthe  promotion, and the promotional  prospects  of\r\n\r\nplanners in both the Planning Department  and  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Control  Division   have   improved.\r\n\r\nVacancies of senior posts are now open to officers\r\n\r\nof both sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the former Raffles Institution\r\n\r\nsite  and the Gemini Chit Fund site at Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nRoad, I do not understand why the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nshould  blame  the  Planning  Department  for  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  development. It is not only  planning\r\n\r\napproval  that leads to a building. A lot  depends\r\n\r\nupon   the   owners.  In  the  case   of   Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution, it belongs to the Development Bank of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For  their  own  reasons   they   have\r\n\r\npostponed  the  construction of the building.  The\r\n\r\nproposal has been temporarily shelved. At one time\r\n\r\nit  was  because of the shortage of skilled labour\r\n\r\nand building materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   project  has  since  been  revived  and  the\r\n\r\narchitects, I understood, are now proceeding  with\r\n\r\nthe  detailed planning. The site would not be left\r\n\r\nas a car park-cum-school field as it is now, but a\r\n\r\n70-storey  building is coming  up  and  it  should\r\n\r\nsatisfy the Member in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gemini Chit Fund site was granted planning\r\n\r\napproval  in 1968 for a hotel/commercial building.\r\n\r\nThis  permission was cancelled in 1970 because  of\r\n\r\nnon-compliance  with planning  conditions.  A  new\r\n\r\nproposal   for   the  erection  of   a   24-storey\r\n\r\nhotel/commercial building was approved  in  April,\r\n\r\n1973.  The  developers  have  requested  that  the\r\n\r\nproject   be  deferred  because  of  the   current\r\n\r\neconomic situation. Since this site belongs  to  a\r\n\r\nprivate developer, the Division cannot compel  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  to proceed if he is unable  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nHowever,  every encouragement is being  given  for\r\n\r\nthe revival of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to reply to the Member's last\r\n\r\nquestion without details of the site being  given.\r\n\r\nHe  refers  to  new  buildings  being  allowed  in\r\n\r\nWallich Street. Perhaps he is referring to the one\r\n\r\nat  the  junction of Wallich Street and Peck  Seah\r\n\r\nStreet where planning approval was granted for the\r\n\r\nerection   of  a  17-storey  office  building   in\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1972. In contrast to the site  at  Tras\r\n\r\nStreet, which is only about 2,900 sq, ft, in area,\r\n\r\nthe  site  at the Wallich Street/Peck Seah  Street\r\n\r\njunction  is about 10,000 sq, ft, and therefore  a\r\n\r\nbuilding could be allowed without prejudicing  the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive redevelopment of the area. The other\r\n\r\none  was not approved on the grounds that  it  was\r\n\r\nmade  on  a  piece-meal basis and  too  small  and\r\n\r\nlikely     to    prejudice    the    comprehensive\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

No damage could arise where\r\n\r\nresidents  are  concerned.  This  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsolutions   as   Singapore  is  short   of   land.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  it  would  be  advisable  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could acquire certain pieces  of  land\r\n\r\nand  give them to the farmers to cultivate for our\r\n\r\ndaily needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we cannot depend much on\r\n\r\nagriculture, what about fishing?

For  that  I  am   very\r\n\r\ngrateful to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the job of the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction   Department   is   to   further    the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our agriculture and fisheries  and\r\n\r\nto  assist  the  rural  people  to  improve  their\r\n\r\nmethods  of  production so that their standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  could  be  raised.  However,  I  am   most\r\n\r\ndisappointed  to  find that recently  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department officers have  become  land\r\n\r\ninspectors instead. They go round to check whether\r\n\r\nthe  villagers have erected any illegal structures\r\n\r\nor  whether  their buildings have  been  used  for\r\n\r\nillegal  purposes. I have here a letter  from  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Lands addressed to me saying  that\r\n\r\na  farmer in my constituency is manufacturing kaya\r\n\r\na  kind of coconut jam in his house, and that this\r\n\r\nmatter was reported to him by a land inspector  in\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department. Then there  is\r\n\r\nalso  another  farmer who was found by  a  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department land inspector to have  used\r\n\r\nhis  store  as  a hatchery without permission.  In\r\n\r\nactual   fact  a  hatchery  is  another  form   of\r\n\r\nagricultural  activity.  If  the  farmer  had  not\r\n\r\napplied  for  such  a  permit,  then  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  officer  should  be   more\r\n\r\nsympathetic in his attitude. He should advise  the\r\n\r\nfarmer as to how an application could be made  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose. On the contrary, the land inspector\r\n\r\nnot  only did not give any advice but reported  it\r\n\r\nto  the Commissioner of Lands. So this poor farmer\r\n\r\nremoved  the incubators out of the store, thinking\r\n\r\nthat the matter would end there and there would be\r\n\r\nno   more  trouble.  But  the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  did  not stop there. It  made  a  very\r\n\r\nabsolute recommendation to the Land Office - allow\r\n\r\nme  to  read  out  the  original  letter  for  the\r\n\r\nappreciation of hon.

As an MP for a rural  area,\r\n\r\nI  am  most disgusted and painstricken at the base\r\n\r\nattitude adopted by the officers of the Department\r\n\r\nwho  regard the farmers as enemies. With  such  an\r\n\r\nattitude,   how   are  they   going   to   promote\r\n\r\nagricultural development? I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nreassess  the scope of operations of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  and  conduct   a   special\r\n\r\npolitical  training course for those officers  who\r\n\r\nhave frequent contact with the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the current resettlement regulations,\r\n\r\nthe  allocation of land to affected farmers  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  be recommended by the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment.  However, there  are  complaints  that\r\n\r\nsome   people   who  are  not   engaged   in   any\r\n\r\nagricultural work at all have been so recommended.\r\n\r\nFinally these people chose to be allocated a  free\r\n\r\nflat  with higher compensation, while some genuine\r\n\r\nfarmers  were not recommended for land allocation.\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to ask the Minister what are the\r\n\r\ncriteria   adopted   by  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  making  recommendations  for   the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  land, and whether  the  survey  of\r\n\r\nfarmers  by the Primary Production Department  was\r\n\r\ndone  before  or after finalising the registration\r\n\r\nof  farmers  by the Resettlement Office.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister enlighten the House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Jurong, of course, always supports\r\n\r\nthe  farmers and fishermen who live in  his  area,\r\n\r\nbut  we now have a new supporter in the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson who has also become a farmer, fisherman  and\r\n\r\ngardener.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the left hand of one department does\r\n\r\nnot know what the right hand is doing, MPs ask  me\r\n\r\nquestions, like the Member for Kim Keat.

So when there  is\r\n\r\ncommunication they question it, and when there  is\r\n\r\nlack of communication they also question it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong should be aware of the\r\n\r\nefforts of the Primary Production Department, even\r\n\r\nto  improve  market  gardening! Besides  providing\r\n\r\nservices  on  the sale of pesticides,  control  of\r\n\r\ndiseases   and  the  improvement  of  agricultural\r\n\r\npractices,   even   hydroponic   cultivation    of\r\n\r\nvegetables  has been encouraged so  as  to  obtain\r\n\r\nhigher  yields than ordinary vegetable cultivation\r\n\r\nmethods.  However,  that is for  hydroponics.  But\r\n\r\nbecause of the high capital cost, not many farmers\r\n\r\nhave attempted this yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department also assists the pig and poultry\r\n\r\nfarmers  by  the sale of high grade  piglings  and\r\n\r\nchicks   to   upgrade  stock  and  by  controlling\r\n\r\nlivestock  diseases.  Technical  know-how   gained\r\n\r\nthrough  research is disseminated to the  farmers.\r\n\r\nTo   encourage  more  efficient  production,   pig\r\n\r\nfarming  on  a  large  commercial  scale  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraged,  not  in  Jurong,  but  this  time  in\r\n\r\nPunggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultivation of crops on roof-tops of HDB\r\n\r\nfiats  is  not  considered  a  practical  nor   an\r\n\r\neconomical proposition. The flats are not designed\r\n\r\nto withstand any additional load or to accommodate\r\n\r\nthis kind of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fishing, Singapore has limited\r\n\r\nterritorial waters in which to fish. Our fishermen\r\n\r\nmust  go  out far to fish in international waters.\r\n\r\nThis  means  a hard vigorous life. Sometimes  they\r\n\r\nare kidnapped and held to ransom for long periods.\r\n\r\nSo  fishing is a prospect which most of our  young\r\n\r\nmen  are  reluctant  to take up,  especially  when\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  attractive and comfortable  jobs\r\n\r\navailable on terra firma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson likes to eat mutton, the\r\n\r\nprice  of  which he said has increased during  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years. This is true. The price of mutton\r\n\r\nwent up with other food items. In April to June\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast year the retail price was about $3.10 per lb.\r\n\r\nThis  was  at  its  peak. But the  price  has  now\r\n\r\ndropped by about 40 cents and this should keep the\r\n\r\nMember   happy.  We  are  dependent  on   imported\r\n\r\nsupplies  of mutton. However, frozen or fresh,  it\r\n\r\nis  expensive  to import live animals  as  freight\r\n\r\ncosts account for about one-third of the price  of\r\n\r\na live animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wanted to know the\r\n\r\ncriteria for the assessment of a bona fide farmer.\r\n\r\nThe status of a farmer is assessed on a number  of\r\n\r\nfactors.  Firstly, the actual number of  livestock\r\n\r\nthat the farmer owns, and secondly, the degree  of\r\n\r\nhis  other farming activities as determined by the\r\n\r\ndetailed census records of his activities over the\r\n\r\nlast  two  or three years. Thirdly, dependency  on\r\n\r\nfarming  for  a livelihood, and other  sources  of\r\n\r\nincome  are  also  taken into consideration.  This\r\n\r\ninformation is collected and reviewed by  a  panel\r\n\r\nin the Primary Production Department who then make\r\n\r\nrecommendations as to the status of  a  particular\r\n\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Member's information, five licences for\r\n\r\nkelong  operations  off the  coast  of  Tuas  were\r\n\r\nrevoked  by  the  Primary  Production  Department.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the sea coast of Tuas  is  affected\r\n\r\nby   reclamation   work   of   the   Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  speak  on  the  problems  of  pig\r\n\r\nfarmers.  In  the  past,  the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment did quite a great deal for the pig  and\r\n\r\npoultry   farmers.   For  example,   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department provided  inoculations  for\r\n\r\nthe  chickens  in  order to  develop  the  poultry\r\n\r\nindustry.  But I understand that this service  has\r\n\r\nstopped recently. I do not know the reason. I feel\r\n\r\nthat inoculation of chickens should continue to be\r\n\r\nprovided  to  help our poultry farmers.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  Department  should also continue  to  provide\r\n\r\nassistance in methods of increasing production and\r\n\r\nhigher  egg yields so as to meet local consumption\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask two questions in this\r\n\r\nregard. Firstly, the pig farmers in Chua Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nare  being  resettled in Punggol. The  process  of\r\n\r\nresettlement will certainly affect the  production\r\n\r\nof pigs. During the transitional period the supply\r\n\r\nof  live pigs to the market will also be affected.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances I would therefore like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister what effective steps are being taken\r\n\r\nby  the Primary Production Department to ensure an\r\n\r\nadequate supply of pigs in the market during  this\r\n\r\ntransitional  period'? I would also like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  steps  are  being taken to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nprice of pork is stabilised in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, according to my understanding,\r\n\r\nlast   year   the  Primary  Production  Department\r\n\r\nplanned to set up an enterprise for pig farming in\r\n\r\nthe Central Experimental Station in Sembawang. Now\r\n\r\nthat  a year has passed, I would like to know what\r\n\r\nprogress has been made. Can the Minister enlighten\r\n\r\nthis House as to when will this enterprise for pig\r\n\r\nfarming be operational and when will it be able to\r\n\r\nsupply the market?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nremember   you  had  previously  ruled  that   the\r\n\r\ncolloquial  term used by the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nlikening a hawker inspector to a kind of land  cow\r\n\r\nwas  somewhat unparliamentary language and  could.\r\n\r\nnot  be  used in this House. This term  was  again\r\n\r\nused by the Member for Jurong just now. In view of\r\n\r\nyour  previous ruling, I wonder whether the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong would consider withdrawing such remarks\r\n\r\nas implied in the term used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this term is a colloquial\r\n\r\nexpression used by the people.

Sir, I accept the\r\n\r\nexplanation of my Friend, the Member for Jurong. I\r\n\r\nhave been called worse names in this House, but  I\r\n\r\nam  sure any name he calls me is with the best  of\r\n\r\nintention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the resettlement programme has been in\r\n\r\noperation for many years. The pig production  has,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  increased between 1967 and  1972.  This\r\n\r\nshows  that the resettlement programme has  little\r\n\r\neffect  on  the production of pigs.  Members  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  prices of pigs went  very  low  in\r\n\r\nearly  1972  causing  much  concern  to  the   MPs\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Production fell subsequently  in  1973\r\n\r\nand  1974  but this was because of other  economic\r\n\r\nfactors. Prices of feed for pigs increased in 1973\r\n\r\nand   1974  as  a  result  of  general  inflation.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, the cost of pig production went up\r\n\r\nand  the  marginal farmers were  eased  out.  Pork\r\n\r\nprices   also  rose.  Like  any  other  commodity,\r\n\r\nMembers  should be aware that the  price  of  pork\r\n\r\ndepends  on  supply  and  demand.  During  festive\r\n\r\nseasons  prices rise and fall back to the  general\r\n\r\nlevel  soon  after. It is not always  possible  to\r\n\r\nstabilise  the price of pork by merely  increasing\r\n\r\nor decreasing pig production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not very good news for the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang.  The intensive commercial  pig  farming\r\n\r\nscheme, which was previously proposed to be set up\r\n\r\nin  his  constituency,  is now  being  shifted  to\r\n\r\nPunggol.  Sembawang  has  been  designated  as   a\r\n\r\ncatchment area. Water comes first before pigs. The\r\n\r\nland  in Punggol is now under preparation and  the\r\n\r\nfirst  lots for these pig farms will be  available\r\n\r\nnext month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware whether the Member's allegation\r\n\r\nabout  the  withdrawal of poultry  vaccination  is\r\n\r\ntrue  or  not. If it is, then it is an undesirable\r\n\r\nstep and I will certainly look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 am very glad to note that we\r\n\r\nhave  a  very broad-minded Minister. I  think  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary could learn a lot from him\r\n\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister referred to his Ministry\r\n\r\ncoordinating  the work of the various departments.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that I do not mean that\r\n\r\nthere  should  not  be  any  coordination  between\r\n\r\ngovernment departments. Coordination is  good  but\r\n\r\nevery department must know its own basic functions\r\n\r\nand  role in dealing with the people. For example,\r\n\r\nin  dealing with the people, officials should take\r\n\r\na  sympathetic view of the matter. In the  case  I\r\n\r\ncited just now, I feel that the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  was  too  cruel.  Even  the   electric\r\n\r\nsockets  and  plugs  had  to  be  removed.  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, this is going too far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also informed the House just now\r\n\r\nthat  in my constituency five licences for kelongs\r\n\r\nhad  been  revoked. I am aware  of  this.  But  my\r\n\r\nquestion  i5  this: in the revocation of  licences\r\n\r\nfor  the kelongs, the fishermen need fishing boats\r\n\r\nto  go to the kelongs. And the problem is that the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department has refused to issue\r\n\r\nlicences  for  these fishing boats. As  a  result,\r\n\r\nkelong  workers and owners are not able to  go  to\r\n\r\ntheir  kelongs  in  their boats.  Hence  the  fish\r\n\r\ncaught  would be utterly lost. So I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether licences  for  fishing\r\n\r\nboats can be issued to them so that they can go to\r\n\r\nthe kelongs. If he can promise me this, I will  be\r\n\r\nvery grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards deep-sea fishing, I am quite\r\n\r\naware  of  the hard life of these fishermen:  They\r\n\r\nare  exposed  to all sorts of dangers,  risks  and\r\n\r\neven  piracy on the high seas. I am sure that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  also understands their problems.  He  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  good Minister as he takes an interest  in\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of fishermen who are exposed to risks\r\n\r\nand  dangers. I feel that the Government has  some\r\n\r\nresponsibility to help the fishermen solve some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their  problems. We should get in  touch  with\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries and work out some arrangement  to\r\n\r\nensure  the safety of our fishing vessels  on  the\r\n\r\nhigh  seas and to ensure that should our fishermen\r\n\r\ngo  into  the  territorial waters of  other  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries by mistake, they should be permitted  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  fishing  there.  I  wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister will agree to this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as for the boat licences requested for by\r\n\r\nthe   Member,  I  will  certainly  look  into  his\r\n\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our fishermen, we do not abandon them on\r\n\r\nthe  high  seas.  When  they are  caught,  whether\r\n\r\nrightly  or wrongly, our Foreign Office does  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the government concerned.  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou  may  remember  the research  vessel  \"Changi\"\r\n\r\ndetained  in Rangoon. We made many representations\r\n\r\nthrough  the Foreign Office, and the Head  of  the\r\n\r\nFisheries  Department  of the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment made several trips to Rangoon not  only\r\n\r\nto  help  the seamen who were detained but  in  an\r\n\r\neffort to get them out. Finally we succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware whether the question of fisheries\r\n\r\nhas been taken up in ASEAN.

I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the Minister could look into this  matter\r\n\r\nand give his sympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I am going to raise with the\r\n\r\nMinister has already been brought up by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong,  and therefore I would  like  to  ask\r\n\r\nanother    question.   The   fishermen    in    my\r\n\r\nconstituency, that is, in Telok Mata  ikan,  Bedok\r\n\r\nand  Ayer Gemuroh, are very badly affected by land\r\n\r\nreclamation  work. Big monsoon  drains  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  about  two  years ago.  I  have  asked  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department and the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  who were  in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land,  to  make  every  effort  not  to\r\n\r\ninconvenience  the  fishermen  in  that  area.   I\r\n\r\nremember   having  asked  the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  to construct a temporary  bridge  over\r\n\r\nthe  monsoon  drain  for the  convenience  of  the\r\n\r\nfishermen  so that they can bring their  nets  and\r\n\r\nother fishing gear to the sea. At the same time  I\r\n\r\nhave also asked the Department to construct a path\r\n\r\nleading  to the sea for the fishermen.  But  until\r\n\r\nnow  this  job has not been done and the fishermen\r\n\r\nare very unhappy about it. Some three weeks ago  I\r\n\r\nasked  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development to convene a meeting with\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department and the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board, but to my surprise nothing\r\n\r\nhas been done. When I pressed the matter further I\r\n\r\nlearned  that  the  Primary Production  Department\r\n\r\nofficers  were asking the Housing Board  engineers\r\n\r\nas to who have got to pay for the bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this state of affairs has been going on for\r\n\r\nnearly two years. I was given to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstand that the land reclamation work would be\r\n\r\ncompleted in about a year's time. I hope that this\r\n\r\nyear, within a period of 12 months, something  can\r\n\r\nbe done to help these fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the facts are that the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is dredging the coast off Changi\r\n\r\nto  provide fill for the reclamation in the  Telok\r\n\r\nAyer Basin. As a result the licences of 15 kelongs\r\n\r\naffected by the dredging have, therefore, not been\r\n\r\nrenewed. The licensees have been given one  year's\r\n\r\nadvance notice. But as the dredging works have yet\r\n\r\nto  reach  these kelongs, the operators have  been\r\n\r\nallowed  to  continue  their  operation   in   the\r\n\r\nmeantime.  Fishing  boats  serving  the   affected\r\n\r\nkelongs  have  not been issued with  licences,  as\r\n\r\nlicences  for  the kelongs have not been  renewed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  arrangements  will  be  made  to   issue\r\n\r\ntemporary licences to these boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any reclamation work must interfere with\r\n\r\nfishing, kelongs and their operations. Two loading\r\n\r\nand  unloading areas for the fishermen  have  been\r\n\r\ndesignated  on the coast between Bedok  and  Tanah\r\n\r\nMerah  Besar. Roads have been provided across  the\r\n\r\nreclaimed land to these loading areas for the  use\r\n\r\nand  benefit of the fishermen. A crossing over the\r\n\r\nconveyor belt system has been built servicing  the\r\n\r\nreclamation  works and a pedestrian bridge  across\r\n\r\nthe  drainage canal at Sungei Mata Ikan have  also\r\n\r\nbeen   provided   for  the  convenience   of   the\r\n\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the Member complains, he has not been\r\n\r\nable to get much out of the Departments concerned,\r\n\r\nI would suggest that he puts this down in a letter\r\n\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the very kind remarks\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister,  I  beg leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper Supplement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n<br>Mr J.

The Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee has achieved quite a  lot\r\n\r\nin  the  past few years. It has provided a lot  of\r\n\r\nservices  and amenities for the rural  people  and\r\n\r\nhas  also  helped in the development of the  rural\r\n\r\nareas. Many roads, street lights, drains and water\r\n\r\nsupply have been provided in the rural areas. ,All\r\n\r\nthese have brought benefits and convenience to the\r\n\r\nrural  people.  However, in the last  one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears  the allocation for Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nhas been reduced drastically. For the current year\r\n\r\nthe provision is increased by about $200,000 only.\r\n\r\nThis  is insufficient to meet the demands  of  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. In the past few years many roads  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas have been metalled, streets lights\r\n\r\ninstalled, drains constructed and water  supplied.\r\n\r\nBut only half of the rural areas has been provided\r\n\r\nwith  these amenities. The other half of the rural\r\n\r\nareas  still  lacks these modern  facilities.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  allocate   more   funds   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment work to be carried out in  the  second\r\n\r\nhalf of the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask two further questions.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  find that many roads  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas deteriorate very fast. In other words,  many\r\n\r\npotholes appear on the surface of the roads in,  I\r\n\r\nthink, less than six months after construction. Is\r\n\r\nit because the authorities concerned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  not  exercised  strict  supervision  on  the\r\n\r\ncontractors engaged in building the roads? Do  the\r\n\r\ncontractors indulge in malpractices when  building\r\n\r\nroads? It is a waste of public funds. I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to take note of malpractices  among\r\n\r\nthe  contractors and see that the roads  built  by\r\n\r\nthe contractors are strictly supervised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we find that the roads built by the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen last longer than those  built\r\n\r\nby  the  contractors. This goes to show  that  the\r\n\r\nroads  built by national servicemen and  villagers\r\n\r\nare  more  durable, and every cent spent is  worth\r\n\r\nit.  Moreover, the expenditure incurred is  lower,\r\n\r\nand  is  therefore  cheaper than  roads  built  by\r\n\r\ncontractors.  If we allow the national  servicemen\r\n\r\nto  carry out road construction, then we can  save\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the expenditure because the  other  half\r\n\r\ngoes  to  the wages of the labourers. So  I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  ask  the  Minister  to  encourage  more\r\n\r\nnational    servicemen   to   engage    in    road\r\n\r\nconstruction. Firstly, they are more lasting  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly, we can save money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Sir, kampung roads are constructed for the use\r\n\r\nof  residents  only, and therefore can  take  only\r\n\r\nlight   traffic.  However,  once  the  roads   are\r\n\r\ncompleted, heavier vehicles and higher  volume  of\r\n\r\ntraffic are attracted to the area and this  causes\r\n\r\nthe  road  to  break up relatively quickly.  Rural\r\n\r\nroads  constructed by contractors normally have  a\r\n\r\nfour-inch  thick crusher run aggregate covered  by\r\n\r\n1k-inch thick asphalt. The standard roads  have  a\r\n\r\nfour-inch  thick  quarry waste sub-base  under  an\r\n\r\neight-inch layer of crusher run aggregate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncovered  by a two-inch asphalt premix. The latter,\r\n\r\nof course, cost very much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads constructed under gotong royong projects\r\n\r\nuse   PWD  machinery  and  workmen  and  voluntary\r\n\r\nassistance by members of the public, resulting  in\r\n\r\na saving in cost, and normally used to incorporate\r\n\r\na   sublayer  of  quarry  waste.  I  support   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of the Member to encourage more  gotong\r\n\r\nroyong road projects. However, there is a limit to\r\n\r\nwhich  the  PWD  machinery  and  workmen  can   be\r\n\r\ndeployed for this purpose as their routine work of\r\n\r\npatching  up potholes and repairing minor  damages\r\n\r\nto other roads would be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, I would like to thank the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  for  his explanation.

As a result of urban renewal in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency,  many  single  persons  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by it have been unable to obtain priority\r\n\r\nfor  allocation  of Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats.  The  Resettlement  Department  refused  to\r\n\r\nresettle  them on the ground that these subtenants\r\n\r\nhave  never lived there at the time when a  census\r\n\r\nwas taken and therefore their names did not appear\r\n\r\nin its register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the this ground unfortunate. Department's\r\n\r\nofficial held against them, it is most They are\r\n\r\nunlike those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  who,  knowing that the property  has  been\r\n\r\nacquired,  moved in and stayed after  the  cut-off\r\n\r\ndate,  in  the  hope  of  obtaining  priority  for\r\n\r\nallocation of HDB flats when eviction takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subtenants I am referring to are bona\r\n\r\nfide  residents, whose authenticity can be  proved\r\n\r\nbeyond  doubt as their identity cards  bear  their\r\n\r\nnames,  addresses and date of original issue  long\r\n\r\nbefore   the  acquisition  took  place.  But,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the reason why their names have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  recorded  in  the  census  at  the  time  of\r\n\r\nacquisition  is that they have \"missed  the  boat\"\r\n\r\nwhile working on board the ship, if I may use this\r\n\r\nanalogy  to  describe their position. Hence,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Resettlement Officers visited their place  of\r\n\r\nabode  to  take  census,  their  names  were   not\r\n\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that clothing, food,\r\n\r\naccommodation  and conduct are the four  important\r\n\r\nfactors in a man's life. If so, how can they  live\r\n\r\nwithout   accommodation?  They  are  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and how can we see them roaming  about\r\n\r\nin the streets without a roof over their heads?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Sir, I appeal to the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  make  a ruling on  this  matter  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  these unfortunate single persons,  the\r\n\r\nvictims  of  circumstances, who  have  lost  their\r\n\r\ndwelling places through no fault of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am afraid I am not prepared to make the\r\n\r\nruling asked for without an investigation into the\r\n\r\nfacts and particulars. Single persons affected  by\r\n\r\nresettlement    are   entitled   to    alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation and priority therefore if  they  can\r\n\r\nget others to join - two or three bachelors or two\r\n\r\nor  three spinsters getting together provided,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, they qualify in other respects. Here,  the\r\n\r\nMember  says that their identity cards  show  that\r\n\r\nthey are living at Bras Basah constituency and  at\r\n\r\nthe time of the census, they were not around. That\r\n\r\nraises a doubt as to whether they missed the  boat\r\n\r\nas  the Member said, either in Bras Basah or  they\r\n\r\nmissed  the boat elsewhere. Perhaps they were  not\r\n\r\nseamen.

According to the current policy of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board,  they  are   not\r\n\r\neligible  for  rehousing  under  the  resettlement\r\n\r\npriority scheme. Although they have been living in\r\n\r\nthese clearance sites for many years, they are not\r\n\r\nconsidered  for rehousing and have to  find  their\r\n\r\nown   alternative  accommodation,  which  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult.  As there is no way out, they  stay  on\r\n\r\nday  after day in the clearance sites. They do not\r\n\r\nknow what to do, and because of this the clearance\r\n\r\nprojects  have to be delayed. Therefore,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to\r\n\r\nreconsider  the  HDB  policy and  to  allow  these\r\n\r\npeople   to   purchase   HDB   flats   under   the\r\n\r\nresettlement priority scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Government's first duty is towards its\r\n\r\ncitizens.

Non-citizen\r\n\r\nfamilies   are   not  provided  with   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation by the HDB even though they  may  be\r\n\r\naffected by development projects. However, we have\r\n\r\nbecome  a little flexible.

I\r\n\r\nam sure the Minister is aware that many direct and\r\n\r\nindirect  savings and other benefits  will  accrue\r\n\r\nwith  the  introduction of  lift  attendants.  For\r\n\r\nexample,   it  will  cut  down,  if  not   totally\r\n\r\neliminate,  vandalism to lifts  and  other  public\r\n\r\nproperties:  This  is a direct, though  invisible,\r\n\r\nsaving  to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board.\r\n\r\nBesides,  the consequent reduction in crime  rate,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  robberies in the lifts or in the  flats,\r\n\r\nwould mean a saving not only to the society  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole but also to the Ministry of Home Affairs  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  their  costs  of  administration  and\r\n\r\noperation  against crime. But the  most  important\r\n\r\nconsequential  benefit is  that  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board estates will be  a  much  safer\r\n\r\nplace  to  live  in.  Therefore,  I  request   the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  take the suggestions  seriously  and\r\n\r\nperhaps I should take this opportunity to urge him\r\n\r\nto  consider  the possibility of  carrying  out  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive cost-benefit study on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is the most generally\r\n\r\nacknowledged fact that the quality of construction\r\n\r\nand  finish of HDB flats have obviously been  poor\r\n\r\nand deteriorating. I would like to know what steps\r\n\r\nare being taken to remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to ask the Minister - I\r\n\r\nhave  brought it up previously and I  am  sure  he\r\n\r\nwill  recall  it-  is the problem of  water-logged\r\n\r\nopen  spaces in Toa Payoh Town. I had raised  this\r\n\r\npoint in the past and he admitted then that he was\r\n\r\naware  of the problem and that he would look  into\r\n\r\nit. I wish to enquire what measures or action have\r\n\r\nbeen taken so far to remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, by and large, the standard of maintenance\r\n\r\nservices in Housing and Development Board  estates\r\n\r\nhas   not   deteriorated.  In  some  estates   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance contractors have found it uneconomical\r\n\r\nto  operate  unless they accumulate  their  repair\r\n\r\norders  over  a period so as to make  less  trips,\r\n\r\nthereby inconveniencing many residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has taken\r\n\r\nsteps  to  rectify this by dividing these  estates\r\n\r\ninto zones so that more contractors are engaged to\r\n\r\ndeal  effectively  in respect of  each  zone.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board has also  recently\r\n\r\nformed  a  high  level inspection  team  which  is\r\n\r\ncharged   with  the  task  of  looking  into   and\r\n\r\nrectifying  any  shortcomings in  the  maintenance\r\n\r\nservice.  The Board relies directly on its  daily-rated task force for the maintenance of 75% of its\r\n\r\nopen  public spaces. The remaining 25% of the work\r\n\r\nis let out to maintenance contractors. In a way it\r\n\r\nis  good  administration to have some  competition\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two groups as a guide to measurement\r\n\r\nof efficiency and cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to flooding referred to by the Member, sub-soil drainage has been introduced to the open\r\n\r\nspace  between Blocks Nos. 1 and 2, Lorong 6,  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  Part  of  the  area  was  also  raised  by\r\n\r\nadditional  fill and this measure  appears  to  be\r\n\r\nsatisfactory so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lifts, I can assure the Member that we do\r\n\r\nnot  brush aside reasonable suggestions. It  would\r\n\r\nappear impractical to introduce the lift attendant\r\n\r\nsystem.  We  had  discussed this  before  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  Today there are about 1,700 lifts  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.  Based  on 24 shifts per  day  per  lift,\r\n\r\nabout  4,250 lift attendants would be required  to\r\n\r\nman  the  lifts.  This number  would  continue  to\r\n\r\nincrease  in  future as more lifts  are  put  into\r\n\r\noperation  in new blocks of flats. At the  moment,\r\n\r\nof  course, it is not even easy to recruit such  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of lift attendants, even if residents  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay an additional $10 per  flat  per\r\n\r\nmonth for lift attendant services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member on the benefits lift\r\n\r\nattendants  must bring -reduced crime and  reduced\r\n\r\nvandalism, and general cleanliness. Some lifts are\r\n\r\nin a disgraceful condition because of the use made\r\n\r\nof  them  by  some people. But I  can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember  that we have not completely brushed  aside\r\n\r\nthe   suggestion  and  have  been  reviewing  this\r\n\r\nproposal over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, with more than 180,000 units of flats under\r\n\r\nthe  management  of  the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  and nearly half the population residing  in\r\n\r\nhousing  Board  flats, the problems  mentioned  by\r\n\r\nvarious Members of the House will increase in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  It  is  recognised that the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  has  a  formidable   task   to\r\n\r\nconstruct and manage the numerous housing estates.\r\n\r\nToo   often  have  we  heard  of  defects  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of flats, resettlement of  residents,\r\n\r\nhawkers,  parking  charges  and  the  attitude  of\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board officials  towards\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the main function of the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board is to  construct  as  many\r\n\r\nflats  as possible at the shortest possible  time,\r\n\r\nand  then  follow  up with strict  enforcement  of\r\n\r\ntenancy  and  lease agreements to prevent  abuses.\r\n\r\nVery  little  is being done to foster good  public\r\n\r\nrelations between residents and officials  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters to the press are promptly answered.\r\n\r\nThese are mostly in defence of the inadequacies of\r\n\r\nthe service provided by the Housing Board. Tenants\r\n\r\nand  hawkers,  particularly those from  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group, are constantly harassed or  treated\r\n\r\nwith  indifference by hawker inspectors and  other\r\n\r\nofficials. Problems and complaints brought  up  by\r\n\r\nthem are not properly attended to. Very often they\r\n\r\nare  told to refer their problems to the  MPs,  if\r\n\r\nthey are not satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit that the Estate Officers in charge\r\n\r\nof  an  Area  Office  have an unenviable  task  to\r\n\r\nperform.  In most cases, they handle the  problems\r\n\r\npretty well. But those officers below them do  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  understand the problems of  residents,\r\n\r\nshop-keepers  and hawkers. It is  recognised  that\r\n\r\nthe  Estate Officer cannot handle all the problems\r\n\r\nhimself,  but then the officers serving under  him\r\n\r\nshould   be   properly  trained,   especially   in\r\n\r\nmaintaining   good  public  relations   with   the\r\n\r\nresidents in the various housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on some of these\r\n\r\ncomplaints  and inadequacies, in the balloting  of\r\n\r\nflats  we  often  notice prospective  flat  owners\r\n\r\njumping  up  with joy or rubbing their hands  with\r\n\r\nglee  the  moment it was announced that they  have\r\n\r\ngot their ideal flats, that is, on the lower floor\r\n\r\nor  facing  the  desired direction.  This  gleeful\r\n\r\nexpression  is short-lived, and it soon  turns  to\r\n\r\ngloom  when  they receive the keys  to  the  flat,\r\n\r\nbecause on inspection of the flats they will  find\r\n\r\nso  many defects which Members of this House  have\r\n\r\nbeen  complaining about. The most  common  defects\r\n\r\nare uneven floors, paint- or tar-soiled floors. My\r\n\r\nparty  office, for instance, I had to saw off  the\r\n\r\nbottom of three doors in order to accommodate  the\r\n\r\nunevenness of the floors. For those who can afford\r\n\r\nto  relay the floors with mosaic, etc., it is  all\r\n\r\nright.  But  what about those who  cannot  afford,\r\n\r\nespecially the people resettled from other  areas?\r\n\r\nI would suggest that the Housing Board contractors\r\n\r\nshould be asked to place as a deposit a prescribed\r\n\r\nsum of money or a bank guarantee with the Board on\r\n\r\nthe  understanding that if defects are found  such\r\n\r\ndeposit  would  be confiscated and the  contractor\r\n\r\nbarred  from  Housing Board projects for  a  given\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Housing Board has\r\n\r\ndone  nothing to rectify the defects found in  the\r\n\r\nflats.  It  is  the time taken and  the  haphazard\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which the contractors  put  right  the\r\n\r\ndefects.  One  solution would  be  to  allow  flat\r\n\r\nowners  to  rectify  the  defects  themselves  and\r\n\r\ncharge the cost to the Housing Board who will,  in\r\n\r\nturn,  recover  this  cost  from  the  contractors\r\n\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, shopkeepers and hawkers are always at the receiving end of the stick. When they want to rectify any of the defects mentioned earlier, they are asked to pay a reinstatement deposit amounting to hundreds of dollars. It is a common practice for shopkeepers to display their wares or advertise their services in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromote sales. Officials of the Housing Board are\r\n\r\nunduly strict in the application of regulations\r\n\r\ngoverning obstruction in common passage-ways. In\r\n\r\none instance, shopkeepers in my constituency had\r\n\r\ntheir goods confiscated for allegedly causing\r\n\r\nobstruction. When I took this matter up with the\r\n\r\nArea Office, I was asked to refer it to the head\r\n\r\noffice. The official in the head office told me\r\n\r\nthat the problem could be easily settled if I were\r\n\r\nto ask the shopkeepers concerned to see him. When\r\n\r\nthe shopkeepers called at his office, they were\r\n\r\npolitely told that the goods had already been\r\n\r\ndisposed of. All this happened in one day. Surely\r\n\r\nthe HDB is not that efficient! When it comes to\r\n\r\nexercising their right, Housing Board officials\r\n\r\nare unusually quick on the draw. But when\r\n\r\ncomplaints are lodged, it takes a long time for\r\n\r\nthem to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present system of rentals\r\n\r\nfor  eating  houses and hawker stalls  in  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  estates  could lead to  many  problems  and\r\n\r\nabuses.  The  usual minimum rental  for  a  eating\r\n\r\nhouse is around $700, but it is often tendered for\r\n\r\nas  high  as  $3,000. To recover this amount,  the\r\n\r\nshophouse  tenant  sublets  as  many  cooked  food\r\n\r\nstalls  as  the  shop-house  can  accommodate   at\r\n\r\nrentals between $100 and $600 each a month.  In  a\r\n\r\ncoffee  shop premises as much as 50% of the  floor\r\n\r\nspace  is rented out to these cooked food  stalls.\r\n\r\nThe  result is that patrons have to eat  on  five-foot  ways and in adjacent empty spaces. Then here\r\n\r\ncomes  along  a  Housing Board  official  to  take\r\n\r\naction  against the offending coffee shop  tenant.\r\n\r\nThis goes on all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentals for cooked food stalls arc the same,\r\n\r\nirrespective of the type of food sold  in  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  hawker centres. For instance, an  ice-water\r\n\r\nseller is charged the same rental as one who  runs\r\n\r\na  restaurant type of business. The daily turnover\r\n\r\nof  these  two types' of business is poles  apart.\r\n\r\nSuch   a   situation  gives  rise  to  abuse   and\r\n\r\nmalpractice.   It   encourages   stallholders   to\r\n\r\nillegally sublet or assign their stalls to  others\r\n\r\nfor a profit. For example, if a person pays\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$500  to $600 for a stall in a coffee shop to sell\r\n\r\nHokkien  mee,  a stallholder in the hawker  centre\r\n\r\nnear  to the coffee shop can demand a similar rate\r\n\r\nfor  subletting or illegal assigning of his stall.\r\n\r\nIn Hokkien, this term is known as pak hor Ian, or,\r\n\r\nin  English  it  is  known as  Ali  Baba  type  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister would probably ask me why I\r\n\r\ndid  not report this state of affairs. The  reason\r\n\r\nis  that it is very difficult to prove such wrong-doing  as  there  is some collusion  somewhere.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that offenders should be charged for\r\n\r\ncorruption  if  they illegally  sublet  or  assign\r\n\r\ntheir  shophouse for a profit. Anyone  who  enters\r\n\r\ninto such an arrangement makes exorbitant profits,\r\n\r\nall tax-free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest the following proposals.\r\n\r\nThe  Housing Board should restrict the  number  of\r\n\r\ncooked  food  stalls  allowed  for  subletting  in\r\n\r\ncoffee shops. It should be based on the proportion\r\n\r\nof the floor space available. In other words, if a\r\n\r\ncoffee  shop premises has a floor space  of  3,000\r\n\r\nsq, ft, so  many square feet of  space  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed for cooked food stalls and so many  square\r\n\r\nfeet  for  patrons. A ceiling should he placed  on\r\n\r\nrentals  for  subletting, just  like  the  maximum\r\n\r\nrental  charged by flat owners who wish to  sublet\r\n\r\ntheir  flats.  Rentals for cooked food  stalls  in\r\n\r\nhawker centres should he based on the type of food\r\n\r\nsold.  In this way, we can minimise all the abuses\r\n\r\nand malpractices mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the hawker centres in Housing Board\r\n\r\nestates  are badly planned. Two hawker centres  in\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh have been reconstructed costing several\r\n\r\nhundred thousand dollars. Another one is earmarked\r\n\r\nfor reconstruction. In some of these centres there\r\n\r\nis  an  excess of stalls in a certain trade and  a\r\n\r\nshortage  in  others. There are either  inadequate\r\n\r\nfacilities  or no access for hawkers  to  transfer\r\n\r\ntheir  goods into the market. As a result passage-ways and footpaths are clogged with goods carriers\r\n\r\nleft  there  by  the hawkers. Some of  the  access\r\n\r\nfacilities  lead  only half way into  the  market.\r\n\r\nHawkers are compelled to make use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  paved  areas around the market, thus  causing\r\n\r\nmore  obstruction and littering. To overcome  this\r\n\r\nproblem and shortcoming, I would suggest that  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board consult the MP in the  area  before\r\n\r\nconstructing any hawker centre or market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Cheong, your ten minutes are up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if everything that the hon. Member has said\r\n\r\nis   true,   then   he  had  better   change   his\r\n\r\nconstituency.  He  won  the  last  election  quite\r\n\r\neasily, which means the people in his constituency\r\n\r\nare happy and, I repeat, if everything he says  is\r\n\r\ntrue and the people there are so unhappy, then  he\r\n\r\nhad better watch out in the next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be fair to the Housing Board, and I have\r\n\r\nnot  heard one good word about the Board  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  it  is  doing a good job.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nhouses that it has built or is building under  its\r\n\r\nprogramme  over the last five years has  increased\r\n\r\nfour-fold. Today it is building about 25,000 units\r\n\r\nper  year  and the target is 30,000 in a  year  or\r\n\r\ntwo. But the actual volume of construction work is\r\n\r\nmore  than four times as the average sizes of  the\r\n\r\nflats are more than twice those built earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shortage of skilled construction\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  Republic.  The  workmanship  has\r\n\r\nsuffered  somewhat not only because of the  larger\r\n\r\nproportion  of unskilled and semi-skilled  workers\r\n\r\nbut  because  of  the increase in the  numbers  of\r\n\r\nbuildings   or  building  units  that  are   being\r\n\r\nconstructed  every year. However,  the  structural\r\n\r\nsoundness  of the buildings is in no way affected.\r\n\r\nThere  is no short cut to training a large  number\r\n\r\nof  skilled workers. It requires several years  of\r\n\r\napprenticeship at the construction site. The Board\r\n\r\nhas,  in  conjunction with the Industrial Training\r\n\r\nBoard, sponsored a scheme to train more workers at\r\n\r\nconstruction sites. The response has not been very\r\n\r\nencouraging.   The   majority   of   our   workers\r\n\r\napparently prefer jobs in offices or hotels  where\r\n\r\nthey work in air-conditioned comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked for the retention of a\r\n\r\ndeposit. The answer is that the Board has a system\r\n\r\nwhereby it retains 5% of the contract price over a\r\n\r\nperiod of six months, in case there are defects to\r\n\r\nthe buildings which have to be put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member complained about the Board's\r\n\r\nofficers.  I  understand that the  Board's  Estate\r\n\r\nOfficers  and  Assistant Estate Officers  actively\r\n\r\nparticipate   in  Meet-the-People  sessions   with\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament in all the  constituencies\r\n\r\nwhere there are HDB estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Such\r\n\r\nparticipation  by  the  Board's  Estate   Officers\r\n\r\nshould promote goodwill between flat dwellers  and\r\n\r\nthe Board.

But maybe there are one  or\r\n\r\ntwo   matters,  relating  in  particular  to   the\r\n\r\nclearance  activity being undertaken  in  the  new\r\n\r\ntown, Ang Mo Kio, in my constituency, that need to\r\n\r\nbe  aired.  The Minister has told the  House  that\r\n\r\nphysical  clearance of families who have  received\r\n\r\nclearance notices actually takes place some months\r\n\r\nafter  notice of clearance and notice to quit  are\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the families. This is quite true,  Sir.\r\n\r\nBut complaints have reached me from families being\r\n\r\nresettled  in my constituency that while  this  is\r\n\r\nso,  officials  from  the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  urge families having  received  such\r\n\r\nclearance  notice  to  move  out  as  quickly   as\r\n\r\npossible. And all the time that this is being done\r\n\r\nthe  question of compensation entitlement  of  the\r\n\r\nfamilies and the computation thereof have not been\r\n\r\ncompleted in the cases that have been referred  to\r\n\r\nme.   I  would  have  thought  that  having  given\r\n\r\nclearance  notice to the families, the next  thing\r\n\r\nthat should be done by the Resettlement Department\r\n\r\nis to hastily decide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  question of compensation entitlement and then\r\n\r\n`worry  about computing the amount of compensation\r\n\r\nto  be  given before urging the families  to  move\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter relates also to resettlement in\r\n\r\nthe  sense that the Resettlement Officers go round\r\n\r\nto  approve  closure of ponds which  are  a  basic\r\n\r\nfactor  in  the  livelihood of the  farmers,  even\r\n\r\nbefore   computation  of  compensation  or   their\r\n\r\nentitlement  is decided. This causes  hardship  to\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  in the area. Ponds,  on  which  they\r\n\r\ndepend  to feed their pigs and sometimes vegetable\r\n\r\nfarms, need to be levelled off or covered over  by\r\n\r\nthe  earth in the levelling process, and this also\r\n\r\ncauses   hardship   to   many   families   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to bring notice of this development to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister because it appears to me and to  the\r\n\r\nfamilies in my constituency who are affected  that\r\n\r\nthe  officers from the Resettlement Department may\r\n\r\nbe  over-enthused in their work. I am particularly\r\n\r\nworried  when  I  read, for example,  the  1973-74\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board Annual Report, under\r\n\r\nResettlement,  page  4,  where  the   Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment  talks  about  achieving  an   all-time\r\n\r\nrecord  of resettling 12,067 cases in the 15-month\r\n\r\nperiod under review, and so on. This gives me  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that the Department may  be  regarding\r\n\r\nsuch  families  as near cases to be resolved.  But\r\n\r\nthese are families whose lives are being disrupted\r\n\r\nand  who  have  to  change  to  a  new  means   of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  I  hope  the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\nwill be prepared to extend human consideration  to\r\n\r\nsuch  cases and not treat them just as cases  with\r\n\r\nan   enthusiasm  to  outdo  previous  records   in\r\n\r\nresettling  families. I am sure the Minister  will\r\n\r\nbe able to undertake some action here to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe worries of the families in my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, a notice to quit is served on all\r\n\r\nresettlement  cases. This is a legal formality  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Department to  obtain  a  warrant  of\r\n\r\ndispossession from the Magistrates'  Courts  where\r\n\r\nthose concerned do not move. With this warrant the\r\n\r\nDepartment can ensure that resettlement  cases  do\r\n\r\nnot resist clearance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  actual physical clearance is initiated.  But\r\n\r\nthe  warrant  is  only used as a last  resort  and\r\n\r\nactual  physical clearance is not initiated  until\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation has been  provided  and\r\n\r\ncomputation  of  compensation to  the  prospective\r\n\r\nresettler has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Serangoon Gardens\r\n\r\nthat the Resettlement Department is not interested\r\n\r\nin  breaking any records. The Department is  under\r\n\r\nconsiderable pressure from various Ministries, not\r\n\r\nonly from the Ministry of National Development  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  sites for housing are concerned but  they\r\n\r\nhave also the unpleasant task of resettling people\r\n\r\nin  most parts of Singapore for practically  every\r\n\r\ndepartment.  When tile Ministry of  Defence  wants\r\n\r\nlarge  areas in Singapore for the requirements  of\r\n\r\nthe  military,  it is the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\nthat  has  to  do the dirty work. So it  is  under\r\n\r\nconsiderable pressure from the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\nto do its resettling as soon as it is possible. If\r\n\r\nwe  are to provide cheap housing accommodation for\r\n\r\npeople  as  in Ang Mo Kio, then they  have  to  be\r\n\r\nresettled.   But   the   Resettlement   Department\r\n\r\nofficers are not over-enthused with their work. As\r\n\r\nfar  as it is possible they are humane. As I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday, resettlement is an unpleasant  business\r\n\r\nhut  it  has  to  be done if Singapore  is  to  be\r\n\r\nredeveloped.   People   sometimes    get    bitter\r\n\r\nespecially  when they have to be resettled  twice.\r\n\r\nBut this is happening in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I accept the explanation given by the\r\n\r\nMinister,   and  I  beg  leave  to   withdraw   my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nL.

But, sad to say, the bottleneck there has\r\n\r\nbecome more acute and traffic jams are more common\r\n\r\nnow  than ever before. Last year only S 10,000 was\r\n\r\nutilised, unfortunately. With the new Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  flats coming up there, the  expansion\r\n\r\nof  the  shipyard  and  the industrial  estate  in\r\n\r\nSembawang, it is even more essential now to  widen\r\n\r\nthat  road.  I hope this year at least the  amount\r\n\r\nappropriated   will   be   utilised    and    some\r\n\r\nimprovements   made   to  this   important   road,\r\n\r\nespecially with the industrial estate being  built\r\n\r\nin Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah for moving this amendment.

My answer will put the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment in a better light. They asked what have\r\n\r\nwe  done  about this road since we had money  last\r\n\r\nyear  but  nothing was done. The answer is,  there\r\n\r\nare  problems in connection with resettlement  and\r\n\r\nland  acquisition.  There  are  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nresettlement cases, and at least 450 shops  to  be\r\n\r\nresettled. Hence the delay. In order to  speed  up\r\n\r\nconstruction,  the  road has  been  realigned,  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the  Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard,  to minimise the number of cases that  need\r\n\r\nto  be  resettled.

Work\r\n\r\non  Stage II from Sembawang Hill Circus to  Mandai\r\n\r\nRoad  will  begin  in the first quarter  of  1976,\r\n\r\nwhilst  Stage III from Jalan Sembawang  Kechil  to\r\n\r\nAdmiralty Gate will start in the first quarter  of\r\n\r\n1978. When fully completed by the end of 1978, the\r\n\r\nroad  will be a dual carriageway with two  traffic\r\n\r\nlanes  in  each direction.

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Dr. Tan Eng Liang and Mr Ho Kah Leong).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a hint that medical charges may\r\n\r\nbe  further  increased. This is  not  the  first\r\n\r\ntime  that the charges have been increased ;  in\r\n\r\nfact  the  medical charges have  been  increased\r\n\r\ntoo  often.  There  is no  doubt  that  cost  in\r\n\r\nhospitals, clinics, etc., have gone up.  But  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular matter, we have to  think  very\r\n\r\ncarefully  before we increase  the  charges.  If\r\n\r\nthe  increases  are too great,  it  will  affect\r\n\r\nthose  in  the lower income group very badly.  A\r\n\r\nperson  suffering from a cold  or  some  disease\r\n\r\nmay have to visit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Outpatients Department two or three times. The\r\n\r\nlower  income  group will suffer a great  deal  if\r\n\r\nthey  have to go to private clinics for treatment.\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid that tile people in this  particular\r\n\r\ngroup  have a tendency to go to tile quacks or  to\r\n\r\nthose Who call themselves doctors though they  are\r\n\r\nnot medically qualified in any way. The net result\r\n\r\nis that we may have people deformed or worse after\r\n\r\nthe   treatment   received  from   these   quacks.\r\n\r\nTherefore, these people have no choice but  to  go\r\n\r\nto  Government clinics or hospitals for treatment,\r\n\r\ncausing greater headaches to the doctors and staff\r\n\r\nin  the hospitals.

This subject may be very stale,  but  in\r\n\r\nfact, it is repeated so often that no wonder there\r\n\r\nis  an  exodus  of medical personnel to  countries\r\n\r\nlike Canada and Australia. We must try our best to\r\n\r\nretain these people as we need them so badly here.\r\n\r\nWe  should not close an eye to their problems  for\r\n\r\nit  will  result in dissatisfaction and emigration\r\n\r\nto  other countries by our doctors and nurses whom\r\n\r\nwe  need  so  badly in our own country.  Something\r\n\r\nmust  definitely be done for them.  Otherwise,  if\r\n\r\nnothing is done we will have this problem year  in\r\n\r\nand  year  out.  The  result  will  be  a  chronic\r\n\r\ncongestion  in  the hospitals, overworked  doctors\r\n\r\nand dissatisfied medical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though a certain amount of publicity has\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to  the zoning of  hospitals,  it  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient.  My  contention  is   that   greater\r\n\r\npublicity should be given to this matter  so  that\r\n\r\nit  will  ease the confusion in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the new General Hospital that is being\r\n\r\nbuilt  in the grounds of the Out-ram Road  General\r\n\r\nHospital would he built in such a way that it will\r\n\r\nnot in-  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvenience the sick, the aged and the  disabled.\r\n\r\nIn  the present layout, patients have to walk long\r\n\r\ndistances   from  one  section  to   another   for\r\n\r\ntreatment.

Then the  doctor\r\n\r\nhad  to be awakened to attend to the patient. This\r\n\r\nmight  have taken as much as half an hour. Surely,\r\n\r\nin the Emergency Unit, half an hour is a very very\r\n\r\nlong  time in which to save a person's life  which\r\n\r\nsometimes  can be decided in a matter of  minutes.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  in  the  same  hospital  as  far  as\r\n\r\nmedicine  is concerned, the patient was not  given\r\n\r\nany  medicine. He had to go back the next  morning\r\n\r\nfor   his  medicine  because  the  dispensary  was\r\n\r\nclosed.   This   caused   further   inconvenience.\r\n\r\nSomething   should  be  done  to   alleviate   the\r\n\r\nsuffering  of the sick. They should not be  forced\r\n\r\nto go back to the hospital again and again just to\r\n\r\ntake a bottle of medicine or some pills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there have been cases in some hospitals\r\n\r\nwhere  wrong medicine had been given. As a result,\r\n\r\nI know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nof  a patient who has developed an allergy even to\r\n\r\npanadol. Such mistakes would not have occurred  if\r\n\r\nthe doctors had not been overworked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a case of a person who was warded\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore General Hospital.  A  few  days\r\n\r\nlater  he was transferred to another ward. On  the\r\n\r\nday  he  was transferred, his wife went  to  visit\r\n\r\nhim.  At  the ward she was told that he  had  been\r\n\r\ndischarged and had gone home. This lady was  happy\r\n\r\nthat  her husband had been discharged and went  on\r\n\r\nher  way home. At the bus stop she met her mother-in-law  who  was also on her way to see  him.  She\r\n\r\ntold  her  mother-in-law  that  her  husband   had\r\n\r\nalready  been  discharged. But  her  mother-in-law\r\n\r\nsaid that she came from home and had not seen him.\r\n\r\nSo they decided to go home. When they reached home\r\n\r\nhe  was  not to be found. Subsequently, they  were\r\n\r\nworried  and telephoned the hospital. The hospital\r\n\r\nstaff failed to assist them and requested them  to\r\n\r\ngo  to the hospital. Later, at the hospital,  they\r\n\r\nfinally   learnt   that  the  patient   had   been\r\n\r\ntransferred to another ward. Sir, I want  to  know\r\n\r\nwhy  these  two women had to be inconvenienced.  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   hospital  staff  could  give   proper\r\n\r\ninformation and not cause people to panic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that patients in third class\r\n\r\nwards  of Kandang Kerbau Hospital are not  treated\r\n\r\nproperly. I have received complaints that they are\r\n\r\ntreated very badly by some of the staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, may I answer the Member for Anson point by\r\n\r\npoint?  Firstly,  with regard to  the  raising  of\r\n\r\nmedical charges. As stated in the Addendum to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address, increases in medical charges\r\n\r\nhave  become  necessary because of the  escalating\r\n\r\ncosts. Costs have increased from 5% in 1952 to 25%\r\n\r\nin  1974. This will continue to escalate as prices\r\n\r\nof medicine, equipment, staff, follow inflationary\r\n\r\ntrends.  However,  the increase  in  charges  will\r\n\r\nremain nominal. For example, C class patients  are\r\n\r\nnow  charged $3 a day for food, medical  care  and\r\n\r\nstay  in hospital. But the actual cost per day  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining a patient is more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  $40.  Therefore, even  if  the  charges  are\r\n\r\nincreased  to  $4  or  $5 per  day,  it  is  still\r\n\r\nnominal.  Increases in cost must be by  taxpayers.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair, therefore, that those who use the\r\n\r\nservices should bear part of the cost in the  form\r\n\r\nnominal  fees.  This  is consistent  oft  repeated\r\n\r\npolicy that in Singapore is for free. This prevent\r\n\r\nwastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.30 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of patients resorting may I say\r\n\r\nthis.  In  considering  any  increase  fees,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is concerned as the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nits  effects  on the lower in-up. In  fact,  if  a\r\n\r\npatient  cannot pay even the nominal fee there  on\r\n\r\nfor  the fee to be waived, as been done all along.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is no reason for any  person  to\r\n\r\nquacks  because  of the increase medical  charges.\r\n\r\nAttendance has, in fact, continued to increase  at\r\n\r\nall our institutions and outpatient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the question of loss of medical\r\n\r\nstaff,  the  Member for Anson said it  as  due  to\r\n\r\nstaff  being overworked, and so on. He  also  said\r\n\r\nthat it is a stale subject as it is often repeated\r\n\r\nfrom  year to year. I agree with him that it is  a\r\n\r\ntale subject. To me it sounds like playing an  old\r\n\r\ngramophone  record  again. I  have  answered  this\r\n\r\nquestion in my reply to the Member for Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nlast  week . I stated quite clearly that  positive\r\n\r\nSteps  have  been taken to attract as  well  s  to\r\n\r\nretain more doctors in the service. May I say that\r\n\r\nthere has been no exodus of doctors, as stated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson and predicted by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kim  Seng  last year. As far  as  nurses  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  they  too  have  benefited  from   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the National  Wages  Council's\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  Their  working  conditions  have\r\n\r\nalso improved by shorter night duties. They now do\r\n\r\nthree  night shifts at a stretch instead of  seven\r\n\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the zoning of hospitals which has been\r\n\r\nintroduced  recently, the Member complained  about\r\n\r\nlack of publicity.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublicity  was  given   prior   to   the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of  the  zoning   of   hospitals.\r\n\r\nInformation  for the public was given through  the\r\n\r\nradio,   television,  press  releases  and   press\r\n\r\nconferences.  General  practitioners   were   also\r\n\r\ninformed  separately  by  circulars  and  hospital\r\n\r\nstaff were briefed. But, of course, whenever a new\r\n\r\nsystem is introduced there is bound to be teething\r\n\r\nproblems.  It  is too early to say how  successful\r\n\r\nthis  zoning  will  be. But it is  important  that\r\n\r\nzoning is implemented, otherwise the position will\r\n\r\narise  where  certain hospitals are  over-utilised\r\n\r\nand others under-utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the complaint of the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nabout patients having to walk long distances, thus\r\n\r\ncausing  inconvenience, and also matters  relating\r\n\r\nto  the running of the hospital, I agree with  him\r\n\r\nthat the present layout of the Outram Road General\r\n\r\nHospital  leaves much to be desired.  Members  may\r\n\r\nknow that this Hospital was built more than half a\r\n\r\ncentury  ago  and  over the years other  buildings\r\n\r\nwere  added  on  without any systematic  planning.\r\n\r\nThis  is one of the reasons for the building of  a\r\n\r\nnew   Singapore   General  Hospital   which   will\r\n\r\neventually replace the present Outram Road General\r\n\r\nHospital.  The  Member for Anson is  also  worried\r\n\r\nabout  the  designing  of the  proposed  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital. I can assure him that this  new\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  is very carefully  planned  for\r\n\r\nmaximum  efficiency as well as for the convenience\r\n\r\nof  patients and those who work in it. We have had\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the expertise  of  international\r\n\r\nconsultants   as   well  as  experienced   medical\r\n\r\nadministrators and Heads of Unit in  the  planning\r\n\r\nand designing of this Hospital. We have a Hospital\r\n\r\nPlanning Committee working on it, and I personally\r\n\r\nchair  a  steering  committee which  oversees  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of this new Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a complaint about\r\n\r\nsomeone who had a dislocation and in attending the\r\n\r\nEmergency Unit of the General Hospital he  had  to\r\n\r\nwalk all the way to the Orthopaedic Unit for an X-ray. I do not think this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis true because the Emergency Unit itself has an X-ray  machine, and therefore there is no  necessity\r\n\r\nfor  an X-ray to be taken in the Orthopaedic Unit.\r\n\r\nAn  X-ray can be taken and is being taken  hi  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Unit itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to charges for school children who\r\n\r\nattend outpatient dispensaries, the answer is that\r\n\r\nschool children who attend outpatient clinics  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to pay a nominal charge of 50 cents  per\r\n\r\nattendance.  However,  school  children  who   are\r\n\r\nreferred to the Institute of Health for subsequent\r\n\r\nfollow-up examination arising out of screening  in\r\n\r\nschools do not have to pay any charges. That is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the allegation of staff found asleep\r\n\r\non   duty  at  the  Emergency  Unit  of  Alexandra\r\n\r\nHospital  and  had  to be awakened  to  attend  to\r\n\r\ncases,  I say that this is a very serious  matter.\r\n\r\nAny  staff  in the Emergency Unit found asleep  on\r\n\r\nduty  will have to face disciplinary action. I  am\r\n\r\nalso surprised that the Member has not thought  it\r\n\r\nfit  to write a complaint to me so that the matter\r\n\r\ncan  be investigated and action taken if there  is\r\n\r\nnegligence of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint is about patients who after\r\n\r\ntreatment in the Emergency Unit had to go back the\r\n\r\nnext  day  to  get the medicine. Let me  tell  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that after any treatment given at\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency  Unit,  the patient  will  get  the\r\n\r\nmedicine straightaway because medicine is  stocked\r\n\r\nin the Emergency Unit itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation of wrong medicine\r\n\r\nbeing  given to the patient, and allergy developed\r\n\r\nas  a  result,  I say again that this  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  allegation. May I invite  the  Member  to\r\n\r\ngive  me  the particulars of the case so  that  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation can be carried out and action  taken\r\n\r\nagainst the particular staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the complaint about a husband having\r\n\r\nbeen  warded in one hospital and later transferred\r\n\r\nto another hospital and the wife on a visit to the\r\n\r\nhusband  was told that he had been discharged  and\r\n\r\nhad gone home. On the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  back  she met her mother-in-law who  was  not\r\n\r\naware  of the patient's discharge and transfer  to\r\n\r\nanother hospital. First of all I do not know about\r\n\r\nthe case. If details were given to me I would have\r\n\r\ninvestigated  the case: to find  out  who  was  at\r\n\r\nfault. There may be many explanations as to how it\r\n\r\nall  happened. Usually before a transfer is  made,\r\n\r\nthe   next-of-kin  will  be  informed.   In   this\r\n\r\nparticular case I do not know whose name was given\r\n\r\nwhen the patient was admitted, the mother-in-law's\r\n\r\nname  or the wife's name. So if it was the mother-in-law's  name, then the mother-in-law would  have\r\n\r\nbeen informed and she would have known about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

When the wife could  not  find  her\r\n\r\nhusband,  she asked the staff. The hospital  staff\r\n\r\ntold  her that he was already discharged.  On  the\r\n\r\nway  back home she met her mother-in-law  who  was\r\n\r\nalso going to see her son. She told her mother-in-law that he was already discharged and, therefore,\r\n\r\nboth  went home. However, when they went home they\r\n\r\nwere   surprised  that  he  was  not  there.  They\r\n\r\ntherefore  telephoned the hospital, but the  staff\r\n\r\ntold  them  that  they  had  to  go  back  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital.  Later they found out that he  had  been\r\n\r\ntransferred to another ward. The question  is  why\r\n\r\ncause  such inconvenience to people? The  hospital\r\n\r\nmust have a record of the transfer of patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, if the particulars are given to me, I shall\r\n\r\nget  the  other version. Usually before  transfers\r\n\r\nare  made,  the next-of-kin would be  informed.  A\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  a  patient cannot  be  made  without\r\n\r\ninforming  the next-of-kin. Of course, it  depends\r\n\r\non  whose name was given on admission as the next-of-kin.  Unless the next-of-kin's name  is  given,\r\n\r\nthe hospital would not be in a position to inform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to records, there are records kept of\r\n\r\ntransfers.

If anyone is found  guilty\r\n\r\nof  negligence of official duty, then disciplinary\r\n\r\naction will be taken against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to tile matter about bad treatment\r\n\r\nof  third  class  patients in the  Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital,  I  think  a general allegation  is  not\r\n\r\nhelpful.  If  there  are  particular  cases  where\r\n\r\nnurses  are  rude  or patients are  neglected,  if\r\n\r\ndetails  are given then they will be investigated.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  any  complaint,  not  necessarily  from\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament only but also from  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public,  is  seriously  looked  into  and\r\n\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Quite often, patients for whom appointments\r\n\r\nare  made to see the specialist are kept for hours\r\n\r\nat a time through no fault of the specialist. This\r\n\r\nis  the result of poor coordination between  those\r\n\r\nwho  do  tile  paper work and  those  who  do  the\r\n\r\npractical work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was a case where a patient whose\r\n\r\nappointment  was at 9.45 am, was kept waiting  for\r\n\r\nmore than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  hours  before he could see the specialist  in\r\n\r\nthe Orthopaedic Unit. This\r\n\r\nis  simply because tile specialist had either gone\r\n\r\nout  to  conduct certain lectures or had to attend\r\n\r\nto some other business. The patient, together with\r\n\r\nmany others, had to wait for two whole hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only those who made the appointment could\r\n\r\nforesee   the   doctor's  timetable,   then   this\r\n\r\nunnecessary waiting could have been avoided. Those\r\n\r\npatients could have spent the two hours usefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors at the OPD are overworked. They\r\n\r\nsometimes  have  to  attend  to  as  many  as  100\r\n\r\npatients  per  day so much so that they  sometimes\r\n\r\nprescribe the wrong medicine. The doctors are  not\r\n\r\nto  be  blamed. They can only work  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nlevel  with  efficiency. Beyond  that,  efficiency\r\n\r\ndrops. One cannot he at his peak of efficiency  at\r\n\r\nall  times, especially when a doctor has to  treat\r\n\r\nmore than 100 patients per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly something could be done to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  work  of the doctors at tile OPDs, they  are\r\n\r\nhuman  too. They too require a certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nrest. They can work with optimum efficiency for  a\r\n\r\ncertain period. Furthermore, if these doctors  are\r\n\r\noverworked,   we   are   just   encouraging   more\r\n\r\nresignations.  In certain outpatient  clinics  the\r\n\r\nstaff is so inadequate that the amahs are asked to\r\n\r\ncarry  out some of the minor duties of the nurses,\r\n\r\nlike  taking  temperature. Surely an amah  is  not\r\n\r\nqualified in any way to attend to a patient.  Such\r\n\r\nthings  would  not  occur if there  is  sufficient\r\n\r\nstaff in the outpatient clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these clinics the doctors may he\r\n\r\noverworked  to  such an extent  that  they  become\r\n\r\ncareless. There was the case of a girl who went to\r\n\r\nthe  OPD for treatment. Although she was suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  severe  pain  she was told  that  there  was\r\n\r\nnothing wrong with her and was told to go back  to\r\n\r\nwork.  At  the  office  tile  head  of  department\r\n\r\nnoticed  her condition and wrote a note and  asked\r\n\r\nher to go to the OPD once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  the  OPD  the  doctor just gave  her  a  day's\r\n\r\nmedical  leave. It was 3.00 p.m, then but she  was\r\n\r\ntold to go off. The girl had no choice but to  see\r\n\r\na  private doctor who examined her thoroughly  and\r\n\r\nhe  finally managed to cure her. This carelessness\r\n\r\nwould not have occurred if doctors at the OPD  are\r\n\r\nnot overworked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some doctors at the OPD just give a quick\r\n\r\nexamination  of the patients and ask them  to  buy\r\n\r\nPanadol.  If  a patient is charged a fee  for  the\r\n\r\ntreatment, proper medicine must be given to  them.\r\n\r\nIf the treatment is not effective, they have to go\r\n\r\nto  a  private doctor. In this way, they will have\r\n\r\nto  spend  more money. Can the Minister look  into\r\n\r\nthe matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I take the first\r\n\r\npoint about the appointment system. With regard to\r\n\r\nappointments,  both the doctor and patient  should\r\n\r\nkeep  to their time of appointment. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nin practice, there have been a number of instances\r\n\r\nwhere  the  times allotted could not  be  strictly\r\n\r\nadhered  to.  This  is because consultations  with\r\n\r\nsome  patients may take a longer time than  usual.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also  instances where because  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of emergency cases which the doctors  have\r\n\r\nto  attend to, it is not possible for them to keep\r\n\r\ntheir   appointments  at  the   scheduled   times.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  studies  are  now  being  made   to\r\n\r\ncomputerise  and  to  assign  more  staff  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  outpatient  clinics in  order  to  reduce\r\n\r\ninconvenience of waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's allegation that\r\n\r\ndoctors  at outpatient dispensaries are overtaxed,\r\n\r\nmay I say that the average number of patients seen\r\n\r\nby  a  doctor  at  the  outpatient  dispensary  is\r\n\r\nbetween  80  and 100 a day. This average  has  not\r\n\r\nchanged  over  the  years.  It  is  accepted  that\r\n\r\nattention to individual patients could be improved\r\n\r\nif  the  doctor had fewer patients  to  see.  Each\r\n\r\ndoctor  has his own duty and will be well occupied\r\n\r\nin his own way, since he is a professional man who\r\n\r\nlooks after the patient in his own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present workload of 80 to 100 patients a day\r\n\r\ncannot be said to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunreasonable. Of course, there are occasions when,\r\n\r\nas  in  outbreaks  of  flu, epidemics,  etc.,  the\r\n\r\nworkload   of   the  doctors  at  the   outpatient\r\n\r\ndispensaries can be considered to be  very  heavy,\r\n\r\nas expected. But in normal times it cannot be said\r\n\r\nthat their workload is heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation that amahs have been\r\n\r\nasked  to  do simple nursing duties, this  is  not\r\n\r\npermitted at all. This is yet another instance  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Member  has not submitted  a  specific\r\n\r\ncomplaint so that an investigation could be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that proper medicine is prescribed at\r\n\r\nthe outpatient dispensaries.\r\n\r\nThe  Member has quoted the case of a girl who  had\r\n\r\nto  go to a private practitioner because she could\r\n\r\nnot  get a medical certificate or treatment in the\r\n\r\noutpatient  dispensary. Again it  is  only  proper\r\n\r\nthat the details of this matter should be given to\r\n\r\nme.  But  may  Is  say  this in  general?  Medical\r\n\r\ncertificates a the not issued on demand but on the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  the  patients.  If  there   is   no\r\n\r\njustification in giving medical leave,  a  medical\r\n\r\ncertificate will not be issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister in reply\r\n\r\nsaid that tile doctors are not over worked. May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that times taken to determine how long  it\r\n\r\ntake a doctor to see a patient. From these we  can\r\n\r\ncalculate   and   tell  whether  the   doctor   is\r\n\r\noverworked or not. A doctor usually takes only two\r\n\r\nor three minute to examine a patient. As a result,\r\n\r\nthe patients are not properly examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether a doctor can s\r\n\r\n80 or 100 patients a day is, in fact, professional\r\n\r\nmatter. Of course, common sense tells us that  not\r\n\r\nevery case is same. Some cases take a longer  time\r\n\r\nwhile others do not. On the average a professional\r\n\r\ndoctor has been able attend 80 to 100 cases a day,\r\n\r\nand the average has been maintained for number  of\r\n\r\nyears. If a case can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiagnosed  within a short time, I do not  think  a\r\n\r\nlonger examination would reveal anything more than\r\n\r\nwhat  was  already done in the shorter  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.  The professional doctors tell me that their\r\n\r\nworkload  is reasonable; and that is that,  unless\r\n\r\nthe  Member can give examples to show in what  way\r\n\r\nthe workload is too heavy for the doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not very satisfied with the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply.   I  suggested  that  times  be  taken   to\r\n\r\ndetermine how many patients a doctor can see in  a\r\n\r\nday.  By  taking these times we can calculate  the\r\n\r\naverage number of patients a doctor can see  in  a\r\n\r\nday   so   that  the  patient  can  be  thoroughly\r\n\r\nexamined.
