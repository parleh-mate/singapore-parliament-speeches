They are: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Elling North Primary School \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Kallang Primary School \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Cantonment Primary School \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Kembangan Primary School \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Bukit Ho Swee East Primary School. In this analysis (Cols. 347 - 348) the Ministry omitted those schools which have only one or two PSLE classes as being unrepresentative. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1981/19811222/19811222-HA-0410347.htm\">analysis - PRIMARY SCHOOL LEAVING EXAMINATION (Cols. 347 - 348)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors can account for the good performance of these schools. The key factor appears to be the principal. The principals of these schools, and I may add also of other good schools, are men and women who have the leadership and professional vision to initiate special projects such as reading, mathematics or remedial teaching. They are \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> able to convince their teachers that such hard work can bear fruit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the principal of Elling North launched a crash programme in English in 1979. Children were tested to see if they had acquired certain skills expected at each level. Remedial or corrective measures were provided for pupils who were discovered to be weak. In Kallang Primary School the principal initiated a creative English programme which has achieved remarkable results with children from poor home environments. The principal of Cantonment Primary School introduced special methods to teach Mathematics which improved the Mathematics results in the school significantly. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Kembangan Primary School, the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan is familiar with the Partners in Education Project which involves the teachers, parents and community leaders. The attention which the school has received through the project has motivated teachers and pupils to improve their performance. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed and motivated teachers can do much to help the pupils in their schools. In the five schools that I have mentioned, the yearly improvements in PSLE results are due to the efforts and dedication of both their principals and teachers. The same can be said of schools which have year after year obtained consistently good results. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Sir, noting the important role of school principals in their effort to upgrade the school performance in PSLE in so far as the primary schools are concerned, would the Hon. Minister of State inform the House whether the Ministry has further plans to ensure that the school principals will acquire better skills in management and also will have a wider scope of ingenuity and initiative in searching for projects which can help to upgrade the performance of schools? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, the answer to the question is \"Yes\". My Ministry is looking into the possibility of organizing courses which will help school administrators, including principals, in their duties and in improving their leadership in the running of schools. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PRIMARY SCHOOL FOR RADIN MAS/TELOK BLANGAH AREA</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Building of)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr M.K.A.

In the Telok Blangah Constituency, there is only one primary school, Kampong Jagoh School. This school, however, will be closed in January 1982. The buildings will be demolished, as it is an old school, and the site redeveloped into a new 1980 standard primary school. The new school is expected to be completed in mid-1984. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new primary school at Bukit Purmei in Radin Mas Constituency will be completed in September, 1983. Soil investigation of the site has been completed and piling tenders are being prepared. In the Telok Blangah Constituency, two new primary schools, in addition to the redevelopment of Kampong Jagoh School, will also be built. Soil investigation of the site for the first school at Telok Blangah Drive has just been completed. The school is expected to be completed in mid-1983.

Some have argued that the 10-year age limit for cars to qualify for PARF should be abolished or increased to 15 years as proposed by the hon. Member.

Finally, there is a class of seafarers who earn more than $1,250 p.m. and who are not doing manual work, such as shipmasters, engineers and other officers who are not entitled to compensation under the Act. For these sea-farers, the Marine Department has, since August this year, required shipowners to take out insurance coverage separately for them.

Such crew agreements have to be approved by the Marine Department. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards compensation to crew for loss of personal effects arising from loss of vessel or fire on board ships, the Marine Department has also required shipowners to take out insurance coverage against possible loss in the crew agreements. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far these arrangements have been found satisfactory. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>UNEMPLOYMENT AND RETRENCHMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour if the Ministry of Labour is monitoring closely the situation of unemployment and the problems of retrenchment in Singapore; what steps the Ministry will take to help retrenched workers to find alternative employment and to acquire new skills; what measures will be introduced to encourage companies to employ retrenched workers; and what is the projection of the unemployment rate in Singapore for the next two years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Dr Wong Kwei Cheong) (for the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has been monitoring closely the unemployment and retrenchment situation.

The charges collected are insufficient to pay for the costs to HDB of providing these services. In spite of this, the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> quality of services taken as a whole has improved although the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru may not be aware of it. The overall cleanliness could improve further if the residents would give HDB their full cooperation and behave responsibly. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service and conservancy charges remained static for many years until the first increase in July 1974. After that, there were no further increases until 1980, six years later. Between 1974 and 1980, the cost for the-provision of conservancy services in HDB estates increased tremendously. The main cost items are labour costs, utility charges and the costs of repairs, maintenance and redecoration. We should compare these costs on a per unit of flat basis since the number of flats has increased. On this basis, between 1974 and 1980, labour costs per unit have increased by 89%. utility charges by 100% and the cost of repairs, maintenance and redecoration by 106%. The overall increase in expenditure per dwelling unit was 132% while the average increase in conservancy charges per unit was only 83%. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, the expenditure incurred by HDB on conservancy services was $34.6 million. The income from conservancy charges was only $30.1 million. The HDB was able to absorb the deficit of $4.5 million. In 1980, expenditure rose to $148 million but income based on the old rates fixed in 1974 would have been only $55 million, resulting in a deficit of $93 million. The HDB could not continue to bear these deficits and had to raise the conservancy charges to recover part of the increased costs. To minimize hardship, the increase was implemented in two stages, namely in August 1980 and July 1981. Despite the increase in August 1980, the HDB incurred a deficit of $47 million for FY 80-81 relating to the provision of conservancy services. Even after the second stage increase in July this year, the HDB expects a deficit of $42 million for FY 81-82. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that the recent increases in conservancy charges are not sufficient to cover the increased conservancy expenditure by HDB. Despite this, the HDB has \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> done more to improve the upkeep of the flats and their environment. Among the major improvements to the amenities of HDB estates are the provision of additional lifts, flushing of water tanks and more frequent repairs and redecorations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB is constantly looking for ways to keep down maintenance and conservancy costs. Some factors are beyond its control: for example, increases in utility charges and salaries of cleansing workers. The Board, however, can control the use of labour and can study ways to increase productivity. One of the most obvious ways is to mechanize cleansing and maintenance operations. Mechanization is also necessary as the HDB is facing difficulty in recruiting cleansing workers. This is partly due to the prevailing tight labour market. Besides, manual work is shunned by our young people. However, there is a limit to the mechanization of most of the cleansing operations and other jobs now performed manually. An obvious example is the sweeping of staircases. This is difficult to mechanize. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB residents can play an important part in keeping down conservancy expenditure. The HDB provides a refuse chute for every flat. If residents use these conveniently located chutes to dispose of their household rubbish instead of throwing garbage out of the windows or leaving them in the corridors, the HDB will be able to reduce the number of cleansing workers deployed to sweep corridors, staircases, lift lobbies and other common areas. By making proper use of their refuse chutes and cultivating good social habits they can contribute to minimizing increases in the conservancy and maintenance costs of HDB estates. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B.

The HDB will continue to sell flats to sitting tenants at prevailing posted prices because this is a fair practice. Any property owner who sells his property will not sell at his old buying price but will charge the going market rate. There is no reason why the HDB should do otherwise. This is the fundamental difference between renting and owning a flat. If you rent a flat you do not suffer any losses if the flat goes down in value; neither do you enjoy any capital appreciation if the market price goes up. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All HDB flat-owners agree with the principle that the resale of flats should be at market value. This is evident from advertisements in the newspapers offering HDB flats for resale. In every case, the owner's asking price is much higher than the prevailing HDB selling price for a similar flat in the same housing estate. I am quite certain that sitting tenants who now purchase their flats at posted prices will ask for the going market price in five years' time if they should decide subsequently to sell off their flats. In fact, the prevailing posted prices of flats offered to sifting tenants are lower than the present construction cost of such flats. Most tenants know that buying over their existing flats is a good investment. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting tenants who buy over their flats get a 99-year lease effective from the date of sale. In addition, they enjoy the following benefits: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) They do not have to pay the 20% downpayment if they have resided in their flats for two years or more; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) They do not have to submit fresh applications for purchase which, in effect, means that they are exempted from the eligibility rules relating to income ceiling; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) They do not have to wait for their flats, and their flats are in localities which they have been used to. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB rental flats are, in fact, highly subsidized. Rentals paid by HDB tenants are not sufficient to cover the financing and maintenance costs and property tax of the fiats, For example, the rental for a 3-room improved flat outside the Central Ares rented to a Singaporean is only $82.50 per month whereas the interest, administrative and maintenance cost and property tax borne by the HDB amount to $142 per month. Not only is there nothing left over to pay for the original cost of the flat, but there is, in fact, a subsidy of about $60 per month per fiat. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand the Minister of State, the justification is that if a private owner of an HDB flat wishes to sell it, he could sell it at the market price. First, is the Minister equating the HDB, which is charged with providing public accommodation at a cost that the citizens are able to bear, with that of a private owner? Secondly, is the Minister aware that the Ministry of Finance has offered for sale old flats in Neptune Court and Lagoon View at their cost prices when they were built, and thirdly, why is his Ministry pursuing a different policy from the Ministry of Finance? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member had listened carefully to my answer, he would already have got the facts in answer to his, supplementary question. In the case of private owners, for example, if any Member here buys some property and subsequently sells it, he will sell it at the market rate, not at the price he bought it. For example, if the hon. Member himself has property to sell, would he sell it at the old price? Definitely not. So the principle is fair. But the point that I am making really is this. The sitting tenants have, in fact, been enjoying subsidized rentals for many years before buying the flats. Why should they further enjoy the benefit of capital appreciation?

Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs) and I visited Bangkok from 21st to 24th November, 1981. The primary purposes of this visit were, firstly, to exchange views with the Thai Foreign Minister on the Kampuchean problem and, secondly, to ascertain the progress made by the three Cambodian factions in their efforts to form a Coalition Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will remember that the leaders of the three Cambodian factions, Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann and Khieu Samphan, met in Singapore in September this year, and they agreed in principle to form \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> a Coalition Government. Since their meeting in Singapore, representatives of these three factions have been holding meetings in Bangkok to try and work out the details on the formation of such a Coalition Government. At the time that we visited Bangkok, there had already been nine meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee studying the details on the formation of this Coalition Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before we left for Bangkok, the leader of the KPNLF, Son Sann, announced that he would not participate in the proposed Coalition Government but that his followers were free to discuss the matter. Even as we arrived in Bangkok, we heard news that Prince Sihanouk had also announced that he would not be participating in the Coalition Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is in this context that we arrived in Bangkok to have discussions with Son Sann, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and In Tam (in Tam being the representative of Prince Sihanouk). We had meetings with them, individually as well as jointly. From these meetings, it became obvious to us that the Ad Hoc Committee had meandered into difficulties and that, instead of discussing the details of how to pursue the sole objective of increasing the military, political and diplomatic pressure on the Vietnamese, they have got embroiled in discussions on the formation of a Coalition Government along the lines of a Coalition Government in peace time. One of the principles that the Khmer Rouge insisted upon was the principle that the institutions of the existing Democratic Kampuchea government should be retained in any Coalition Government. This was quite unacceptable to the other factions, especially when these institutions are associated with the notorious inhuman record of the Pol Pot Government in the years 1975 to 1978. As the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee had quite obviously reached an impasse, and as Son Sann had categorically stated that he would not participate, and so had Prince Sihanouk, we obviously had to look for some other solution. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the discussions that we had in Bangkok with these groups, we proposed that the Coalition Government which they \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> should form should at this stage be concerned only with one single objective, that is, the pursuit of the struggle against Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. After the Vietnamese withdrawal, the Coalition Government should automatically be dissolved. In fact, this was suggested by the Khieu Samphan group, and that after the Coalition Government had been dissolved then there would be free elections to choose the government of Cambodia, the elections to be organized and supervised by the United Nations. Under this arrangement, each faction would retain its identity and be free to propagate its own distinctive political programme and philosophy for the future of Cambodia. The three factions would only be united in their struggle against Vietnam. The three key officers of this Coalition Government, i.e. the President, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, would all seek to mobilize international support for their struggle against the Vietnamese. These points are contained in the statement that was released by the Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs) on 24th November, 1981. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son Sann readily agreed to these proposals although he said that he would have to consult his followers. In Tam, representing Prince Sihanouk, also agreed in principle and, subsequent to that meeting, both Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk have confirmed their formal approval of these proposals. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary representing the Khmer Rouge, they did not reject these proposals but asked for time to consider these proposals and we agreed to give them two months. We are awaiting their reply and we hope that their response will be favourable. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, on the 10th of this month, ASEAN Foreign Ministers met informally in Bangkok and expressed their full support for these proposals which we had earlier put up in our visit to Bangkok. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers urged the Khmer Rouge and other interested parties to respond positively to these proposals. They also agreed at this meeting that these proposals should be \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> explained to friendly countries who have been supporting ASEAN on this question. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still a little too early to say whether the Khmer Rouge will respond positively to these proposals. As the Khmer Rouge have already announced their full support for the Resolution and Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea, and as they have also agreed to the various UN Resolutions on this subject, we assume that they should respond positively to our proposals because these proposals are within the principles already expressed in the UN and in the International Conference on Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge leaders have at various times assured the ASEAN Governments that they have no intention of seizing power by force when the Vietnamese withdraw from Cambodia and that their sole objective is to join together with other patriotic forces to struggle against Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. As I said just now, since our proposals are consistent with the stand that they have taken so far and consistent with the objectives that they have stated, we think that logically they should accept the proposal that we have made. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is, of course, for the various Cambodian factions to decide how far they want to proceed in the Coalition Government and how much they are prepared to sacrifice their immediate individual interests in order to join together and cooperate in their effort to free Cambodia from Vietnamese occupation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Hon.

But we have not had any official reply and we still have almost another month for them to give us this reply. So we are still hopeful, I would not as yet say that our efforts have been futile, and we have to keep trying. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to alternatives and other options, I think it is too early to talk about alternatives. It is only proper that having given them two months, they should give us a formal and final reply before we discuss alternatives.

But since they were well within the framework laid out by the Foreign Ministers, we made the proposals and subsequently informed them.

This so-called \"Double Account\" System, which provides one account for Capital and another for Revenue, was in fact adopted from British practice. In England, it has been used by public utility undertakings established under Special Acts of Parliament. This accounting treatment by the HDB has been in use for 17 years now and there have been no complaints until recently. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1979, the HDB has increased the selling prices of its flats only once, i.e. in 1974. Since 1979, HDB has been compelled to increase the selling prices of HDB flats substantially because of the tremendous escalation of construction costs. The prices were increased by an average of 15% in 1979, 20% in 1980 and 38% this year. These price hikes have caused much anxiety and concern among flat buyers. The subject of concern is really the selling price, which is dictated by the construction cost, and not the HDB accounting system per se. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any accounting system adopted by a public institution such as the HDB, should allow for proper control and accountability of public funds, especially when large sums of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> money are involved. In this regard, the present accounting system has achieved its purpose. There is no doubt about that and the Auditor-General has satisfied himself that this is indeed so. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of an accounting system is the reporting function for internal management control and for public information. This is more a question of convention and style. Some accountants may prefer one system of accounting whilst other accountants may prefer another. The accounting system would also depend on the nature of the organization - whether it is a profit-oriented commercial firm or a statutory board providing a public service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB accounting system has worked well and been accepted for many years. However, in view of the criticisms by the Auditor-General that the HDB accounting system is out of date and considering the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, the HDB has decided to revise its accounting system, despite the many difficulties involved in such a major exercise. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in accounting treatment has already been implemented for HDB's subsidiary operations and other peripheral activities, including hawker centres and car park operations. All these years, such surpluses or deficits have been properly and separately accounted for and the operating results from the hawker centres and car parks have all along been shown in the Income and Expenditure Account. As for the subsidiary operations, such as the HDB quarry, brickworks and tile factories, the operating results for Financial Year 1980-81 have, for the first time, been reflected in the Income and Expenditure Account for the year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the sale of flats activity, the problems involved are far more complex. Many technical problems concerning what is and what is not part of the construction cost will have to be ironed out. For example, in many instances, after an estate has been developed and completed, public amenities and other infrastructure are subsequently added to improve the estate. If such additions are considered part of the costs of the flats which have already been sold, how \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> should the cost be treated; or if such improvements take place after some flats have been sold, and some others are waiting to be sold and still others rented, how should the cost be accounted? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's accounting system has been used since its inception. Over the last 17 years some 350,000 units of flats have been built. It is impossible to go back so many years to try and revise the accounts to the new format. A cut-off date will, therefore, be necessary to arrive at a proper set of accounts which will serve as the starting point for the new accounting system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB needs time to study all the technical problems before implementing the revised system. In this complex and wide-ranging task, the HDB is further hampered by the lack of manpower. The Board has been losing many experienced accountants in recent months and it is having difficulty replacing them. In view of the many difficulties involved, it is expected that the earliest that the HDB can target to have the revised system installed is Financial Year 1983-84. \n  <br>3.30 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr J.B.

In the case of uncustomed petrol or where there is variation in the price of a grade of petrol of the same trade mark, the highest price, inclusive of customs duty, for that grade and trade mark shall be taken to be the value for the purpose of customs duty. The value of any grade of petrol which is not of a trade mark being retailed in Singapore shall also be the highest price, inclusive of customs duty, for that grade regardless of trade mark. If there is any doubt on retailers' pump price, the Director-General is empowered to decide and fix the price. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill caters for the free trade zone at the Singapore Changi Airport. It allows an authority administering a free trade zone or any person authorized by the Director-General of Customs and Excise to remove, without customs permit, dutiable goods from an aircraft into a free trade zone in a customs airport, to be directly tran-shipped from the free trade zone to another aircraft at the same airport. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, I rise in support of this Bill and would like to draw the attention of this House to a particular provision. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to change the mode of valuation of petrol duties from the present fixed rate to a percentage based on petrol pump prices. Presently fixed duties on petrol are 36 cents per litre for premium grade and 34.5 cents per litre for regular. Following this, petrol duties will be at 40% of pump prices as stated by the hon. Minister earlier. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this proposed change, we can expect that petrol duties will go up by an additional 12 cents for premium petrol and nine cents for regular petrol. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely that oil companies will absorb these increases in duty. In fact, they will be passed on to the motorists. As a result motorists in Singapore can expect to pay $1.19 per litre for premium grade and $1.08 for regular grade petrol. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present prices are already expensive enough. With the additional duties, Singapore will be one of the most expensive places in the world to buy petrol, notwithstanding the fact that it has one of the biggest refineries in the world. People in Hongkong pay the equivalent of only 85 Singapore cents per litre. In the United States where prices differ from city to city, the average retail price is only about 82 Singapore cents per litre for premium grade. Our friends across the Causeway pay only 92 Singapore cents per litre for regular and 98 Singapore cents per litre for premium grade, What is the justification of the Government to increase the cost of petrol to motorists in Singapore? At a time when OPEC is reducing the price of oil owing to a decline in global demand and a glut in supply, it seems that the advantage of such a situation is not being passed on to Singaporeans, and instead the Government is seeking to raise the prices of petrol in Singapore. Even stranger must be the fact that this latest move runs counter to the Government's position that prices of oil products must reflect world market conditions. Pump prices were decontrolled about three years ago, so that consumers could pay according to world-wide rates. Now at a time when prices are falling or stabilizing, the Government chooses to increase the cost of petrol to Singaporeans. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end it is not only the hard-pressed motorist who suffers. Everyone knows what happened the last time petrol prices went up by a substantial amount. Everything else followed suit. There would always be those who would be the first to increase their prices thereby causing further difficulties to Singaporeans, particularly those in the lower income group. With the inflation rate running around 8% this year, can we afford any round of Government-induced price increases? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey was made recently by the Automobile Association of Britain on the cost of owning a car in various countries around the world. In this list of countries which included developed countries like the United States, Japan and Great Britain, Singapore was placed the second most expensive country in the world to own a car. With the astonishingly high duties and taxes one pays just to own a car, our unenviable position on this list is not surprising. And it will not be surprising if, with the passing of this Bill, Singapore succeeds in making it to the top of this unflattering list. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the points which the Member for Alexandra has made are all points which motorists, among whom I number myself, will appreciate. The fact is that there will be an increase in pump prices. The exact increase will depend, of course, upon how much the petrol companies will absorb the increase in duty. For a motorist using 30 gallons a month, the increase will most probably be about $15 a month. However painful it is to pay more tax, I do not feel that motorists can consider this increase an intolerable burden. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must remind the Member that the principle of this Bill and of this increase was accepted by the House at the time of the debate on the Budget statement. I made it clear in my speech just now on the Second Reading that this Bill is intended to implement one of the measures in the Budget for this year. If it is any consolation, the Member would like to know that as this Bill comes up before the House only at this stage, motorists have had the benefit of having already saved many months of additional tax. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.48 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Law (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of this Bill are merely two-fold. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill will empower a Court to increase in certain circumstances the penalty which may be imposed, in addition to any other punishment, on a person who is convicted of any offence of corruptly accepting gratification under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Where a person is charged with a number of offences under the Act, he may be convicted of one or some of the offences and consent to the other outstanding offences being taken into consideration for the purpose of passing sentence. At present, however, the Court can only order a convicted person to pay as an additional penalty a sum equal to the amount or value of the gratification specified in the charges in respect of which he was convicted. The Court has no power to order the convicted person to pay the amount or value of the gratification specified in the other outstanding charges which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 13 of the Act so as to confer such power on the Court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill makes provision to enable the President to create additional grades of special investigators for the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. With this amendment in clause 3, there will be no necessity to amend the Act in future whenever new grades of special investigators are to be created. The remaining provisions of the Bill are consequential. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on this my first speech in this House, if it is not inappropriate, may I first of all thank you, Mr \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Speaker, for the courtesy that I have received at your hands and express the hope that with your able guidance I may be able to contribute to the proceedings of this House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that on this, my first speech in this House, I am able to compliment the Government in its efforts and determination to stamp out corruption and I can assure the Government and the Members of this House of my Party's support in all that the Government does to stamp out corruption in this land of ours. Corruption is, as has been said, a cancer on the society and must be ruthlessly rooted out. But what we do not always approve are the methods that are used by the law enforcement agencies when they go about carrying out the task assigned to them, and the CPIB is no exception. I need not remind hon. Members of this House of the need for law enforcement officers to act strictly under and in accordance with the law and to respect the rights of citizens in the investigations they carry out into any offence which they are authorized to carry out. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, if I may say so, Mr Speaker, absolutely essential that if there is to be respect for law and order among the citizens of our country, then law enforcement officers themselves should respect the laws of the country and act under and in accordance with the law. If law enforcement officers bend the law or abuse the provisions of the law for the object of carrying out their task, however laudable it may be, the result can only be that there will be among the populace of the country a growing disrespect for law and order when they see law enforcement officers not complying with the law of the land. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unknown that CPIB officers have very often abused the law in the investigations that they have conducted into offences which they are empowered to investigate. It is not unknown that quite often witnesses are detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act when they are called up to the CPIB headquarters in Stamford Road and they are unable, or refuse perhaps, to give the answers or information requested of them by the CPIB officers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it may be said that these measures are necessary if you want to stamp out corruption because corruption is perhaps the greater evil. But the danger is that if you resort to these measures to achieve however laudable an object, you open the door to innocent persons being convicted, You open the door to fabrication of evidence under pressure by persons who may feel that the only way to get out of the clutches of the CPIB is to say whatever the CPIB wishes them to say and to implicate perhaps innocent officers or innocent members of the public. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not very long ago the case of a witness who was called up to the CPIB offices for a statement to be given in connection with an offence alleged against another. This man was picked up by the CPIB very early in the morning at about seven o'clock and he was not released by the CPIB till late in the evening. Before he left, there was a statement taken from him which he was asked to sign. After he had left the offices of the CPIB he was asked whether he had read all the statements that he had made to the CPIB and whether he had read them carefully before he acknowledged the correctness of the statements. He then had second thoughts about all this because he said he was in no condition, when it came to the time of his release, to appreciate fully all that had been recorded from him. He then went and saw a solicitor and went back to the offices of the CPIB to ask whether he could re-read the statements that he had made to the CPIB. There was some demur at this request but eventually it was granted, and he read this in the presence of the solicitor who accompanied him and he asked whether he might delete two sentences in his statement because he said they were incorrect. He maintained that he had not said those two statements. He was not allowed to delete those statements, Mr Speaker, Sir. He was told that if he wanted to vary his statements he could be detained in this country for another 12 months: presumably the CPIB officers were referring to the Criminal Law \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> (Temporary Provisions) Act. He was told that he could not have his passport. He was not a resident of Singapore. The man settled for his passport and, not wanting any risk of detention for 12 months, he agreed to leave his statement as it was and left with his solicitor with the passport. Eventually when the case came up for trial, ho told the Court that those two sentences in that statement were incorrect and he could not on oath repeat those two statements in the witness box. The man was then prosecuted for making a false statement to a CPIB officer, a statement which he had at the earliest opportunity informed the CPIB was not a true statement and which he wanted to retract, Fortunately for him he was acquitted. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another case which arose recently after allegations were made that our players were bribed in the Malaysia Cup Final in Kuala Lumpur. After the allegations had appeared in the papers, the CPIB were called in to investigate allegations of corruption among the football players. The man I am talking of was not a player. He was a respectable executive of one of the major companies in Singapore. He was summarily picked up from his office about 10 o'clock in the morning and was taken to the CPIB, even though he protested that it was not convenient for him at that time. He was taken there and detained by the CPIB. He was not released till about 11.00 p.m. During that time he was not allowed to leave the room, even to go to the lavatory to answer the call of nature or even to go and get any food. Then at about 11 o'clock at night he was bundled into a car and taken to his house where the house was ransacked by the CPIB officers. The poor wife was woken up and the children too. The CPIB officers ransacked the house and took some documents away. That was not the end. When they left the house he was taken to his office where his table and drawers were again ransacked. He was eventually brought back to the CPIB. He was then told that he would have to bring his son there because the son happened to be with the father in Kuala Lumpur to watch the game. The son was below 18 years of age. He said that his son was staying with his mother-in-law. So off they drove to the mother-in-law's \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> house. The son was picked up in spite of the protest by the father that his son was attending school. He asked whether the CPIB officers could not leave the son till the following morning if they wished to ask him any questions. No. He was picked up and taken to the CPIB. The son was detained for some hours at the CPIB for questioning. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken time to mention these cases because it seems to me that if you adopt these tactics, you open the door to fabrication of evidence and that, to me at least, is a greater evil than corruption. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill that is before the House now seeks to extend the very wide powers that are now possessed by the Director, the Deputy Director, Assistant Directors, Chief Special Investigator or Senior Special Investigators. It proposes to extend these powers right down to the lowest officer, that is, the Special Investigator. Every officer in the CPIB, right from the Director to the lowest officer, is going to be armed with all these special powers. I would ask this House, or advise this House, to be cautious before we give such extensive powers to the officers unless there is also provided at the same time proper checks on the exercise of these powers by the CPIB officers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that the Act and the Bill do not contain any checks on the exercise of the powers granted to them by the CPIB. I would refer in particular, Mr Speaker, Sir, to clause 8. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 17 of the principal Act which provides that the Public Prosecutor may empower: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the Director, the Deputy Director, or an assistant director . . . or any senior special investigator [it stops with that] to investigate any bank account, share account, purchase account, expense account or any other account, or any safe deposit box in any bank, and the order shall be sufficient authority for the disclosure or production by any person of all or any information or accounts or documents or articles as may be required by the officer so authorised.' Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see from that that it is a very wide, far-reaching power. Power is given to officers to open up any bank account of any person - share account, purchase account, expense account or any other account, or any safe deposit box \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> in any bank. The question is: is it not possible that if this power is entrusted to junior officers, for example, the special investigators, is there not a danger that this power may perhaps be abused for whatever reasons, maybe for personal reasons or vendetta or for other reasons, because they have been put up to it by someone who is interested in investigating the accounts? One can think of many reasons why this power can be abused. What is alarming is that subsection (2) of this section renders the person who fails to answer any question or disclose the information liable to be convicted and to suffer a fine of $2,000 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we move on to clause 10. That likewise extends the power which hitherto has only been exercised, on the directions of the Public Prosecutor, by the Deputy Director or any assistant director or any police officer of or above the rank of assistant superintendent or any senior special investigator - it extends this power which has hitherto only been exercised by these senior officers to ordinary special investigators. This section authorises them to inspect banker's books. May I again say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this is a very wide power and it may be necessary that to fight corruption we have got to give the officers the power to make proper investigation. All I am saying is: let us take care that we do not give wide, very extensive powers to junior officers unless we provide at the same time proper checks on the exercise of these powers and see that they are exercised in accordance with and under the law. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to clause 11 which deals with powers of search. Powers of search are contained in section 21 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. What the amendment proposes to do is to put it into a neater form because of the various amendments that had been made to the section. Now, under the proposed amendment and under the law as it stands, any special investigator may enter somebody's house or flat without obtaining any search warrant in the first place, if - and he is made the sole judge of this - he has reason to believe that by the delay the object \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> of the search as it says here, \"is likely to be frustrated\". If he, first of all, believes that the delay in obtaining a search warrant is likely to frustrate his search, then he can dispense with the necessity of obtaining a search warrant and he can then enter anybody's house and ransack the house from top to bottom in his purported exercise of powers granted under this Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we must accept is that our people do have some rights and it is important that the Government, the law enforcement agencies and Government departments recognize this and respect the rights of our citizens. It is a wrongful act for any person to enter into the house of another person unless he has been invited by that other person, If the law is going to change that, and to make an exception to this, then should not there be proper safeguards in favour of the citizen? And I am surprised, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there is no requirement in this proposed amendment to section 21 that before any CPIB officer conducts a search of any premises, he should produce to the occupant of the place the search warrant if he has obtained a search warrant and hand him a copy of the search warrant if requested so that the occupant may know under what rights the CPIB officer is invading his privacy and, at the same time, show the occupant his certificate of appointment to show that he is a CPIB officer authorized to conduct the search. What often happens is that our citizens are neither shown the search warrant - and it is anybody's guess whether the officer has a search warrant upon him or not - nor is the occupant shown the certificate of appointment. He may say that he comes from the CPIB but the certificate of appointment which every CPIB officer is required to carry under section 4 is not produced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister if he would consider amending the proposed clause 11 to include provisions requiring CPIB officers, before exercising the power of search given to them under this section, to either produce the search warrant and give a copy to the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> person whose place is to be searched and at the same time produce the certificate of appointment or, where he does not have a search warrant, requiring the CPIB officer to give a signed statement of the offence he is investigating and stating the reasons why he had not obtained a search warrant before carrying out his search. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my submission, Mr Speaker, these provisions are essential if we are going to enhance respect among our citizens for law and order. Then only will our citizens respect the enforcement officers and those whose task, unpleasant as it is, is to enforce laws in this country. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with the powers given to the CPIB officers and the need to provide proper checks. There are two other matters on which I would like to speak, Sir, and they are these. I need not remind the Members of this House of the value of precept and example. This Government has a name for being neither corrupt nor corruptible but, Mr Speaker, as the saying goes in regard to the administration of justice, it is not enough that justice is done but must be manifestly seen to be done. I think it is a matter in which Members of this House can set an example, an example which can be followed by all our citizens. What I am going to suggest, Mr Speaker, is that the Minister include a new clause in this Bill requiring all Members of Parliament to file a statutory declaration of all assets and movable and immovable properties belonging to or possessed by the Member, his wife or spouse, sons and daughters, and requiring hereafter every Member elected to Parliament to file a similar declaration before taking his oath and seat in Parliament. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the example over the Causeway of the Prime Minister there directing his Ministers and his top civil servants to file a similar declaration of assets. It is something which we can follow to our advantage because it is something in which we can give the lead to all our people in Singapore that it is absolutely necessary for us to remain free from this cancer of corruption. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, Mr Speaker, Sir, indeed going to table a question at this sitting of Parliament \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> for the Hon. Prime Minister to answer whether he would consider making such a direction. But I was prevented from tabling this question because of the provision in the Constitution and in the Standing Orders that until I have taken my oath and taken my seat, I cannot table any questions. So I would commend this provision to the Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision that I would like to see, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Bill and that is the punishment for the improper use of facilities and services provided and paid for out of public funds by any Member of Parliament or by any civil servant or public officer as defined in the Constitution, whether in his own interest or purpose or in the interest of a party or organization to which he belongs. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noted that in Singapore today there is close identification of a political party with the Government and I have heard that facilities and services provided for and paid out of public funds are put at the disposal of this party. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is wrong and should be made punishable because it is also corruption - using facilities and services provided for and paid out of public funds. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the Member if he will give specific instances? I will take action on them forthwith. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the instances are the use by the party of Government land and premises at Napier Road. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, carry on. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> And also the use by the Hon.

These are serious charges, just as the one the Member for Anson made in a speech at Fullerton Square in 1976, where he made the allegation that I was corrupt or I indulged in corrupt practices in allowing a banking licence to be issued to a bank in which my brother was a director. The case has gone right up to the Privy Council and the Privy Council will soon determine whether the Member for Anson, when he swore on the Bible on oath that he did not mean to allege that I was corrupt, and that \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the words did not mean what they say. He is a God-fearing man. He now comes to this House and makes further innuendoes. This is a government that is prepared to open all the books.

What I will not \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> have, Mr Speaker, Sir, is what, I am sure, we are going to have in the next three to four years, and we will have it ad nauseam and the Member will get it back from me ad nauseam, a direct challenge to prove in an open court or a Commission of Inquiry.

His appeal in 1979 was again reported at great length in Singapore. It is before the Court and I am making no comments on the merits of the arguments. All I am saying is when that appeal is disposed of, it will mean that either I or the hon. Member for Anson - in my case I took an affirmation, in his case an oath on the Bible - went into the witness box and did not tell the truth. That is what it amounts to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two allegations have been made of misconduct. I offer an open forum for all details. Instead I have an unseemly, disgusting, wriggling retreat. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind him that way back in February 1955 we taught Singapore the first lesson in public accountability when we \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> disclosed that a Labour Front Minister had received $700,000. A Commission of Inquiry was offered, immediately accepted, and we proved our allegations. Those same standards we intend to honour. If there is any allegation of misconduct by any Member of this House or any Member of the Government, or official of the Government, there will be a full inquiry, a full prosecution, and every facility for the facts to be unravelled. That is the strength of this Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before the Member makes vote-catching, popular suggestions of public declaration or statutory declaration, let me tell him that there are standard practices in America, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. They are worthless. It does not stop corruption. If the boss of the outfit, whether he is the head of a department or the minister or, worst of all, the head of the government, the Prime Minister, does not set standards, then standards cannot be enforced lower down. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know exactly what each Member in this House is worth. They make full disclosures to me. There is no way in which anybody can prevent me from being corrupt if I choose to be corrupt, but the price is the disintegration of the system, and the system has held for 22 1/2 years. And we have established a reputation which the Member concedes for integrity because the highest standards are enforced. So I end up with a simple message to him and his supporters - any allegation of misconduct, and he will have the whole panoply of the law for a thorough and open investigation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to the Hon.

But he spoke of corruption in general. He spoke on section 21. Let me reassure the Member that this is not a new section. It is merely tidying up consequentially all the powers on which he has spoken and on which he wants checks and balances. These powers have been with the CPIB for a very long time. If we are to stamp out corruption, we must have these powers. We must give them these powers. At the same time if there are abuses, there can be complaints which the Attorney-General or even the Police Department can look into. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the People's Action Party occupying land at Napier Road, we need not supply him with these particulars. He can easily make a search in the Land Office. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E W Barker]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>4.45 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2. line 30, to leave out from \"person\" to the end of line 5 in page 3 and insert the words shown in my Notice of Amendments*. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <pre>\r\n               *The words to be inserted read as follows:\r\n               \"charged with two or more offences for the \r\n               acceptance of gratification in contravention \r\n               of this Act is convicted of one or some of \r\n               those offences, and the other outstanding \r\nCap. 113       offences are taken into consideration by the \r\n               court under section 177 of the Criminal \r\n               Procedure Code for the purpose of passing \r\n               sentence, the court may increase the penalty\r\n               mentioned in subsection (1) by an amount not \r\n               exceeding the total amount or value of   \r\n               the gratification specified in the charges   \r\n               for the offences so taken into consideration.\".\r\n</pre> \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is one of form rather than substance.

At present, the clause makes no reference to section 177 of the Criminal Procedure Code which is the section which permits outstanding offences, with the consent of the prosecutor and the accused, to be taken into consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed for the offence or offences of which the accused has been convicted. The omission in the existing clause of any reference to section 177 of the Criminal Procedure Code may give rise to a doubt as to whether the provision of the clause is related to or independent of that section. The amendment will remove this doubt. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 8 stand part of the Bill.\" \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, clause 8, as I have said, gives right down to the special investigator the very wide powers which have hitherto been exercised only by the Director or the Deputy Director and Assistant Director or the Senior Special Investigator.

The clause only makes it an offence where a person refuses access to or fails to comply with the lawful demands of the Director, special investigator or police officer. It does not make it an offence where the enforcement officer concerned is a Deputy Director or an Assistant Director of the CPIB. The amendment to the clause will rectify this by substituting the reference to the Director, special investigator or police officer with a reference to the Director or any officer. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In page 5, lines 24 and 25, to leave out \"a special investigator or police\" and insert \"any\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In page 5. line 27, to leave out \", special investigator or police\" and insert \"or that\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the amendment is the same as that which I have given for clause 12, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read, \n  <br>4.57 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory car inspections will be introduced with effect from 2nd January, 1982. Cars which are over five years old will be affected during 1982. To start the programme, cars which are more than eight years old and whose vehicle licence (road tax) expires on or after 31st March, 1982, will be called up for inspection first. Cars between three and five years old will be affected from 1983. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Vehicles will notify affected car owners to have their cars inspected three months before their road tax is due for renewal. During these three months, they should have their cars repaired and brought up to the standard required to pass the inspection test. They may call either of the two authorized inspection centres, VICOM and the Automobile Association of Singapore, to make an appointment to have their cars inspected before the expiry of their road tax. If a car passes the test, a test certificate will be issued by the inspection centre. If it fails, the owner will have to send his car for repairs and have his car re-tested at the same centre until it passes the test. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a car is due for compulsory inspection, its road tax will not be renewed by the Registrar of Vehicles unless it has been issued with a test certificate. Since cars between three and 10 years old have to be inspected once every two years and those over 10 years old annually, this condition will not apply to the car's subsequent six-monthly or yearly renewal of road tax unless it is due for an inspection. This condition of having a test certificate when renewing road tax will also not apply to cars which are below three years old and which are exempted from compulsory inspection. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of tying renewal of road tax with the issue of the test certificate is adopted in other countries which have already introduced compulsory car inspections, for example, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Japan. The purpose is to ensure that a car is not allowed to be driven on the road unless it has been inspected and certified fit at the time of inspection. The non-renewal of the road tax will facilitate enforcement of this ruling. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car owners should, however, be aware that passing the car inspection is not a guarantee that the car will be roadworthy until the next compulsory inspection is due. Cars may still be involved in an accident due to mechanical failure after it has been inspected. This is because there is no way of knowing when the mechanical condition of the car would deteriorate after it has been inspected. For this reason car owners are urged not to be complacent simply because their cars have passed the inspection test. Instead, they should always be conscious of their responsibility to check their cars regularly and to maintain them in good condition at all times for the safety of all road users. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Road Traffic Act is now being amended to give effect to the decision to tie the renewal of the road tax with compulsory inspection of the car. The amendment will empower the Registrar of Vehicles to refuse to issue a vehicle licence to a car owner unless a test certificate has been issued for his car within three months prior to the issue of the vehicle licence. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Teng Cheong]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTEGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.03 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provisions of the Local Government Integration Act allow the Public Works Department to recover road-making costs incurred by the Department from the owners of properties fronting, adjoining or abutting streets which have been made up. Payments may be made by instalments with an interest rate not exceeding 6% per annum over a period not exceeding 10 years. The interest rate of 6% per annum has never been revised since 1963 and does not reflect the present cost of funds. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill, therefore, seeks to: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) revise the interest rate for recovery of road-making costs by instalments, to 11% per annum which is the normal rate levied by the Government for the recovery of debts by instalments; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) allow the Minister to vary the rate by notification in the Gazette when there is a need to further revise the rates as economic conditions change. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose this Bill. The main purpose of this Bill, as explained by the Hon. Minister, is to raise the rate of interest that is charged at the moment for monies due from occupants of properties fronting streets where the Public Works Department has carried out any works that improve the property and, where monies are payable by these persons, to allow for interest to be charged where the money has not been paid within a limited time or where payment by instalment has been allowed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's reason would appear to be that no revision has been made to the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> interest rate since 1963. Mr Speaker, Sir, that may well be true, but is there any particular reason besides that? Why should the interest rate be increased now? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Civil Law Act, the Courts are empowered to award interest for any debts upon which an action is brought by a person, and the Courts have power to award interest of 8%. In this particular instance here, where the Director of Public Works, i.e. the Government, institutes proceedings against the owner or the occupant of a property for the recovery of costs, under the Civil Law Act, the Courts may only award interest up to 8%. But, nevertheless, this Bill now proposes to impose a rate of 11%, which is almost twice the rate that is at present charged. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government is known, and quite rightly, for its efficiency in collecting revenue. But whilst this Government is ready to collect all revenue that is possible, it is not at the same time that ready and willing to extend to the citizens the same benefits that it claims for itself. I refer to deposits of money held by statutory boards or by the Government that belong to the citizens, and upon this money no interest is paid, as far as I know. Recently, I have come across cases where people have paid quite large sums of money to the HDB and the HUDC, in particular, and these monies have been held for periods of years, sometimes two or three years, and no interest is credited to the persons who paid the deposits of money for the purchase of properties either from the HUDC or the HDB. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the dissatisfaction felt in many quarters of the low interest that is paid on the CPF contributions. I would, therefore, ask the Minister to consider whether it is right in these circumstances that the rate of interest should be doubled, almost doubled, to 11%. These persons from whom the monies are sought to be recovered may be quite ordinary, poor persons, often from the middle class and lower middle class income groups, and it may be a burden for them to meet these charges, in the first place, for the making up of roads or other improvements, and provision is rightly made for the Govern- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ment to carry out these works and to recover the cost. But is it necessary that there should be imposed on these persons an unnecessary extra burden just because they are unable in the first place to meet the cost themselves? It is because they are unable to meet the cost themselves that the Director of Public Works carries out the work. It seems as though they are being penalized for being unable to meet the cost of the works that an interest is levied on any amounts due to the Director if it is not paid within 14 days or the time limited for payment. Now it is proposed to increase the interest rate from 6% to 11%. I would ask the Minister to consider this before he adds another burden, not on all of our citizens but on some of our citizens who may be charged with payment of monies to the Director of Public Works. I move to oppose the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view this amendment Bill is very necessary for a valid purpose. I have something to say that is different from the Member for Anson's. I feel that the existing Act should be amended. If there is no amendment then the Government will stand to lose. For instance, I own a property that has a mad frontage, and as a result of public works being carried out on the road, I owe the Government a certain sum of money for the cost of these works. But since the interest rate paid by banks and finance company is so high at present, I would rather put the money, which ought to be paid to the Government, in a bank or in a finance company and earn interest at more than 6% every year. So why should I pay the Government in one lump sum? By paying the Government in instalments, I can not only offset the 6% interest rate charged by the Government but also make some money out of it. If the existing law is not amended, the Government will be the loser in the end. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government makes up the road for owners of properties fronting the road, the expenses incurred by the Government must be recovered from the owners. At present the owners can make use of the money payable to the Government to make some profit. That is not right and is unfair. If we do not amend \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the Act, then perhaps because of the extra workers needed to carry out the work, the 6% interest cannot cover the additional expenditure on administration and labour, Now that wages are so high it is also not easy to engage any worker, hence, it is necessary for us to amend the present law. If anybody thinks that the intention of the amendment to the existing law is to make a profit, I would say that this thought is very childish. It is not the intention of the Government to make money. If the Government wanted to get more money, it could levy more taxes in other fields, not an insignificant 5% from this item. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not a lawyer. But from the question raised by the Member for Anson that money deposited with the Government and statutory boards does not earn interest, I would like to know whether a lawyer pays interest on money put by his client into the lawyer's office. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Second account. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> There is no interest at all.

May I inform the hon. Member that there is provision for this, and I am sure lawyers who are in this House will bear me out that the rules provide exactly for this - that where a solicitor holds a sum of more than $5,000 of his client's money, he shall deposit it in an interest-bearing account and the client should be credited with that interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that answers the Member. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Member for Khe Bong for his support of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the various points raised by the hon. Member for Anson, I would rather not go into the details of the deposit with the HDB and HUDC because we will have plenty of opportunities very soon in the Budget debate to discuss this matter. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I just want to say that the amount of deposit for an HDB or HUDC flat is not sufficient to buy the land. If the hon. Member for Anson has dealings with developers, he can ask them whether the few thousand dollars deposit for an HDB flat or the $18,000 deposit for an HUDC flat is sufficient to buy the land to develop the flats. If the hon. Member for Anson has an opportunity to ask the developers, I am quite sure the answer is \"No\". The amount of deposit is not sufficient to buy the land. The money held by the HDB or HUDC is utilized for the purchase of the land for development of flats. In fact, both the authorities are not holding any money of these people who deposit money with these two authorities. But this has nothing to do with the Bill before the House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Local Government Integration Act, the 6% interest which the Government collects is well below the prevailing market rate at present, I am quite sure the hon. Member for Anson knows that the interest rate that a finance company pays to those who put money in it is certainly very much higher than 6%, probably much higher than 11% which this Bill proposes to collect. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department incurs the expenditure mainly for making up roads. And it involves those properties fronting the roads which have not been made up. Quite often, these roads have a lot of pot-holes and not suitable for vehicular traffic. What the PWD does is to make up these roads to Government standards and thereafter the Government will declare the roads as public roads and maintain the roads henceforth. After the roads have been made up by the Public Works Department, the owners of properties fronting these roads will find that the value of their properties has been greatly enhanced. I think all the owners should be very glad that the PWD is able to make up the roads which help to improve their properties. Of course, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> many of the owners are good businessmen and they can do the calculations. If the finance company is paying a good deal more than 10% interest, then by paying instalments to the Government at 6% they can use the money for another purpose. It is not that these are poor people who cannot afford to pay the Government the money for making up of roads. In fact, the developers are multi-millionaires. At present, they are paying the Government instalments at an interest rate of 6%. But if the interest rate is increased to 11%, maybe the Government will increase its revenue and make the cost of money reflect the market rate. The owners will do the calculations and quite often they will still pay the instalments because they find that the proposed interest rate of 11% is still quite low compared with the market rate or the rate charged by the banks. Most probably it will cost them a good deal more than 11%. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Teh Cheang Wan]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>REGISTRATION OF DEEDS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br>5.21 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr E.W.

Repayment of withdrawals released under this Scheme are required to be secured by statutory charges or mortgages in favour of the Board. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 14(l)(c) of the Registration of Deeds Act, the Registrar has no power to accept statutory charges or mortgages of pans of land lots where survey of those parts has not been approved by the Chief Surveyor. Additional costs will therefore need to be incurred by members of the Fund whose withdrawals have been approved by the Board if a survey has to be carried out by a registered surveyor and survey plans approved by the Chief Surveyor. With the amendment to Rule 13 of the Registration of Deeds Rules, 1979, as now contained in the Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Rules, 1981, presented to this House as SL Paper No. 57 of 1981, the Registrar of Deeds will have the power to accept for registration any notice of any statutory charge or mortgage created under section 14 of the Central Provident Fund Act in respect of any part of Government survey lot (including a flat) shown in an attached plan without requiring the prior approval of the Chief Surveyor. The amendment will benefit the Central Provident Fund members who will not be required to bear the survey costs and at the same time will protect the interests of the Central Provident Fund Board. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (2) of section 29 of the Registration of Deeds Act (Chapter 281), resolves that the Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Rules, 1981, published as Notification No. S 337 in the Government Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 51 of 23rd October, 1981, as contained in Paper S.L. 57 of 1981, be approved. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr E.W.

In 1979, 349 or 44.3% of the total number of pilgrims were males and 438 or 55.7% were females. 60 of the males were below 50 years of age and 289 were above 50 years.

The pilgrims went on scheduled flights which involved two stop-overs in Bangkok and Amman in Jordan during the journey. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, in response to the pilgrims' suggestions for direct flights without stop-overs, MUIS negotiated with ALIA - The Royal Jordanian Airline - to fly the pilgrims direct to Jeddah and back. The majority of the pilgrims registered with MUIS went in two chartered flights. They each paid $2,250 for their return air fare. The remaining 191 pilgrims were insufficient to make up a third chartered flight and they went on the scheduled flight. They each paid $1,930 for their return air fare. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gross total payment which each pilgrim incurred was:- \n  <pre>\r\n                       $3,988 in 1979\r\n                       $4,300 in 1980\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, the gross payment for those pilgrims who went on the chartered flight was $4,650; and $4,330 for those who went on the scheduled flight. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) \n  <b>The number of deaths for each year</b> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 4 deaths in 1979; 14 in 1980 and 23 in 1981 among the pilgrims. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) \n  <b>The number of registered and unregistered pilgrim travel agents in Singapore</b> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period 1979 and 1981, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board licensed two travel agents specifically to deal with pilgrims going on the Haj. These two travel agents were sponsored by the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there were travel agents licensed by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board who also sold airline tickets and made other arrangements for the pilgrims going on the Haj. These travel agents were not sponsored by MUIS and I regret that I am unable to say how many such travel agents there were. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) \n  <b>Main problems encountered by the pilgrims</b> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems encountered by pilgrims in any Haj season are many and varied in nature. Some of these problems are unavoidable in view of the millions of pilgrims gathered in the holy cities in Saudi Arabia during Haj. However, wherever possible, MUIS will try its best to find solutions to problems affecting Singapore pilgrims which are within its capacity and capabilities to resolve. Problems like:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) poor services rendered by some of the local \"syehs\" or pilgrim brokers there; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) overcrowding in some of the lodging houses; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) location of lodging houses vis-a-vis the Haram Mosque in Makkah and Nabawi Mosque \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Medina; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) shortage of medical and nursing personnel, will be looked into by MUIS. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. On accommodation, MUIS will be arranging with some \"syehs\" or pilgrim brokers in Makkah to accommodate future pilgrims travelling with MUIS in two lodging houses at the most, instead of in several as in the past. Each lodging house will have its medical team to look after the pilgrims. In addition to this, MUIS will also try to obtain a place for use as a medical centre for pilgrims during their short sojourn in Mina. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 1982 pilgrimage, MUIS hopes to recruit two doctors and six nursing officers to look after pilgrims. Additionally, two MUIS officials will also accompany the pilgrims to render general assistance to them during the Haj season. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    Appendix III \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>GOVERNMENT PENSIONERS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Finance (i) the number of persons receiving government pension stating their frequency distribution by age group and the total amount of the pensions; and (ii) the projected number of additional pensioners and total amount of additional pensions as at 31st December, 1986. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The number of pensioners by age group and the total amount of their pensions on 30th November, 1981 are as follows:- \n  <pre>\r\n  Distribution by        No. of        Gross Monthly\r\n    age group          Pensioners         Pension\r\n\r\n50 years &amp; below          1,043         $ 250,980.82\r\n51 - 55 years             1,769           401,965.35\r\n56 - 60 years             2,701           849,909.61\r\n61 - 65 years             1,883           514,003.77\r\n66 - 70 years             1,255           313,595.12\r\nAbove 70 years            1,555           321,572.71\r\n                         ______       ______________\r\n                         10,206       $ 2,652,027.38\r\n                         ______       ______________\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projected number of additional pensioners on 31st December, 1986 is 1,516. The actual number is likely to be lower because some may leave government service before then on dismissal, resignation or death. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of additional pensions to be paid on 31st December, 1986 is extremely difficult to estimate because it depends on a number of variables and the values of these variables will not be known until then. The amount of pension is based on the length of service and the salary of the pensioner at the time of his retirement. If an officer is granted no-pay leave, his length of service is reduced by the period of such leave. If he is promoted, his pay will of course increase. Similarly, annual increments and salary revisions will push up salaries. To complicate matters further, some officers may have reached the maximum of their salary scales before they retire and in their case, a straight-line projection of their income up to the time of their retirement would result in an over-estimation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, perhaps a statistical projection based on past expenditure is the most practical alternative. Based on pensions paid out in Financial Years 1976-80 and 8 months of the current Financial Year, the projected amount of pensions for FY 1986 is $20,615,513.60.  \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
