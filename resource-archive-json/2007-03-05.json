That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates by reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have heard the term \"Goldilocks Economy\" used to describe the Singapore economy.&nbsp; The \"Goldilocks Economy\" term is used to describe when things are just right.&nbsp; Indeed, in Singapore, after&nbsp;the tough few years, last year has been&nbsp;good for the economy and the outlook looks good.&nbsp; Most sectors of the economy are doing well and the outlook remains good for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; But external factors can quickly change the <I>status quo</I> and&nbsp;just right things can become too hot or too cold for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such times we should not get complacent but instead should take the opportunity to position the economy for future growth and also to prepare to weather any storms that we might face.&nbsp; Let me ask the Minister to share with the House on what future growth drivers we will develop for the economy.&nbsp; Specifically, after the biomedical sector and the&nbsp;Integrated Resorts, what will the next couple of areas we can seek opportunities in to become the major growth drivers for the future economy?&nbsp; What new engines do we plan to develop for Singapore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we focus on new engines of growth, it is obvious that&nbsp;there is now an urgent need for us to nurture a new breed of innovation and technology-focused start-ups capable of very high growth and of becoming&nbsp;Singapore's own multi-nationals&nbsp;of the future.&nbsp; As more foreign MNCs exit Singapore, our best bet is to grow our own base of such companies.&nbsp; It will take a whole new approach for us to identify and support such companies quite different from the past approach of focusing on the already successful SMEs and to help them grow further.&nbsp; It will require a combination of incentives, ecosystem and support which can incubate and grow such companies rapidly, including the adoption of latest technologies and also in helping them globalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do have two concerns which I want to raise for the Minister to comment on.&nbsp; First, the emergence of the dual economy and our strategy to address it.&nbsp; While there will always be weak sectors of any economy,&nbsp; I think the divide is not just among different industries but between big and small companies too.&nbsp; Is the Minister watching this dual economy development?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second issue is on cost competitiveness which is not a major issue right&nbsp;now but which can very quickly become an issue if you are not watching it.&nbsp; As I mentioned during the Budget debate speech, we had in the past allowed our economy to become uncompetitive as a result of cost increases which resulted in the formation of special committees from time&nbsp;to time to address cost competitiveness.&nbsp; This time, I hope that we do not&nbsp;get in the same mode but try to avoid major cost increases. And I talked about the triple whammy of cost increases we have seen -&nbsp;rentals going up, wages going up&nbsp;and also the input costs, including fees and charges from Government, that have gone up recently.&nbsp; Perhaps, the Minister can share with the House the measures his Ministry will be taking to avoid getting into another cost uncompetitiveness situation.&nbsp; Specifically, can the Minister reconsider its strategy&nbsp;to allow&nbsp;JTC&nbsp;to divest its assets?&nbsp; I will not want to repeat what I said during the Budget speech but needless to say that, if JTC divests its assets in the industrial property sector, this will price some of the industrial land beyond the reach of some of the companies that could still operate out of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, I would like the Minister to comment on the effectiveness of the Competition Act or has it been mainly a white elephant.&nbsp; We still have cartel-like behaviour in certain industries, like the oil companies,&nbsp;taxi companies as well as the energy sector, where I have heard about one example of how a new entrant in the electricity generation sector is facing a lot of problems because of the uncompetitive behaviour of the incumbent big players in the energy sector.&nbsp; In fact, this energy player is facing problems from the gas sector too which is not being liberalised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Minister can share with us how the Competition Act is working in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I agree that the best way to help all Singaporeans in good times&nbsp;and bad times is to&nbsp;build a strong economy and build it on a sustainable basis.&nbsp; We continue to be attractive to MNCs and global financial institutions.&nbsp; Our communication infrastructure, IP protection, rule of law, competitive tax regime and comfortable living environment for the&nbsp;expatriate staff will continue to give us an edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the many new measures announced in the Budget Statement, such as increasing partial tax exemption, tax exemption on chargeable income, will benefit SMEs and start-ups.&nbsp; I urge the Government to continue to promote all local enterprises, including SMEs and start-ups, and not to slow down the momentum as our economy improves.&nbsp; As we diversify our economy, SMEs and start-ups will continue to provide jobs and contribute to the development in many ways.&nbsp; Local enterprises are also more likely to stay rooted in Singapore and even if they were to expand all over the region and the&nbsp;world, they are likely to keep their HQ status in Singapore and repatriate their profits back home and pay Singapore taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also support the Government's&nbsp;intention to invest 3% of our GDP in R&amp;D.&nbsp; This, I think, is a very good signal and it will in time create new companies once the products and services are commercialised.&nbsp; I hope that our agencies can revisit some of these opportunities in the region because SMEs in Europe like Germany and Italy are interested to use Singapore as a springboard into China and India.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our MNCs, on the other hand, have benefited from Government funding to encourage them to do R&amp;D in Singapore.&nbsp; I am concerned that the new technology plan managed by the NRF may again not effectively reach out to our local enterprises.&nbsp; Sir, MTI needs to rethink how it plans to deploy the R&amp;D funds as past approaches did not fully achieve their objective for local companies and, therefore, today, we have very few local innovative, technology and high growth companies which arose out of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me point to the ongoing debate about how successful our biomedical strategy has been.&nbsp; On the surface, it seems&nbsp;to have worked and I think it did work exactly the way the strategy of attracting and growing foreign MNCs worked for many years through EDB's strategies.&nbsp; EDB's strategy for MNCs was to give them a whole lot of tax incentives and MNCs also got cheap land rentals, almost at negligible cost in many cases, plus a whole lot of other facilitation by Government agencies.&nbsp; If we look at the way the biomedical strategy has worked, it has been exactly the way the MNC's strategy was put together.&nbsp; We had lots of funding, lots of incentive and therefore we attracted many global researchers who did research in the way that they wanted and not necessarily the way it could have benefited the Singapore economy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my worry is that the strategy seems to have ignored the local companies and expertise.&nbsp; We should have additionally focused on building local capabilities at the high end as well as supporting companies at the lower end.&nbsp; A case in point&nbsp;about supporting industries,&nbsp;I was told, is that there is a lack of some ancillary services in the biomedical sector. Specifically, the lack of gamma-sterilisation facilities in Singapore meant that our companies are sending such work to Malaysia to get it done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope that the new R&amp;D strategy&nbsp;of the Government will not forget local enterprises&nbsp;and go&nbsp;the way that MNC strategies have worked in the past.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Promoting Local Enterprises Overseas</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast):</B> Sir, the Ministry and IE Singapore have good initiatives to promote internationalisation and growth for local enterprises.&nbsp; In 2006, the internationalisation efforts included organising and supporting a hundred over trade missions and incoming missions as well as facilitation of alliances to help local enterprises exploit overseas market opportunities.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the&nbsp;Ministry how successful have&nbsp;these programmes been in the growth of our local enterprises overseas?&nbsp; How&nbsp;much business have the local enterprises been able to secure?&nbsp; What is the Ministry's assessment of the success of these programmes and what have been the challenges?&nbsp; Have these efforts been coordinated in supporting our local enterprises?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related matter, on participation in larger projects overseas, has there been success in the Singapore consortium approach and has this enabled our SMEs that have good skills but lack business development capabilities grow and penetrate overseas markets and participate in these large deals?&nbsp; As someone said to me recently,&nbsp;a dwarf standing from the shoulders of a giant may see further than the giant himself.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Loo Choon Yong:</B> Sir, regionalisation is important to our economy, even as we continue to attract foreign MNCs and global financial institutions and move from a population of 4.5 million to perhaps 6.5 million. By and large, our&nbsp;agencies, such as EDB, IE Singapore, SPRING and even ACE, have done well in helping local enterprises, in particular and start-ups.&nbsp; We have done many right things, provide incentives, organise overseas business trips, conduct forums and organise business matching sessions.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACE, over the last four or&nbsp;five years, has managed to help shift the mindset of Singaporeans and also added to the debt of financing available to new start-ups.&nbsp;Now, given that many other governments are actually actively involved in helping their companies penetrate overseas markets, some even engage in more direct activities, such as negotiating deals, then we should do more for our enterprises.&nbsp; SMEs and start-ups need more assistance than&nbsp; big companies that can help and fend for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest that some of our big companies and TLCs have actually been quite successful in regionalising the companies.&nbsp; You go to China and India and you will see quite a few of Singapore companies have established themselves in various fields&nbsp;- property development, estate development and manufacturing.&nbsp; The question really is: is it possible for the Government to encourage both TLCs and local companies to give smaller Singapore companies a chance to quote for the goods and services when they want to procure them?&nbsp; And obviously, not just moral suasion, but whether there could&nbsp;indeed be some tax incentives given at home when they actually give these contracts to Singapore companies.&nbsp; I understand Japan, Korea and, to some extent, the Taiwanese government&nbsp;do this to help their companies go overseas.&nbsp; A company,&nbsp;I know, that does this is&nbsp;Keppel Land and it actively encourages &nbsp;its consultants and sub-contractors to go with them to new markets - Shanghai, Beijing - as they develop these properties.&nbsp; And I think it has worked well for small companies because this is the first time that they have a chance to break into these foreign markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point that I would like to bring up - that I have no time earlier on to talk about - is that we notice in some established countries - Germany, Italy - there are many, many SMEs which are bigger than our SMEs in Singapore.&nbsp; I think they are beginning to be more interested in Asia because of the growth of the Chinese and Indian markets.&nbsp; I think there is a great opportunity to revisit some of these countries and try and see if they will use Singapore as a springboard to India and China. They could perhaps team up with our SMEs.&nbsp; They have the technology.&nbsp; Our SMEs and&nbsp;local companies have got people in place, knowledge of the terrain and connections with the people in these countries.&nbsp; I hope this will happen and it will enable SMEs to regionalise even further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I think&nbsp;SMEs are all waiting anxiously for Mr Philip Yeo to take over the chair as Chairman of SPRING.&nbsp; With his immense wealth of experience and boundless energy and vision, I think SMEs and local enterprises would benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Entrepreneurship</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, in the recent ACE's Finance Action Crucible study trip to Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong, we observed that governments in the various economies took on SME financing as a developmental role.&nbsp; Hence, they did not expect any monetary profits from the financing that they provided to enterprises.&nbsp; My question is: should Singapore not adopt the same approach?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our current Government-supported financing scheme, MOF has set a requirement that the agency administering will have to return to MOF a certain return over and above the cost of borrowing.&nbsp; In other words, SPRING and other agencies administering&nbsp;such schemes are required to make money for the Government.&nbsp; For the countries we visited, we noted that all ended up writing&nbsp;off a significant portion of the funds provided to support SMEs every year.&nbsp; While I do not have the exact data, my projection based on information I got from a couple of banks showed that, in Singapore, SME lending as a proportion of total lending is a mere 2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the Asian economies that we visited, the evidence is that the number is closer to between 20%&nbsp;and 25% of the total lending going to SMEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that if we just make a simple adjustment where SPRING and the other agencies just have to break even for the funds provided, not make money, I think we would be able to reach out to many more companies and service those that are deserving and increase our percentage from 2% to a much better number.&nbsp; This profit making requirement should be eliminated because really this should be a developmental role and we can then service many more companies which can benefit from the growth of the economy here in Singapore.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> First, let me thank Members for their very insightful comments and suggestions.&nbsp; Members have rightly pointed out that our key challenge is really how Singapore should position itself, invest in our future and grow the economy.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we start from a very strong position. &nbsp;The Singapore economy is in good shape.&nbsp; It grew by a robust 7.9% last year, with growth permeating all sectors.&nbsp; More than 173,000 jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell to 2.7%.&nbsp; The average household income, among employed households, grew by 4.3% last year&nbsp;with income per household member showing gains across all deciles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current strong position is due to our restructuring efforts over the years.&nbsp; We cut our income taxes; we recalibrated our cost structures and we increased wage flexibility.&nbsp; We also diversified our economic base by growing new industries and expanding into new markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economy now has more growth engines, compared to five years ago.&nbsp; This gives us greater cushion against business cycle fluctuations of the individual sectors.&nbsp; For example, the strong performance of the biomedical and transport engineering sectors in recent years has helped to compensate for the slower growth in chemical and construction sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one of the most open economy in the world, and that has served us well.&nbsp; Trade grew by 13% last year and is projected to grow by between 8% and 10% this year.&nbsp; Our international trade linkages have never been stronger.&nbsp; Since we embark on&nbsp;the first Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 2000, we have concluded 11 such agreements and are in active negotiations for 10 more.&nbsp; Our FTAs have helped our companies achieve tariff savings of over $470 million in 2006 alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The global economic growth however is expected to be slower&nbsp;but, overall, the external environment is still positive.&nbsp; Domestically, consumption is likely to strengthen, while investments will remain firm. We expect inflation to remain in check, even with the impending GST increase in July. Barring unforeseen setbacks, we should continue to see another year of robust growth of between 4.5%&nbsp;and 6.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members pointed out, we should ride on this current growth momentum and seize this opportunity to further strengthen our competitiveness.&nbsp; While we are enjoying the low hanging fruits of our earlier restructuring efforts, we need to press on with&nbsp;the more difficult areas which will take time to transform.&nbsp; Three areas we need to concentrate on: first,&nbsp;rejuvenate existing sectors and grow new ones;&nbsp;second, build up our innovation capacity; and, third, develop our enterprises and help them to venture overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out, we need new growth engines. Today, we have a broadly diversified economy.&nbsp; If we can strengthen and nurture more sectors, we will have more engines of growth and be more resilient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen successes in rejuvenating the marine sector, for example.&nbsp; In the marine and offshore sector, they have reinvented themselves to become major global players in ship conversions and rig-building.&nbsp; Our recent investment successes in the electronics and chemical sectors will provide the growth momentum in these sectors in the next cycle.&nbsp; Tourism is another sector that we are remaking.&nbsp; MOS Iswaran will elaborate on the promising results so far, and what more we are doing beyond the first two Integrated Resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the existing clusters, we are also making good progress in growing new clusters, such as education, healthcare, water and environmental technology, interactive and digital media as well as alternative energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biomedical sciences, or BMS, sector is another new sector that we started developing in 2000.&nbsp; It has since enjoyed phenomenal growth and now accounts for almost 7% of the GDP and 10,600 high value-added jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh raised two main points about BMS strategy, first, whether our MNC-approach has left our local enterprises out and, second, whether we should sharpen the focus of our strategy.&nbsp; Let me first elaborate on our approach to developing the BMS sector.&nbsp; For knowledge-intensive industry like the BMS, talent and knowledge are the keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in our first phase, we focus on establishing a firm foundation in basic biomedical research in Singapore, even as we attracted big pharmaceutical companies to set up plants here. We established our research institutes to develop the BMS capabilities as well as build up a&nbsp;pool of research talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that, apart from attracting MNCs, we also need to focus on building up local capabilities and supporting industries.&nbsp; I fully agree.&nbsp; A-Bio, our first biologics contract manufacturer, and MerLion Pharmaceuticals, a drug discovery company, are examples of local companies built up from our capability development efforts.&nbsp;We hope to nurture more such firms.&nbsp; On the biopharmaceuticals front, we have attracted a number of supporting services for R&amp;D and manufacturing.&nbsp; We are also building up the local supplier base for medical technology. Specifically, on the gamma-sterilisation facility that Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out, this is indeed presently lacking in Singapore. And EDB is working actively to address it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh's second point is that we should sharpen the focus of our biomedical strategy on niche areas, instead of just letting foreign researchers do what they want in Singapore.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; Let me explain our R&amp;D strategy.&nbsp; First of all, we have decided to increase our National R&amp;D expenditure to 3% of GDP.&nbsp; I thank Dr Loo Choon Yong for supporting such a strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;By world standards, 3% of GDP is not very large, particularly when we consider the size of our GDP.&nbsp; Second, two-thirds of that expenditure would, in fact,&nbsp;be&nbsp;from the private sector.&nbsp; Hence, Government expenditure is only 1% of GDP.&nbsp; Third, Government expenditure has to be apportioned to the BMS sector as well as&nbsp;the non-BMS sectors.&nbsp; In the non-BMS sectors, for example,&nbsp;we are very clear&nbsp;of our mission&nbsp;- to support and expand the existing sectors and grow new sectors, as I outlined just now.&nbsp; Fourth, with the limited funds available, therefore, we have to concentrate and we have to focus on niche areas.&nbsp; And this is indeed what we have been doing.&nbsp; We have recruited foreign scientists based on the strength that Singapore wants to&nbsp;compete on and develop, and also on how the foreign scientists&nbsp;can help train and nurture our local talent.&nbsp; Furthermore, A*STAR does not work alone. In cancer research, for example, it collaborates with other leading research institutions, such as Sweden's Karolinska Institute. Our capabilities are well recognised internationally, due to the critical mass of excellent research talent that we have managed to attract internationally. At the same time, we are developing a healthy pipeline of our local researchers. A*STAR has so far awarded close to 400 scholarships in the field of BMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must recognise that&nbsp;BMS is a long-term investment. We are only&nbsp;five years into it. We have laid a strong foundation in the first phase. In the next phase, we will add a new focus to develop translational and clinical research capabilities. This will bring discoveries from the 'bench' to the 'bedside'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our BMS strategies are in the right direction, but we will continue to fine-tune them as we gain more experience.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will also continue to tap on our international scientific advisory boards as well as eminent local and foreign experts to guide us in our effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thrust of our development strategy is to build innovation capacity.&nbsp; For Singapore to remain competitive in the longer term, we need to become a knowledge-based economy thriving on creativity and innovation.&nbsp; R&amp;D is a major effort and we are undertaking to support this transition into a knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that the transition to a knowledge-based economy cannot be limited to just the MNCs located here but also has to occur among our SMEs as well.&nbsp; We should indeed help our local companies to develop and exploit technology.&nbsp; Recognising that local enterprises often need help to undertake R&amp;D, we have indeed developed various programmes to provide them technical manpower and funding assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the National Research Foundation (NRF) plans to allocate $250 million for initiatives that will benefit our local SMEs, particularly technology start-up companies.&nbsp; NRF is working with MTI and its agencies to develop these specific programmes.&nbsp; MOS Lee Yi Shyan will provide the details later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third thrust is really to develop our enterprises, particularly in helping them compete overseas.&nbsp; Financing is a problem faced by many SMEs.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh mentioned that Government agencies are required to make a return on SME loan and investment schemes.&nbsp; He asked whether Singapore could adopt a developmental approach towards financing SMEs, whereby losses incurred by the Government from these schemes are regarded as investments in our economy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me assure Members that the Government does not expect to profit from our SME financing schemes.&nbsp; However, the cost of capital is charged to ensure financial discipline so that funds are deployed efficiently on worthy projects.&nbsp; But it does not mean that our schemes are not developmental in their approach.&nbsp; For example, for most loan schemes, the Government shares 50% of the loan default risks and sets aside a grant to cover the potential losses.&nbsp;We have even gone up to 70% on selected schemes.&nbsp; The grant is not expected to be recovered.&nbsp; For equity financing schemes, such as SEEDS, the Government's expected return is only 5%, far below the threshold for private equity funds.&nbsp; But I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that we should fine-tune our financing schemes to be more efficient in reaching out to the various companies, and I welcome his suggestions.&nbsp; SPRING will work closely with ACE on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our companies grow, they must also go beyond our shores to take advantage of the enormous business opportunities elsewhere.&nbsp;Ms Jessica Tan and Dr Loo Choon Yong asked about the Government's initiatives in leading overseas business initiatives.&nbsp; The Government's approach in helping Singapore companies internationalise focuses on three aspects, ie, competency, capital and connections.&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan asked about the success of these efforts.&nbsp; Let me quickly update Members on our results over the past year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE Singapore's grants for capability development are expected to help companies generate almost $2.9 billion in incremental&nbsp;sales over the next three years.&nbsp; Our financing schemes capitalise $220 million worth of loans and help our enterprises insure almost $900 million in assets.&nbsp; Our various trade missions and fairs are expected to generate almost $1.7 billion of overseas sales.&nbsp; We agree with Dr Loo Choon Yong that our smaller enterprises need more help than their larger counterparts.&nbsp; That is why, when we design our schemes, we factor in the size of the enterprises.&nbsp; For example, the Trade Credit Insurance Programme pools the demand from the smaller enterprises so that they can gain access to attractive premium rates normally available only to larger companies.&nbsp; Our Internationalisation Finance Scheme is only open to companies whose turnover is $200 million or below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, even as we push on with growing our other sectors and building our innovation capacity and developing our enterprises, we must ensure that we remain cost competitive,&nbsp;as Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out.&nbsp; Let me address a few key issues which concern us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the manpower issues.&nbsp; Our labour market is tight and wages are rising.&nbsp; A strong pipeline of jobs is coming onstream in the next few years, on top of a buoyant employment market.&nbsp; For example, the marine industry will need at least 15,000 additional workers by the end of this year.&nbsp; To support the construction of major projects, the process supporting industry will create some 10,000 supervisory jobs from 2007 to 2009.&nbsp; Another area is the tourism industry where the two IRs will each create about 30,000 jobs economy-wide when fully operational.&nbsp; To cope with the rising demand, we will train as many Singaporeans as possible to take up the new jobs created, especially the better-paying ones.&nbsp; But we foresee that there will still be a shortage of workers, in particular, for the semi-skilled jobs that Singaporeans are not attracted to.&nbsp; We are working closely with the Ministry of Manpower to see how we can ease the tight labour supply.&nbsp; The Minister for Manpower will elaborate on this in&nbsp;the Committee of Supply debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is the issue of rentals.&nbsp; Our industrial rentals have come down very significantly since the late 1990s.&nbsp; The rental indices for JTC's standard factories and flatted factories are approximately 50% and 45% below their respective levels just before the Asian financial crisis.&nbsp; The Government will continue to be responsive in making available land through the Government land sales programme to meet the demand of our industrialists.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh is concerned about the upcoming divestment of JTC's properties and how this may push up rentals.&nbsp; JTC understands his concern.&nbsp; I had addressed this earlier last week in response to a question.&nbsp; To minimise the risk of unwarranted rental hikes, JTC will proceed with the divestment process carefully, with the aim of fostering a competitive industrial market landscape, post the divestment.&nbsp; JTC will not be divesting its entire industrial portfolio to one owner but, instead, plans to divest some via a REIT and others via trade sale.&nbsp; This will introduce more players into the industrial space sector.&nbsp; Even for properties put into a REIT, the REIT manager cannot hike rentals above what the markets will bear.&nbsp; Otherwise, tenant retention will be a problem. &nbsp; The divestment process, in fact, should result in more choices and better properties and&nbsp;services for tenants, as landlords try to maintain their competitive position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, in summary, our economic prospects are bright.&nbsp; We will strengthen our growth sectors, upgrade our innovation capacity and extend more help to local enterprises while staying vigilant on costs.&nbsp; We are confident we can maintain our long-term competitiveness and sustain Singapore's economic growth.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Second Minister for Finance, in his Budget Speech, pointed out that only 25% of our companies derive half or more of their revenues from overseas.&nbsp; I presume they belong to this second group.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the last session of Parliament, the Minister for Trade and Industry gave us a good profile of SMEs today.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I could quote him: \"Today, we have some 133,000 SMEs in Singapore which make up 99% of all our enterprises.&nbsp; About 94% of our SMEs belong to the service and commerce industries, while the remaining 6% are in the manufacturing industry.&nbsp; SMEs contribute some 42% of our GDP and employ 56% of our workforce.\"&nbsp; By any measure, these are very large numbers.&nbsp; It underlines the important role that SMEs play in our economy.&nbsp; I should also add that 41% of respondents in last year's SME Development Survey said they did not generate any revenue from overseas.&nbsp; This may be an indication that our regionalisation drive, while successful in some ways, still has some way to go.&nbsp; These are just some of the development issues facing SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps is the Ministry taking to help local SMEs in management training, international marketing and overseas expansion?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in my speech during the Budget debate, I raised the issue of change management for PMETs.&nbsp; I would also argue that managers of SMEs, too, would benefit from this form of training to help them&nbsp;transition and venture beyond our local market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On other aspects of&nbsp;SME financing, during the parliamentary session in January, I raised the issue of the very low take-up rate of Government funding schemes for SMEs.&nbsp; Again, I quote the 2006 SME Development Survey which found that only 8% of SMEs surveyed took up the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme, only 4% took up the Micro Loan Programme and only 2% took advantage of&nbsp;SME Excess Loans.&nbsp; In his reply, the Minister said that the very fact that 8% of our SMEs took up the LEFS scheme, to him,&nbsp;is a very good sign.&nbsp; He cited the availability of funds and other avenues available for financing of SMEs.&nbsp; The SME Development Survey that I cited earlier also showed that 40% of SMEs surveyed depended on overdrafts for their short-term financing needs.&nbsp; This is a very costly option compared to other instruments and underlines the fact that SMEs were not able to avail themselves of other options, including Government financing schemes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I raise this issue again for the urgency that it represents.&nbsp; I strongly urge MTI to review the Government financing schemes available today and ascertain how they could be better accepted.&nbsp; What further corrective actions, including adequate promotion and marketing of the various Government financing schemes, will MTI be embarking on?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Maybe it is time.&nbsp; We are very glad that Mr Philip Yeo, a top-notch senior civil servant with a wealth of experience in EDB and A*STAR, has been appointed Chairman of SPRING Singapore.&nbsp; Will he be the Prince Charming who will lead the charge and transform the SMEs for the good of the country?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The SMEs, on the other hand, are feeling the going becoming tougher and tougher because of higher rental costs which, in some cases, have gone up by as much as double; higher staff costs as the bigger companies are hiring and can afford to pay higher salaries and, soon, higher CPF.&nbsp; It is a scenario of twin economy.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs, by their set-up, are enterprises with limited resources, both in terms of finance, manpower and even contacts.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp;SMEs find it very difficult to compete in the international marketplace and, at times, even on their own home soil where the bigger MNCs or GLCs muscle them off the field.&nbsp; In addition to that, very often, in order to have peace of mind and less justification to be made, the contract awarding Government agencies prefer to work with bigger foreign companies or GLCs instead of homegrown SMEs.&nbsp; At least, that is the impression that SMEs have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I would like to urge the Government, firstly, to promote and&nbsp;buy local services and products.&nbsp; Secondly, JTC and HDB should&nbsp;continue to provide affordable office and industrial space to mitigate sharp increases in rentals.&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to urge the Government to encourage GLCs to work together with the local SMEs when they venture abroad and to take SMEs as their extended departments.&nbsp;

SMEs in the USA, for example, have shown&nbsp;far higher growth rates than large corporations. They could teach our local SMEs a thing or two about doing business, either in our own home ground or in venturing overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, they may also pose a serious competitive threat to our own local SMEs.

If so, what can MTI do to improve our local SMEs' competitiveness?&nbsp; Ever since Singapore embarked on our industrialisation drive, we have attracted MNCs.&nbsp; Besides providing much needed necessary investments and employment, these MNCs have also returned significant value to the economy through establishing local linkages and supply chains with local SMEs.&nbsp; They have also helped them to improve capabilities, through training, knowledge, skills transfer, and other forms of capability development.&nbsp; Some MNCs have even taken a stake in some of our local SMEs.&nbsp; As a result, our SMEs have moved up the value chain, attracting new businesses from other MNCs and even expanding their operations overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has facilitated these linkages through schemes such as the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP).&nbsp; In short, these linkages have been a win-win for the SMEs as well as the MNCs.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if he sees any prospect of similar, mutually beneficial, linkages between these foreign SMEs and our local SMEs.&nbsp; Can foreign SMEs add value to their local counterparts?&nbsp; Could MTI pose as a condition to foreign SMEs that they 'adopt' local SMEs, either as suppliers or sub-contractors, and provide them the necessary support and industry linkages?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, according to MTI, there are 133,000 SMEs in Singapore which make up 99% of our enterprises.&nbsp; I would like to ask if MTI could provide a more granular&nbsp;definition of SMEs, by breaking down&nbsp;by criteria such as&nbsp;revenue base, size of workforce, etc, so as to enable the Government to provide more targeted assistance to companies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Resources and Opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, on behalf of the SMEs, I would like to start by thanking the Minister for the cheer and hope that they have brought to the SMEs in this Budget.&nbsp; In fact, I cannot wait to hear the details of the Government's plan to make Singapore the best place to start, grow and globalise businesses.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By nurturing SMEs today, the seeds for a bumper harvest for the economy as well as a better standard of living for our people are sowed.&nbsp; But what are some of our weak links? A recent SME development survey by DP Information Group revealed several ironies.&nbsp; I shall list three for our consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, cost efficiency, productivity and overseas expansion dominate the minds of SMEs in growing businesses.&nbsp; We know that technology can help improve productivity and lower costs.&nbsp; Yet, a third said that IT has no impact on their growth while only 9% of the SMEs see investments in new technology as a strategy to overcome competition.&nbsp; This suggests that many SMEs are still very low-tech.&nbsp; If <I>bak kwa</I> men and durian vendors have found ICT useful in their operations and distribution process, then we need to step up our efforts in driving the ICT adoption rate amongst our SMEs. We need, however, better designed integrated vertical and horizontal IT platforms to attract SMEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, the SMEs also listed the top hindrance to growth as competition and manpower issues.&nbsp; SMEs are unable to compete with the MNCs in attracting suitable and quality candidates. This will worsen with the tightening labour market.&nbsp; Yet, some 17% of SMEs are more concerned about their daily operations and have no concrete plan or direction for their businesses in the next two years. This suggests that short-term planning and, possibly, little or no investment in manpower training.&nbsp; A business is only as good as its people. Hence, I urge SPRING to seriously look into the manpower and professional needs of SMEs, and IE to play a more active role in helping SMEs' overseas operations manpower needs. Also, SMEs can benefit from more Government actions to help them establish business contacts overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third irony is on funding.&nbsp; Despite the <I>Straits Times</I> ' report that banks are rolling out red carpets to SMEs, funding remains a top obstacle.&nbsp; Currently, there are many Government-related schemes, but I think the devil is in the implementation.&nbsp; I hope the Minister can address this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing a demand floor in helping SMEs will improve their access as well.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Miss Low, you are breaching your time limit again.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Finally, what steps would the Government take to ensure that the local SMEs will be the chief beneficiary of this new support for SMEs?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Local Enterprise and Small and Medium Enterprise Support</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, based on a recent STEPS&nbsp;survey conducted by DP Information that Miss Penny Low talked about, it was noted that 67% of the start-ups had expressed their desire to enter the overseas market right from day one. In addition, the latest GEM survey also reflected that one&nbsp;of five businesses employs the latest technology. We currently do not have a satisfactory eco-system which can help companies which approach our Government agencies for Start-up, Technology and Internationalisation assistance.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, IE Singapore has done a good job in supporting companies already successful in Singapore to internationalise their operations or markets.&nbsp; IE is not set up to focus on start-ups and we cannot expect them to satisfactorily serve start-ups planning to internationlise because their needs are quite different compared to the needs of established companies.&nbsp; I feel that if&nbsp;we let one agency focus on local enterprise support from start-ups till the time they become our own MNCs, we will achieve better results. We can either merge the two agencies, IE Singapore and SPRING, to form a local enterprise champion, or have a rationalisation&nbsp;of roles with SPRING taking over&nbsp;certain roles plus resources from IE Singapore to help support start-ups to internationalise.&nbsp; This way, we will avoid the duplication of work, as I know&nbsp;SPRING has sometimes been&nbsp;asked by companies SPRING&nbsp;serves to help them tap overseas market opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the area of technology adoption in local companies, as I mentioned, I feel that EDB alone cannot effectively reach out to all our local enterprises. At present, some Government incentive schemes and promotion role for all&nbsp;enterprises including local enterprises reside in EDB.&nbsp; But EDB is primarily focused on bringing in FDIs as well as MNCs.&nbsp; It is time that SPRING, as a local enterprise&nbsp;agency,&nbsp;took over these roles of technology promotion, leaving EDB the main role that it is good at&nbsp;- bringing in foreign companies into Singapore.&nbsp;Sir, EDB cannot effectively serve local companies because&nbsp;I was told by someone in Government that EDB \"cannot use the same gun to fire at ants and elephants\".&nbsp; So, it chose to fire only at the elephants which are MNCs. So, we are kidding ourselves if we think that EDB can effectively serve both local enterprises and MNCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a very good case, therefore, for SPRING to become that local enterprise champion that can also assist start-ups in the area of internationalisation and technology adoption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp; in all, the real value that any Government agency can act in the coming years in supporting local enterprises is in the area of capability development. As I mentioned, &nbsp;this must be in the area of technology and innovation adoption. So I hope that MTI will bring greater focus in helping local companies become better in what they do, especially in the area of management expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in case some Government officers misunderstand what I am saying, let me say that both EDB and IE Singapore have done well in doing what they have been tasked to do. The issue is not that the people in the two agencies did a bad job.&nbsp; The issue is with the structure which the Government has set up and, therefore, local companies do not get the optimal support that they desire. And I was told that some IE Singapore officers were a bit unhappy with my comments that appeared in the <I>Today</I> paper saying that they did not do a good job.&nbsp; This is what I meant, that is, the structure is such that they cannot serve the smaller companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Dr Loo Choon Yong and Dr Ong Chit Chung have mentioned, I welcome Mr Philip&nbsp;Yeo in&nbsp;taking over the role of SPRING Chairman.&nbsp; I believe if he&nbsp;focuses, we will achieve the results that we desire for small and medium enterprises and to grow local enterprises into our MNCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING needs greater focus and we need a rationalisation of the roles in technology adoption and also in internationalisation, all in one place.&nbsp; I think we will be very successful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Consumer Protection</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</B> <I>(In Mandarin):</I>&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070305/20070305VS_144746.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act Working Committee has already submitted their work report to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. It highlighted the need to expand the scope of Fair Trading Act to deal with more unfair trade practices. In addition, it also proposes to place the financial services sector under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp; The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has earlier submitted a proposal to MTI to suggest the possibility of introducing what is commonly called the \"lemon law\". Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to reply at the earliest convenience with regard to the above proposal.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the Chairman of CASE, I would like to propose the introduction of a new law to protect the rights of all consumers, that is, the Timeshares Act. Such a law will be applicable for commercial practices including timeshare rentals, timeshare advertisement services or timeshare termination services, cancellation of timeshare contracts, timeshare sales, timeshare resales, buying timeshares, timeshare rentals, and/or to provide refund services for consumers with existing timeshare contracts or timeshare agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past few years, CASE has received continuous complaints against timeshare companies, and such complaints are becoming more and more. Usually, the timeshare companies will call up consumers and inform them that they have been selected and have won lucky draw prizes. But consumers will soon find out it is a timeshare scam and timeshare companies want to sell them thousands and thousands of dollars of timeshare packages. After making payment, consumers will then realise that the timeshare companies do not honour their promises. As these oral agreements are not put into the contract, consumers suffer heavy losses since they are not protected by the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to suggest that the proposed Timeshares Act include the following clauses:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;To prolong the cooling-off period to 10 working days. This recommendation is made with reference to the \"European Union Timeshare Guidelines\" and the Guiding Principles announced by the Malaysian Supervisory Committee.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;To forbid timeshare companies from receiving payments during the cooling-off period.&nbsp; The EU has already implemented this policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;To disclose the letter of intent to the public every six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;To appoint Small Claims Tribunal or Designated Court for court hearing of timeshare complaints.&nbsp; Currently, the Small Claims Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over any complaints arising out of timeshare agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;To revise the deadline given to enforce the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp;To ensure that the registered timeshare companies have a minimum paid-up capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp;To uncover the veil of timeshare companies so that restrictions can be imposed on the ownership. For example, the board of directors must be held responsible if the timeshare company goes into bankruptcy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8)&nbsp;To protect the confidentiality of personal consumer information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9)&nbsp;To fix the operation hours and code of business conduct and ethics for timeshare companies.&nbsp; The timeshare companies are not allowed to restrict consumers to stay for more than&nbsp;two hours in their office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the above proposed suggestions are for the Ministry's consideration.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 2823-2824.\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Chairman, first, let me declare my interest,&nbsp;before speaking on this cut, as a&nbsp;Committee Member of&nbsp; the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act has been in force since 1st March 2004.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;law meant to protect consumers from various unfair practices by suppliers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, after three years of operation of the law, there are some weaknesses in the consumer protection law that needs to be reviewed.&nbsp; Let me just highlight a few of them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Opt-out practices. Consumers are sometimes required to pay for unsolicited goods and services.&nbsp; In such cases, suppliers typically send goods or services to the consumers without their prior consent and then&nbsp;subsequently demand for payment. Sometimes, these goods and services are provided on free trial and when the trial period ends, the consumer is obligated to opt out from the arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Sir, this places the obligation on the consumer to opt out from an arrangement which he never requested for in the first place. Sometimes, the consumer forgets to opt out because the reminder came by way of an SMS which he has either accidentally deleted or overlooked.&nbsp; In the process, he is required to pay because of a moment of forgetfulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an instance, because this is not considered as an unfair practice under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act, the consumer has no recourse, even though he did not ask for the supply of services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, refund&nbsp;for/or replacement of defective goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are increasing incidents where suppliers refuse to refund/replace goods which remain&nbsp;defective despite multiple repair attempts even though these goods are still under&nbsp;warranty. This can be basic goods like mobile phones with defective software or even expensive products like vehicles. Again, the consumer here is not protected as there is presently no lemon law in Singapore that will oblige a supplier to exchange or replace a product which is defective, despite many attempts to repair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, third, in 2004, CASE received&nbsp;1,187 complaints against the financial industry for unfair and high pressure tactics in selling their financial products.&nbsp; In 2005, we have 1,021 complaints. Currently, contracts relating to financial investment and insurance matters are excluded from the&nbsp;CPFTA and this&nbsp;leaves little&nbsp;recourse to the consumer.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act&nbsp;Review Taskforce has been formed in July 2005.&nbsp;It has made several recommendations to MTI to amend the Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the&nbsp;Minister whether these amendments have been accepted, and&nbsp;if so, when&nbsp;will they be tabled in&nbsp;Parliament for discussion?&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister also whether he will consider having a lemon law to&nbsp;compel&nbsp;suppliers of defective products to replace them.&nbsp; I also would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider bringing financial services under the ambit of the Act.&nbsp; I also like to urge the&nbsp;Minister to consider having a Consumer Claims Tribunal of some sort to&nbsp;assist consumers. From the feedback given by consumers, they face difficulties at the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp; Sir, the Consumer Claims Tribunal will allow consumers the option of making their claims before&nbsp;specialist referees&nbsp;and without having to resort to costly&nbsp;litigation under the present legal assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan):</B> I thank Members for&nbsp;their comments on SMEs.&nbsp; Let me assure Members that we share their sentiments and passion on the importance of having a vibrant SME sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term \"SME\" has been used widely and loosely with good intention, to refer to a wide range of companies: sometimes start-ups, sometimes large companies by Singapore standard but small internationally.&nbsp; Different speakers may have different SMEs in mind when they expound SMEs' needs and how best they can be met.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it is useful to highlight SPRING Singapore's definition of SMEs as enterprises with $15 million or less in fixed asset investment and, for non-manufacturing enterprises, 200 or fewer employees.&nbsp; SPRING uses this to qualify companies for its programmes.&nbsp; This has served us well, but we agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo's suggestion to design even more targeted solutions based on more granular sub-classifications of SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this definition, 99% of establishments here are SMEs.&nbsp; SMEs form an important pillar of our economy, employing 56% of our workforce and contributing 42% of our GDP .&nbsp; They form a broad base from which new businesses and innovative ideas sprout, and tomorrow's multinationals emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, many of our SMEs are doing well here and internationally.&nbsp; Aeromobiles, for instance, has the largest market share for aircraft Hi-Lifts in the Middle East.&nbsp; Esco Micro is among the top laboratory equipment companies in the world, counting Pfizer International and Harvard University as its customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a group, the top 500 SMEs here have seen total turnover increase by 30% to $13.5 billion over the past five years, and net profits almost double to $630 million.&nbsp; For those in the domestic sector, the 20 retailers, including SMEs, who participated in the pilot phase of the Government's Customer Centric Initiative to improve service quality reported 8% improvement in service level, and expect sales to increase by $150 million.&nbsp; We applaud their achievements.&nbsp; The Government will continue to support their growth, and create a vibrant, dynamic and competitive base for SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh and Dr Ong Chit Chung suggested that we transform SPRING into a local enterprise champion that assists start-ups with internationalisation and technology through their growth stages.&nbsp; I also want to thank them for having identified the Prince Charming for the SMEs. I am pleased to inform them that SPRING thinks of herself as \"the champion of enterprise growth\" in many of her outreach programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the champion agency, SPRING recognises that enterprises' needs change as they grow.&nbsp; Broadly speaking, SPRING's assistance programmes for SMEs can be grouped under a 4-C framework, namely:</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Creating a Pro-Business Environment;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Capital&nbsp;- making it easily accessible;</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Capacity Building; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Connections&nbsp;- linking up with the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various programmes under this framework can be further classified into basic, intermediate and advanced levels, to meet enterprises&rsquo; needs at the start-up, growth and internationalisation phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While SPRING should not duplicate the role of other agencies, it endeavours to work with them as one government to help SMEs.&nbsp; For internationalisation, SPRING works closely with IE Singapore (IE).&nbsp; To help SMEs exploit technology, SPRING works with A*STAR.&nbsp; In this way, start-ups with internationalisation and technological needs can still get the necessary help through SPRING.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho, Miss Penny Low and Mr Singh asked about our plans for enhancing the competitiveness of local SMEs.&nbsp; Allow me to bring Members through our SME development efforts, under the 4-C framework:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we create a pro-business environment.&nbsp; To render Singapore attractive for small businesses and start-ups, we must continually simplify our business environment, cut red tape and lower barriers to entry by promoting fair competition.&nbsp; The Pro-Enterprise Panel, a public-private sector partnership, actively solicits suggestions to ensure our rules are pro-business.&nbsp; The EnterpriseOne web portal and Enterprise Development Centres (EDCs) provide one-stop services for businesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to note that the <I>World Bank Doing Business</I> reports consistently rank Singapore amongst the top three easiest places in the world to do business.&nbsp; Together with the recently announced Budget measures, we have one of the most pro-SME environments an entrepreneur can hope for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, capital.&nbsp; Access to financing has always been a concern for SMEs.&nbsp; We have been working with our financial institutions to address this.&nbsp; Since 2001, the Government has provided $40 million worth of equity financing for 170 start-ups, and extended $3.6 billion worth of loans to 14,000 SMEs.&nbsp; Our intent is to introduce more SME-focused solutions from the private sector.&nbsp; I was therefore heartened to see Philips Securities launch an Over-The-Counter (OTC) platform last year.&nbsp; So far, two companies have raised $5.7 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first worked with SMEs in year 2000, SME was not the focus of many banks.&nbsp; Today, almost every major local and foreign bank in Singapore has a SME Banking Group.&nbsp; Overall, start-ups and SMEs now have many more options and better access to funding, as these banks offer collateral-free loans, trade services, and investment banking facilities.&nbsp; A recent report by the Milken Institute ranked Singapore second best for businesses&rsquo; access to financing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho does not think that 8% of our SMEs taking up the LEFS scheme is a good sign.&nbsp; Should it be higher? &nbsp;How much higher?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our target should be that every bankable project from the SMEs should be able to find its financing, ideally from a number of offers, from an efficient financial market.&nbsp; We see the Government's role in financing as a catalyst, identifying and filling gaps not well served by the private sector.&nbsp; Over time though, financial institutions in the private sector should, through our policy encouragement, introduce more varied and specialised financial tools for our SMEs, continually enhancing Singapore's attractiveness as a SME hub, a hotbed for SMEs to start up and flourish.&nbsp; This is why we are reluctant to set up a SME Bank <I>per</I> <I>se</I>.&nbsp; Going forward, we will continue to work with the private sector, including the ACE Finance Action Crucible, to bring about even more market-based financing solutions for our SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, capacity building at enterprise and industry-level.&nbsp; Ms Low and Mr Singh are right in wanting to help SMEs exploit technology.&nbsp; This is necessary to grow enterprise in the knowledge economy, and to compete against lower-cost competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPRING launched the $150 million Technology Innovation Programme (TIP) last year to encourage SMEs to adopt technology innovation.&nbsp; TIP provides funding support for projects.&nbsp; It also allows technical experts to be seconded to SMEs, complementing an existing 'Growing Enterprises through Technology Upgrading', or GET-Up programme.&nbsp; Furthermore, under TIP, three Centres of Innovation are being set up for the Food, Marine and Environmental industries.&nbsp; As mentioned by my Minister, the NRF will also&nbsp;commit another $250 million to these efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked how we help SMEs with marketing.&nbsp; I agree that SMEs need to differentiate their offerings to succeed.&nbsp; A strong brand helps.&nbsp; Thus, we run the BrandPact programme to raise awareness and adoption of branding as a competitive strategy.&nbsp; So far, 2,700 companies have benefited from the workshops, and 90 have received project funding.&nbsp; PGS Design, for instance, which produces signages for customers, like Food Junction and Kopitiam, expects sales to double in 2007, after the BrandPact exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho and Mr Singh asked about management training.&nbsp; SPRING successfully piloted an 18-week Executive Management Programme with SMU last year.&nbsp; SPRING will soon release details for its new management development programme for SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the industry level, our agencies work through various channels to maximise our reach to SMEs.&nbsp; We believe that if our industry players work together, many industry-specific programmes can become feasible to substantially raise the capacity and competitiveness of the industry.&nbsp; Since 2005, more than $65 million has been committed by the Government and 14 industry associations under the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme.&nbsp; We expect 40,000 enterprises to potentially benefit from these initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of cooperation under the LEAD programme would be: the Container Depot Association of Singapore, the Singapore Transport Association and the Singapore Logistics Association, which came together to work with PSA to implement the Containerised Traffic System to improve turnaround time using GPS technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth thrust is facilitating market opportunities, issues which Mdm Ho and Ms Low raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help our local enterprises internationalise, IE provides a comprehensive suite of Government assistance, such as the Internationalisation Finance Scheme, which extends loans to enterprises venturing overseas. &nbsp;IE organises missions and trade fairs to bring Singapore enterprises to new markets.&nbsp; It also introduces foreign buyers to Singapore enterprises.&nbsp; In 2006, over 300 trade missions and fairs led to $1.7 billion of overseas sales for 3,500 companies. &nbsp;IE's outreach programmes helped 3,000 companies learn to exploit our FTAs, saving $470 million in tariffs last year.&nbsp; IE recognises that start-ups and small companies have different internationalisation needs from the larger companies.&nbsp; To cater to these companies, IE will launch a New Exporters Programme this year to help them through training workshops and expert advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address Ms Lee Bee Wah's suggestion that Government-linked companies, or GLCs, should help SMEs internationalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of our GLCs are public listed companies.&nbsp; They operate as independent commercial entities and are free to choose to partner with local or foreign companies in international ventures.&nbsp; We encourage like-minded companies, large and small, to work together for the many obvious benefits.&nbsp; This is a process not to be mandated, but evolved over time on mutual understanding and trust.&nbsp; I must say that, based on my personal observation, many of our companies are beginning to work as teams.&nbsp; In 2004, IE Singapore launched the iPartners Programme to bring our enterprises together to bid for overseas projects as consortiums.&nbsp; To date, 25 consortiums comprising 130 companies have been formed.&nbsp; Many GLCs are leading or participating in such consortiums.&nbsp; For example, the Security Consortium, led by ST Electronics, enabled three SMEs -&nbsp;Teleradio Engineering, Technologies Creation, and Arrowcrest Technologies -&nbsp;to clinch $8 million worth of security projects in the Middle East.&nbsp; Other non-GLC but large local companies are also leading smaller companies in consortiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho and Ms Low expressed concern for local SMEs against foreign competition.&nbsp; Let me explain our approach.&nbsp; Last year, we launched a five-year $4 billion Enterprise Development Fund (EDF) III.&nbsp; 99.5% of the 2006 funds actually went to local SMEs.&nbsp; We assure Members we will continue to direct our efforts to build local SMEs to become tomorrow's MNCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our SMEs operate in a globalised environment.&nbsp; Thus, shielding them from competition domestically will not help them as they internationalise.&nbsp; Foreign SMEs can help stimulate local enterprise development by bringing in new capabilities and market opportunities.&nbsp; One example is a Korean SME Colorzip which brought in ZapCode, which has already been adopted by the likes of Amazon.com and eBay, and creates new marketing possibilities for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign SMEs collectively employ 165,000 workers here&nbsp;and contribute to almost 20% of GDP. In fact, foreign SMEs only account for 9% of the entire 130,000 SMEs base in Singapore but they contribute almost as much as the local SMEs here.&nbsp; As we make our environment more pro-business, we can expect high quality foreign SMEs to move here.&nbsp; We should welcome them, but we will also study Mdm Ho's suggestion on ways to better foster collaboration between foreign and local SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are committed to building our SME sector as a key thrust in our economic development efforts.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am confident that by working together, we can achieve our vision of having a vibrant SME sector, thriving with globally competitive enterprises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move to the topic of consumer protection.&nbsp; I thank Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Lim Biow Chuan for their comments on the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp; Since the&nbsp;Fair Trading Act was implemented in 2004, the Consumers Association of Singapore has been actively raising awareness and helping consumers resolve issues covered by the Act. In 2006, CASE took up close to 600 Fair Trading Act&nbsp;related cases.&nbsp; Last year, a taskforce led by CASE and MTI completed a review of the Act, and has submitted its recommendations.&nbsp; Among the recommendations are proposals to enhance CPFTA, such as expanding its ambit to cover financial services, and tightening existing provisions on cooling-off periods.&nbsp; My Ministry has accepted all of the taskforce's eight recommendations and is now in the final stages of finalising the proposed regulatory changes for public consultation.&nbsp; We will do this over the next three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of &nbsp;\"Lemon Laws\" was also raised by the taskforce.&nbsp; These laws typically provide consumers with remedial rights for substantial defects in goods that persist after a reasonable period.&nbsp; Different countries have adopted different approaches with regard to the scope and extent of consumer rights to a refund or replacement.&nbsp; In the US, for example, lemon laws generally deal with specific product types and&nbsp; these allow the laws to cater specifically to the products of concern.&nbsp; The UK, on the other hand, strengthened its consumers' right to remedies through its generic Sale of Goods Act.&nbsp; Given the potentially extensive impact, this issue requires closer study and deliberation.&nbsp; We will do so with the various stakeholders' inputs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo proposed to introduce new legislation to regulate the timeshare industry.&nbsp; He also made some specific suggestions on what the legislation could cover.&nbsp; We appreciate his thoughtfulness.&nbsp; We believe that an industry or consumer-led accreditation system, such as CaseTrust, is a better approach to encourage fair practices in the timeshare industry, and provide a monitoring mechanism to ensure compliance.&nbsp; Conditions raised by Mr Yeo, such as those relating to operational hours and prospectus requirements are better dealt with by the&nbsp;industry or through a consumer body like CASE.&nbsp; Additional legislation may not be the best solution.&nbsp; For example, it&nbsp;would not be practical for the&nbsp;Government to legislate the number of hours a customer can spend at the premises of a timeshare company.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, we do not legislate so finely for any other industry at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding, we are prepared to review some of the specific suggestions to weigh in on good practices.&nbsp;For instance, the CPFTA today already makes provision for a cooling-off period for direct and timeshare sales.&nbsp; We would look into Mr Yeo's suggestions to further enhance the cooling-off provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to work closely with CASE to review and improve our consumer protection framework.&nbsp;We will do so while maintaining a good balance between regulatory action and consumer responsibility.&nbsp; Consumers must play their part, and be vigilant when making purchases.&nbsp; Ultimately, we believe that the best way to protect consumers is to ensure that they are well-educated about their rights and protect them with a balanced legal framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mr Singh asked&nbsp;about the effectiveness of the Competition Act.&nbsp; The Act has a short history, with the prohibitions against anti-competitive agreements and abuse of a dominant position only effective from 1st January 2006. The third and final prohibition against anti-competitive mergers will come into effect on 1st July this year.&nbsp; As the Act is still in its early days of implementation, it may be premature to say how effective it has been at this juncture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Member or the public has information to suggest that the oil or taxi companies are engaging in anti-competitive activities, I urge them to lodge a complaint to the CCS.&nbsp; The energy sector is excluded from the Competition Act, and under the purview of the Energy Market Authority.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh cited a generation company which is facing difficulties in its bid to enter the electricity generation market.&nbsp; Let me reiterate that my Ministry is committed to having a competitive gas market, to complement the electricity market which has been liberalised.&nbsp; We will ensure that all industry players, both the incumbents and new players, will have open access in the gas market.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tourism</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck):</B> Sir, for Singapore to be a buzzing and exciting first world city we need to explore different forms of events and entertainment and that should be internationally based.&nbsp; But if we are overly focused on&nbsp;ROIs, we may have missed out on great opportunities.&nbsp;Many a time, it is not the event itself but the pre and post event activities that will bring benefit and that may be hard to measure.&nbsp; I get shivers down my spine when proposals by people&nbsp;from the&nbsp;private sector get turned down or received a lukewarm response because the returns forecast do not meet the target set.&nbsp; We are not experts and should let them take the lead.&nbsp; If we keep repeating ourselves to ask the people to help themselves so that we can help them, let us&nbsp;show it by giving more support and let us&nbsp;not discourage them.&nbsp; If not, I feel we are going to miss another great opportunity like F1.&nbsp; Now that we have a second chance to give F1 a shot, would the Ministry update us on the progress of the F1 event to be held here?

With the upcoming integrated resorts and influx of tourists, the capacity to provide good services thus remains one big challenge for us.&nbsp; Besides Europe, America and Southeast Asia, there will be more tourists from China, India and the Middle East.&nbsp; Hence, it is important that we provide our visitors a wide range of tourism products and services. This will include ample tourist attractions, cultural and entertainment centres, shopping facilities, etc, to fulfill all their shopping needs and sightseeing needs.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of Singapore's upper market tourist attractions will be the integrated resorts; others include Orchard Road, Suntec City and Clarke Quay. These high end attractions provide them the opportunity to satisfy their tourism and shopping needs. However, there&nbsp;are also the middle class tourists, who have different shopping needs and habits, and sizeable purchasing power. It is thus a very wise decision for our Government to announce its plans to develop Little India. We will be able to attract more tourists from India and Sri Lanka.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that Geylang Serai is another area worth considering for development. The rich Malay culture and traditions of Geylang Serai are expected to attract tourists from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East. Its colorful architecture, shopping facilities and cultural performances will give a boost to our tourism industry. What is lacking now is a unique cultural attraction like Rose Garden in Thailand. While visiting Thailand, the tourists will definitely go to Rose Garden where they can catch Thailand's traditional cultural performances.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to suggest that the Government consider setting up a multi-cultural performing arts centre which will feature various cultural performances of the Chinese, Indian as well as the Malay communities.&nbsp; Such performances will include lion and dragon dance performances, highlights of a traditional Malay wedding ceremony, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told by many tourists that two of their&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;destinations are Sentosa and Geylang. Geylang offers a wide variety of tropical fruits at&nbsp;great prices, including durians, mangosteens and coconuts. These are popular fruits favoured by tourists from tropical countries. A great eatery area, Geylang has a lot of famous and good local food to offer. Apart from that, Geylang is best known for its bright and famous night life spots.&nbsp; It has attracted tourists from all around the world, and has become a popular tourist attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask the Government whether it has any development plans to redevelop the Geylang area, including Geylang Serai, to reconstruct and rebuild Geylang into a more charming and interesting district. This will help us to achieve our basic goal of strengthening tourism as a key pillar and, at the same time, to reach our targets of 17 million tourists and the corresponding tourist spendings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 2825-2826.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Singapore is a small country with limited historical or natural attractions and therefore we need to create and develop our own tourism appeal. To help boost the sector, the Government decided to go ahead with the&nbsp;two IRs with casinos.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the gaming component has done the trick. STB received quality bids from world renowned names in resort development and&nbsp;gaming. And, in one stroke, we will soon see an iconic building at the Marina Bay and Universal Studio at Sentosa. Without the casino component, it would be very difficult to draw in such mega investments.&nbsp;But we still need more of such \"wow\" and bold attractions to make Singapore a more compelling destination , attracting the non-gaming tourists as well. How would the Ministry intend to attract other major tourism investments into Singapore without the gaming component? Would the Ministry consider sweetening existing incentive schemes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few years back, I read in the&nbsp;<I>Straits Times</I> that the Singapore Flyer project was delayed because of financing difficulties. Is STB prepared to take a more catalytic role, in not only assisting in the financing of such projects but perhaps to also participate as a co-investor? And is our high cost of land working against the viability of these projects?&nbsp;Often, our hot and humid weather is cited as a drawback to attract repeat visitors to Singapore. What more can we do to mitigate our shortcomings? Should we explore more mega indoor attractions that are also children-centric, something like the Hello Kitty Land in Tokyo?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Government announced about one year ago that the Crazy Horse is coming to Singapore, it signals to the world that Singapore is a vibrant global city with buzz and we do have premium night entertainment for the niche segment of our visitors. The news of Crazy Horse coming to Singapore was quite well reported by world media. I remember reading about it in the <I>Financial Times</I>.&nbsp; However, little more than a year later, after making its Asian debut, the famous Crazy Horse, which has been running for more than 50 years in Paris, closed its doors in Singapore due to poor attendance. According to the company, the 400-seat theatre was less than half filled on most nights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what went wrong&nbsp;with Crazy Horse? Not that I am crazy about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Baey, I have not watched the show as well.&nbsp; Is it a case of tight advertisement controls?&nbsp; I thinkthe House had heard replies from SMOS Balaji last week.&nbsp; But my point today is: do we have an effective cross-selling system to cross sell our tourism products, such as Crazy Horse, among our tourism stakeholders? Tourist arrivals hit 9.7 million tourists last year. If we have, say, about 1&nbsp;% of these 9.7 million tourists visited the theatre, the company may not have to close its door prematurely. So, are our hotel concierges or the tour agents, or even the taxi drivers, aware of our tourism products and what to recommend to visitors?&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang mentioned about the attractions of Geylang. &nbsp;I think there are other&nbsp;attractions that we can also offer. We can&nbsp; do more to encourage cross-selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point is whether we have done enough to nurture the industry&rsquo;s local players . With the&nbsp;two IRs, local players are beginning to feel the cost pressure from the tight labour market.&nbsp; Headcount turnover is expected to increase and wages are set to rise further.&nbsp; Local operators fear that they are not able to match the high salaries offered by the IRs because they do not have the casino component in their business models.&nbsp;I understand that in Hong Kong, the government actually helps their local players cope with the entry of Disneyland into the markets with tangible assistance schemes. Can we do more to help our local players?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last point is this. We have been pretty successful in bringing major conventions to Singapore.&nbsp; How about sports events, like the&nbsp;F1 or A1, that Mr Teo Ser Luck has mentioned as well?&nbsp; Can the Ministry give an update on that?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, coincidentally my point augments Mr Liang's argument.&nbsp; After only one year of operations, the Crazy Horse cabaret show in Singapore has ended.&nbsp; There has been much discussion about the reasons for its failure here, considering its successful track record in Paris and Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The franchisee insisted that it was due to&nbsp;advertising restrictions.

I remember there was a device called Pay-As-You-Use meter introduced some years ago.&nbsp; Households on the scheme get a &ldquo;smart-key&rdquo;, like a cashcard, which can be topped up to a maximum of $250.&nbsp; At every top-up, 20% of the amount goes to paying for the arrears, while the rest is stored onto the key to pay for future bills. In July 2005, there were 1,000 such meters installed.&nbsp; In October 2006, there were 12,500 meters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this Pay-As-You-Use meter, in one stroke, the number of people with utilities arrears has come down dramatically.&nbsp; And the power company has an effective way to recover the utilities arrears with each top-up by the users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is this meter really effective in helping poor families to reduce their arrears, or improve their financial status?&nbsp; I am afraid the answer is probably, no.&nbsp; Because even when the household has only $1 in his meter and he still owes a few hundred dollars&nbsp;in arrears, his name will not appear on the arrears list.&nbsp; So, my point is that the real arrears cases are probably &ldquo;masked&rdquo; by the Pay-As-You-Use meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have no intention to criticise the power company for its creativity in collecting bad debts.&nbsp; On the contrary, I think they deserve the credit for doing their job well.&nbsp; They earn their keep.&nbsp; However, I believe we should go beyond the Pay-As-You-Use meter to really address the root cause of the arrears problem.&nbsp; The most effective way is for the households to consume the energy prudently.&nbsp; During my house-to-house visits, whenever residents have complained about high utilities bills, I would always ask the Town Council officers to check their electrical appliances and consumption pattern, and advise them how to save energy consumption and reduce utilities bills through some simple steps, and I have found this approach to be useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister, besides using the Pay-As-You-Use meter to reduce the statistics of arrears cases, whether his Ministry will consider stepping up other measures to educate and incentivise Singaporeans, especially low-income families, to reduce their energy consumption and henceforth their bills or arrears.&nbsp; I believe this two-pronged approach&nbsp;- Pay-As-You-Use meter and public education&nbsp;on&nbsp; energy saving - will likely&nbsp;provide a real help to the poor.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Alternative Fuel Sources</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, I would like to raise the issue of developing alternative sources of energy supply for our country's needs and to sustain our profit growth.&nbsp; I should disclose my interest as a Director of Trust Power which has an interest in one of the alternative fuel sources I am going to speak about.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we depend on oil and natural gas to an overwhelming extent for our power generation, that is, the production of electricity for our domestic, commercial and industrial consumption.&nbsp; Indeed, the larger proportion, close to 80%, comes from natural gas as modern plants running on natural gas are considered more efficient and cleaner than the older ones running on fuel oil. Our suppliers of natural gas come from pipelines with two of our neighbours -&nbsp;Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as incidents in the past involving water and now sand had shown, commercial agreements can be subject to political stresses.&nbsp; An example of the havoc that can be caused by disruption of gas supply was seen recently when Russia, having a difference of view with its neighbour, the Ukraine, halted the supply of gas which also affected Germany at the other end of the pipeline as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our heavy dependence on modern amenities, Singapore cannot afford to suffer similar disruptions.&nbsp; We need to diversify our sources of energy supply.&nbsp; That is one of the key reasons for the move to build an LNG terminal as gas can be more readily stored in its liquefied form.&nbsp; I welcome the move.&nbsp; But&nbsp;oil and natural gas resources are finite and in high demand around the world, including from high growth economies like China and India, meaning that the prices in global markets are volatile, again as we have seen in the last few years.&nbsp; We need to look at other alternatives in addition to LNG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I raise two such alternatives for the Ministry's consideration. The first is biofuel, that is, fuel made from grain, oil or sugar bearing crop.&nbsp; These are renewal fuels that in theory would never be exhausted as long as the crops themselves were being produced.&nbsp; The second is coal which is generally being considered an old fashioned and dirty fuel.&nbsp; But the proven reserves of which are far deeper than for oil or natural gas.&nbsp; How can we promote these alternative fuels?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EDB is trying to do so by awarding pioneer status and tax benefits for biofuel manufacturers, and one such manufacturer, Natural Fuels Limited, an Australian-based company with the Singapore subsidiary, is building a plant here.&nbsp; But tax benefits only take you so far because they depend on the plant itself making money and being profitable. What would really get the industry going is to broaden the market for such fuels.&nbsp; This could be achieved, for example, by having a mandatory blending policy for automotive fuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is similar to what we have done with the bulk of production of NEWater.&nbsp; It gets pumped back into our reservoirs so that&nbsp;its effect is felt, if not always seen or tasted.&nbsp; This could take the form of requiring or having incentives to make it commercially attractive, say, 20% of automotive fuels come from biofuels are eaten off.&nbsp; This is being done in countries, like Brazil and the US, and other countries are considering following suit.&nbsp; Allowing a wider range of cars, especially those with turbo diesel engines would also make biodiesel a more attractive fuel alternative to motorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other advantage of biofuels is that they are considered green.&nbsp; A fuel source that is considered not so green is coal.&nbsp; However, that is an outmoded view of a fuel that is making a come back in the wake of high oil prices.&nbsp;Modern technology has succeeded in making coal plants cleaner than ever before, and it is continually being improved to meet stricter environmental standards, provided these concerns can be addressed.&nbsp; The time may come for Singapore to have its first coal plant to take advantage of the abundant supplies of coal available.&nbsp; I believe GIC has even taken a stake in the Di Coal Mine in Indonesia.&nbsp; This would allow us to further diversify our sources of fuel and better safeguard Singapore from disruptions that would affect our citizens and possibly derail our economy and send a strong signal to all and sundry that Singapore would not be held hostage in any arena, including that of security of energy supply.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran):</B> Sir, I would like to thank Members for their suggestions and views on energy and tourism.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow&nbsp;me to first touch on the bread and butter energy issues before moving on to the more colourful tourism related questions that have been raised. Energy, like land and manpower, is a critical economic resource.&nbsp; The key objective of our energy policy is to ensure that we have sufficient and secure energy supplies at affordable prices, and to make sure that we accomplish that objective in a manner that is sensitive to our environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established an inter-Ministry Energy Policy Group to formulate and coordinate our energy policies.&nbsp; Led by MTI, and comprising several key agencies, the Energy Policy Group adopts a \"whole-of-government\" approach in addressing energy issues from the four perspectives of energy security, economic competitiveness, environmental sustainability and also the development of the energy industry itself. These are all points that many Members have touched on in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of competitive markets is the cornerstone of our energy policy. In the contestable segments of the energy value chain, we want to implement contestable markets.&nbsp; We have, therefore, liberalised the electricity market and, going forward, we will be taking steps to open the natural gas market to further enhance competition, a point that Mr Inderjit Singh raised earlier.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked how&nbsp;the consumer has benefited from this liberalised electricity regime.&nbsp; That is a fair question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2001, we have liberalised the electricity generation and retail market in stages.&nbsp;Consequently, there is now greater competition in the electricity market, and this has led to downward pressure on price and it forces players to be more cost competitive.&nbsp; And this has helped to cushion the impact of high oil prices on our electricity tariffs.&nbsp; For example,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>although fuel oil prices&nbsp;increased by 80% over the&nbsp;six years from January 2001 to January 2007 from nearly S$42 a barrel to S$75 a barrel, over the same period, our household electricity tariffs have increased by only 8%&nbsp;from 18.46&cent; per kilowatt hour&nbsp;to about 20&cent; per kilowatt hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is particularly noteworthy is that this is despite the fact that the&nbsp;major cost component of electricity generation is fuel and that accounts for&nbsp;55%.&nbsp; So, notwithstanding the fact that more than half the cost of generating our electricity comes from the cost of fuel oil and the fact that that has gone up by 80%, the price of electricity tariffs is actually quite steady, at about 8%.&nbsp; That is clear proof that the policy is working&nbsp;and the market structure is working in favour of our consumers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, competition in the market has certainly helped to keep&nbsp;electricity prices at about the same level since 2001, despite sharp increases in fuel oil prices.&nbsp; This is the clearest demonstration of how consumers have benefited from the liberalised electricity market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Government does recognise that lower-income households may still feel the impact of rising electricity and other utility bills,&nbsp;even if the increases are modest.&nbsp; This is why we have the Utilities Save (U-Save) scheme, which disbursed about&nbsp;$600 million over&nbsp;the past five years.&nbsp; In this&nbsp;Budget, it has again been renewed for a further five-year period.&nbsp;&nbsp;That will provide additional cushion.&nbsp; On top of that, we have the ComCare Fund and other schemes.&nbsp; So, I would say that, in general, the market structure and the regime favour consumers and there are other schemes to help those who might slip through the cracks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low also asked the question about retail contestability.&nbsp; We have taken steps to liberalise the electricity retail market.&nbsp; This is to provide more competitive pricing and choice to consumers and businesses.&nbsp; Since 2003, about 10,000 large consumers, accounting for 75% of total electricity demand, have already become contestable.&nbsp; This means that the retailers compete to sell electricity directly to these consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 1.2 million small customers are basically&nbsp;households which account for 25% of total electricity demand as residual, and they are not yet contestable and continue to buy electricity from SP Services Ltd.&nbsp; The reason is simple.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;because the economics of catering to this vast group of small consumers is very different.&nbsp; It is more expensive for electricity retailers to service a large number of small customer accounts, than to serve a single customer with&nbsp;a large amount of electricity demand.&nbsp; For small consumers to enjoy the true&nbsp;benefits of contestability, there is a need to reduce the cost of the supporting infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA is currently studying an Electricity Vending System (EVS) which allows retailers to post their electricity supply schemes and prices at various points-of-sale, such as the Internet and convenience stores.&nbsp; An EVS will help reduce the back-end administration and business costs associated with serving small consumers.&nbsp; As the EVS has not been tried elsewhere, EMA is&nbsp;developing the technology and testing the prototype, and that will take&nbsp;the next two to three years to stabilise and make sure that it works.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;EVS is found to work and it stabilises, then there is a very higher chance that the real benefits will accrue to the&nbsp;consumer in a switch to contestability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sam Tan&nbsp;asked about the number of household accounts in utilities arrears and whether there has been some masking of the numbers.&nbsp; Let me first deal with the arithmetics.&nbsp; In January 2005, there were 9,859 accounts in arrears.&nbsp; These are consumers whose payments are overdue for at least three months.&nbsp; Subsequently, in May 2005, the Pay-As-You-Use (PAYU) Scheme was implemented.&nbsp; Following this, accounts in arrears are distinguished between those on the PAYU scheme and those who are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2007, there was&nbsp;a total of 6,200 accounts in arrears, about half on the PAYU scheme and half&nbsp;non-PAYU accounts.&nbsp; This is a decline of about 37% from the 9,000-odd&nbsp;accounts in arrears in January 2005.&nbsp; The more basic question that Mr Sam Tan is asking is whether this, by some magic, has masked the numbers.&nbsp; The answer is simple.&nbsp; There is no magic.&nbsp; This is a simple account management process that SP Services uses to decide who are the accounts in arrears.&nbsp; So, as in any commercial practice, when an account in arrears reschedules its debts and is migrating to pay you, let us say they reschedule their debts, then they are no longer treated as cases in arrears.&nbsp; They are moved to a new category and, thereafter, they only re-enter the arrears account if they default on their payments again above the three-month period.&nbsp; That is the nub of it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan has a very legitimate concern, ie, does this somehow deprive those who really need help in order to meet their utilities costs from getting it?&nbsp; It is not SP Services' job to take care of the welfare, although they do take a very considered approach in dealing with arrears' accounts.&nbsp; They give them several chances,&nbsp;counsel them on the usage of electricity and so on, before they go to more extreme steps.&nbsp; But at the same time, as Mr Sam Tan is aware, there is nothing stopping any one of the individual account holders from approaching their MPs or other agencies for help.&nbsp; The help is available through ComCare and other facilities.&nbsp; So we can take care of them.&nbsp; As far as SP Services' accounting is concerned, it is designed to manage it from a commercial point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Alvin Yeo has raised the important issue of energy security.&nbsp; We need policies and strategies on both the demand and supply side to safeguard our energy security.&nbsp; Demand management is key, as using energy more efficiently will help reduce our energy dependence and emissions.&nbsp; We are, therefore, working closely with MEWR and NEA to develop programmes and measures on energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply side, Mr Alvin Yeo has highlighted the need to diversify our&nbsp;fuel sources.&nbsp; In that regard, we are planning to develop a terminal to enable the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) so as to diversify our gas supply sources.&nbsp; To guard against a disruption in fuel supplies, our power generation companies are also required to stockpile fuel reserves.&nbsp; If our natural gas supply is disrupted, our gas turbines can switch to using diesel instead.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Alvin Yeo on the importance of developing alternative energy sources and keeping ourselves open to the different options, including coal.&nbsp; These alternatives can help us&nbsp;diversify away from our dependence on oil and gas, which accounts for nearly 90% of our electricity supply.&nbsp; We keep an open mind on the use of coal power, as long as it is cost effective and can meet our environmental standards.&nbsp; We know that there is new technology which is able to bring the sulphur dioxide and particulate matter emissions down to levels comparable with fuel oil emission, but there are issues pertaining to carbon dioxide emission and these need to be addressed as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, waste-to-energy is our largest source of renewable energy.&nbsp; The incineration of wastes generates 2%-3% of our electricity supply.&nbsp; But due to our geographic limitations, other sources like hydro, geothermal, wind and tidal energy sources are not viable.&nbsp; Solar technology and biofuels appear to be the main renewable energy options that are feasible in Singapore.&nbsp; However, solar power is still about twice as expensive as our household electricity tariff due to the high upfront cost of photo-voltaic systems.&nbsp; Similarly, ethanol and biodiesel are costlier than their petroleum counterparts.&nbsp; In fact, this is a key consideration, ie, cost, quite apart from which there is the issue of the infrastructure for fuel supply&nbsp;and refueling.&nbsp; These need to be taken into account.&nbsp; Biofuels are new, and we need to understand their impact on car engine performance, reliability and tailpipe emissions as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is stepping up R&amp;D efforts to produce commercially viable alternative energy technologies.&nbsp; A*STAR and EDB will be investing more than $100 million over the next five years in various energy research and testbedding programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;One new initiative is the S$17 million Clean Energy R&amp;D Platform under the EDB.&nbsp; This R&amp;D Platform will allow us to evaluate the performance of various clean energy technologies in our tropical context.&nbsp; Through this programme, we hope to install around two megawatts of&nbsp;power generation capacity from solar and other clean energy sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts on biofuels are ongoing.&nbsp; The Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences (ICES) under A*STAR is conducting research into new methods to produce biofuels, such as from cellulosic materials.&nbsp; The EDB and the NEA have brought together a group of companies, including Robert Bosch, Shell, Nexsol and DaimlerChrysler, to test and evaluate the use of biodiesel in our local setting.&nbsp; If the trials are successful, we can consider introducing biofuels into the market on a pilot scale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, let me now touch on our tourism strategy.&nbsp; The World Tourism Organisation has projected that global tourist arrivals will grow at about 4% per annum, and that the Asia-Pacific region&nbsp; will experience even higher growth exceeding 6% till 2015.&nbsp; This presents Singapore with significant opportunities, especially given our location.&nbsp; At the same time, our competitors are not standing still.&nbsp; Many countries have been aggressively investing in new tourism products.&nbsp; We must be prepared to respond swiftly and make bold changes to avoid being left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To capture our fair share of the growing tourism pie, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) aims to triple tourism receipts&nbsp;to $30 billion, and double visitor arrivals&nbsp;to 17 million by 2015.&nbsp; This means that our tourism receipts have to grow at about 10.3% annually and our visitor arrivals by 6.4%.&nbsp; These are ambitious targets, but they are essential to spur our efforts to ensure Singapore remains an attractive destination for visitors.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that we are on track to achieve our 2015 targets.&nbsp; The strong performance of our tourism sector in 2006 was very encouraging.&nbsp; Several new record highs were set.&nbsp; We generated an estimated $12.4 billion in tourism receipts, ie, about 15% growth year-on-year,&nbsp;and welcomed 9.7 million visitors, ie, about 9% growth.&nbsp; The average occupancy rates and average room rates in our hospitality industry reached an all-time high of 85% and $164 respectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few years promise to be quite exciting for our tourism industry, with the opening of several large attractions.&nbsp; The development of the Singapore Flyer observation wheel is progressing well and it is expected to open in the first quarter of next year.&nbsp; In addition, the opening of the two Integrated Resorts&nbsp;at Marina Bay and Sentosa is anticipated in 2009/2010.&nbsp; These three products will give a major boost to our tourism industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But borrowing a line from our population policy, why stop at three if we can afford more?&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep ahead, STB aims to develop a wide range of tourism attractions and product offerings to enhance our appeal as a leading destination to a diverse group of business and leisure visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked how we will enhance the attractions in Geylang.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all know what he meant.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Ang that, aside from the high-end tourists, we also want to develop offerings which appeal to other market segments, including the middle and mass markets.&nbsp; The ethnic precincts are an integral part of Singapore's tourism offerings.&nbsp; STB has been working with other Government agencies to develop and rejuvenate various ethnic tourism precincts like Little India and Chinatown.&nbsp; STB will do the same to further develop Geylang and Geylang Serai and continue to actively involve the local business associations and other key stakeholders in the effort.&nbsp; The key is to be able to enhance the infrastructure and amenities in these areas without losing their charm, character, street life,&nbsp;and even their intrinsic \"messiness\", which many visitors find quite attractive.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to developing attractions and products, STB will actively pursue other tourism initiatives, such as branding, marketing and pursuing new market segments, to position Singapore as a truly global city and to capture our fair share of the growing Asia-Pacific tourism pie.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is widely acknowledged as a financial centre with a conducive environment for business.&nbsp; But, as Mr Teo Ser Luck has pointed out,&nbsp;we need to enhance our range of leisure and lifestyle events.&nbsp; Singapore must have the X-factor to&nbsp;be a place that is vibrant and buzzing with energy, and a place where it is fun to live and work.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take London, as an example.&nbsp; London has been ranked the top European city for business for the 16th year in a row by the European Cities Monitor, a well-known&nbsp;survey conducted annually of European business locations.&nbsp; It is also famous for its myriad of leisure and lifestyle events, such as West End musicals, the London Fashion Week and Wimbledon.&nbsp;&nbsp;London and other global cities like New York are renowned business hubs which are also on the list of&nbsp; \"must-visit\" leisure destinations for tourists.&nbsp; They are</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Our aspiration is for Singapore to join the ranks of these global cities with its own unique and sustainable positioning.&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza has passionately expressed his ethical concerns and wanting an assurance that we will remain within certain boundaries.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;me assure Mr&nbsp;de Souza, that we have not lost, and will not lose, our ethical bearings in this journey.&nbsp; The fact is, opinion is somewhat divided on why the Crazy Horse cabaret in Singapore came to an end and a good many may not agree with Mr de Souza&rsquo;s analysis.&nbsp; But that is besides the point.&nbsp; The key thing is&nbsp;that I would caution that we do not&nbsp;extrapolate too much from this single episode&nbsp;in drawing general conclusions.&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, what is our approach?&nbsp; It is&nbsp;to clearly define the boundaries, based on our social mores, so that investors are fully aware of our requirements and the limits.&nbsp; And we make no apologies for it.&nbsp; We make it very clear these are the boundaries.&nbsp; We then leave it to the market to judge whether there is a commercial case, or in Mr de Souza's language, whether it is mission impossible or mission possible.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why, in proceeding with the Integrated Resorts, we put in place a robust and stringent regulatory regime to keep casino and other&nbsp; activities under control.&nbsp; All shows staged in Singapore are subjected to the guidelines for public entertainment and censorship set out by Police and MDA.&nbsp; The entertainment in the Integrated Resorts will be subject to the same rules&nbsp;- no more and no less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's reputation as a business and Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions&nbsp;(MICE)&nbsp;destination was further burnished by the recent successful hosting of the IMF/World Bank Meetings.&nbsp; We have also been nurturing and growing leisure and lifestyle events.&nbsp; The Barclays Singapore Open, World Gourmet Summit and Singapore Fashion Festival, for example, have grown in stature and popularity with each passing year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts in creating more \"buzz\" in Singapore seem to be producing results.&nbsp; Recently, the Global Country Brand Index ranked Singapore second in the world for nightlife and dining.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think it came as&nbsp;a mild surprise to even some Members of this House, that we achieved such a high ranking.&nbsp; But the fact is that our leisure and entertainment scene is thriving and it is being&nbsp;given an additional boost with the opening last year of Saint James Power Station, and the more recent launch of the world's largest Caf&eacute; Del Mar in Sentosa.&nbsp; In January this year alone, Singapore hosted seven high-profile concerts including Eric Clapton, which I have the pleasure of attending, but also Korean sensation Rain (I did not attend that) and the classical pop group IL Divo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as Mr Liang Eng Hwa has rightly pointed out, more can and needs to be done. While we continue to do well in international business competitiveness rankings, we fall short when it comes to leisure.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Travel and Leisure Magazine's Best City awards, Singapore is not even in the top 10 list of cities to visit in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be known and seen as a truly global city, we must have an exciting and fun living environment offering not just a wide variety of quality lifestyle, leisure and entertainment options but also world-class events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why we are taking a very serious look at hosting a Formula One Grand Prix in Singapore&nbsp;- an idea that both Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have raised.&nbsp; The F1 is the highest echelon of motorsports, and is said to be the third most watched sporting event in the world, after the Olympics and the World Cup.&nbsp; It is also a glamorous event&nbsp;- one which is attended by sports and entertainment celebrities alike.&nbsp; In fact, the Formula One drivers themselves - such as Schumacher, Alonso and Raikkonnen&nbsp;- and even the cars are celebrities in their own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck has asked whether we are willing to look at the long-term strategic impact of events like F1, to take calculated long-term risks rather than just consider short-term gains&nbsp;in deciding whether to bring them into Singapore. He said he gets shivers.&nbsp; I wish to assure him that there is no need to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, the answer is&nbsp; definitely \"yes\".&nbsp; We do and will continue to assess our tourism projects on the long-term strategic benefits&nbsp;- economic and non-economic, tangible and intangible - that they bring to Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, the F1 is a prime example.&nbsp; The attention and buzz that it generates will expose Singapore to a very different audience from that in the business and financial world.&nbsp; It is a group we currently do not reach out to.&nbsp; An F1 race could also bring about broader tourism benefits and spill-over gains for associated industries such as hospitality, retail and travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, the Ministry of Trade and Industry&nbsp;has been studying, with various agencies, the feasibility of an F1 race in Singapore.&nbsp; An F1 race is a major financial undertaking for&nbsp;any business venture.&nbsp; It will require Government's financial and other support to be commercially viable.&nbsp; The Government is willing to support such a venture but only up to a level that is commensurate with the broader benefits&nbsp;for our&nbsp;economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a venture that we will support at all costs and certainly, Government cannot do this alone without the strong support of key stakeholders and interested businesses, including hoteliers.&nbsp; In response to Mr Teo and Mr Liang, I would say that the prospects are good, but there are still issues such as the commercial terms to be struck between a potential race promoter and the F1 Group, the level of support required from Government, and the extent to which other stakeholders come forward with their support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, allow me to conclude by saying that the&nbsp;outlook for our tourism industry is good. &nbsp;To capture the growing opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, we must be responsive to the needs of the industry, be prepared to revisit old assumptions, and dare to take&nbsp;risks where necessary.&nbsp; To achieve our aim of being a global city, we will need to transform Singapore into a vibrant and exciting lifestyle destination - a city that commands \"top-of-mind\" awareness amongst travellers as a place where locals and tourists alike would like to visit,&nbsp;live and&nbsp;play.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>: Mr Low Thia Khiang, take your two&nbsp;cuts together.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Sentosa Development Corporation</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the report of the Auditor-General has revealed deficiencies in procedures for land sales.&nbsp; It is disturbing that the land sales by Sentosa Development Corporation through its subsidiary, SCPL, were not seen as transparent, fair and competitive.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following instances were reported by the Auditor-General.&nbsp; In one tender&nbsp;in November 2004, 24 land parcels were sold to a sole tenderer significantly below valuation.&nbsp; The result of the tender was neither published nor was a required advice of the Chief Valuer obtained. In another sale, 33 land parcels were sold in August 2005 through a process in which the award criteria were not made known at the beginning to all 170 invited parties.&nbsp; Subsequent extension of deadline was only disclosed to a much smaller group.&nbsp; In a third case in December&nbsp;2003, a former director of SCPL was allowed to tender for sales of land through a company he controls&nbsp;33 days after he retired from the Board of the SCPL.&nbsp; Before his retirement, he was involved as Board Member in deliberating the land sales.&nbsp; SDC subsequently sought approval of the Ministry of Finance for exemption for breaching the financial code for reason of flexibility needed to market Sentosa Cove.&nbsp; MOF decided that no retrospective exemption will be given for the deviations from IM detected by Auditor-General for past Sentosa Cove's property sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these deviations are significant, given that one of the sources of building reserves is from sales of State land.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for Trade and Industry:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Who approves the sale of land parcels listed above?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Was the Minister aware of the breach of the Government Land Sales procedure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; What measures have been taken to ensure adherence to a principle of fair competition, maximising total returns to the Government and transparency in future land sales?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, now I move on to EDB.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Economic Development Board</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore ranks highly in many surveys on our level of corporate governance in the public sector.&nbsp; However, I wonder whether such rankings are well-deserved as one of our statutory boards, namely, the Economic Development Board has been found by the Auditor-General for numerous lapses in governance, structure and practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the Board of EDB dedicated its powers to a sub-committee to approve big amounts for incentive loans and grants, but without requiring it to report back to the Board. The delegation of the Board's powers to certain staff to make borrowings and to grant loans was not allowed under the EDB&nbsp;Act either. As a result, an expenditure of $5.8 million was only approved 15 months after the completion of the transaction.&nbsp; The Auditor-General also found that a project of $9.2 million was split into smaller contracts which were approved by lower level approving authorities.&nbsp; There was also an overpayment of salaries totalling more than $400,000 for the period November 2001 to 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know what oversight mechanisms are there in place to ensure that EDB is functioning in line with the Act passed by Parliament and complying with Government's &nbsp;financial procedures, especially in respect of procurement, tender and approval of expenditure. For Singapore to aspire to be first world standards, statutory boards, such as EDB, should lead by example to implement and to maintain a high standard of governance and internal control, especially in light of the Government's new economic&nbsp;initiative to promote Singapore as a centre for \"a range of high trust services from legal, financial services to highly specialised niche services\", &nbsp;as highlighted by the Second Minister for Finance, Mr Tharman, in his Budget speech.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, let me thank Mr Low Thia Khiang for raising the two findings raised by the Auditor-General's Office and giving me the opportunity to clarify.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the Sentosa Development Corporation's land sales, let me explain the background. As we know, Sentosa Cove is a unique development, comprising not just condominium parcels but also individual bungalow lots, hotels, shops and even&nbsp;a marina.&nbsp; SDC had originally adopted the tender mode of sale for Sentosa Cove for the first and second sales of sites.&nbsp; However, the feedback from potential buyers was that this mode was rigid and too onerous.&nbsp; It was not flexible enough to cater to private developers as well as to individual final home-owners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From our previous experiences, selling land in such a complex mixed development using the normal Government methods will not achieve the best value. SDC therefore set up a private company, SCPL, so as to position the sale of sites at Sentosa Cove as a commercial undertaking.&nbsp; It also enlisted the help of private sector people in the SCPL Board to contribute their market expertise and their business acumen.&nbsp;To better meet the market needs, SCPL decided to adopt alternative modes of sales and practices which are common in the private sector. These methods have been effective and Sentosa Cove has done very well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Auditor-General found that these practices do not comply with the Government's Instruction Manual (IM) which SDC, as a statutory board, has to follow.&nbsp; Following Auditor-General's observation, SDC has reconciled its sale practices with the requirements of IM and obtained the Ministry of Finance's exemption from certain provisions. This allows SDC to meet the market needs&nbsp;while fully observing the principles of fair competition, transparency and maximising the returns to Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the three specific instances which Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned. First,&nbsp;the November 2004 case where it was&nbsp;the sole tenderer and the tender was awarded below valuation. The SCPL Board, in fact, had very long and deliberate discussions on whether to award this despite being only a sole tenderer and below valuation. As you know, the market situation at that time, in 2004, was still very fragile.&nbsp; We had just recovered from the 2003 SARS episode.&nbsp; And the Board decided that&nbsp;if they did not award this tender, it would send a signal to the market and cause the market to be more fragile. So they decided that in the interest of pursuing Sentosa Cove's development, to maintain the momentum, they decided to award to this tenderer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason why the tender price came below the valuation is because this was the first time we awarded based on an en-bloc development of the bungalow lots.&nbsp; Previously, we were selling the bungalow lots individually and selling to the highest bidder for each lot.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the target catchment that we are looking for in Sentosa Cove high-end bungalows, many of them did not want to come in and tender individually.&nbsp; And some of these sales are to foreigners.&nbsp; So SCPL thought that en bloc sale through an intermediary, who&nbsp;is more able to respond flexibly to the final home buyer, would be a better approach.&nbsp; Therefore, there is a question of judgment by the valuer on&nbsp;how much to discount when&nbsp;we do an en bloc sale.&nbsp; That explains why there was a difference in the valuation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second case,&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Kiang mentioned that it was a limited tender.&nbsp; This was because SCPL decided to go for an approach called \"Expression of Interest\".&nbsp; This is&nbsp;something that is not in our Instruction Manual but, in the private sector, the developer will invite prospective tenderers through an Expression of Interest.&nbsp; So, in this case, SCPL asked all members of REDAS, the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore, whether they were interested in tendering for this particular project.&nbsp; As a result, a smaller group of people expressed interest.&nbsp; From then on, SCPL dealt with this smaller group.&nbsp; So there is nothing wrong in dealing with a smaller group after you have asked the huge membership of REDAS to first see whether they have any interest in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp;third case of a former director tendering,&nbsp;this is not unusual.&nbsp; Many times, we invite private sector people on to our boards to make use of their expertise and for them to contribute.&nbsp; It is common corporate governance that when they join the board, they will declare their interest and they will excuse themselves from participation in individual cases, which is what happened in this case.&nbsp; The former director retired and, after his retirement, he participated in the tender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the second case of EDB.&nbsp; In the EDB's case, the Auditor-General had eight findings.&nbsp; EDB views the Auditor-General's findings very seriously.&nbsp; For the non-systemic findings, EDB has taken swift actions to rectify the lapses highlighted.&nbsp; For areas where the Auditor-General has recommended improvements, EDB has promptly reviewed and implemented the necessary changes.&nbsp; MTI will work closely with EDB to ensure that it continues to strengthen its corporate governance practices and its internal control systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;explain the eight findings.&nbsp; There were two findings on board governance structure.&nbsp; Previously, the EDB budget and applications for large incentive loans and grants were submitted directly to MTI HQ and approved by MTI HQ without going through the board.&nbsp; EDB has since accepted Auditor-General's Office recommendation and its operating budget is now approved by the board since FY 2006, and all key decisions and decisions made by the board's sub-committees are now reported back to the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were three findings because of differing interpretation of the EDB Act and the accounting treatment.&nbsp; On the wrongful delegation of the board's powers on two of the findings, ie, on the delegation of the board's powers on borrowings and to grant loans, EDB has acted on its legal counsel's advice regarding the interpretation of the EDB Act.&nbsp; AGC has a different interpretation of the Act.&nbsp; EDB and MTI have since adopted AGC's interpretation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>instead, and EDB has made the necessary changes to comply with the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the under-contribution of its annual surpluses because of&nbsp;different accounting treatment, EDB has relied on the view of two external auditors on the accounting treatment adopted for the Scholarship Fund, which was different from the Auditor-General's Office.&nbsp; EDB has since adopted Auditor-General's Office's recommended accounting treatment and has made the necessary corrections and contributions to the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two findings on procurement procedures, as highlighted by Mr Low Thia Khiang.&nbsp; One was on expenditure of $5.8 million which was approved 15 months after the completion of the transaction.&nbsp; This was because the project was very complex. The costing was available only much later and the approval was therefore obtained late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second case of $9.2 million which was split into smaller contracts, EDB has followed the procurement procedures for each contract's value rather than on the total project cost.&nbsp; EDB has accepted Auditor-General's recommendation to seek approval based on the total project cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there was a finding of over payment of salary totalling some $400,000 for the period from&nbsp;November 2001 to May 2005.&nbsp; The over payments were isolated incidents and not systemic.&nbsp; The amount was promptly recovered through instalments and will be fully recovered by 31st March 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EDB has also put in place various monitoring processes to prevent such incidents.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our intention, first of all, is to have a separate REITs manager from the REITs.&nbsp; The two will be separated.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the sale of the REIT, whether it&nbsp;is to&nbsp;be divided into two, three or four separate REITs out of the properties to be divested, this is something that we are working together with our financial advisers.&nbsp; Our objective is quite clear.&nbsp; We want to make sure that we have a competitive industry structure at the end of the divestment exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On dual economy, let me apologise for not responding earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite a complicated subject.&nbsp; When you look at the Singapore economy, I am sure you can dissect it in many ways and claim that it is a dual economy,&nbsp;tri economy or an economy with four parts.&nbsp; I am not so sure how useful that analysis is.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh explained that the economy can be divided into the small and the big.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo had previously argued that the dual economy is because of domestic versus exports.&nbsp; I would say that&nbsp;our economy is evolving.&nbsp; We are confronted by globalisation.&nbsp; We are confronted by technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;The different sectors in the economy that our companies are in have to evolve and innovate and compete&nbsp;based on these globalisation and technological changes.&nbsp; So some sectors which were considered not doing so well in the past, eg, the ship-repair industry, through their rejuvenation and changes, they have done very well in the last few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, because of under investment in the refinery and chemical sector, the margins were poor and also under invested for the last five to seven years.&nbsp; But in recent years, we are seeing&nbsp;a revival of investment and I am very confident, over the next two to four years, the contributions from our chemical industry will be more significant and we will see it as another growth sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in our electronics sector, last year, we went through severe readjustment&nbsp;-&nbsp;retrenchments in Maxtor; we had a major restructuring in our hard disk drive sector&nbsp;-&nbsp;but, at the same time, we are attracting new components of the electronics sector and&nbsp;also in the hard disk media sector.&nbsp; So I am confident that in two to three years, as these factories come into operation, we will see the contribution from the electronics sector improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best example, of course, is construction&nbsp;- great difficulties over the last few years and now on the threshold of growth.&nbsp; And as long as we are able to continue to get new supplies of sand and granite, as we are confident we will get, our construction sector should do well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think we have to deal with these changes as the economy evolves.&nbsp; The economy cannot stand still.&nbsp; We are very open, a very small economy, and we have to continuously evolve to meet with our global changes.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I fully agree with him.&nbsp; In SDC's case, obviously, SDC&nbsp;made some lapses.&nbsp; SDC bought over Sentosa Cove land.&nbsp; They took up a bank loan and they procured the entire land parcel.&nbsp; As far as they are concerned, they have bought the land lock, stock and barrel from the Government.&nbsp; So they set up a private company to implement the sale of the land.&nbsp; They did not realise that as a statutory board, they still have to follow statutory board procedures, especially the Instruction Manual.&nbsp; Therefore, when this was raised to them, then, of course, they sought exemptions from MOF.&nbsp; That was the lapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, I agree with Mr Low that even when we invite people into our board, there ought to be considerations of limitation period after they resign from the board.&nbsp;

But let me just address his points again.&nbsp; I think we need to separate the issue of our concerns in terms of what are the boundaries that we are prepared to accept in Singapore from the commercial outcomes of any ventures undertaken within those boundaries.&nbsp; So we set the boundaries, and it is not specifically for one or two industries.&nbsp; We set it across the board, so we have the rules and these are rules enforced by the Police, MDA and other agencies.&nbsp; All our potential and existing entrepreneurs in the business understand these rules, and the same rules should apply and will apply to the IRs, no more and no less, as I said.&nbsp; So that would be our approach.&nbsp; Beyond that, we leave it to the companies.&nbsp; If the IRs want to bring in a certain type of entertainment, the first thing really is:&nbsp;does it pass muster with our agencies that control or license or guide the kind of activities they can have?&nbsp; If they pass muster,&nbsp;it is up to them, and then good luck to them.&nbsp; They go ahead, try it out, and see whether it works.&nbsp; But it is not for us to micro-manage what occurs within the IRs beyond the existing and pre-agreed and generally established norms of what we consider to be acceptable.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My question is: as&nbsp;a world class SME would require&nbsp;world class professional workers,&nbsp;what steps can we take to ensure that the <I>creme de la creme</I> do not all flow towards only the foreign SMEs or the MNCs, but some would at least be encouraged to work in the local SMEs?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is on the chorus of green to go with opportunity waves, talking about the green collar jobs and green dollars that we can bring into Singapore.&nbsp; Can the Minister inform this House of his plans and intentions, and what can consumers and businesses anticipate in the near future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;the ICT adoption rate.&nbsp; How is MTI or SPRING working together with&nbsp;IDA in driving the adoption rate amongst SMEs and what are some of the performance indicators?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth,&nbsp;tourism.&nbsp; I think there has been a lot of talk about the&nbsp;MICE events and Formula 1 events.&nbsp; I think they are all exciting but the&nbsp;WEF's Travel and Tourism survey also ranked Singapore 8th out of 124 cities.&nbsp; That is marvellous, except when it comes to the category on human culture and heritage, we actually ranked very, very low.&nbsp; Obviously F1 or MICE events will bring in the crowds.&nbsp; They&nbsp;will bring a lot of crowd but they are also footloose and price competitive.&nbsp; Is it not better to encourage&nbsp;the joining of local festival type of events to attract tourists and to make it a permanent attraction?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We also work with the various industry associations to increase the attractiveness of the various sectors.&nbsp; For example, you would have noticed that people in the shipyard business are now advertising themselves through a Chinese serial.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On IDA and the adoption of IT, we adopt a whole-of-Government approach.&nbsp; So SPRING, IE and IDA work with our SMEs to encourage them to adopt IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;On tourism, we look for and we will have performance indicators to guide this.&nbsp; On tourism products, we cover a whole range.&nbsp; We know that we do not have the cultural or&nbsp;historical attractions that other people go to in Paris or elsewhere and, therefore, we must make up for these in other attractions as well.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On the issue of local and foreign SMEs, the way we see it is really over time Singapore should have a larger pyramid of enterprises - the small and the startups forming the base, the larger one at the tip.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we try to do is to make the system efficient, as if we put in the catalyst or enzymes so that those at the bottom starting out can rise quickly to the top and become big companies.&nbsp; And this will bring about&nbsp;benefits in terms of economic spin-offs and jobs,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Mdm Ho that there are many indicators in place and we track closely&nbsp;the performance of SMEs as well as the programmes designed to assist them.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So once that is done and through accreditation, we will be able to identify good players and bad players in the market, and for bad players as&nbsp;with&nbsp;the existing mechanism, there are ways to stop them and publicise their shortcomings to the market.&nbsp;

I must say, Sir, that it&nbsp;really is rather like a bad soap opera.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest salvo that has come from Indonesia can perhaps be described as the five Ps. The first \"P\" is that Indonesia took a stand on banning the export of sand on the matter of principle.&nbsp; They said that it was the environment. So that sounds quite noble and high minded.&nbsp; They wanted to protect the environment.&nbsp; It is a matter of principle.&nbsp; A few days later though, they emanated another statement which said that the ban was because of pressure. They wanted to pressure us.&nbsp; That sounds rather less noble.&nbsp; That is the second \"P\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, on Sunday, I noticed that Indonesia's Maritime Affairs Minister, Mr Freddy Numberi, had said, and I quote,&nbsp;\"The ban on sand exports will not be lifted till the Republic settles their border dispute.&nbsp; And even if Indonesia were to eventually allow sales to resume, it wants to renegotiate the price of the sand and determine which areas could be mined to avoid environmental&nbsp;degradation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said also, \"Politically, we banned the export of sand because we wanted it to have a larger economic value, and we also&nbsp;wanted to settle our border disputes with Singapore.\" &nbsp;This comment about banning sand because they wanted to have a larger economic value&nbsp;is rather telling.&nbsp; Because what that suggests is&nbsp;its price, the third \"P\".&nbsp; So the first \"P\" -&nbsp;principle can perhaps be compromised, if the third \"P\" comes in, which is price.&nbsp; So the principle can be purchased.&nbsp; Of course, all&nbsp;this results in the fourth \"P\" for Singapore because we are puzzled.&nbsp; And if I could just wrap the whole thing up by saying that the entire Indonesian stand&nbsp;can be described as the fifth \"P\", which is that it is peculiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Minister could comment on these developments as well as the other bilateral relations that we have with our neighbours, which seem to be rather more smooth sailing with the occasional ups and downs.&nbsp; But bearing in mind that we live in a neighbourhood which is sometimes calm and sometimes exciting, it would be helpful if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could give us an indication of whether we are sailing in smooth waters or whether we must experience a little turbulence here and there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</B> Sir, ASEAN would be celebrating its 40th anniversary.

In fact, the situation appears to be regressing after many broken promises made to ASEAN and with hardly any progress made on their roadmap to democracy.&nbsp; Myanmar's military junta has done little to provide ASEAN with justification to continue defending it, and ASEAN's credibility has suffered much as a result of trying to defend the junta against international criticism.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, ASEAN must also realise the limits of its influence, as evidenced&nbsp;by the snub received by its envoy, Syed Hamid Albar when&nbsp;he visited&nbsp;Myanmar earlier last year. Although ASEAN's influence on Myanmar appears limited, ASEAN governments must speak up and make it clear that what is happening in Myanmar is not&nbsp;acceptable to the other ASEAN members.&nbsp; ASEAN cannot simply ignore the tragedy happening in the member country and should review its policy of constructive engagement and stop using non-interference as an excuse for inaction.&nbsp; ASEAN's current constitution does not have any provision to suspend or expel&nbsp;rogue members.&nbsp; Could the Minister tell us whether the proposed ASEAN Charter currently being drawn up will address this shortcoming?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman):</B> Sir, we have been a member of ASEAN since its inception some 40 years ago.&nbsp; ASEAN has expanded, not only in size, but also in scope of its work as a regional and economic bloc.&nbsp; Our ASEAN members are also riding on each other's development as we see the positive outcome of the region being seen as an attractive destination for investors, albeit occasional domestic challenges faced by individual members.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while individual member countries may have their own challenges and difficulties, we also see periodic tensions in bilateral relations between ASEAN members.&nbsp; We have had our fair share of bilateral challenges with our neighbours.&nbsp; Our relation with Thailand was affected recently by the Shin Corp episode and the former Prime Minister Thaksin's private visit here.&nbsp; Then with Indonesia, we had the sand ban issue with their leaders going back&nbsp;to enforce on the reasons for the ban.&nbsp; Whether their reasons are environmental or political or the other&nbsp;\"Ps\" that are mentioned by Ms Indranee Rajah earlier, our relations with them is a little bit strange.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not help when political leaders make statements that&nbsp;seem as though we are such bad&nbsp;neighbours.&nbsp;Then with Malaysia, we continue to be targets of various accusations from time to time.&nbsp; Sir, I acknowledge that we are not the only ones having periodic bilateral issues with our ASEAN countries.&nbsp; Relations&nbsp;in Thailand have their own border issues to deal with.&nbsp; Countries continue to dispute on territorial boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, bilateral relations have often times become thorny issues between member countries.&nbsp; How do ASEAN members ensure that these issues do not affect the larger objectives and vision of ASEAN? The stability of the region is critical for us to attract investors and for ASEAN to be seen as an economic force to be reckoned with.&nbsp; We cannot allow intra-ASEAN disputes to affect investor sentiment&nbsp;for the region as we will all stand to lose.&nbsp; While we continue to look beyond ASEAN, we should ensure&nbsp;our attractiveness as an investor destination. We must work to impress upon our counterparts in ASEAN on the importance of ASEAN solidarity&nbsp;for our collective and mutual benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister: how is Singapore managing its relationship with individual ASEAN member countries bilaterally, especially during periods when bilateral relations are strained?&nbsp; Sir, we are aware of the non-interference in domestic policies of ASEAN.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, is there a role for ASEAN in managing such bilateral issues?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is Singapore's role to ensure that ASEAN continues to remain strong and able to glue the member countries together to rise above sensitive bilateral issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, we have helped our ASEAN neighbours by giving technical assistance.&nbsp; We have also helped our ASEAN neighbours in their times of need as much as we can within&nbsp;our capabilities.&nbsp; An example is our tsunami relief effort.&nbsp; Singapore was among the first to rush to Indonesia's aid.&nbsp; We sent emergency relief and pledged $15 million for its reconstruction efforts.&nbsp; Singaporeans from all walks of life also donated a total of $88 million for tsunami victims.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than half the projects are in Indonesia.&nbsp; Just to name some:&nbsp;we built 1,500 houses in Aceh, built and upgraded hospitals, training centres and schools, and also built a pier in Meulaboh.&nbsp; Hundreds of ordinary Singaporeans, from retirees to students, also pitched in, serving as volunteers.&nbsp; And this was not a one-off effort.&nbsp; After the earthquake in Central Java last May, Singapore was also among the first to help with emergency relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has also sought to spur growth in our neighbouring countries through economic cooperation.&nbsp; One of the most recent was the framework agreement to develop the Special Economic Zones in Batam, Bintan and Karimun.&nbsp; In Thailand, we have also worked hard with the various Thai governments over the years to build a constructive relationship based on mutual help and mutual benefit.&nbsp; In particular, we have encouraged our companies, including our Government-linked companies, to seriously consider Thailand as a key investment option.&nbsp; Hence, Temasek's investment in Shin Corp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are major expenditures and investments, both tangible and intangible.&nbsp; But Singaporeans witnessing the unfriendly actions of Indonesia and Thailand would be forgiven for asking if all these efforts to build a strong ASEAN community and to help our neighbours are a worthwhile effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans do not expect gratitude from our neighbours and we certainly do not expect also to be constantly made the scapegoat for their own domestic troubles or the butt of bully-boy tactics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we do not forget countries which have helped us in times of need.&nbsp; We also resist populist pressures to play the nationalist card against our friends just to win votes.&nbsp; In our early years of struggle for survival after independence, it cannot be said that Indonesia was helpful to us.&nbsp; On the contrary, Indonesia was engaging in <I>konfrantasi</I> against us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To become a viable state, we were forced to leapfrog the region.&nbsp; Our economic success today is the result of our hard work, resilience and ingenuity, and not because of any sand that we might have imported from any country or the oxygen that they might have provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have put the past behind us and we have been working hard towards a strong ASEAN.&nbsp; We want a peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood.&nbsp; And we know that this region needs a strong ASEAN to face up to the challenges of&nbsp;a rising China, India and the shifting geostrategic landscape.&nbsp; But until the bigger countries in ASEAN get their act together and treat other countries in ASEAN with mutual respect, it would seem that this would remain only a hazy dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister what are the prospects for an integrated ASEAN given this state of affairs?&nbsp; Can I also ask the Minister whether he thinks that the haze problem would be considered a major ASEAN problem that all ASEAN countries should solve together, especially with the help of our biggest neighbour, Indonesia?&nbsp; It would seem that if we want to strive towards&nbsp;an integrated community of peace and prosperity, we should have a clear ASEAN, a clear-minded ASEAN with fresh air that would draw in investments, rather than one that is clouded in smoke and haze and will cause investments to go away.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Middle East, however, remains worrying. &nbsp;The situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate. The standoff between the international community and Iran over its nuclear programme is reaching a head.&nbsp; Against the backdrop of growing division between Sunnis and Shiites, the Middle East is one area where conflict can suck in all the world's major powers. We will be directly affected in Southeast Asia as well. Without forward movement in Palestine, Iraq and Iran, the problem of <I>jihadi</I> terrorism can only get worse. But it is not all gloom; there are some positive developments as well.&nbsp; For example, Saudi Arabia is now playing a helpful role in bringing Fatah and Hamas together to form a unity government in Palestine. Although the Mecca Agreement falls short of the conditions set for an internationally-recognised Palestinian government, it nevertheless represents a step forward.&nbsp; It is good that the US is also now prepared to engage Iran and Syria through a regional conference on Iraq.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we have little influence over the larger forces at play, we can help stabilise our immediate environment in Southeast Asia. Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Ms Irene Ng, Mr Charles Chong, Dr Maliki, Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Hawazi Daipi raised ASEAN and the importance of ASEAN integration.&nbsp; Building a stronger ASEAN is indeed a core element in our foreign policy. By the next Summit this November, the ASEAN Charter, which is being drafted, should be ready for our Leaders to sign. We will strengthen all three pillars of ASEAN, for political-security cooperation, for economic integration and the strengthening of our socio-cultural linkages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong ASEAN enables us to negotiate more effectively with our major partners like the US, China, Japan, India, Europe and Australia/New Zealand. ASEAN is already playing a leading role in the construction of a larger architecture of peace and cooperation in the region. We have an inner concentric circle consisting of ASEAN and the three Northeast Asian countries of China, Japan and Korea, what we call ASEAN&nbsp;+ 3. And we have, in addition, a larger concentric circle, the EAS, which also includes India, Australia and New Zealand. Launched in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005, the EAS had a successful second meeting in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about the ASEAN Formal Ministers' Retreat in Siem Reap last week. We had a good meeting and we were able to advance the ASEAN agenda significantly.&nbsp; Later this year, Singapore will be in the ASEAN Chair for its 40th Anniversary as pointed out by Ms Rajah, Dr Ong and Mr Hawazi. We will also be celebrating the 30th Anniversary of our dialogue relations with the US and the EU.&nbsp; ASEAN's relations with both the US and the EU are becoming stronger. With the US, a Plan of Action was signed last July to implement the ASEAN-US Enhanced Partnership. With the EU, negotiations for an EU-ASEAN FTA will soon be launched. &nbsp;The EU has also indicated its desire to accede to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. &nbsp;Singapore is a strong advocate of stronger EU involvement in ASEAN.&nbsp; We hope that both the ASEAN-US and ASEAN-EU Anniversaries will be celebrated at the Summit level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in the Chair, we will do all we can to move ASEAN forward.&nbsp; A peaceful ASEAN can play a major role in maintaining the larger peace in Asia. &nbsp;If I may answer Dr Maliki, Dr Ong and Ms Irene Ng directly, it does not mean that, with a strong ASEAN, there will&nbsp;be no more problems or conflicts among countries in Southeast Asia. &nbsp;There will still be. &nbsp;But a sense of regional solidarity and a habit of consultation and cooperation will set our disagreements within limits and facilitate their solution. &nbsp;To respond to the comments made by Dr Ong and Ms Irene Ng, ASEAN still has a very positive role to play.&nbsp; The most important objective is to maintain the peace in the region. If we are able to keep the peace for another generation, the entire region, which encompasses more than half the world's population in Asia, will be transformed beyond recognition and hundreds of millions of people will be brought out of the depths of poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move to our bilateral relations in ASEAN.&nbsp; Ms Rajah, Dr Maliki and Dr Ong Chit Chung commented on our relations with Malaysia. On the whole, our relations with Malaysia are good and getting better.&nbsp; I agree with the recent remarks by Foreign Minister Syed Hamid, quoted in the <I>Straits Times</I> that,&nbsp;\"our bilateral ties with Singapore have never been better.&nbsp; That doesn't mean all our bilateral issues have been resolved, but we are moving on to a more mature track.&nbsp; We are able to segment areas where we think we can move forward and areas we cannot, and move on the areas we think we can move ahead\".&nbsp; I welcome this new phase in our relationship with Malaysia. &nbsp;In May, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will visit Malaysia with a delegation of Cabinet Ministers for a retreat with Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and his colleagues.&nbsp; This will be the first Retreat between our Leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close cooperation between our two countries will benefit our peoples.&nbsp; Personally, I was delighted, when it was announced that Genting made the successful bid for the Sentosa IR project. We look forward to working with Malaysia on the Iskandar Development Region in South Johor on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that the National University of Singapore will be conferring on the Sultan of Johor an honorary doctorate in April on the occasion of his official visit to Singapore.&nbsp; At Siem Reap last week, I expressed our intention to establish a Consulate in JB to Syed Hamid who welcomed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's relationship with Vietnam is growing from strength to strength. Vietnam has made remarkable progress in the last decade. It has been the fastest growing economy in ASEAN all through the Asian Financial Crisis. We have been working with Vietnam to deepen our economic cooperation.&nbsp; The Connectivity Agreement which we signed with Vietnam in December 2005 has raised our economic relationship to a new level by allowing both countries to leverage on each another's strengths. Last year, PM Lee was invited by Vietnam Premier Dung to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park which has been a signal success. The two PMs also witnessed the launch of the VSIP II in September 2006.&nbsp; We look forward to Vietnam playing a growing role in ASEAN.&nbsp; Our relations with Cambodia and Laos are also in good shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong, Mr Hawazi, Ms Rajah and Dr Maliki asked whether problems in our bilateral relations with Thailand and Indonesia will affect ASEAN's development. Well, I certainly hope not. With Thailand, our relationship is strong enough to weather the uproar over Prof. Jayakumar's private dinner with former PM Thaksin. As Thai Assistant Army Commander, General Saprang, who is a member of the Council for National Security (CNS), said in his interview with the <I>Straits Times</I> published on 21st February 2007,&nbsp; \"misunderstandings between the two countries have come about because of Thaksin's business. The problem can be resolved fairly ... and won't blow up because the cause of the problem is not Singapore, but Thaksin\".&nbsp; In other words, we are just being embroiled in their own domestic political conflict.&nbsp; I share General Saprang's sentiments. As close and friendly neighbours, it is right that both sides take into account each other's sensitivities whenever possible. We value our friendship with Thailand and the Thai people.&nbsp; It is good that both countries view Temasek's purchase of Shin Corp as a commercial transaction.&nbsp; The Thai Government has stated publicly that it is mindful of the rights of international investors and will not take action which is discriminatory in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Indonesia, which was raised by, I think, all MPs, our relations were improving until recently.&nbsp; In October 2005, PM Lee held a retreat with President Yudhoyono in Bali.&nbsp; They agreed to negotiate an ET, an Extradition Treaty and a DCA, or a Defence Cooperation Agreement, in parallel and to be concluded as a package. We have made good progress on both the ET and the DCA.&nbsp; There are a few difficult issues remaining, but the gaps can be overcome. We have also agreed to cooperate on the development of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in the Riaus, and to work together regionally and internationally to combat the haze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, despite these positive developments, other issues have recently emerged that could sour relations and affect bilateral cooperation. On 5th February 2007, Indonesia banned the export of land sand to Singapore. Various reasons have been advanced by Indonesian politicians and legislators, some quite wild and strange.&nbsp; I like the five&nbsp;\"Ps\" which Ms Indranee Rajah used to describe the cacophony which we are now hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 16th February 2007, the <I>Jakarta Post</I> published an article which quoted the DEPLU's (Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs) Director General for Asia, the Pacific and Africa saying that the ban on land sand exports to Singapore was a way to put more pressure on us to move faster on ET and border demarcation.&nbsp; MFA issued a statement on 19th February to say that, if this was indeed DEPLU's position, it was unfortunate and contravened the earlier agreement by the two Leaders and would further complicate border negotiations. On 21st February, Foreign Minister Hassan clarified that the land sand ban was not intended to pressure us.&nbsp; He reiterated environmental concerns and conceded that our reclamation would not change the sea boundaries between Singapore and Indonesia because what was under discussion was far away from our reclamation areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I met Minister Hassan during the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat in Siem Reap.&nbsp; He repeated to me that there was no linkage between the ban on land sand and other bilateral issues.&nbsp; And he explained Indonesia's environmental concerns.&nbsp; I told him that our offer to work with Indonesia on these concerns was still on the table.&nbsp; On sand, I acknowledged Indonesia's prerogative to stop its export, subject, of course, to international rules.&nbsp; I told him we were disappointed but we would find alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early last week, another issue arose. We received reports that the Indonesian Navy was interdicting and detaining tugboats and barges carrying granite chips from Indonesia to Singapore.&nbsp; As of this morning, some 12 tugboats and 12 barges have been detained, most of which fly the Singapore flag.&nbsp; Mr Hawazi and others raised this specific problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked Foreign Minister Hassan whether there was a ban on granite exports to Singapore as well.&nbsp; After checking, he assured me that there was no such ban.&nbsp; He said there were only some existing administrative verification procedures to be complied with for granite exports. He invited us to witness the verification process to ensure its transparency.&nbsp; I welcomed this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Lim Hng Kiang also spoke to Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu to clarify the matter.&nbsp; She also confirmed that there was no ban on granite exports and acknowledged that several barges carrying granite chips from Indonesia to Singapore had been detained by the Indonesian Navy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, MFA delivered a <I>TPN</I> to the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore to confirm what Foreign Minister Hassan had assured me in Siem Reap and to ask the Indonesian Government to take immediate action to release the vessels that are still detained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not clear to us what caused the recent events which threatened our bilateral relations. We know, for a fact, that President Yudhoyono values good bilateral relations as we do.&nbsp; On ET and DCA, we are not far from a solution.&nbsp; This was also Minister Hassan's view when I met him.&nbsp; And we have agreed that negotiations should now be elevated to the ministerial level so that they can be jointly concluded on the basis of&nbsp; \"an overall balance of benefits\" agreed to between Prime Minister&nbsp;Lee and President Yudhoyono.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, from time to time, we must expect countries to pressure us in the hope that we will then give way to their demands. Singaporeans know that if we give in to such pressures, we would only invite more such pressures. However, we are always prepared to build good relations with them on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.&nbsp; We should still help them when they are in difficulty not because we expect gratitude or reward, but because that is the right thing to do.&nbsp; I do understand the sentiments expressed by Ms Indranee Rajah, Ms Irene Ng and Dr Ong Chit Chung, which are sentiments shared by many Singaporeans but we have to take these ups and downs in our stride.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on to the rest of ASEAN, Singapore treasures its close ties with the Philippines and Brunei.&nbsp; The leadership of President Arroyo was a decisive factor in the success of the last ASEAN Summit in Cebu.&nbsp; We were touched by the warm welcome accorded to President Nathan during his State Visit to the Philippines last month.&nbsp; With Brunei, our relationship is intimate and problem-free. Later this year, Prime Minister Lee will be visiting Brunei to launch jointly with the Sultan a commemorative currency note to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of our Currency Interchangeability Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Charles Chong asked about our attitude towards Myanmar.&nbsp; It is sad that the country is not moving forward, at least not in a way obvious to foreign observers.&nbsp; By right, Myanmar should be in the Chair of ASEAN this year.&nbsp; We have decided that in ASEAN, we should give Myanmar more space to work out its own internal problems.&nbsp; This also means that ASEAN stopped having a common position at international forums, like the UN and the ILO.&nbsp; Mr Chong asked whether the ASEAN Charter should have provisions for actions against member states in the case of serious violations.&nbsp; This is a subject still being discussed but not with specific reference to Myanmar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilaterally, we continue to maintain good relations with Myanmar and we wish the Myanmar people well.&nbsp; I will be making a bilateral visit to Myanmar next month.&nbsp; It is not for us to tell them what to do but we support ASEAN's consensus calling on the Myanmar Government to adhere to its own Roadmap to Democracy and for the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Ms Rajah and Mr Palmer, our bilateral relations with China, Japan and India are excellent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With China, the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation co-chaired by Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi and DPM Wong Kan Seng covers a wide field.&nbsp; Last year, both sides agreed to launch negotiations for a China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement within the framework of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement.&nbsp; Suzhou has become an icon of our close partnership.&nbsp; China welcomes the extension of our involvement from the coastal regions to the West and the Northeast, and both sides have been making bilateral visits at a high level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our good relations with Japan were highlighted last year by the visit of the Emperor and the Empress.&nbsp; Following the custom of the Imperial Household, the visit was carefully crafted in great detail to express the depth and the warmth of our friendship.&nbsp; This month, Prime Minister Lee will be making an official visit to Japan.&nbsp; With economic recovery, Japan's role in ASEAN's economic development is growing again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Mr Palmer, we are relieved to see the sun come out in the relations between Japan and China although the clouds have not completely dispersed.&nbsp; Prime Minister Abe made an important move in visiting Beijing first when he assumed office, and Prime Minister Wen will be returning the visit to Japan in April 2007.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for India, raised by Ms Rajah and Mr Palmer, our bilateral relations have never been better.&nbsp; We are now cooperating on a wide front, including in security and defence.&nbsp; Our artillery and armour units conduct joint exercises regularly, including live-firing exercises. The two air forces have been conducting a series of bilateral exercises, out of Kalaikunda in West Bengal and, for the first time last year, in Singapore.&nbsp; Following the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in June 2005, bilateral trade jumped 40% last year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a modest way, we have been promoting good relations between India and China and between India and Japan.&nbsp; We try to add value where we can. And these are the three most important countries in Asia.&nbsp; If they develop strong bonds of cooperation, the whole of Asia will benefit and Singapore will prosper.&nbsp; For this reason, we worked hard for an EAS that included India.&nbsp; But we need more than economics to bind us together.&nbsp; We need also to develop cultural ties, the ties that in past periods created the maritime silk route.&nbsp; For example, with the support of the Buddhist community in Singapore, MFA has been working with India, China, Japan and many other Asian countries to promote the Nalanda project which Mr Palmer referred to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer asked whether there is a danger that Singapore might be caught in between should conflict break out between the big powers, for example, between China and US, or China and Japan.&nbsp; There is always such a risk.&nbsp; What is important is for us to be clear about our own position.&nbsp; While we have friendly relations with the major powers, we are never their agents.&nbsp; And we must always be autonomous and have our own core.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me answer Ms Irene Ng and Mr Hawazi Daipi.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a puppeteer, it is the people of Singapore whose collective interest we advance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung referred to our relations with the US, with whom we have an FTA and a Strategic Framework Agreement. &nbsp;Last year, President Bush made his second official visit to Singapore.&nbsp; No other country can match the US in its comprehensive capabilities.&nbsp; When the Boxing Day tsunami hit us, it was the US military which did the heavy lifting in countries all along the Indian Ocean rim.&nbsp; The SAF was only able to play a significant role because we were within operational range of Aceh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recognise the importance of Russia to our region.&nbsp; Our political and economic links to Russia are getting stronger.&nbsp; There are now many direct flights between Singapore and Moscow.&nbsp; We are also working together on the development of Special Economic Zones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, Mr Zainudin Nordin asked for a progress report on our Middle East account.&nbsp; We have made significant progress since our policy shift to engage that region some three years ago.&nbsp; Last year, the Saudi Crown Prince made a very successful official visit to Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; The story of the young boy who walked up to the Prince at the lounge of the Fullerton Hotel, chatted him up and who was then given a string of beads by the Crown Prince, touched the hearts of many Singaporeans.&nbsp; Prime Minister Lee also had a good visit to Saudi Arabia in November last year.&nbsp; We were pleasantly surprised and honoured when the Saudis proposed to send more than two hundred scholarship holders to study in our universities annually.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our relations with the other Gulf states - Qatar, UAE, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait - are also blossoming and becoming more multi-faceted.&nbsp; We enjoy a good brand name and, generally speaking, our companies and our citizens are sought after by all these countries.&nbsp; Some of our companies have secured sizeable contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope more of our businessmen will seize opportunities in that market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negotiations for an FTA with the GCC countries, which consist of all the countries that I have mentioned, have begun and should not take too long to complete.&nbsp; Not only are there opportunities for us to trade and invest in each other's economy, there are also good prospects for us to work together in third countries.&nbsp; Flushed with cash reserves from high energy prices, and feeling somewhat less welcome in the West nowadays, some of the GCC countries are looking for opportunities to invest their money in China, Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries in our region.&nbsp; Some have asked to partner us in entering these Asian markets, especially China, as they believe that we are more familiar with this region.&nbsp; And, as Minister Tharman mentioned in his Budget Speech, Singapore is also becoming a centre for Islamic finance to service the growing economic links between the Middle East and East Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke about the strategic importance of Iran earlier.&nbsp; Senior Minister&nbsp;Goh Chok Tong will be visiting Iran in a few days' time.&nbsp; On Iran's nuclear programme, Singapore has always taken a firm position.&nbsp; We acknowledge Iran's right to develop nuclear technology for civilian purposes but this must be done under the supervision of the IAEA. &nbsp;It is necessary for Iran to comply with its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the IAEA safeguards regime.&nbsp; Since Iran has explained that its nuclear programme is a peaceful one, we hope that it will abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1737 and reduce what IAEA Director-General El Baradei called the 'confidence deficit'.&nbsp; We believe that Iran can play an important positive role in bringing peace and stability to a troubled region.&nbsp; Doing so would be in the interest of Iran and the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the Gulf, Singapore's relations with Egypt, Jordan and the Maghreb are all warming up.&nbsp; Last year, we established diplomatic relations with Libya.&nbsp; And I hope to visit Libya this coming May to explore opportunities for cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To deepen our knowledge of the Middle East, we will establish an institute to study the Middle East focusing on West Asia and North Africa.&nbsp; It will complement the existing Southeast Asian, East Asian and South Asian Institutes. Our Arab community in Singapore is an invaluable bridge we should use to re-establish links with that region. Many of our Arabs are Hadramis who are an unusually talented and entrepreneurial people. &nbsp;Recently, Minister Yaacob and I had lunch with members of the Arab Association to discuss how the Government can facilitate the Association's efforts to reinvigorate our Arabic heritage, including the teaching of the Arabic language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, with the unfolding of our second wing, Singapore's external engagement has grown dramatically in recent years.&nbsp; Singaporeans and Singapore companies can now be found all over the world, including Africa and Latin America.&nbsp; It is the job of the Foreign Ministry to help expand that external space for Singaporeans in this new phase of our national development.&nbsp; It is an exciting phase and one which I hope more Singaporeans would consider being a part of.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> Sir, the ASEAN Charter is intended to be a legal document, a mini-constitution for ASEAN integration. &nbsp;It would be drafted as a legal document. &nbsp;It would have provisions which will put upon its member states certain obligations. &nbsp;Should there be disputes, there will be provisions for dispute settlement.&nbsp;

It is important that we separate this from the issue on Myanmar, which does not come close to that situation. &nbsp;I appreciate why Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Charles Chong feel strongly about the situation in Myanmar.&nbsp;

If I may touch on the topic of Regional and Maritime Security.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Defence for an update on our regional and maritime security.&nbsp; The reason for the existence of the SAF is the safety, security and protection of Singapore.&nbsp; However, the external threats are not constant.&nbsp; In the 60s and 70s, there was communism.&nbsp; This changed over the decades to various other visual instabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most currently, the key threat to Singapore and our security is that of terrorism.&nbsp; Nobody can say that we do not&nbsp;live in an exciting neighbourhood.&nbsp; What this means though is that the regional security scenario is not static.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;changing every day, every month.&nbsp; The SAF exists to meet these external threats and because the external threats change from time to time, a clear analysis of regional security is necessary to ensure that we are well positioned to meet any of the security challenges that face Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I would be grateful if the Minister could share with us MINDEF's assessment of the regional security situation so that Singaporeans can understand better what it is that we are looking at and in what way we should be prepared.&nbsp; In this connection, I would just also like to ask the Minister if he could comment on an assertion that was made by an Indonesian official that the RSAF is flying over the Riau Islands without clearance from Jakarta.&nbsp; It would be appreciated if MINDEF could give us their perspective on this comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to touch briefly on maritime security.&nbsp; The Straits of Malacca and Singapore are amongst the busiest Straits in the world.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;estimated that half of the world's oil supply and a third of global trade passes through the Straits each year.&nbsp; Security of the Straits is therefore of paramount importance to the region and to Singapore in particular, given our role as an international commercial hub and being one of the busiest ports in the world.&nbsp; Piracy continues to be a problem in regional waters and this can have a very detrimental impact if it is not addressed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also of course the ever constant threat of terrorism.&nbsp;Any act of terrorism in the Straits or regional waters would have a devastating effect on our commerce.&nbsp; At one time, I recall Lloyd's has classified the Straits of Malacca as a war-risk zone even though no terrorist incident had taken place and this of course had an immediate adverse effect on commercial shipping, most notably on the insurance cost.&nbsp; Subsequently, I understand that after enforcement and surveillance, Lloyd's has in fact changed this and has delisted the Straits of Malacca as a war-risk zone but the potential for the threat in terms of terrorism or piracy remains and consequently the threat to our economy remains as well.&nbsp; It will be appreciated therefore if the Minister could update us and give a comment on the security situation as far as the Straits is concerned and what the SAF is doing to make the Straits a more secure place.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

From as early as the 1960s and 1970s, we have put our minds into exploring and developing more training facilities for our troops.&nbsp; Due to limited space within Singapore's territorial land and waters, some training programmes and facilities are located overseas.&nbsp; In the early years, we developed and established overseas&nbsp;training bases for our SAF in Thailand, Brunei and Taiwan.&nbsp; In fact, many of the male colleagues in this House probably had served at least one stint in one of the three overseas training facilities.&nbsp; This has also in no small way added to the increased mutual understanding between our countries and added much to bilateral cooperation on many fronts, not just military.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that we have over the last few years managed to extend cooperation with new countries for more training facilities.&nbsp; Some of these countries are Australia, New Zealand, France and even the US and India.&nbsp; Having new areas of defence cooperation, including joint training facilities,&nbsp;supplement existing bilateral cooperation.&nbsp; I was therefore puzzled to learn that our training facilities with Indonesia are not on the same footing as the other arrangements with so many other countries.&nbsp; I am further puzzled as to why the Indonesians would sacrifice closer cooperation activities that go beyond military, like economic, and most of all for Indonesia, humanitarian activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that our cooperation in the past on frequent military exchanges with our Indonesian neighbours had yielded good results too.&nbsp; It&nbsp; had facilitated, for instance, our boys in uniform helping out in Aceh smoothly and without any glitches.&nbsp; The coordination in such efforts cannot come about without close cooperation and working side by side with different forces during peacetime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, military-training facilities overseas&nbsp;are&nbsp;beneficial in more ways than one.&nbsp; It serves to enhance the peace and stability of the region and it is&nbsp;vital for our economic growth.&nbsp;

Along this line of 300,000 servicemen who have been trained to operate with more personnel when called to duty, their combat readiness might certainly be compromised if the training is not up to speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, retired Chief of Australian Defence Force, Prof. Peter Dennis, was quoted in an interview that history has shown that there is no substitute for boots on the ground when it comes to military superiority.

We certainly do not want our SAF officers to under-train or for the training environment to be so protected that it is unrealistic.&nbsp; Obviously, if we are going to send them into battle at some time or into whatever sort of operation, they need to be prepared and adequately trained.&nbsp; But at the same time, there is also a question of ensuring that these men and women who serve in the Armed Forces are also taken care of because we expect much from them.&nbsp; Because we expect much from them, it is also important that we do our part to ensure that their training is safe.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Having 40 years of experience, Singaporeans have embraced the importance of National Service and parents willingly let their sons go, albeit with some levels of anxiety.&nbsp; Certainly, at the top of every parent's mind is the safety of their sons.&nbsp; It is understandable for MINDEF to prepare parents for the reality that, in preparing their sons to be soldiers, parents cannot expect 100% accident-free situations.&nbsp; In fact, I think in every NSman's experience, he must have had some kind of injury, otherwise he would want to know what he actually did during his NS.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, while we understand that MINDEF will do all it can to prevent misadventures and accidents, we must make sure that the training conditions do not end up being artificial or severely contrived.&nbsp; In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how has MINDEF continued to ensure training safety, yet not at the expense of critical elements of realism in the training.&nbsp; What is MINDEF's public education effort in reaching out to parents to appreciate the fine balance that MINDEF has to strike between these two opposing forces?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is important that the SAF take near accident misses seriously in order to prevent accidents in the future.&nbsp; So, can I ask the Minister: has there been an increase in the number of near misses reported and how&nbsp;it deals with non-reporting of near accidents?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I quote George Washington who declared, \"It must be laid down, as a&nbsp;primary position and the basis of our (democratic) system, that every citizen who enjoys the protection of a free government owes not only a proportion of&nbsp;his property, but even his personal service to the defence of it.\"&nbsp; Although I have argued in this House for a shorter stint for our NS, it has not in anyway dented the belief in the essence of George Washington's declaration.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cornerstone of our defence force - the SAF- relies heavily on the conscription of our youth from the young age of 18 years.&nbsp; Our conscripted defence force had undergone quite&nbsp;massive transformation.&nbsp; We are into our Third Generation and a new military philosophy.&nbsp; Globally, there are views that the end of the conscripted army is near.&nbsp; They argued that military labour is now more complex and has demanded increasing professional personnel.&nbsp; Secondly, technological advancements have proven to be an effective force multiplier that can substitute, to some degree, physical soldiers in the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, here in Singapore, the maturity of our citizenry in recognising the institution of National Service is the chief reason for the SAF's success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service promotes universal values, inculcation of discipline and patriotism in citizens.&nbsp; It is especially beneficial for youth in character-building and it occurs at a time when they are more susceptible to outside influences.&nbsp; I believe that many parents shared in this belief as well as in the benefits not only to the country but also the overall development of their sons. Notwithstanding this, I am also sure that many parents also welcome a shorter stint for their sons in the service to the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is two years since we have reduced the stint of most of our NSmen to two years.&nbsp; It is timely to ask for an evaluation if the shorter stint has any effect on the operational readiness of our defence force.&nbsp; The Minister may also share with Members the adoption of more sophisticated technologies as the proverbial force multiplier that allows us to manage with a smaller number of men in the SAF.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

2007 marks the 40th year of National Service in Singapore.&nbsp; On 27th February 1967, the National Service (Amendment) Bill was first read in this House by the then Minister for Defence, Dr Goh Keng Swee.&nbsp; During his speech on the Second Reading on 13th March 1967, he said:&nbsp; \"I consider it to be wrong to believe that there is nothing we can or should do about defending ourselves, even though we cannot achieve complete invulnerability by our unaided efforts.\"&nbsp; After a spirited debate, the Bill was finally passed on 14th March 1967.&nbsp; But not all people shared the same sentiments of the need for a people's defence force that would be ready to defend Singapore.&nbsp; After the Act was passed, there were anti-National Service marches in various parts of Singapore.&nbsp; People took to the streets and the most serious one took place along New Bridge Road.&nbsp; These demonstrations saw some 300 people having to be dispersed with teargas and about 13 demonstrators detained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, between 28th March and 18th April 1967, registration for National Service began in earnest.&nbsp; This marked the beginning of our citizens' army and National Service has since become an entrenched way of life for every male citizen in Singapore.&nbsp; Our army has transformed itself in the last 40 years and our regular Armed Forces, together with our active National Servicemen and reserve forces, form a formidable defence force.&nbsp; It is, therefore, timely for MINDEF to update us on the following issues:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What is the state of our National Service today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; How has it been transformed over the last 40 years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; As we move into our Third Generation army, what part do our National Service personnel play in the 3G army, and has that transformation been complete?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Chairman, Sir, all NSmen face reservist liability.&nbsp; I understand that PES-C NSmen, including clerks, are subject to NS call-ups as well.&nbsp; I was told of a case where a company was deciding whether to locate an investment in Singapore.&nbsp; But they could go ahead in Singapore only if a PES-C NSmen could get a deferment from his ICT.&nbsp; He was crucial to the project, if it was to happen in Singapore.&nbsp; But his ICT clashed with an important deadline.&nbsp; Despite repeated requests, he was not granted a deferment.&nbsp; He went for his ICT and his company located the project in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I can understand the rationale if&nbsp;this NSmen was a key appointment holder and essential to the ICT.&nbsp; But he was not.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry what is the value of calling PES-C NSmen for reservist training and whether more flexibility can be introduced in considering deferment for NSmen who are not key appointment holders and, especially, if they are clerks?&nbsp; Is there sufficient consideration given to the actual benefit derived from calling up an NSmen compared to the potential opportunity cost to his employer and his career?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a wider dimension to this.&nbsp; Many NSmen seem to believe that NS liability has adversely affected their career prospects.&nbsp; There is also some anecdotal evidence about employers discriminating against Singaporean males to do their NS liability and in favour of foreign talent.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry will also&nbsp;state its position on this issue and explain what measures are in place to address such discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, Sir, National Service (NS) was introduced in 1967 by the then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew to prepare Singaporeans to defend Singapore.&nbsp; NS has been implemented for 40 years.&nbsp; Whether it is in the Air Force, Navy or Army, it has achieved remarkable results.&nbsp; To commemorate the 40th Anniversary, I believe that the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) will have a celebration this year to mark this significant milestone.&nbsp; The achievements over the past 40 years have been remarkable and personally I do feel proud having completed 2&frac12; years of NS.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to know if the Government will give recognition to our NSmen and give them some form of incentive.&nbsp; I would like to know what are the measures taken to ensure our security and safety and what is our role in safeguarding the regional safety and security of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><br>\r\n<B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao) in the Chair]<br>\r\n</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.33 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past 40 years of development, we have innovated and developed high-quality weapons and arms. Recently, I visited our NSmen who are training in New Zealand.&nbsp; According to the training officer, the 155-mm artillery that we are currently using is developed by DSO National Laboratories (&#26032;&#21152;&#22369;&#22269;&#38450;&#31185;&#25216;&#30740;&#31350;&#38498;). The shooting range is between 24 and 30 kilometres.&nbsp; Being a small country, it is thus not possible for us to use long-range weapons in our military exercises within Singapore. Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister, with advanced weapons being developed, whether we will have enough opportunities and training grounds for our NSmen to carry out military exercises accordingly, so as to improve their fighting techniques and combat skills.&nbsp; This will include our Navy, Air Force and Army.&nbsp; In this regard, I would also like to ask the Minister which are the countries that our army forces have been for military exercises.&nbsp; And what is our relationship with these countries in terms of military alliance?<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We are even attracting many of them at a very young age, giving them scholarships and, subsequently, PR status.&nbsp; We know that we require them to do National Service, to be fair to other Singaporeans.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, National Service is about a sense of commitment and patriotism to Singapore.&nbsp; It is about ownership of a country that one is born and raised in.&nbsp; It is about defending and protecting what belongs to oneself.&nbsp; We know our citizens feel this way.&nbsp; Can we expect our PRs, who are required to do National Service, to feel likewise?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of the unique NS experience is the blending of cultures and backgrounds into one common vision.&nbsp; Young men from different ethnic groups and socio-economic backgrounds are put together to live, learn and&nbsp;prepare to defend the nation together.&nbsp; With immigration, an influx of new PRs and naturalised citizens, I would like to ask the Minister how is the SAF managing the integration of these naturalised citizens through the NS experience.&nbsp; Have there been instances of naturalised citizens having difficulty adjusting, and how has the SAF managed such instances?&nbsp; A related question, Sir, is whether there is a difference between&nbsp;the adjustment and NS performance of naturalised citizens with Asian and those with non-Asian origins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, we heard recently that Government scholarships are awarded with PR status tied to it.&nbsp; With this PR status being offered at such an early age, what happens if they change their minds and revoke their PR status midway?&nbsp; What happens if later, when they are more mature, they decide to reapply for PR status and are prepared to serve their NS then?&nbsp; What is MINDEF's policy position for such cases?&nbsp; I understand that ICA's consideration for such cases is dependent on MINDEF's willingness to support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this issue has a greater implication on how naturalised citizens and PRs are assimilated and acculturated into the&nbsp;Singapore society, including our institutions like National Service.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how MINDEF works with ICA in ensuring that this important component of our society is&nbsp; stressed to each PR and new citizen.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There has been feedback from Singaporeans about how these foreigners get equal opportunities to education, jobs and a shot at a good and stable life in Singapore but yet these same foreigners are not happy and willing to have their sons to do National Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister how do our naturalised citizens contribute to&nbsp;Singapore's overall&nbsp;defence generally and National Service specifically?&nbsp; What is the level of performance of the naturalised Singaporeans in National Service?&nbsp; How supportive are the parents of these young naturalised citizens to the NS duties and obligations?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are also foreigners who became naturalised citizens later in their lives and, due to their age and other reasons, may not be eligible for NS.&nbsp; Over time, we will have more of such citizens, as long as we continue to remain open and welcome talents to our shores.&nbsp; If we have more of such citizens, the difference between those who serve in National Service and those who do not will become more pronounced.&nbsp; This difference, if left unattended, may not be healthy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the Minister consider a new or different form of National Service for male naturalised citizens if, at the moment they become citizens, they are no longer eligible for the traditional National Service obligations?&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, it would be beneficial both for our country and also the new citizens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, they could feel proud that they have contributed, like all the other male Singaporeans, to the country's defence and, in the process, build stronger bonds and ties to their new homeland.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, our country would be able to optimise on the addition of those new citizens for our defence manpower needs and tap on their skills and talent.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

ASEAN will have to work more closely and cohesively together if it is to retain its place in the driving seat of developments in our region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As strategic re-alignments take shape, we are maintaining friendly defence relations with each of the key players in the Asia-Pacific and engaging them to enhance regional stability.&nbsp;With the US, the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) signed in July 2005 provides the foundation.&nbsp; Within this framework, the Strategic Security Policy Dialogue between MINDEF and the US DoD, where both sides exchange views on security issues and explore areas for cooperation, was inaugurated last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to enjoy close and deep ties with the US.&nbsp; We train together in many bilateral and multi-lateral exercises, and US forces are able to make use of our base facilities, including Changi Naval Base. Our F-16, Apache and Chinook detachments have high-end training in the US, and they will soon be joined by an F-15 training detachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are establishing a policy dialogue with China, and stepping up exchanges of visits between the SAF and PLA and the attendance of each other's courses.&nbsp; Our defence relations with India continue to expand in scope, with an annual policy dialogue between MINDEF and the Indian Ministry of Defence. The SAF conducts significant exercises with their Indian counterparts both in India and in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Japan, MINDEF and the Japanese Ministry of Defence conduct regular policy dialogues, while the SAF and the Japan Self-Defence Force have staff-level talks at both the Joint and Services level and increasing interactions in multilateral and bilateral activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;These interactions underline our commitment to an inclusive regional security architecture anchored on a strong US presence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globalisation undermines old certainties in other ways as well.&nbsp; Businesses are more mobile, communities less rooted, the gaps between skilled and unskilled, rich and poor widening.&nbsp; All this creates dynamism, but also dislocation and sometimes a sense of grievance that breeds conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an inter-connected world, the aftershocks of conflict or extremist ideology in one country can radicalise people in other parts of the world.&nbsp; The Middle East will persist as a source of international terror if governments cannot fight the roots of extremism and radical Islam on their own soil.&nbsp; In Southeast Asia, domestic faultlines centred on religious and ethnic affiliation, if left unchecked, could emerge as potent forces that straddle countries and borders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, compared to the certainties of the Cold War, today's threats have become more complex and fluid.&nbsp; Terrorism is transnational and driven by non-state actors.&nbsp; It adopts asymmetric strategies and uses technologies in unanticipated ways.&nbsp; This means that in the future, our military will not only be called upon to carry out traditional combat operations, but will also have to respond to security contingencies that manifest in unexpected places and in unexpected ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this backdrop of international uncertainty that we continue to pursue diplomacy and deterrence - the twin pillars of our defence policy.&nbsp; We have made important advances on both fronts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the diplomatic front, we promote our security by building relationships with friendly countries and armed forces, and contributing to a stable co-operative regional environment and international order.&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked about the state of defence cooperation in the region.&nbsp; We have focused on building an open, inclusive regional security architecture that constructively engages extra-regional countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working with our ASEAN neighbours to build confidence and facilitate dialogue amongst ourselves and also to engage countries beyond the region that have a stake in regional stability.&nbsp; The establishment of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting in May last year was a historic development.&nbsp; It was the first time the ASEAN Defence Ministers met.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ADMM will guide the development of an ASEAN defence community that facilitates concrete forms of practical cooperation among regional armed forces.&nbsp; It can also help entrench the open and inclusive ethos of the evolving regional security architecture, by institutionalising the engagement of key extra-regional countries in practical and constructive ways.&nbsp; Singapore will have the honour of&nbsp;hosting the second ADMM later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We play an active role in other regional groupings that enhance security, like the Five Power Defence Arrangements.&nbsp; The FPDA brings together Malaysia and Singapore and anchors its extra-regional partners Australia, New Zealand and the UK in the region.&nbsp; By widening its scope to include cooperation against non-conventional threats such as in maritime security, the FPDA has proved to be an adaptive organisation, relevant to the changing strategic environment and the needs of its members.&nbsp; In June 2006, the FPDA Defence Ministers further agreed that the FPDA could explore cooperation in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Arthur Fong asked about how our defence relations, particularly&nbsp;with Thailand&nbsp;and Indonesia, have affected SAF exercises and training.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF currently conducts exercises and training in about a dozen countries around the world, including Australia, Brunei, France, India, New Zealand, Thailand and the US.&nbsp; So Mr Ang Mong Seng need not be unduly concerned because we do have enough places where we can exercise and train with our various systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendly and mutually beneficial relations which the SAF has with the armed forces of these countries add an important dimension to the overall bilateral relations that we have with them, even if, from time to time, our relations with a particular country may go through a rough patch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Fong asked about our relations with&nbsp;Indonesia and Thailand. The SAF and the Royal Thai Armed Forces have, for the last&nbsp;three decades, cooperated closely in many areas for mutual benefit.&nbsp; The SAF deeply appreciates and values this close cooperative relationship and the opportunities that this provides for the SAF to train and exercise in Thailand. We are similarly happy to welcome our Thai friends for visits, exercises and training in Singapore.&nbsp; For example, the Royal Thai Navy is one of the most frequent users of Changi Naval Base, where its ships call for replenishment as they deploy between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.&nbsp; The SAF and the Royal Thai Armed Forces have also worked together in humanitarian relief operations.&nbsp; Following the floods and landslides in Thailand in May 2006, three Chinook helicopters were deployed to assist the Thais in their humanitarian relief efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the close defence ties, the RSAF transferred&nbsp;seven F-16A/B fighter aircraft to the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) in 2004. Close defence ties have brought substantial professional and practical value to both our armed forces. Recent developments notwithstanding, both Singapore and Thailand continue to share the view that defence cooperation between our two countries is in the long-term strategic interest of both countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore and Indonesia also have a long history of defence cooperation, and have trained together regularly since the 1970s.&nbsp; In fact, I had the honour of taking part in the first military exercise between Indonesia and Singapore - the Exercise Eagle in 1974.&nbsp; The SAF and TNI conduct regular bilateral exercises across all three Services. TNI and SAF officers regularly attend each other&rsquo;s command and staff colleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve&nbsp;TNI officers have received postgraduate scholarships to attend Masters courses at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Indonesian pilots undergo G-tolerance and helicopter simulator training in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last&nbsp;10 years, 200 Indonesian Air Force pilots have benefited from such training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Familiarity with operating together, as well as strong personal ties between our officers, has allowed the TNI and SAF to work closely in times of need.&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined relief operations that the SAF conducted with the TNI following the tsunami and earthquake in 2004 and 2005 were on an unprecedented scale. The TNI and SAF have a long history of working together in challenging situations, such as when the TNI provided invaluable assistance to Singapore in the search and rescue operations following the SilkAir MI 185 crash in Palembang in 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; The TNI and SAF also worked together in hostage rescue operations in West Papua in 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;An SAF Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV)&nbsp;detachment worked closely with the Indonesian special forces in Timika in West Papua, providing surveillance which proved crucial in facilitating the successful rescue of Indonesian and foreign hostages</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

To further strengthen defence cooperation between Singapore and Indonesia, Prime Minister&nbsp;Lee Hsien Loong and President Yudhoyono agreed in October 2005 to conclude a Defence Cooperation Agreement, which will be negotiated in parallel and concluded together as one package with the extradition treaty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DCA will be an important symbol of the close ties between Singapore and Indonesia, and will provide a framework to enhance our defence cooperation to mutual benefit.&nbsp; The DCA will encapsulate our existing defence cooperation, and allow us to work together on new projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be able to resume our cooperation in joint projects, such as the Air Combat Manoeuvring Range and Air Weapons Range in Sumatra, which were of significant professional value to both our air forces, as well as re-start the Combined Fighter Weapons Instructor Course&nbsp; - a top gun course - to allow fighter pilots from both air forces to train together to improve their skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defence officials from both sides have been discussing the DCA, and making progress towards concluding the agreement.&nbsp; While some outstanding issues remain, both sides have shown flexibility and have narrowed differences over these issues in the course of the negotiations. &nbsp;There is a convergence of views on many issues in the DCA.&nbsp;We look forward to working with Indonesia to successfully conclude this Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked about&nbsp;allegations of violations of Indonesian airspace by RSAF aircraft.&nbsp; Sir, I can say categorically that there is no truth in this report.&nbsp; In fact, the Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces, Air Chief Marshall Djoko Soeyanto,&nbsp;was reported in the <I>Batam Post</I> as saying, \"The minute Singaporean fighters take off, they would have passed the border.\"&nbsp; So, since 1980, the designated military training areas 1 and 2 are&nbsp;in the South China Sea and in Batam for RSAF aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described the manoeuvring of Singapore F-16s to the border as natural and having nothing to do with provocation or intimidation in response to the sand ban.&nbsp; He added that there had been no reports of any violations by Singapore, and all Singaporean military activities in Indonesia are currently carried out in coordination with PangKohanudnas, ie, the Indonesian Air Defence Command.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from building strong defence ties, we are also making important contributions to international and regional security.&nbsp;We are playing an active role in multilateral efforts to enhance maritime security.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi asked about the situation in the South China Sea.&nbsp; There has been no recent escalation in military activities in the South China Sea.&nbsp; In 2002, the 10 member states of ASEAN and China signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.&nbsp; The signatories affirmed freedom of navigation and over-flight in the South China Sea in line with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and undertook to resolve territorial disputes by peaceful means through friendly consultations and negotiations, and such consultations and negotiations continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Ong Chit Chung asked how we are cooperating with neighbouring countries to ensure maritime security.&nbsp; Over the last three years, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have jointly launched air and sea patrols to safeguard the Malacca Straits.&nbsp; These efforts have met with encouraging success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2006, the London-based insurance body Lloyd's removed its war risk rating for merchant ships using the Straits of Malacca.&nbsp; In November 2006, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) has an Information Sharing Centre (ISC) which was also officially launched in Singapore.&nbsp; This is the first time regional governments have institutionalised their efforts to combat piracy and robbery against ships in the form of a permanent body with full-time staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong asked about measures to ensure our ports are safe.&nbsp; Singapore has adopted a comprehensive approach to port security.&nbsp;Since 2003, Singapore has subscribed to the Container Security Initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this initiative, the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority works with its US counterpart to screen US-bound containers for material which could be used in weapons of mass destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As risks to our ports can also originate upstream in the supply chain, Singapore established the National Supply Chain Security Programme in July last year.&nbsp; In terms of the physical security of our ports, Singapore has a network of sensors ashore and afloat that has been put in place by the Maritime and Port Authority, Police Coast Guard and the Republic of Singapore Navy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This network enables us to detect potential threats and mount a coordinated response in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min observed that the SAF has made significant contributions to disaster relief missions in recent years, and suggested that MINDEF set up a coordination centre between the SAF and Singaporean&nbsp;volunteer welfare organisations&nbsp;(VWOs) for such future&nbsp;missions.&nbsp; Dr Lam assumes, of course, that the VWOs want to be coordinated by MINDEF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF deployed for a number of relief operations over the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp; In May 2006, the SAF sent a medical team, together with the SCDF, to Yogyakarta on a relief mission following the earthquake in Central Java.&nbsp; Over the&nbsp;eight days of relief operations, the SAF medical team treated over 1,400 patients in a field hospital and through mobile medical teams together with the Indonesian authorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the same period, the SAF's C-130 and Fokker-50 aircraft also contributed to relief efforts, transporting equipment and emergency aid from Singapore to Yogyakarta.&nbsp; During that same period, the SAF was involved in another relief operation in Northern Thailand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of our Chinook helicopters were deployed there for flood&nbsp;relief efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also sent SAF medical staff to one of the affected villages, to treat the villagers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF currently cooperates closely with VWOs for relief operations, eg, with the Singapore Red Cross and Mercy Relief, during the tsunami relief operations.&nbsp; Given that there is already a good working relationship between MINDEF and VWOs during such operations, setting up a MINDEF-led central coordinating body may not be the best approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; VWOs may also decide to carry out humanitarian or relief work on their own where it may not be necessary or appropriate for the SAF to deploy and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF also maintained its commitment to peace support operations last year.&nbsp; SAF peacekeepers and monitors were deployed in Aceh in Indonesia and Timor Leste.&nbsp; Our Landing Ship Tank RSS Endeavour carried out a three-month deployment to the Arabian Gulf, followed by a three month deployment of a KC-135 tanker aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2003, we have made&nbsp;three deployments of LSTs and three deployments of KC-135 tankers and&nbsp;one C-130 aircraft deployment to the Gulf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome of the ongoing efforts to stabilise and reconstruct Iraq and Afghanistan will affect us all.&nbsp; Should the international community fail, the repercussions will be far-reaching.&nbsp; Southeast Asia will not escape the fallout.&nbsp;&nbsp;In today&rsquo;s interconnected world, security and stability are responsibilities that must be shared by all countries that want to live in peace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle against terrorism cannot be won overnight.&nbsp; Neither can the battle against terrorism be won by force alone.&nbsp; We must also win the struggle for hearts and minds.&nbsp; For this reason, Singapore is preparing to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan.&nbsp; Developments in Afghanistan have an impact on Singapore&rsquo;s security.&nbsp; Several of Singapore&rsquo;s JI detainees received their terrorist training in Afghanistan.&nbsp; They were part of a terror cell plotting to carry out attacks on targets in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorism operates without regard for national borders.&nbsp; Singapore is thus prepared to work together, within our means, with&nbsp;some 40 other countries currently working in Afghanistan to build the institutions, infrastructure and services that will bring brighter prospects to the people of Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF will thus&nbsp;be undertaking two humanitarian and reconstruction projects in Afghanistan as part of the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamiyan Province in central Afghanistan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF and&nbsp;the New Zealand Defence Force&nbsp;know each other very well and have previously deployed together in the UN mission in East Timor.&nbsp; The New Zealand Defence Force&nbsp;has operated in Bamiyan Province since 2003.&nbsp; Their personnel have built up a strong foundation of trust with the local community and provincial government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first project, the SAF will deploy a five-man medical team to Bamiyan hospital to set up a dental clinic.&nbsp; The SAF team will bring specialised equipment, set up the clinic, and train local Afghans to take over the clinic on a long-term basis.&nbsp; Separately, under the Singapore Co-operation Programme, training will also be provided to the Afghans in dentistry and basic healthcare so that they can build up sustainable capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the second project, a five-man SAF combat engineering team will undertake bridge construction and repair work, together with the New Zealand Defence Force&nbsp;and local Afghan contractors.&nbsp; The SAF assessed these projects would be most helpful to the Afghan people after consulting the New Zealand Defence Force and the Afghan Government as well as local Afghan authorities during a site visit made to Bamiyan province late last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each team will be deployed for three months.&nbsp; We are currently working out the details with the parties involved, including the New Zealand Defence Force, NATO and the Afghan government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, the Singapore Government will continue to contribute within our means to international peace support operations, as well as relief and reconstruction efforts where the SAF can usefully play a role.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the primary mission of the SAF will still be to defend Singapore.&nbsp; Our security is our top priority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Ms Irene Ng, Mr Arthur Fong and other Members asked about our priorities and the SAF&rsquo;s transformation efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the military front, we are developing the SAF to meet the full range of potential threats to our security&nbsp;- from an assault on our sovereignty and territory, to dealing with low-intensity conflicts, to fighting terrorism&nbsp;- while simultaneously transforming the SAF for tomorrow.&nbsp; These are our priorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to acquire and deploy cutting-edge weapon systems and information technology so that the SAF's operations will be characterised by speed, precision, knowledge and integration.&nbsp; These leverage on our strengths and allow us to overcome the constraints of our small population and size.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF's acquisition of advanced military hardware -&nbsp;such as the F-15SG, Seahawk naval helicopters, the Primus self-propelled howitzer, as well as the recently announced acquisition of the Leopard Tanks&nbsp;- replace older, less capable systems and add important new capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked me to describe the elephant.&nbsp; We have leopards, we have eagles, we have seahawks, we have pumas&nbsp;- super ones&nbsp; -&nbsp; we have falcons, we have zebras and, indeed, we have elephants too, and some mythical animals like the Pegasus, the winged horse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are trying to do in the&nbsp;Third Generation SAF is to harness all their vital qualities, bring them together, make them work together in a networked way so that we can draw on all their capabilities together to defend Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Third Generation SAF is not from having more platforms or specific platform capabilities&nbsp;alone.&nbsp; The strength of the Third Generation SAF is multiplied by our ability to network the various systems and capabilities, so that the overall fighting system is much more capable than the sum of the individual parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced command, control and communications, enabled by information technology and networking, now allow rapid dissemination of information, to give commanders and their subordinate units better awareness, and enable them to exercise better control and self-synchronisation in order to operate as a tightly integrated system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp;Third&nbsp;Generation SAF, the Army, Navy and Air Force operate jointly to leverage on each other's strike and manoeuvre capabilities to achieve the mission.&nbsp; On land, our capability comprises a network of unmanned sensors, precision missiles delivered by Apache attack helicopters, smart bombs delivered by fighter aircraft, and armoured forces on the ground.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;an air war, even navy frigates play a major role because their air defence systems are as capable as the Air Force's.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can thus find a target by multiple means, attack it at multiple points and in different ways simultaneously.&nbsp; The sensor-to-shooter cycle is reduced to a matter of minutes between the time a target appears, is positively identified, and is engaged&nbsp;and destroyed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elements within the Services have also become more tightly connected.&nbsp; The most recent development in the ongoing transformation of the Army into a leaner, closely networked force was the Battlefield Management System.&nbsp;&nbsp;This networked system enables the prompt sharing of information about locations and movements of friendly and enemy forces.&nbsp; It is basically a computer</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This capability provides ground manoeuvre forces the ability to increase their tempo of operations and their area of influence, and also allows Headquarters to command and control its forces more effectively.&nbsp; A picture is, of course, worth a thousand words and I invite the Members of the House to go and watch the DVD that we have provided to you in your little packages - these little 3G packages that have been distributed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sustain our technology edge, Mr Zainuddin Nordin rightly pointed out that sufficient resources and manpower need to be allocated for defence R&amp;D.&nbsp; Today, we have in MINDEF, the Defence Science Organisation National Laboratories and the Defence Science and Technology Agency, and&nbsp;we have some 3,000 engineers and scientists&nbsp; in these two organisations. We invest about 4% of our defence budget on R&amp;D.&nbsp; Within Singapore, we leverage on our defence industry, research institutes and institutes of higher learning to multiply our own capabilities.&nbsp; We also collaborate with international R&amp;D partners. Our ability to attract world-class partners such as DARPA - the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency - and the French Directorate of Armaments on win-win collaborative projects, shows that our R&amp;D effort has generated world-class technologies that renowned defence research agencies also find valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example is the combat information system on board the RSN's new Formidable-class frigate.&nbsp; This highly complex integration work and writing of the system software was carried out by our DSO and DSTA engineers.&nbsp; The system integrates all the combat systems together and provides the crew of the Formidable with state-of-the-art real-time decision-making tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is our Underground Ammunition facility, which will be commissioned later this year.&nbsp;More than&nbsp;10 years ago, DSTA, together with our R&amp;D partners in NUS, NTU, Norway, Sweden and the US, embarked on R&amp;D in underground rock cavern design and construction.&nbsp; The knowledge gained from this pioneering project resulted in several benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It freed up scarce surface land space for other uses.&nbsp; The expertise built up, enabled DSTA to advise other agencies such as Jurong Town Corporation on its recently announced project to build underground storage facilities for Jurong Island.&nbsp; The excavation for our underground facility also contributed a good supply of granite for construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology is only one dimension of our transformation efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also making significant organisational changes to ensure we are nimble and responsive in a complex and evolving operating environment.&nbsp; The revamp of the command structure of the RSAF announced in January this year, is the most recent example.&nbsp; The new structure is flatter, with greater decentralisation of decision making and lateral communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;This reflects the more varied tasks the air force has to perform today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The establishment of the first of the five new commands, the Air Defence and Operations Command, will allow more effective management of the full spectrum of air operations.&nbsp; The army organisation has also been restructured.&nbsp; I will not&nbsp;go into that.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;a nice figure inside the <I>Pioneer Magazine</I> or <I>Army</I> <I>News</I>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the heart of these transformation efforts is an innovative military.&nbsp; We can expect&nbsp;potential adversaries, both state and non-state, to be agile and adaptive, and we must constantly think faster and run ahead.&nbsp; We must be enterprising and adapt&nbsp;quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;But superior organisation and technology alone do not guarantee this.&nbsp; We can only achieve a sustainable edge over our emerging threats by also pursuing qualitative superiority and motivation, initiative, proficiency and the improvisational skills of our people.&nbsp;One example is this NDP that is&nbsp;going to be conducted on Marina Bay.&nbsp; The idea came from our Singapore combat engineers.&nbsp; They put it to us and we agreed.&nbsp; It was a very creative and innovative idea.&nbsp; We all look forward to it this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Ms Indranee Rajah pointed out, the strength of the SAF lies in the quality of our people and how well we train them.&nbsp; The SAF is committed to developing the full potential of all our people - NSFs, NSmen and regulars - and how we keep our NSmen up to date is why we place so much importance on ICT&nbsp;(in-camp training). 3G concepts, new training methods, new&nbsp;weapons and systems are systematically infused into our ICT training. And our technology-savvy and highly educated population is a great advantage in being able to transform the SAF because our people pick up technology so quickly.&nbsp; The SAF will continue to invest heavily in the training of our regular Servicemen.&nbsp; We will continue to send them overseas to learn, observe and bring home knowledge and experience.&nbsp; This will also ensure that the SAF always keeps abreast of the latest technology, operational concepts and training developments worldwide and benchmarks itself against the best in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be enhancing the education and training opportunities for our Warrant Officers and Specialists Corps to develop further as specialists in their respective functional areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ng asked whether Singapore's defence expenditure might be too big or might it even be sufficient?&nbsp; It does not make sense for a small country such as Singapore to have aggressive intentions towards any other country. Our defence posture is designed to deter military interference or pressure against Singapore, and to defend ourselves if our survival or vital national interests are at stake.&nbsp; A capable and operationally ready SAF ensures this. Other countries in the region are also putting emphasis on defence. According to the US Congressional Research Service, from 2002 to 2005, five Asian countries were among the top&nbsp;10 developing country arms importers - China, India, South Korea, Malaysia and Pakistan.&nbsp; Singapore, too, needs to prepare itself to meet the eventualities that may arise from the more uncertain and complex strategic and operational environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ng and Mr Low asked how we ensure that the defence budget is prudently utilised.&nbsp; MINDEF has rigorous checks in our budget process to ensure we use the money allocated to defence prudently.&nbsp; Overall, long-term force development plans are carefully drawn up and scrutinised in a process involving the three Services,&nbsp;the Joint Staff, MINDEF's Policy, Technology and Defence Management groups. They challenge each other.&nbsp; Operational needs and priorities, alternative force structures, and resource implications are studied in a rigorous iterative process to arrive at a long term plan which then has to be presented to the Minister and is subject to his approval.&nbsp; These plans map out the overall force structure requirements and match them to resources available, but that is&nbsp;not the end of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each individual acquisition programme has to be carefully scrutinised to determine need, evaluate options and decide on the most cost-effective solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF's acquisition process is well respected and recognised internationally for its professionalism, thoroughness and probity.&nbsp; Indeed, MINDEF's process for analysing the costs and benefits of competing proposals was adapted for use in the selection of our Integrated Resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF is mindful of its responsibility to spend wisely, and buy equipment carefully.&nbsp; We only buy what we need, and what is most suitable and cost effective for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We buy very sophisticated and highly capable equipment only when it is&nbsp;needed.&nbsp; Often, we do not need to buy the latest piece of equipment, when upgrading or refurbishing can do the job. When we replace older equipment with more modern ones, we often do not&nbsp;need to replace them on a one-for-one basis.&nbsp; For example, our A4 Skyhawks first came into operational service in refurbished condition in 1974. The Skyhawks subsequently underwent an engine and avionics upgrade in the late 1980s. When they retired from operational service recently, the Skyhawks had served the RSAF for 30 years and we replaced them with smaller numbers of more modern fighters.&nbsp; The SM1 tanks which are now being gradually retired, were bought as second-hand AMX-13 tanks from various countries in the late 1960s and refurbished.&nbsp; In the late 1980s, they were upgraded to SM1 standard and only now are we beginning to phase them out after over 40 years in the SAF.&nbsp; We have close to some 300 SM1s.&nbsp; We are replacing the first batch of the SM1s with the refurbished Leopard 2A4.&nbsp; We recently bought 66 with another 30 spare tanks from German army stocks.&nbsp; We will replace the remainder of the SM1s in the coming years, but not on a one-for-one basis as the Leopards, which are replacing the SM1s, are more capable.&nbsp; Certain prime equipment that the SAF uses are also refurbished.&nbsp;Our KC-135 tankers which we have deployed several times in the Gulf are refurbished tankers from the US Air Force.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Challenger class submarines as well as the Vastergotland class submarines we have contracted for, are also refurbished.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF also has mechanisms in place to control our operations and personnel costs very tightly.&nbsp; We control our operations cost by constantly seeking to streamline our orbat so that more cost-effective and capable systems replace less capable and less cost-effective ones.&nbsp; To limit personnel cost, we have maintained zero growth in establishment since 1986.&nbsp; &nbsp;We seek to extract the best value for money and maximise our defence capability for each defence dollar.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Government has stated that, as a policy, it is prepared to spend up to 6% of GDP on defence, in practice, defence spending in the last&nbsp;five years has been kept to between 4.5% and 5% of GDP.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;slightly lower than the 5% to 5.4% in the previous&nbsp;five years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is defence budget sufficient?&nbsp; The Ministry of&nbsp;Finance has provided MINDEF with what it has asked for.&nbsp; I will not hesitate to ask for more if I feel I need it.&nbsp; I am confident that I will be able to persuade my colleagues in the Ministry of&nbsp;Finance to provide it&nbsp;to me if I do because there is&nbsp;strong commitment for defence in this&nbsp;Government and also strong support from this House.&nbsp; By spending smart, we will continue to preserve the SAF's edge, and with it the peace and security which provide the foundation for the progress we have enjoyed these last 40 years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch now on National Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mark 40 years of National Service this year.&nbsp; The commitment of our 300,000 Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) has been the cornerstone of a strong SAF.&nbsp; We will continue to need National Service for the foreseeable future, as there is no other way in which we can build an SAF that is of sufficient size and capability to defend ourselves, given our small population. As Mr Arthur Fong has said, we still need the numbers.&nbsp; Although we go for quality and we try and keep the numbers down, as one military observer has said, \"Quantity has a quality all&nbsp;of its own.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our NSmen play a critical role in making the SAF a credible deterrent and fighting force.&nbsp; Since its inception, National Service has become a national institution and a rite of passage for all Singaporean men.&nbsp; More than 700,000 Singaporeans have served, or are serving National Service.&nbsp; Their common experience during National Service has helped forge robust bonds, a strong national identity, and, importantly, the collective will to defend ourselves.&nbsp; In a survey of NSmen conducted last year, an overwhelming majority of NSmen indicated that they will defend Singapore if it should come under threat and they will risk their lives to fight for Singapore in a war.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have about 360 NSmen who have volunteered to extend their operationally ready National Service.&nbsp; One of them is LTC(NS) See Tow Pak Onn, an NSman for more than 20 years and he voluntarily extended his NS commitments for close to&nbsp;six years todate.&nbsp; He will be our NDP Commander this year.&nbsp; We are thankful to have dedicated NSmen like Pak Onn in the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our investments in technology, systems and people in defence are our investment in a secure future, and they have paid off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite being such a small and vulnerable country, we have maintained our freedom and independence. A strong SAF serves as an effective deterrent, so that we prevent attacks and deter foreign interference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was gratified to read the recent series of <I>Forum</I> page letters to the <I>Straits Times</I> on defence spending.&nbsp; They show that many Singaporeans understand the need for a strong defence.&nbsp; Xiao Fuchun wrote in the&nbsp;30th January edition that Singapore's \"tiny size makes it a tempting target and only a strong SAF keeps potential aggressors in check.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a capability does not come free\".&nbsp; And Lu Junwen framed the issue well when he wrote that \"our armed forces have taken away aggression as a viable option of political intercourse with Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Having a capable defence force means its leaders can sit at the negotiating table and expect a fair negotiation session, instead of having conditions dictated to them by their counterparts&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.30 pm&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added, \"one cannot expect to have a capable military on call when one does not continually invest in its capabilities\" because \"military capabilities, once sacrificed as a result of funding cuts, can take an inordinate amount of time to restore\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for these reasons that we are prepared to invest steadily in defence.&nbsp; This enables Singapore to have a credible military built around a relatively small standing force of conscripts and career soldiers, and a much larger force of NSmen who are well-trained, experienced and available on short notice.&nbsp; It also ensures we have the means to train and equip our NSmen in the best possible way, so that if they have to fight, they will win and come home safely.&nbsp; These investments ensure that we and our families can live our lives in peace and security and determine our own future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now ask Dr Ng to speak on the important subject of safety, particularly, and also Prof. Koo to speak more about National Service.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some Members have asked about training safety in SAF. When I listened to the speeches of&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Mohamad Maliki, Mr Hawazi Daipi, I was very gratified that they understand that while we have to do everything that is possible to make training safe, we should at the same time ensure that there is realism in training, that realistic training is not compromised. All of us understand that we need to put our men and women in the SAF through realistic scenarios, and that means that you have to do it at appropriate levels of physical rigour, in varied terrain, so that when they enter the operational arena, they do so with the well-founded confidence to fulfil their missions and, as the Minister said, to win. However, even as we train realistically, let me assure this House and the public that the SAF values every soldier and will do our utmost to ensure his safety and well-being. As Members of this House said,&nbsp;we recognise that it is someone's son or relative.&nbsp;To achieve this, SAF adopts best practices and a comprehensive safety system.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three fundamentals that drive this safety system.&nbsp; First, safety management receives attention at the highest level.&nbsp; Second, we resource it adequately, and,&nbsp;third, there are open reporting and tracking mechanisms in place, as Mr Hawazi alluded to.&nbsp;Let me start with the first point, top management attention. The Chief of Defence Force chairs a Committee that promotes safety efforts, and it comprises all the Service Chiefs and Senior Officers of the Joint Staff. This Committee develops and drives strategies and measures to promote safety consciousness, and it regularly reviews the safety records of the various formations and units. This extends down to the Services, Formations, training institutes and units, where similar management focus is paid. Both overseas and local training, in both of these, safety is a key consideration in training design and execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We substantially resource these efforts to improve safety. Safety officers are specially appointed to actively assist units to oversee training safety and implement the best practices. Audits and inspections, including surprise runs, are carried out regularly to make sure that the units comply with authorised regulations. So, for example, last year, over 2,000 safety audits were carried out and most units showed improvement compared to previous years. These results are reported to the Service Chiefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our basic underlying approach is not to wait for incidents to occur, but to reduce risks to minimise the chance of these incidents occurring. And this is the reason why we have instituted open reporting and tracking mechanisms. In other words, units are actively encouraged, commanders encourage their soldiers to report hazards, near misses, safety breaches and at-risk behaviours. And this allows us to take immediate corrective action. In addition, trends are analysed to identify potential trouble spots where we can take corrective actions. Mr Hawazi asked whether this has taken root.&nbsp; One sign is that there is an increasing number of near misses reported. We take it that this shows that&nbsp;an open reporting culture is indeed taking root in the Army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are Division and Formation Safety Hotlines, where the identity of the caller is protected, and this underscores the open culture that we want to inculcate and it provides servicemen with an alternative channel to report safety breaches and training safety issues without fear. Calls to the safety hotline will receive attention and action. And for cases assessed to be high-risk, the Formation Safety Officer will conduct the investigation and complete the safety report within 24 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these systemic efforts, the number of overall training incidents has decreased. Members have asked for an update, let me give some figures. It has decreased from 111 in work year 2004 to more than half, 55 for the current work year, as of January 2007. Ms Indranee Rajah asked for the hot spots, what the common types of injuries are. Analysis of trends had indicated that the common types of injuries are heat-related injuries or fractures suffered during physical or field training. And we have taken precautionary safety measures and there is a declining trend for both of these injuries over the past three years. Members have asked for the number of fatalities over the last three years. Let me give figures. In 2004, there was one death, due to training or operations, and there were four in 2005. This work year, there has been one fatality during special operations training. Each loss of life in training is one too many. We will do our utmost to ensure that none occurs but, unfortunately, from time to time, fatal incidents can occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not let up in our quest to achieve zero fatalities, and the SAF remains committed to strengthening its safety system through regular or targeted reviews based on trends of incidents and injuries. For example, we commissioned a review of special operations training last year. We are implementing the recommendations which have included rigorous formal instructor preparation courses, independent assessments of safety structures and features for special operations training, and devoting more supervisory, medical and safety resources for special operations units. And these measures will enable us to better manage the risks of special operations training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other areas also receiving attention relate to sudden cardiac death and heat injuries. Here, we are guided by professional inputs to put into place internationally-accepted best practices. We have introduced Automatic External Defibrillators for immediate use when strenuous physical training is conducted. Our cardiac risk screening regimes are consistent with best practices. Heart rate monitors have also been brought in for use by obese BMT recruits and for NSmen during IPPT Preparation Training and Remedial Training. To prevent heat injury, the SAF is working with the Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute to produce a personal heat strain monitor that keeps tabs on a user's core body temperature and warns him, not warms him, when it gets too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of occupational health and safety, the SAF has also adopted the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Schemes 18001 certification standards as an independent benchmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi asked whether training safety has adversely affected the SAF's operational readiness. We train with other armed forces elsewhere as a result of our bilateral and multilateral engagements, and we use those opportunities to benchmark our performance. In 2005, I visited Operation Forging Sabre, which is conducted in Mojave Desert, in Arizona. And Brigadier-General Douglas Stone, who&nbsp;was the&nbsp;Commanding General of the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command, had this to say, unsolicited, it was an interview, and I quote, \"The Singaporeans are highly disciplined and highly skilled. They put rounds right on the target(s), and that's very, very hard to do, and to be able to put it all together (he meant the UAVs, special forces, Apache helicopters, F-16s, artillery) is just a remarkable compliment to the professionalism of these forces.\" We do not go around soliciting for reassurance or compliments, but when these remarks are uttered, it is a quiet confidence that we are a capable armed forces that has won respect and recognition, and our recent humanitarian assistance deployments to Thailand and Indonesia also demonstrate that our servicemen are always operationally ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking forward, the ongoing SAF transformations will see greater decision making by individual soldiers. So we have to emphasise&nbsp;that every individual has to take personal responsibility, because safety is an individual, team and command responsibility, requiring efforts at every level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to two-year NS, which Mr Arthur Fong brought up. He has asked us for an assessment on how the reduction by six months has affected our abilities and our ability to use force multipliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reduced NS by two years in 2004 after carefully considering various factors. Larger cohort size was expected over the next&nbsp;10 years based on demographic trends and we benchmarked ourselves against the best training methodologies. We were also confident to manage the transition to these two years, because we have been able to achieve better training outcomes in shorter durations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this shortened NSF period does require our training to be more focused and tightly aligned to the operational competencies required in units. So what we have done is adopt a standards-based training methodology where units that have performed well can shorten the time on particular modules, and now we can optimise the time and resources we commit to different units and to different training needs. Where we can, as Members have mentioned, we employ technology to enhance and speed up learning. For example, we use simulators in the Individual Marksmanship Trainer in BMT. Likewise, the Gunnery Tactical Simulator has helped us optimise the limited training time for live firing and increased overall effectiveness. The Army has also introduced the new Battlefield Instrumentation System that can track two-sided soldier engagements, providing feedback on performance. In this way, more is learnt in each exercise. In other instances, we have used some case studies and new problem-based learning methodologies, as is done in the OCS now to improve learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are preparing ourselves for the larger cohort of NSFs who will join us in the coming years; greater training capacity in our training schools has been planned for. Instructors and commanders have also been increased. We have also factored in additional training resources, so that limited training time is optimised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these measures, I am happy to report that SAF has maintained its training standards, as shown by the consistent evaluation results for both basic soldiering skills and unit proficiency. Our operational standby units have also achieved good results during the operational audits conducted by our inspectorates. Our soldiers have risen to the challenges thus far. And their strong commitment and motivation, as well as the better educational profile, have allowed us to attain this required level&nbsp;within the two-year NS duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I want to remind Members of this House and the public, that the unit training requirements and the need for a standing force to be deployed for operational duties, such as protecting key installations, mean that we cannot further reduce the two-year full-time NS duration. We owe it to them to make sure that they have adequate time to train to reach the professional and proficiency standards required to fulfil their missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer asked&nbsp;several questions related to deferment and disruption; deferment of National Service. Let me just say the three principles governing our approach to these issues; deferment and disruption, I include disruption here. The first is that NS must be for meeting a critical need - to ensure our national security and survival, that is why we can call them up. The second&nbsp;is universality - with this National Service responsibility, it&nbsp;is the duty of every male Singaporean fit to serve. The third is equity or fairness in implementing the liabilities and duties of NSmen. These three principles are critical to preserve the integrity and strength of our National Service system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, all NS-liable males may be enlisted at the earliest opportunity upon turning 18 years. And this was provided for by the Enlistment Act, as young and fit enlistees can better withstand the rigours of military training. More importantly, as Members have noted, as NSmen form the backbone of the SAF, enlisting them young enables the SAF to be an energetic and able-bodied defence force optimised to fulfil its mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, MINDEF does exercise flexibility by allowing students to defer full-time NS to complete their studies up to the first education bar. The first education bar is the GCE 'A' level, the polytechnic diploma, or their equivalent, if that person does not exceed 19 years old as at 1st January of the course commencement year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Palmer asked about deferment for exceptional talents. MINDEF does defer full-time NS for exceptional talents, whether they are sportsmen, musicians or those in other categories, based on the merits, of course, of each case. In assessing them, MINDEF considers his past achievements, his potential in his chosen field and the need for the deferment.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As this is applied only to rare and exceptional talents, only a very small number had been deferred in the past.&nbsp; The most recent is a national sailor, Maximillan Soh, who has been granted deferment from full-time NS to&nbsp;August 2008 to allow him to train full-time for the 2008 Olympic Games.&nbsp; Maximillan has proven himself an exceptional sailor by winning gold medals at the recent Doha Asian Games and the 2005 SEA Games and as a potential Olympic medallist.&nbsp; Like everyone else, such individuals still have to serve NS and contribute to our defence after their deferment period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same principles articulated apply to deferment for Operationally-ready NSmen (ORNS).&nbsp; Granting deferment from ORNS has to be balanced with the need to maintain unit cohesion and operational readiness of the NSmen's unit.&nbsp; We ultimately hold the unit commander responsible for the unit's readiness and performance.&nbsp; In other words, if the button is pushed, he is responsible.&nbsp; Therefore, that unit commander should be given the authority to decide on deferment requests.&nbsp; They do so only when the deferment does not disrupt the unit's effort to build up operational readiness, fighting capabilities and team spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our NSmen are given many months' advance notice on their NS call-ups so that they can plan their commitments and avoid the call-up periods.&nbsp; Therefore, deferment for NSmen is given sparingly.&nbsp; In general, NSmen may request for deferment on grounds of new employment, newly established businesses, studies and examinations, and on compassionate grounds, including the birth of a child, marriage and death of a next-of-kin.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the regularity of training, NSmen granted deferment will be scheduled for make-up training.&nbsp; Disruptions from NS call-ups and training are granted to all NSmen who are away on overseas employment or studies for a continuous period of one year or longer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew has asked how we can actively engage employers, and we do, so that they can better understand the needs for NS and&nbsp;see how we can better address their concerns.&nbsp; For example, MINDEF organises employer visits where employers can witness what their NSmen do during in-camp training.&nbsp; I was in one such visit where an employer says, \"Thank you very much.&nbsp; I thought my employees were having a good time during their ICTs.&nbsp; But I realise they are really doing serious training, and that helps.\"&nbsp; This has helped employers appreciate the role of their employees and how they have a role as citizen-soldiers.&nbsp; And, indeed, quite a few employers have also told us that the certificate of service for full-time NS is really useful to them when they want to employ&nbsp;prospective job candidates.&nbsp; They look for it because, if this person can succeed as a commander, they think he can add to their organisation.&nbsp; They look more favourably on a candidate if he has been a commander, because it reflects capable leadership and initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew has also asked us about our policy on PES-C clerks' or reservists' duties.&nbsp; Let me first state that, through National Service, every serviceman is responsible for and expected to contribute to the defence of Singapore, the principle of universality I articulated earlier.&nbsp; The 3G SAF, as with all modern armies, requires servicemen of different vocations and specialisations to work together to fight as a cohesive unit.&nbsp; Therefore, we need frontline soldiers who need the critical combat support and combat service support sustainment to achieve their victories.&nbsp; Our NSF and NSmen are assigned to duties according to their Physical Employment Standard (PES).&nbsp; But let me remind Members and the public that a lower PES grading cannot and does not mean that less is required of that soldier.&nbsp; The responsibilities they are asked to shoulder in their vocations depend on their aptitude, motivation and demonstrated leadership qualities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service-fit&nbsp;servicemen or those graded PES-C, as alluded to by Mr Siew, therefore, can and do play important roles.&nbsp; We do deploy them on a diverse range of vocations, including doctors, technicians, signal operators, medics, drivers and clerks.&nbsp; Each one of them, in their own significant way, is a vital link in the defence of our nation.&nbsp; To enable our servicemen to carry out their duties, we need to call them back for annual in-camp training to refresh their skills and ensure that they are always operationally-ready.&nbsp; Otherwise, they will put the safety of their own lives and the lives of their comrades at risk.&nbsp; For these reasons, it would not be possible to exempt every PES-C NSman who is assigned to be a clerk.&nbsp; We do need them to carry out their duties in their units, and it would erode the cohesiveness of units if we were to disrupt them.&nbsp; Also, it is not equitable to exempt all PES-C clerks from in-camp training.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Mr Chairman, Sir, the training of our soldiers and units is of paramount importance to the operational readiness of the SAF, and a capable SAF is vital to the security of Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I will now answer the remaining questions on the 40th anniversary of NS, new citizens, financial control and National Day parade.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Michael Palmer asked about the key achievements of National Service (NS) and how it has been transformed over the years.&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer is a young man but he remembers his National Service days well.&nbsp; He also read up.&nbsp; It is true that in the early days when the NS Act was first moved, there were pockets of demonstrations.&nbsp; So there was not unanimous or even consensual support.&nbsp; And how has it&nbsp;transformed over the years?&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;40 years have passed and we are very pleased to report that the support for NS has been overwhelming. &nbsp;Survey after survey show that support for NS within the NSF ranks, NSmen and the public is well over 90%.&nbsp; In&nbsp;40 years, we have today over 300,000&nbsp;NSmen, not mentioning those like Dr Ong Chit Chung and myself who&nbsp;have been demobilised.&nbsp; The SAF would&nbsp;not be what it is today without the NSmen over the 40 years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But NS began very humbly.&nbsp; When the first batch of 900 recruits was enlisted on 17th August 1967, Basic Military Training (BMT) was a rude shock for some and an anxious time for many parents.&nbsp; Enlistees were then driven off in 3-ton trucks, and parents were only allowed to visit their sons in camp after two to three weeks.&nbsp; I remember I took a bus from my HDB flat to CMPB, was bundled up a 3-tonner, shouted at, went to two or three camps to collect my boots,&nbsp;uniforms, went to 1 SIR, and then we were given a dressing down by the sergeant.&nbsp; But times have changed.&nbsp; Today, we begin right, and it is a positive experience right from day one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much less anxiety about enlistment today.&nbsp; Today, enlistees are accompanied to the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) in Pulau Tekong or the units by their parents.&nbsp; Their parents come along with them, a proper send-off.&nbsp; Parents get a tour of all the facilities, eg,&nbsp;where they live,&nbsp;train,&nbsp;shoot and eat, and witness their sons' oath-taking and experience a typical meal at the cookhouse with them, where they eat together.&nbsp; By providing the parents&nbsp;with more information and enabling the parents to share in the NS experience, we reduce much parental anxiety about NSmen.&nbsp; We also allow the NSmen to call their parents when training is not in session, and NSmen can also contact their friends, girlfriends, parents, and now we are trying to use the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our philosophy of recruit training has also changed from the early days.&nbsp; Today, BMT takes a progressive, positive approach in training our soldiers, both physically and mentally.&nbsp; Our methods of physical training are also much more scientific, reducing the risks of injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a typical route march, for example.&nbsp; Before our recruits attempt the 24-kilometre route march, they go through shorter marches starting at four kilometres, then moving on to eight kilometres, 12 kilometres, and so on.&nbsp; There will be proper medical care, water-drinking drills,&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp; With this progressive approach, our recruits gradually build up their proficiency levels and graduate as confident soldiers at the end of BMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seek to make NS a challenging and positive experience for our young men.&nbsp; But that does not detract from our objective of developing rugged, operationally-ready citizen-soldiers.&nbsp; Making NS a positive experience is a highly significant way in which NS has been transformed.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another area of tremendous change is that&nbsp;of NS administration.&nbsp; The National Service Affairs Department (NSAD) was established in 2001 to improve the management of NS affairs.&nbsp; Last year, we launched the NS Portal, which is an on-line portal providing services and information to the NS community. &nbsp;This is a one-point one-touch service. &nbsp;I have got the front page of the NS portal.&nbsp; It is easy to remember and is so attractive.&nbsp; Today, NSmen can conveniently inform MINDEF of their overseas travel via SMS or&nbsp;the Internet, and conduct other transactions with ease - a one-point service.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have also asked how MINDEF has recognised the services of those who have contributed to NS over the last 40 years.&nbsp; The Minister, Mr Teo Chee Hean, earlier spoke about the importance of NS to our security and&nbsp;nation building, and of the strong commitment of our National Servicemen, well over 90% support across the board.&nbsp; It has, therefore, been a priority of MINDEF to give recognition to our NSmen.&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF regularly reviews the recognition that should be accorded to our NSmen.&nbsp; A committee to Recognise the Contributions of Operationally Ready NSmen to Total Defence (RECORD) is convened once every five years for this purpose.&nbsp; Over the years, MINDEF has implemented many recommendations put forth by RECORD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF is committed to implementing the recommendations of RECORD IV, the latest RECORD, which put forth its recommendations in early 2006.&nbsp; Last year, MINDEF implemented the 40th Anniversary NS Bonus as part of the Progress Package, which was given to all who have contributed to National Service.&nbsp; This year, we will be providing a higher quantum of NSmen Tax Relief for NS command and staff appointment holders.&nbsp; We will also be&nbsp;giving the ORNS Completion Award to NSmen who have completed their Operationally Ready NS training cycle.&nbsp; These are just some of RECORD IV's most recent recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As announced by the Second Minister for Finance during his Budget Speech, our NSFs, ie,&nbsp;National Service Full Time and NSmen, including those under 21, will receive an additional $100 of GST Credits as part of the recent GST offset measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAFRA is an integral part of the NS story and NS experience.&nbsp; After full-time NS, they move on to become NSmen and they receive this bundle of benefits as well.&nbsp; Through SAFRA, MINDEF aims to recognise the contributions of our NSmen and to facilitate cohesion among them, the units and the families.&nbsp; SAFRA achieves these objectives by providing members with quality facilities and attractive benefits at very, very cheap prices.&nbsp; Today, 35 years after inception, SAFRA has more than 230,000 members.&nbsp; Its growing membership is an indication of SAFRA's continued relevance to our NSmen.&nbsp; As part of RECORD IV's recommendations, a sixth clubhouse is currently being built to serve NSmen who live in the western part of Singapore, in Jurong.&nbsp; SAFRA will also be re-developing its Toa Payoh Clubhouse, the first clubhouse, and upgrading the Tampines Clubhouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we commemorate NS40?&nbsp; NS40 is not just events but a whole series of experiences over the last 40 years.&nbsp; But events are landmarks that we want to commemorate.&nbsp; There will be a calendar of events this year to record some of the important milestones over the 40 years.&nbsp; Highlights include an exhibition on NS, a commemorative book and a series of open houses.&nbsp; The Army and the Navy&nbsp;will each be opening one,&nbsp;and the opening of the Army Museum.&nbsp; The organising committee will be announcing the full slate of events very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Maliki Osman and Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about the contribution and commitment of new citizens to NS, and how they are integrating and adjusting to military life.&nbsp; Each year, we have a number of new citizens in full-time NS.&nbsp; They are born foreign nationals, they took up permanent residency, but have since been naturalised as Singapore Citizens.&nbsp; Like those who are born Singaporeans, they are enlisted for full-time NS upon reaching enlistment age and contribute to Operationally Ready NS thereafter.&nbsp; Others enlist as permanent residents and subsequently take up citizenship during or after full-time NS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we integrate these new citizens and PRs, as asked by Dr Maliki and Mr Zainudin?&nbsp; To start off, new citizens often have a limited understanding of National Service, as their fathers may not have done National Service. &nbsp;MINDEF, therefore, recognises these issues and organises visits for new citizens and their families to BMTC (Basic Military Training Camp) to allay any concerns that they may have prior to enlistment.&nbsp; Such visits have allowed many of our new citizens to transit smoothly into military life.&nbsp; I host these visits personally and want to assure these new citizens that life in BMTC is only slightly different from&nbsp;civilian life.&nbsp; There is a smooth transition from civilian&nbsp;life to military life.&nbsp; Similar visits are also organised for permanent residents and their families prior to enlistment.&nbsp; These take place after the boy has registered for NS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NS serves to provide new citizens and permanent residents with a first-hand experience of Singapore's diverse social fabric. &nbsp;This common experience has also helped bond new citizens and permanent residents to other Singaporeans and to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Maliki asked whether there is a difference between Asian NSmen and Non-Asian NSmen.&nbsp; We treat all NSmen&nbsp;the same.&nbsp; In fact, many non-Asian NSmen have transited into NS very well.&nbsp; And also among Asian NSmen, some are not so Asian.&nbsp; In fact, I just received an email from a schoolmate.&nbsp; He said, \"Dear Tsai Kee, I have not seen you for&nbsp;30 years. &nbsp;My son is now 22 years old. &nbsp;He has never been to Singapore, never studied in Singapore.&nbsp; He has just finished his university education in Stanford. He is coming back to Singapore.&nbsp; Can you help to enlist him early?\"&nbsp; So, this is a case of a Singaporean who has&nbsp;worked overseas for the past 22 years and his son has been in a foreign environment.&nbsp; He probably speaks American but he is coming back.&nbsp; He is Asian, but he may not be so Singaporean.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we will find a way&nbsp;to transit him into National Service. &nbsp;We treat Asians and non-Asians as just NSmen.&nbsp; We are colourblind.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my encounter with new citizens serving NS has been very positive.&nbsp; I have done many of these visits and, each time, I find interesting NSmen.&nbsp; I recently met 3SG&nbsp;Jagdeep Singh when I visited BMTC.&nbsp; Jagdeep was born in India, but has since taken up citizenship. After graduating from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with&nbsp;a Diploma in Information Technology, he was enlisted into BMTC, trained as an infantry specialist and&nbsp;was subsequently posted back to BMTC as an instructor, where he now trains future batches of recruits.&nbsp; He is a very interesting character and&nbsp;a very positive NSman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few years, an increasing number of new citizens have contributed to National Service.&nbsp; Mr Chairman, I see that the time has run out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; This being a very big budget involved, I will give you more time.&nbsp; Please give time for clarifications.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</B> Thank you, Mr Chairman, for your indulgence.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, as I have said, an increasing number of new citizens have contributed to National Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not just the number gained.&nbsp; Many have also volunteered their services beyond their call of duty and, in doing so, have demonstrated their commitment to Singapore's defence.&nbsp; Let me give you some examples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA(NS)&nbsp;Wong Hong Ting was a permanent resident (PR) who became a citizen during National Service. He volunteered to participate in Operation Flying Eagle, that means,&nbsp;the Tsunami Relief Operation, to provide relief to residents of Meulaboh, after it was struck by the tsunami in December 2004.&nbsp; He has since completed his full-time NS and is now pursuing a Degree in Science at the National University of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example, Sir, SSG(NS)&nbsp;Siu Yeung Fuk came to Singapore from Hong Kong when he was nine years old.&nbsp; He is 43 years of age today and has volunteered his services beyond the statutory age of 40 to continue serving as a company sergeant in an infantry brigade. Mr Siu is a dedicated NSman and was awarded the SAF's NSmen of the Year in 1998.&nbsp; The SAF is very proud to have dedicated servicemen, such as&nbsp;3SG Jagdeep Singh, LTA&nbsp;Wong, SSG Siu and many others like them.&nbsp; Welcome to the NS community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the Modified NS for \"First Generation\" New Citizens, Mr Arthur Fong and Mr Zainudin suggested that we introduce a modified form of NS for new citizens who were formerly first generation PRs to imbue in them the importance of national defence because they do not have&nbsp;a chance to do National Service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The People's Association (PA) has existing programmes to integrate new citizens and permanent residents into Singapore society.&nbsp; MINDEF will work with the PA to see how the programme can include elements that will help new citizens and PRs to better understand the importance of NS and national defence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the important issue of financial controls asked by Mr Low, I want to thank him for that question.&nbsp; Mr Low asked about our findings on the cases of procurement irregularities highlighted by the Auditor-General's Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there were three cases highlighted by the Auditor-General's Office.&nbsp; All&nbsp;three were incurred&nbsp;in the same overseas office, and involved the way that three contracts were awarded for renovation and minor works.&nbsp; Although industry practice overseas may differ from practices in Singapore, our officers performing such functions overseas still have to comply with the procurement rules and procedures that were established for the Singapore context.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF had investigated the cases thoroughly and found that the irregularities arose due to human lapses and negligence that led to breaches in the Government's standard procurement rules.&nbsp; The Government's procurement procedures would have been effective if they had not been breached due to human lapses and negligence. The individuals who circumvented the controls have been disciplined and no longer hold appointments with such responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to deter such problems, MINDEF has sent reminders to its overseas office to strictly abide by the procurement rules. The disciplinary action taken would also send a strong signal&nbsp;that such lapses are taken seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to reiterate that there are strong and sound financial controls in place in MINDEF. The irregularities reported were due to human lapses and have been seriously dealt with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on National Day Parade, Mrs Josephine Teo has asked for an update on the plans for National Day Parade over the next few years, while the new Kallang Sports Hub is being built.&nbsp; A&nbsp;temporary multi-purpose facility with a seating capacity for 27,000 spectators has been constructed next to the Esplanade, overlooking&nbsp;a floating platform anchored in Marina Bay. The concept of such a floating platform came from the SAF's Combat Engineer Formation which has the honour of organising this year's National Day Parade. The platform was built with&nbsp;engineering expertise from DSTA working in partnership with the industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from hosting other mass spectator events, from this year, the facility at Marina Bay will be used as a temporary site for National Day Parade until the new Sports Hub is ready. The seating capacity of the temporary facility is comparable to the number of people we can seat if the National Day Parade is held at the Padang. In keeping with the tradition, we will continue to hold the National Day Parade at the Padang once every few years. This also allows a mobile column to be on parade -&nbsp;a sight many Singaporeans take pride in and look forward to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be the first year that the National Day Parade will be held at the Marina Bay. The parade organisers plan to make use of the available water and air space along the floating platform to put on an exciting and memorable performance, one which&nbsp;will strengthen our bond as a people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Teo asked how we ensure that the NDP will not compromise on quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would not compromise on quality. We will ensure that it will be as well-run as those that were held in the Padang and Kallang Stadium.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we are going to Marina Bay, so we have the water features to overcome.&nbsp; But we are confident that we will give all Singaporeans an exciting birthday party.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we ensure it as a signature event, as Mrs Teo asked? A signature event will come when we bond&nbsp;all Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will involve as many Singaporeans as we can over the next few months. In fact, even before that, we have consulted Singaporeans and&nbsp;we will make sure that every National Day we will have this special effect of \"the lump in the throat\"&nbsp;feeling.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; We have some time for clarifications, after which it has been indicated to me that we carry on with the next cut.&nbsp; Ms Indranee.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah:</B> May I seek the following clarifications from the Minister for Defence?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of emphasis has been placed on high technology for the SAF.&nbsp; But in the context of the current security threats, especially terrorism, the terrorist approach appears to be low-technology, high-impact, such as September 11th, for example.&nbsp; My question is: what is the SAF doing in anticipated response to that kind of situation and appreciating of course that there has to be coordination with the Home Team?&nbsp;But, the SAF, of course, has its own specific areas of responsibility. That is the first clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is that:&nbsp; the Minister mentioned the regional conference between the Defence Ministers.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what was the main achievement at the end of that conference and what does he look forward to being achieved in the upcoming conference?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third clarification I wish to seek is in the context of training in India. Given that the terrain there is quite different from the terrain in Singapore and the immediate Southeast Asian region, what kind of training do we do there and what is the benefit that we get out of training in India?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> The SAF's role in combating terrorism is carried out in very close coordination with the Home Team. We provide certain very specialised capabilities which may not be cost-effective to develop in the Home Team. For example, the Anti-terrorist Assault Unit.&nbsp; It resides with the Special Operations Force (SOF) in the SAF, and they have&nbsp;very specialised high capabilities to deal with terrorist threats which may present themselves in a very complex way where&nbsp;you have to storm a building,&nbsp;an aircraft or&nbsp;a ship. And there may be multiple threats, not just the typical explosives or hostage threats, but threats from other kinds of capabilities that terrorists today may possess.&nbsp; The SOF will deal with that.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also take care of the low-tech threats&nbsp;which Ms Indranee talked about. We help the Home Team during very high profile events, such as the World Bank/IMF Conference. We took over the security in some of the more outlying areas so that the Home Team could redeploy policemen to places where they were needed,&nbsp;in Orchard Road&nbsp;and the area of the Convention Centre where it was more appropriate to have police officers, rather than to have a high presence of SAF personnel,&nbsp;although there were SAF personnel there in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of&nbsp;the other ways that we do this.&nbsp; And some of the low-tech things are, for example, ways that you can stop a vehicle which wants to crash into Jurong Island or polarise the spectacles so that sentries standing guard at the post can see more easily through the wound-up windows of a truck or a car. That helps with the security of these facilities.&nbsp; We have looked at all these things in great detail to see how we can help soldiers and, of course, our Home Team people, to operate in this kind of environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ADMM is an evolving organisation.&nbsp; We had our first meeting in Kuala Lumpur last year and we will host the next meeting this year.&nbsp; What we want to do is to set up an architecture which will result in practical cooperation.&nbsp; Before the ADMM meeting, we already have had a number of different groups meeting amongst the ASEAN members.&nbsp; We have CDFs&nbsp; informal meeting, for example.&nbsp; And we have meetings of intelligence chiefs. We have meetings of various Service Chiefs. And we have a number of bilateral and multi-lateral exercises taking place in ASEAN.&nbsp; One of the things we want the ADMM to do is to provide some kind of overall guidance and structure to these various activities so that they can proceed with better direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing which we want the ADMM to do is to develop an architecture where we can strengthen ourselves but, at the same time, engage extra regional countries which have something to contribute to the stability of our region. We know that our region occupies a very important position in Asia, at the confluence between India and China; at the confluence of major sea routes, air&nbsp;routes and also energy-rich. We know that other countries outside the region have an interest in the stability of&nbsp;our region in Southeast Asia and we want to engage them in a way which contributes to this stability. These are steps which we are taking along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On training in India, it&nbsp;has a wide variety of terrain.&nbsp; It is a very large country.&nbsp; It has got mountains, jungles and deserts.&nbsp; And it has got very good training facilities.&nbsp; The Indian Army is a very experienced armed forces.&nbsp; Our interaction with the Indian Army has been a very useful and interesting one, because they also have a range of equipment which we do not usually get to exercise with.&nbsp; This provides SAF with&nbsp;very challenging exercises to do.

Since this&nbsp;involves an overseas office, and I understand that MINDEF has more overseas offices in the past&nbsp;10 years or so,&nbsp;my concern is how does MINDEF supervise their overseas offices pertaining specifically to expenditure of the overseas offices as well as procurement?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there&nbsp;any specific oversight agency in MINDEF itself scrutinising expenditures and looking after the procurement procedures in the overseas offices?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next clarification I have&nbsp;pertains to the Minister's speech about the 3G SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand&nbsp;that one of the features of the 3G SAF&nbsp;is actually network-centric and force integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two important features are dependent very much on computer and communications systems.&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;ask the Minister for Defence what is the strategy that MINDEF employs in terms of ensuring the security and integrity of the communications system&nbsp;and I believe that communications system is going to be the backbone of the 3G SAF.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We take this very seriously.&nbsp; I am glad that Mr Low has brought up this issue because it allows us to make an explanation.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I should say that the points that Mr Low brought up are actually the points&nbsp;which were brought up in the AGO's report and it shows that this is a very important&nbsp;line of defence that we have in our system.&nbsp; In fact, I am very happy that the AGO is reporting in this way and is taking such a thorough look at MINDEF's accounts and accounting procedures because it gives me, as a Minister, a lot of reassurance that somebody else outside of MINDEF, that is the AGO, is actually keeping a very close watch on what is happening in the Ministry of Defence.&nbsp; And this is on top of the internal processes that we have in place in MINDEF, both&nbsp;within MINDEF here and in our overseas deployments.&nbsp; We do have an internal audit department which audits MINDEF carefully and I look at the report regularly; and where we have irregularities or where there are weaknesses, we do correct those from the internal audit report.&nbsp; But as I said, I am very happy to see that the AGO scrutinises MINDEF and all the other Ministries so carefully because it shows that the checks and balances that we have in our Government system are fully in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the subject of&nbsp;communications system, Mr Low is absolutely correct.&nbsp; Communications is the key.&nbsp; So we do have a very robust communications system.&nbsp; We have been strengthening up the corps of our communications system in the SAF over the years.&nbsp; We now have, for example, in the SAF, an officer who will be of&nbsp;Brigadier-General rank, who will be responsible for communications in the SAF, and that is across the three services.&nbsp; And that means communications by all means that we have available today,&nbsp;including satellite communications, terrestrial communications, broadband communications, and high-speed communications.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We have various committees.&nbsp; We have the&nbsp;ACCORD and we interact with employer organisations and we have awards for&nbsp;employers.&nbsp; Perhaps we should invite Members of the House to attend these to give a sense of how we engage the employers' community.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, our feedback from them is that&nbsp;there is no, if you like, systemic discrimination against NSmen; in fact, the reverse is true.&nbsp; Many of them had&nbsp;fed back that they actually value, as I said, the Certificate of Performance.&nbsp; They want to know how Singaporeans have&nbsp;performed in NS.&nbsp; We have one story where the employer&nbsp;said he had so many applications, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;shortlist&nbsp;them, so he said, \"OK.&nbsp; Show me those who have done well in NS and I will just concentrate and start there.\"&nbsp; But if there are specific instances that Members know, then, of course, please forward&nbsp;them to us and we can look at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of his question about calling up NSmen and losing out business opportunities, I admit there might be many instances where Singaporeans have to sacrifice, whether it is&nbsp;opportunity loss because of specific instances.&nbsp; We will try to reduce them because we give advance notice for deferment.&nbsp; But I accept that out there, in terms of our NSmen, there could be opportunities missed.&nbsp; That is why we choose other ways to recognise, through RECORD, through our NS bonuses, and, this year, in the GST offset credits.&nbsp; It is a very small token never commensurate with the sacrifices that our NSmen have to make but, nonetheless, there are certain ways that&nbsp;we can show that we appreciate their efforts and sacrifice.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There&nbsp;are economies of scale and it is more effective and efficient to do it that way.&nbsp; Sometimes, we co-develop with others a certain product or&nbsp;system where we have requirements and needs which coincide.&nbsp; Where we go into research and development, it is in those key areas where we either cannot get access to the technology because people will not&nbsp;sell it to us or there are particular needs and requirements that we have which other people do not pay as much attention to.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are some unique defence requirements that we have.&nbsp; We are very small, we have&nbsp;very short reaction times.&nbsp; Our weather and&nbsp;terrain&nbsp;are also unique because we are very tropical and we may require very&nbsp;specific solutions because of our cloud cover,&nbsp;vegetation cover,&nbsp;and temperatures where the generic solution may give a satisfactory answer but may not give an optimised answer.&nbsp; And if we can find the optimised answer for some of these things, it gives our systems the extra edge.&nbsp; So when you look at&nbsp;a vehicle, whether it is a tank,&nbsp;a weapon, a gun,&nbsp;an aeroplane or a ship, it may look the same outside; but inside, what it does can be different and the extra 5% or&nbsp;10% that our engineers can give&nbsp;can make&nbsp;a crucial difference, whether you win or lose the combat.&nbsp; And those are the types of things that&nbsp;we put our R&amp;D on, not the general things which we can purchase easily off the shelf.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I know that when the tsunami struck all along the Indian Ocean rim, there was a tremendous outpouring amongst Singaporeans, they wanted to do something to help.&nbsp; It was palpable.&nbsp;&nbsp;We could see that in our community -&nbsp;residents' committees and&nbsp;community centres were gathering together to collect money,&nbsp;food and clothing.&nbsp; School children were lining up&nbsp;to make contributions, they were volunteering at relief centres to pack goods, and so forth.&nbsp; There was such an outpouring.&nbsp; And the assistance that the SAF gave was part of that outpouring of goodwill, friendship, a common sense of humanity with our friends and neighbours, particularly in Indonesia and&nbsp;Thailand.&nbsp; What the SAF was able to contribute during this operation was to allow an expression on the part of Singaporeans of that sense of wanting to do something to help.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that the third LST that we sent -&nbsp;we sent three LSTs to Meulaboh in Indonesia -&nbsp;we brought along representatives of many of&nbsp; the NGO groups which had worked hard to make a contribution; and the commitment and dedication of those NGO and VWO volunteers when they got there was tremendous.&nbsp; It was something which has to be seen to be understood.&nbsp; I went to Meulaboh a couple of times and I saw them there; it&nbsp;was tremendous.&nbsp; So when it comes to humanitarian relief and&nbsp;disaster operations, we have to help because that was the right thing to do, and I still believe that it&nbsp;is the right thing to do despite&nbsp;the atmospherics that have happened in recent years.&nbsp; I am a little saddened by that.&nbsp; I suppose, in some quarters, memories can be short but, heaven forbid, if we were to be called upon again, I am sure that we will respond and&nbsp;Singaporeans will respond simply because it is the right thing to do, and Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines - these are all our neighbours and we are all brothers in ASEAN.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In general,&nbsp;we defer those who have contingencies, for example, a new job or a&nbsp;new baby comes along.&nbsp; So our commanders are not insensitive and, where they can, they do grant deferments.&nbsp;
