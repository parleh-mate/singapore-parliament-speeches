In the two  months  since  His\r\n\r\nExcellency's   Address  outlining   our   commercial\r\n\r\npolicy,  Government has established a Trade Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil.  It  has, as the House is  aware,  been  in\r\n\r\ncommunication  with  our  great  trading  neighbour,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  with a view to improving our  commercial\r\n\r\nrelationship.  Furthermore, plans for an  Industrial\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Corporation,   to   encourage    local\r\n\r\nindustries  along  the  lines  that  have  been   so\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  Hong Kong, are now  under  intensive\r\n\r\nstudy.  The  Report  of the International  Bank  for\r\n\r\nReconstruction and Development is being  studied  in\r\n\r\ndetail,  Sir,  and the question of the establishment\r\n\r\nof  a Central Bank is being pursued. The appointment\r\n\r\nof  an  Economic Adviser and an Economic Commission,\r\n\r\nof which this House has heard, and which it is hoped\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  take place in the  course  of  this\r\n\r\nyear,   will  assist  in  blueprinting  an   overall\r\n\r\ncommercial,  industrial and fiscal  policy  for  the\r\n\r\nnext few years. In the meanwhile, Sir, assistance in\r\n\r\nthe  industrial and commercial fields is taking  the\r\n\r\nform  of  attention  to individual  applications  on\r\n\r\ntheir   merits,  encouragement  to  the  extent   of\r\n\r\ngranting hard currency, and allowing immigration  of\r\n\r\nkey  personnel, where necessary, for the development\r\n\r\nof industry in this territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also draw attention to the Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance which is before the House this morning and\r\n\r\nwhich is the first step in Government's plan for the\r\n\r\namelioration of employer-employee relations and  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of industrial stability, so  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the  encouragement of capital to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  tie  opportunities that are  available  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  I  think  I ought to add,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  for technical education  which  are  now\r\n\r\nafoot would, it is expected, considerably assist  in\r\n\r\nthe  industrialisation, so necessary for our  future\r\n\r\nwelfare, the absorption of the unemployed of  today,\r\n\r\nand the youth seeking employment of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister\r\n\r\ngive  more detailed information regarding the  means\r\n\r\nthe  Government will use to attract private  capital\r\n\r\nfrom both local and overseas investors; for example,\r\n\r\nby  means  of giving income tax reliefs, initial  or\r\n\r\nannual  or both, on the cost of factory construction\r\n\r\nand initial plant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated\r\n\r\nthat  the  question  of  the  establishment  of   an\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Development  Corporation  is  proceeding\r\n\r\napace.

Political Parties  represented  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse have, through the Press, heaped abuse upon the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  its handling of these  events.  Yet\r\n\r\ntoday  we  have the extraordinary position that  not\r\n\r\none  single  member of these political  Parties  has\r\n\r\nseen  fit  to challenge in this House the action  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Though no Member of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nseeks  a debate, I consider it my duty to report  to\r\n\r\nthis House the facts as I know them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, a clique of P.A.P. politicians who\r\n\r\nmasquerade as trade unionists. On Friday, 10th June,\r\n\r\nI  received  from one of them what they  called  \"an\r\n\r\nultimatum to the Government\", indicating that unless\r\n\r\nthe   Government  settled  the  outstanding  dispute\r\n\r\nbetween the Harbour Board and its Staff Association,\r\n\r\nmore  than 20 trade unions, wholly unconnected  with\r\n\r\nthe  dispute,  would be called  out  on  a  sympathy\r\n\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several days prior to that Friday, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPress  had been giving considerable publicity  to  a\r\n\r\nstatement of a member of that clique, threatening an\r\n\r\nisland-wide sympathy strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has made repeated and earnest\r\n\r\nefforts  to  bring  about a settlement  between  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board and its Staff Association, but  there\r\n\r\nnever was question, and there can never be question,\r\n\r\nof  Government seeking to compel an employer  or  an\r\n\r\nemployee  to  surrender to the terms  of  the  other\r\n\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, Sir, that I received this so-called \"ultimatum\", reports began coming in of a very disturbing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharacter,  of intimidation of trade  unions  in  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to compel them to join the sympathy strike.\r\n\r\nThese reports suggested that some of the same forces\r\n\r\nas  those  which  brought about the tragedy  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent riots were at work, and indicated that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  strong  possibility that organised  violence\r\n\r\nmight  flare up under cover of the confusion of  the\r\n\r\nsympathy  strike. Our advisers, Sir, urged immediate\r\n\r\naction   to  protect  peaceful  citizens.   Security\r\n\r\narrangements were finalised, and I saw  this  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nclique  on  that  Friday night. When  they  left  my\r\n\r\noffice at 8 p.m., I believed that there would be  no\r\n\r\nsympathy  strike and that I would on  the  following\r\n\r\nmorning receive a communication from them. I did not\r\n\r\nhear  from any member of this clique on the Saturday\r\n\r\nmorning, and the emergency meeting of the Council of\r\n\r\nMinisters  on  that  Saturday  afternoon  considered\r\n\r\nreports of heightened activities and intimidation in\r\n\r\nfurtherance  of this sympathy strike which  was  set\r\n\r\nfor  the  following Monday. I made repeated  efforts\r\n\r\nthat  Saturday  afternoon to  get  members  of  this\r\n\r\nP.A.P. clique to see me. They did not appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was naturally very anxious to avoid\r\n\r\nunrest  and  violence which would cause considerable\r\n\r\nharm to our people and our commerce. We were anxious\r\n\r\nto  avoid using the Emergency Regulations. I dislike\r\n\r\nthe   Emergency  Regulations,  intensely.  It   was,\r\n\r\nhowever, an urgent question of protecting the people\r\n\r\nagainst  an  imminent threat of violence.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  on  Saturday evening,  authorisation\r\n\r\nwas   given  for  the  arrest  under  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations of a small number of persons believed to\r\n\r\nbe the sparking points of this threatened violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after this meeting, Sir, at 8 o'clock\r\n\r\nI  sought  once  more to persuade  members  of  this\r\n\r\nclique  to  see  me, and despite my urgent  request,\r\n\r\nthey  kept  me  waiting for one  hour,  and  finally\r\n\r\nappeared  at  nine.  At  9.20  p.m. they  issued  a\r\n\r\nstatement agreeing to call a meeting of trade unions\r\n\r\nto  consider  calling off the sympathy strike.  That\r\n\r\nstatement,  Sir,  materially modified  our  original\r\n\r\nplan  of arrests. A few arrests, however, were  made\r\n\r\nand the headquarters of the P.A.P. pseudo trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunionists  were searched. As a result of  this,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. clique  promptly sought  to  prostitute  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement and worked frantically for  the\r\n\r\nnext  few days to call out workers of the Colony  on\r\n\r\nstrike,  not  for  the  purposes  of  bettering  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of the workers, not for any question  of\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  the workers, but  openly  coercing\r\n\r\nGovernment into releasing the men it had arrested - an\r\n\r\naction  thought  necessary for the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was at no time any suggestion, Sir, from\r\n\r\nthis clique or its associates that this House should\r\n\r\nassemble  in  order to consider the  action  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which  they so loudly decried,  and  for\r\n\r\nwhich they were prepared to put this country to such\r\n\r\ninconvenience and such risks. It was an open  effort\r\n\r\nto  substitute mob government for government by  the\r\n\r\npeople's    elected   representatives.    Widespread\r\n\r\nintimidation and rumour-mongering were resorted  to.\r\n\r\nThe  security forces were constantly on  the  alert,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  the  knowledge of the strength  of  these\r\n\r\nsecurity forces and of Government's readiness to use\r\n\r\nthem,  as  well  as the few arrests which  had  been\r\n\r\nmade, are believed to have been the reasons for  the\r\n\r\nabsence of violence during those days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, large numbers of\r\n\r\nworkers,  reaching  a maximum of  15,000, excluding\r\n\r\nthose  who  were on legitimate strike, were  induced\r\n\r\nduring  those days to go out on strike,  dislocating\r\n\r\npassenger transport and considerably inconveniencing\r\n\r\nthe  public,  and alarming capital. Government  made\r\n\r\narrangements  for the transport of school  children,\r\n\r\nand  later for members of the public. The threat  by\r\n\r\nthis   P.A.P. clique  to  the  democratic   process\r\n\r\ncollapsed,  Sir, after five days, when  the  workers\r\n\r\nunder   their  domination,  led  by  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Company  workers, openly revolted  against\r\n\r\nbeing  used  as pawns in a political game,  and  the\r\n\r\nthreat to reinstate a general strike on the 26th  of\r\n\r\nJune failed to materialise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, there were eight persons arrested - two are\r\n\r\nfacing  open  trial in our Courts;  four  have  been\r\n\r\nreleased  as  the danger of violence in  which  they\r\n\r\nmight be used had passed, and I would like to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassure hon.

In\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances, only two of the eight continue\r\n\r\nto  be  detained.

We had the knowledge of a\r\n\r\nsmall group of persons who might be used as sparking\r\n\r\npoints for violence during these illegal strikes. It\r\n\r\nwould  have  been easy to make a clean  sweep  of  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of these people to such an extent as to\r\n\r\nprevent the general strike and subsequent threatened\r\n\r\nviolence from materialising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out to this House, however, that a\r\n\r\nvery  large  section  of our working  population  is\r\n\r\nilliterate; that it has for generations developed an\r\n\r\nantipathy to Government as such; that the widespread\r\n\r\narrests  which were indicated would have involved  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of persons in the P.A.P. movement.  The\r\n\r\nforces  that seek chaos in this country  would  have\r\n\r\nfound it easy then to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvince  the  common  worker, Sir,  that  executive\r\n\r\npower  was  being  abused  with  the  intention   of\r\n\r\ndestroying  political opponents, and  of  destroying\r\n\r\nthe  worker's movement by depriving him of  his  so-called  leaders. The ingrained traditional antipathy\r\n\r\nto  Government  as such by a large  section  of  our\r\n\r\nworking population would have been only too ready to\r\n\r\naccept  such an explanation, particularly  as  force\r\n\r\nand the Emergency Regulations are closely associated\r\n\r\nin  the  public mind with colonial rule. The  people\r\n\r\nhave  not  had the time, Sir, to recognise the  very\r\n\r\nreal  distinction between past governments and  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.

The Government hopes that this loyal\r\n\r\nsection   of   the  population  will   realise   the\r\n\r\ntremendous importance of the task of attracting  the\r\n\r\nloyalty  of  the illiterate worker to the democratic\r\n\r\nprocess,  of  making him realise that  this  is  his\r\n\r\nGovernment, and of achieving the harmonious  welding\r\n\r\nof  all sections and all interests in this territory\r\n\r\ninto  a  unified  loyalty. It  is  the  Government's\r\n\r\nbelief,  Sir, that the democratic process, which  is\r\n\r\nnow  rapidly  gaining ground,  can  best  serve  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of all the people and can adapt  itself  to\r\n\r\nthe pace of change that the public may demand at any\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misled workers who went out on strike at the\r\n\r\nbehest of this P.A.P. clique have, in fact, begun to\r\n\r\nrealise to what extent their welfare was sacrificed,\r\n\r\nand  the  trade union movement prostituted, for  the\r\n\r\npersonal,  selfish political ends of some  so-called\r\n\r\nleaders.  To  that extent it has been a victory  for\r\n\r\nthe  democratic process, where there could have been\r\n\r\na  very  grave  setback,  irretrievably  losing  the\r\n\r\npotential loyalty of a large mass of our population.\r\n\r\nThis is but the commencement of the process, and  as\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment gives further evidence of its deep desire\r\n\r\nfor the welfare of the worker and the masses of this\r\n\r\nterritory,  it  is hoped to attract and  consolidate\r\n\r\nthis  loyalty  of  this illiterate  section  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to express the gratitude of the Government\r\n\r\nfor  the patience and the loyalty of a large  number\r\n\r\nof  the citizens of this Colony in a time of stress,\r\n\r\nand  for  the sense of responsibility and  stability\r\n\r\nshown by many trade union leaders who did not permit\r\n\r\ntheir unions to be prostituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure this House that we have the\r\n\r\nstrength to meet all emergencies that may arise, and\r\n\r\nwe  will  use  that  strength when  we  consider  it\r\n\r\nnecessary for the welfare of all the people of  this\r\n\r\nterritory.

Members the  urgency,\r\n\r\nor the reason for the urgency, of carrying this Bill\r\n\r\nthrough all stages at this sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Ordinance was enacted\r\n\r\nin  1953, and was to have come into force on May Day\r\n\r\nthis  year.  However, soon after I  took  office  in\r\n\r\nApril,   representations  were  made  to   me   that\r\n\r\namendments  were necessary to the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund Ordinance. It was therefore decided to postpone\r\n\r\nthe   operation   of   the  Fund   so   that   these\r\n\r\nrepresentations   could  be   considered   and   any\r\n\r\nnecessary  amendments prepared. This, Sir,  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen done,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the Bill before the House is the result. It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that there should be no further  delay  in\r\n\r\nputting into operation the Central Provident Fund so\r\n\r\nthat  it  can start during the second half  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that are sought today, Sir, are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  ensure the smoother  working  of  the\r\n\r\nFund - hence the Certificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 2 of the Bill provides for the\r\n\r\noperation of the Fund as from July 1st, and for  the\r\n\r\nrefund  of  any deductions which may have been  made\r\n\r\nbefore that date. But it also provides that if  both\r\n\r\nparties agree, such deductions may be paid into  the\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the changes embodied in these amendments\r\n\r\nare minor changes, suggested by the Board to ensure,\r\n\r\nas  I said earlier, Sir, the smoother working of the\r\n\r\nFund.  The purpose of these is set out in detail  in\r\n\r\nthe  Objects and Reasons, and I do not think  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  me  to  dwell on  them.  There  are,\r\n\r\nhowever,   several   changes   of   substance    and\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, Sir, and the new Schedule to which it\r\n\r\nrefers,  provide that employees who  earn  not  more\r\n\r\nthan $200 per month do not have to contribute to the\r\n\r\nFund,  though their employers must still make  their\r\n\r\ncontributions of 5 per cent of their wages.  It  was\r\n\r\nput  to  me,  Sir,  that the lower-paid  workers  in\r\n\r\npresent  circumstances cannot afford to lay aside  5\r\n\r\nper  cent of their wages each month, even though  it\r\n\r\nis  to provide an investment for the future. It  can\r\n\r\nhardly  be denied that this is true, and that  these\r\n\r\nlower-paid  workers should therefore be exempt  from\r\n\r\ncontributing to the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special provision is put into the Schedule so\r\n\r\nthat  an  employee whose wages are between $200  and\r\n\r\n$210.50 in any month shall not pay a full 5 per cent\r\n\r\ncontribution, but only so much as would  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnet amount he would receive as pay for the month  to\r\n\r\n$200.  Without  this provision,  an  employee  whose\r\n\r\nwages were in this zone would have less to take home\r\n\r\nthan the employee whose wages were only $200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 (a), Sir, amends subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection  21  of  the  principal  Ordinance  so  that\r\n\r\nprivate  provident  funds or  schemes  will  not  be\r\n\r\neligible  for approval unless they were  established\r\n\r\nbefore 11th December, 1953, the date of enactment of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance.  The Ordinance in its  present  form\r\n\r\nrequires the Board to approve of any private fund or\r\n\r\nscheme established by an employer at any time, if it\r\n\r\nprovides pecuniary benefits for the employees of not\r\n\r\nless  value  than  the benefits provided  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Employees who are members  of  any  fund\r\n\r\nwhich  is  approved will not be liable to contribute\r\n\r\nto  the  Central  Provident  Fund,  nor  will  their\r\n\r\nemployers  be  liable to contribute  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthem.  If  this  is permitted, Sir,  it  means  that\r\n\r\nemployees  can  be  removed from the  scope  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund at any time by the setting up\r\n\r\nof  new schemes, and the number of employees covered\r\n\r\nby  the  Fund will diminish. The cost of supervising\r\n\r\nthese  schemes  would have to be met  by  the  Board\r\n\r\nwhich  would be receiving no income from investments\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  them. What is even more  important,\r\n\r\nSir, is that it would, in practice, be impossible to\r\n\r\nensure  that  contributions to numerous  funds  were\r\n\r\npaid  correctly, or that employees received the full\r\n\r\nbenefits  due to them. This amendment would  prevent\r\n\r\nthis  anomalous  state of affairs, though  it  would\r\n\r\nnot, of course, prevent an employer from setting  up\r\n\r\nanother scheme in addition to participating  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund if he so wished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 (b), Sir, seeks to add additional\r\n\r\nsubsections  to section 21 of the Ordinance,  and  a\r\n\r\nnew  subsection  (8) gives power  to  the  Board  to\r\n\r\nexempt  non-domiciled employees  getting  more  than\r\n\r\n$500  per  month as wages who already enjoy adequate\r\n\r\nretirement   benefit  rights.  There   are   certain\r\n\r\nemployees in Singapore who have pension rights under\r\n\r\nvarious  schemes  provided by  their  employers,  or\r\n\r\nunder government schemes in other countries, and who\r\n\r\nare  not  domiciled in Malaya, to  whom  it  may  be\r\n\r\nreasonable to give exemption\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  contributing  to the Central  Provident  Fund.\r\n\r\nSuch  schemes cannot generally be amended  to  bring\r\n\r\nthem   within  the  provisions  of  the   Ordinance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  the retirement benefits  provided  by\r\n\r\nthese  schemes  may be quite adequate in  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  the  amount  which would be payable  from  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund on reaching the age  of  55,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the case of employees  whose  wages\r\n\r\nare  over $500 per month, for whom the Central  Fund\r\n\r\ncontribution is at the rate of less than 5 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  their  wages. It is proposed to give  the  Board\r\n\r\nunder  this  new  subsection powers to  exempt  such\r\n\r\nindividual employees if they apply for exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21, Sir, in addition to exempting employees\r\n\r\nearning  not  more than $200 per month,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nalready mentioned, substitutes contributions at  the\r\n\r\nflat  rate of 5 per cent for the present set scales.\r\n\r\nThis will greatly facilitate the calculation of  the\r\n\r\namount  to  be deducted, especially in  cases  where\r\n\r\nwages  are paid daily or weekly and the amount  paid\r\n\r\non different pay-days is variable. As the law stands\r\n\r\nat  present, the calculation of the contribution  in\r\n\r\nthese cases is very complicated, and in the case  of\r\n\r\nbig  employers,  would involve considerable  expense\r\n\r\nand waste of time. The new Schedule will avoid this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the suggestions made to\r\n\r\nme was that monies paid out of the Fund on the death\r\n\r\nof  an employee should not be subject to estate duty\r\n\r\nunless they exceed some limit to be decided upon.  I\r\n\r\nam  in  sympathy with this suggestion, but it  needs\r\n\r\ncareful consideration in relation to other financial\r\n\r\nmatters.  It  is not urgent, because estates  up  to\r\n\r\n$1,000 in value are already exempt from estate duty,\r\n\r\nand  it will be some time before any member's  share\r\n\r\nof  the  Fund will be more than $1,000.  I  give  my\r\n\r\nassurance  that  before the matter can  arise,  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion will be further considered carefully  and\r\n\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.

If calculated on the\r\n\r\nbasis of $200, it comes to about $2,400 for a period\r\n\r\nof 20 years. I think this sum is very low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When proposals were made to amend this particular\r\n\r\nSchedule,  I thought that the Government would  come\r\n\r\nin  and  give aid to these workers; in other  words,\r\n\r\nthe Government would consider contributing a certain\r\n\r\npercentage  as  their  contribution,  thus  enabling\r\n\r\nthese workers to take home a very substantial sum on\r\n\r\nretirement.

In fact, many, if not most, firms have\r\n\r\nalready complied with the law requiring this Fund to\r\n\r\ncommence   as  from  the  1st  May,  and  this   has\r\n\r\nnecessitated  clause  2  of this  Bill  to  legalise\r\n\r\nactions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  employers  for  deducting contributions  to  the\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  as from the 1st May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the Minister has said, there is not a great deal of new\r\n\r\nmatters in this Bill, the most important of which is\r\n\r\nthe  right  of those workers drawing less than  $200\r\n\r\nper  month  not to contribute to the Fund.  In  such\r\n\r\ncases,  only the employers are to contribute.

There is nothing, Sir, in the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment to prevent any member of the Fund, who  is\r\n\r\nin  receipt of less than $200, to contribute himself\r\n\r\nif he so desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar, he says that the Ordinance  should  not\r\n\r\nhave  been  postponed and that it should  have  been\r\n\r\nallowed  to operate as from the 1st of May.

One of the complaints was\r\n\r\nwhat  this  Schedule has now attempted  to  correct.\r\n\r\nContrary  to  the  expectations of  the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty, the Ordinance did not bring them the required\r\n\r\nresults  in the last elections. It was their  brain-child,  and  it was rejected because little  things,\r\n\r\nlike  people  who  earn less  than  $200  having  to\r\n\r\ncontribute, although they could not afford to do so,\r\n\r\nwere not taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Minister for Labour has had consultations\r\n\r\nwith  mysterious representatives who have  convinced\r\n\r\nhim that $200 is the line of demarcation. It may  be\r\n\r\nright,  it may be wrong. I had always believed  that\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of this Assembly is to allow the people\r\n\r\nas  a  whole to make their representations,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake  their views known, on any particular piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation.   It  is  because  of  this   important\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  I say to the Government  that  this\r\n\r\namendment is entirely theirs. Nobody has contributed\r\n\r\nanything to it.

Members for its Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Ordinance arose out of, and was designed\r\n\r\nto  meet,  the need to protect the large numbers  of\r\n\r\nIndian and Chinese immigrants who were recruited  at\r\n\r\nthat  time of rapid expansion of the tin and  rubber\r\n\r\nindustries.  Its emphasis, naturally enough,  tended\r\n\r\nto  be  on  the control of conditions of immigrants,\r\n\r\nand   on   the  provision  of  satisfactory   living\r\n\r\naccommodation for the immigrants. Inevitably,  large\r\n\r\nportions   of   the   old  Ordinance   have   become\r\n\r\nmeaningless for present-day Singapore. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthose  provisions of the old Ordinance,  which  have\r\n\r\nproved  their value over the years of the operation,\r\n\r\nhave  been  retained,  and their  meaning  has  been\r\n\r\nconsiderably  clarified to enable them  to  be  more\r\n\r\nreadily understood by the workmen. For example,  the\r\n\r\npower  of the Commissioner for Labour to hear claims\r\n\r\nfor wages, etc., is retained. This has proved a free\r\n\r\nand  speedy  method  for a workman  to  settle  such\r\n\r\nclaims,  and  he  is  thus spared  the  expense  and\r\n\r\nformality  of  laying  his  complaint  in  a   Civil\r\n\r\nDistrict Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many new features which bring the Bill\r\n\r\ninto  line  with  the  latest  International  Labour\r\n\r\nOffice's  Conventions  on  labour  conditions.   The\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"workman\" has been widened to  include\r\n\r\ndrivers,  and  by making United Kingdom  departments\r\n\r\nfunctioning  in  the Colony liable to  inclusion  as\r\n\r\nemployers, the workmen employed by them are  brought\r\n\r\nwithin  the scope of the Bill. An entirely new  part\r\n\r\nhas  been added, Sir, regulating the recruitment  of\r\n\r\nworkmen,   which  gives  effect  to  the   principal\r\n\r\nprovisions of the I.L.O. Convention on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new section makes main contractors jointly\r\n\r\nand  severally responsible with sub-contractors  for\r\n\r\nthe  wages  of  the workmen, even  though  they  are\r\n\r\nengaged directly by the sub-contractor. In the past,\r\n\r\nSir, a great many of the claims for arrears of wages\r\n\r\nheard  by  the Commissioner for Labour had  involved\r\n\r\ndefaulting  sub-contractors,  and  the  workmen  had\r\n\r\nsuffered considerable hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, Sir, more protection is given to\r\n\r\nchildren  and  young  persons.  The  employment   of\r\n\r\nchildren  under  12 is prohibited, and  I  am  given\r\n\r\npowers  to prescribe minimum rates of pay.  To  make\r\n\r\ncertain that there will be no abuses associated with\r\n\r\ntheir  employment,  all children and  young  persons\r\n\r\nwill  be registered, and the Commissioner for Labour\r\n\r\nhas  powers to require that they should be medically\r\n\r\nexamined in order to ascertain their fitness for the\r\n\r\nemployment proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity allowances were compulsory under the old\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  but  were based on they female  workers'\r\n\r\nwages.  Under  the  new Bill, these  allowances  are\r\n\r\nfixed, in order to give effect to the principle that\r\n\r\nthese benefits should be sufficient for the full and\r\n\r\nhealthy maintenance of the mother and her child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other sections of the old Ordinance, Sir, have\r\n\r\nbeen  amended to give greater protection to workmen.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the workmen can now  claim  up  to  4\r\n\r\nmonths'  arrears of wages instead of  3,  under  the\r\n\r\nsection   guaranteeing  the  priority  of  workmen's\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours of work have been reduced from 9 to 8, with\r\n\r\novertime  at one and a half times the ordinary  rate\r\n\r\nfor any hour in excess of 8. If the workman works on\r\n\r\nrest  days,  he  is  to receive  double  pay,  or  a\r\n\r\nsubstitute day of rest. And in passing, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to mention that I have given notice to move  an\r\n\r\namendment for a 44-hour week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is in 17 parts, and the purpose of\r\n\r\nthese  parts  is given in the Objects  and  Reasons.\r\n\r\nThis Bill, Sir, is designed to protect artisans  and\r\n\r\nmanual  workers, but I am very conscious that  there\r\n\r\nare  other classes of workers in Singapore, such  as\r\n\r\nshop assistants and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclerical workers, who need more protection than they\r\n\r\nenjoy at present. These classes of workers may  rest\r\n\r\nassured that they have not been forgotten. It is  my\r\n\r\nintention to introduce further legislation to ensure\r\n\r\nthat they, too, have fair conditions of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Bill was brought up to replace the old Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich,  as  the Minister for Labour and Welfare  has\r\n\r\nsaid, is now outmoded. We welcome such a change, but\r\n\r\nI think it should have been brought in much earlier.\r\n\r\nSo  far  as it goes, we find that during this  short\r\n\r\nperiod  since this Bill was printed - on  21st  June - a\r\n\r\nmatter  of about ten days, reactions have  not  been\r\n\r\nunfavourable. However, I think for a  Bill  of  this\r\n\r\ntype, which affects a great portion of the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore, people should have been allowed  time  to\r\n\r\nair  their  views.  We have seen  in  the  papers  a\r\n\r\nprotest from some of the trade union groups,  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  if  there were  more  time,  probably\r\n\r\nindustrialists, employers and employee unions  would\r\n\r\nhave  come forward, either with criticisms  or  with\r\n\r\nbetter suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, as we see it, can be accepted\r\n\r\ngenerally in principle, it has brought nothing  very\r\n\r\nnew.  As  I see from the Comparative Table, we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  into  this Bill what  has  already  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  other parts of the  world.  We  have\r\n\r\ninside  it the I.L.O. and other sections from  Burma\r\n\r\nand  India,  and  the  Children  and  Young  Persons\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Nothing objectionable could be  found  in\r\n\r\nthat,   and   I   think  there   is   nothing   very\r\n\r\nrevolutionary.  I believe, too, that good  employers\r\n\r\nwould  have by this time carried out most  of  these\r\n\r\nlaws without any urging from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I maintain that to allow the very short\r\n\r\ntime  of a week for the Second Reading of a Bill  of\r\n\r\nthis size is not correct. Most of the old Members of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly probably have read the Bill a  number\r\n\r\nof  times,  but I think for other Members  who  have\r\n\r\ncome  into  this  Assembly only very recently,  they\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  given  time to read the Bill through  carefully,\r\n\r\nconsider it, and gather opinions from all interested\r\n\r\nbodies,  in order to make their contributions.  Like\r\n\r\nthe  other  Bill  which  has  just  been  passed,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Sir,  this Bill would have probably  about\r\n\r\nthe same effect. There will be plenty of Ayes on the\r\n\r\nGovernment side, but we may not be able to take part\r\n\r\nin it as fully as we would like to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this matter, however, it is important that\r\n\r\nthis  new  Bill should come into effect as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.  And  I would suggest that  the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage  of  this  Bill  be not taken  today,  but  be\r\n\r\npostponed for a month. Perhaps by that time we  will\r\n\r\nhave gathered sufficient material for discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed, too, from the Bill that there is a\r\n\r\nclause  concerning medical examination  of  workers,\r\n\r\nand  it  requires  that workers be  brought  to  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour for examination. Probably in\r\n\r\nthis  instance it might help workers,  if  they  are\r\n\r\nlarge in numbers, for the doctors to examine them at\r\n\r\nthe  factories,  rather than for  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\npeople  to  go  and crowd themselves in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOffice to be examined. I think that clause should be\r\n\r\namended  for  that  purpose when  it  comes  to  the\r\n\r\nCommittee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to remind the\r\n\r\nGovernment side that party government should  always\r\n\r\noperate on a line that will enable the Opposition to\r\n\r\nhave  some  chance  of discussing  a  Bill.  It  is,\r\n\r\nindeed,  very undemocratic for the Government  side,\r\n\r\nwho  knows everything, to keep everything back until\r\n\r\nthe  very  last  minute,  and  then  pounce  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  We  are not lawyers.  A  Bill  of  this\r\n\r\nnature, even given to a lawyer, probably would  have\r\n\r\ntaken  him quite a lot of time to read over; and  as\r\n\r\nlaymen,  trying to understand what lawyers  want  to\r\n\r\nput  into words, it would take us far more time.  If\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  were placed in the hands of an  ordinary\r\n\r\nlabourer, he would not even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstand  a little bit of it, unless it  has  been\r\n\r\nexplained to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The intention is that it should\r\n\r\ngo  to  a  Select Committee to report  back  in  six\r\n\r\nweeks,  so that everybody should have an opportunity\r\n\r\nof  studying  the Bill.

I think if the Government takes  such  an\r\n\r\nattitude as suggested by the Chief Minister, we will\r\n\r\ndefinitely be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, it is very sickening that Members\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly often plead for time. I have heard\r\n\r\nit often, but I do believe that on a measure of this\r\n\r\nkind,  of which Members are fully aware, they should\r\n\r\nnot  take  two  weeks  or one month  to  express  an\r\n\r\nopinion  in principle. As legislators we can  easily\r\n\r\nunderstand  the various clauses in this Bill  if  we\r\n\r\nhave some idea of what labour conditions are, and if\r\n\r\nindividuals cannot understand I presume their  Party\r\n\r\nwould be in a position to brief them. I have no such\r\n\r\ncomplaints, Sir, but I am very glad that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has expressed the Government's intention to\r\n\r\nrefer  it  to a Select Committee. If the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  not made that announcement, I would have  moved\r\n\r\nformally  that  the  Bill be referred  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a large number of people in my\r\n\r\nconstituency who are employed by the Services, and I\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity on their behalf  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir  appreciation for including them in this Bill.\r\n\r\nI would also inform this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   their   confidence  in  this  Government   is\r\n\r\nincreasing,  as  measures of this kind  which  would\r\n\r\nbenefit those employees are being introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hours of work, which was a subject of very\r\n\r\nkeen  discussion  in labour circles,  has  now  been\r\n\r\nresolved. For a long time the manual workers of this\r\n\r\ncountry  have  been struggling hard  in  negotiating\r\n\r\nwith  their employers for less hours of work, and  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  amendment envisaged by the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nreally  a good move in the right direction.  I  have\r\n\r\nheard  it  said that 48 hours can be worked  by  any\r\n\r\nmanual labourer, and it is also argued that this  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done all over the world. But we in this  part\r\n\r\nof  the world are situated differently. Our climatic\r\n\r\nconditions do not allow our manual labourer to  work\r\n\r\nfor 8 hours a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Trades Union Congress, Sir, has\r\n\r\ndeclared,  in one of their statements to  the  Press\r\n\r\nthe other day, that various clauses in the Bill need\r\n\r\nspecial consideration, and I do hope that the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  which is going to examine this Bill  will\r\n\r\ninvite  representatives, not only of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTrades  Union Congress but of all those trade  union\r\n\r\norganisations which are interested in the welfare of\r\n\r\ntheir employees, to give their evidence. As a result\r\n\r\nof this, when the Bill comes up at the next Assembly\r\n\r\nsitting, it will be one which will have no criticism\r\n\r\nfrom any quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the measure under discussion is a wise and far-reaching   one,  and  the  Government   is   to   be\r\n\r\ncongratulated  for the initiative it  has  taken  to\r\n\r\nimplement it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has just passed through a phase of acute\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest, and it is to be  hoped  that  at\r\n\r\nlast something is going to be done for the worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I look at this Bill, one problem seems\r\n\r\nto be needing urgent attention. In a large number of\r\n\r\nindustrial concerns, no steps have been taken to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring  the worker into the general scheme of  things\r\n\r\nand  convince  him that he is also  a  part  of  the\r\n\r\nindustry. On the other hand, the feeling is stressed\r\n\r\nto  the  worker  that \"You are asked to  do  certain\r\n\r\nthings. If you like to do them, you do so. Otherwise\r\n\r\nyou get out and look for a job elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my considered opinion that a new scheme\r\n\r\nbe  set  up to bring the worker and management  into\r\n\r\nAdvisory    Boards,   bodies   which    will    send\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the workers  and  management  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the  day-to-day problems  in  a  spirit  of\r\n\r\nfriendship and co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this measure is done, there will be a\r\n\r\nlessening of the tension and frustration that  exist\r\n\r\ntoday,  and this will lead to industrial  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nstatement  of the Hon. the Chief Minister that  this\r\n\r\nBill  will be referred to a Select Committee.  There\r\n\r\nare  therefore only two small points which  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  bring to the attention of this House,  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently   to   the  Select  Committee   to   be\r\n\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first refers to clause 3, sub-clause (2),\r\n\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Governor may also appoint such other officers\r\n\r\nwith  such  powers as may be necessary for  carrying\r\n\r\ninto  effect  the provisions of this Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nmay  incur such expense as may be necessary for  the\r\n\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it, first of all, Sir, that it does not\r\n\r\nmean  that the Government will not have to  come  to\r\n\r\nthis  House for the sanction of such sums as may  be\r\n\r\nrequired from time to time. Further, I would like my\r\n\r\nhon.  Friend the Minister for Labour and Welfare  to\r\n\r\nindicate what expenditure will be required per  year\r\n\r\non   new  staff.  I  am  not  suggesting  that  this\r\n\r\nimportant  new  Labour Code can be operated  without\r\n\r\nstaff,  but we on this side of the House would  like\r\n\r\nto have some idea of the cost involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter to which I wish to refer is\r\n\r\nmaternity  benefits,  with particular  reference  to\r\n\r\nclauses  94, subclause (2), and 96. These  read  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 94.-(2) (Rate of maternity allowance).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A female workman who has worked under the\r\n\r\nemployer  from whom she claims maternity benefit  on\r\n\r\nnot less than one hundred and eighty days within the\r\n\r\nperiod  of one year immediately preceding the notice\r\n\r\nrequired under subsection (2) of section 98 of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance shall be paid maternity allowance  at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  four dollars per diem during  the  benefit\r\n\r\nperiod.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 96.-(Payment of maternity allowance).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The amount of the maternity allowance shall be\r\n\r\npayable in two instalments, the first for the period\r\n\r\nup  to  and including the day of confinement, to  be\r\n\r\npaid  within  seven days of the date of confinement,\r\n\r\nand the second, for the period after confinement, to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  within  seven days  of  the  end  of  that\r\n\r\nperiod.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset I want to make it very clear that we\r\n\r\nwelcome maternity benefits. We welcome the 8  weeks'\r\n\r\nbenefit  period, and we approve the $4 per day  rate\r\n\r\nof  payment for those who have worked for  180  days\r\n\r\nfor  one  employer  out of the  preceding  year.  We\r\n\r\nwould,  however, like to suggest an  improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe  method  of payment and the time of payment  for\r\n\r\nthe  consideration of this House and of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee to be appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at present drafted, a female workman will be\r\n\r\nentitled to $224 as benefit - $112 payable within one\r\n\r\nweek of confinement, and the balance of $112 a month\r\n\r\nlater.  This means that she will receive no  payment\r\n\r\nof  any  kind for one month before confinement,  and\r\n\r\npossibly for one week afterwards - surely at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  most needed. I suggest, Sir,  that  it\r\n\r\nwould be more humane and helpful to continue to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  normal rate of weekly wages up to a maximum  of\r\n\r\n$4 per day throughout the benefit period, and make a\r\n\r\nlump sum payment of the balance one week before  the\r\n\r\nexpected  day  of  confinement when  money  is  most\r\n\r\nneeded. That is to say, if the normal rate of  wages\r\n\r\nis  $3  per day, which is quite common in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthis  should  be  paid  weekly  in  the  normal  way\r\n\r\nthroughout the benefit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod,  that is $168 in all; the balance  from  the\r\n\r\n$224, namely $56, to be paid as a lump-sum ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayment  one  week  before  the  expected   day   of\r\n\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of female workmen earning at the rate\r\n\r\nof  $4  per  day, or above, they should receive  the\r\n\r\npayments weekly at the rates laid down under  clause 94 (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have made my point clear.

Those are clauses 2  and\r\n\r\n3 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill purports to amend section 29\r\n\r\nof the principal Ordinance which provides that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where a written law confers power on any person\r\n\r\nto  do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all\r\n\r\nsuch powers shall be understood to be also conferred\r\n\r\nas  are reasonably necessary to enable the person to\r\n\r\ndo or enforce the doing of the act or thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience over the past few years has shown that\r\n\r\nit  is  desirable that such powers  should  be  more\r\n\r\nparticularly expressed in the law, and clause  2  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, as Members will see, expressly gives  the\r\n\r\npower to prohibit and control and includes the power\r\n\r\nto  provide therefor by licensing; and the power to\r\n\r\ngrant  a  licence, permission or exemption  includes\r\n\r\nthe  power to impose conditions. This new provision,\r\n\r\nSir,  finds  a  place in most modern  Interpretation\r\n\r\nOrdinances  of  other territories, and  it  is  long\r\n\r\noverdue in this Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 is designed to provide that section 32 of\r\n\r\nthe  principal  Ordinance shall he amended  so  that\r\n\r\nsubstantive  appointments may  be  made  to  offices\r\n\r\nwithout  delay  when the former holder  proceeds  on\r\n\r\nleave  prior to retirement or transfer. This  clause\r\n\r\n3,  Sir, follows the usual pattern of clauses in the\r\n\r\nInterpretation Ordinances of other territories, and,\r\n\r\nindeed, finds a place in our own Order in Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining clauses deal directly with the\r\n\r\nMinisterial system of government, and I  venture  to\r\n\r\nthink  that they are fully and adequately  explained\r\n\r\nin  the  Objects and Reasons attached to the printed\r\n\r\ncopy  of the Bill. I venture to think that there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  controversial in those  provisions,  or  at\r\n\r\nleast nothing that should cause any undue concern to\r\n\r\nMembers  on  either this side of the  House  or  the\r\n\r\nother side.

This  budget, in the  main,  concerns\r\n\r\nextension   schemes  already  in   being   for   the\r\n\r\nElectricity, Water and Gas Departments. Towards this\r\n\r\nexpenditure, at the beginning of this year, the City\r\n\r\nCouncil had in hand a sum of $1\ufffd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion, being the unexpended balance of the 4% loan\r\n\r\nraised  in  November of last year. This sum  is  now\r\n\r\nexhausted and loan account expenditure has,  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  been financed to the extent of almost  $7\r\n\r\nmillion from surplus revenue balances. It is  clear,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that the coffers of the City Council must\r\n\r\nbe replenished as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally intended to float this loan at a\r\n\r\ndiscount  of 2\ufffd%. Recently, however, interest  rates\r\n\r\nhave  hardened  slightly, and  the  Council  is  now\r\n\r\nadvised  that, in order to bring the terms  of  this\r\n\r\nnew  loan  into line with current market conditions,\r\n\r\nthe rate of discount should be increased to 4%. This\r\n\r\nvariation  in  the terms of the loan will  have  the\r\n\r\neffect of increasing the redemption yield from 4.15%\r\n\r\nto  4.25%, and should have the effect of making  the\r\n\r\nloan attractive to investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated, it is proposed to use\r\n\r\nthe proceeds of this new loan mainly for the further\r\n\r\nexpansion of the City Council's electricity, gas and\r\n\r\nwater  undertakings. During the years from  1948  to\r\n\r\n1954  the  City  Council has borrowed  approximately\r\n\r\n$140  million  mainly for the development  of  these\r\n\r\nundertakings. It is now possible to see the  results\r\n\r\nof this expenditure. The funds have clearly been put\r\n\r\nto  productive  use. The increase in output  of  the\r\n\r\nthree utility departments has been most marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of electricity, for example, in 1948\r\n\r\nsales  averaged 300,000 units a day. At the  present\r\n\r\ntime, they average 800,000 units a day. In the  case\r\n\r\nof  water, sales have risen from 27\ufffd million gallons\r\n\r\na  day  in 1948 to 46 million gallons a day  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time. In the case of gas, sales have  risen\r\n\r\nfrom  600,000 cubic feet a day in 1948 to 1\ufffd million\r\n\r\ncubic feet a day at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore develops, the demand for these\r\n\r\nservices  will increase at an even faster rate  than\r\n\r\nit  has  in the past, and I think hon. Members  will\r\n\r\nagree  that money cannot be invested better than  in\r\n\r\nsuch undertakings.

Members are aware, a new Customs Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas enacted in February of this year. This Ordinance\r\n\r\nconsolidates  and  amends the law  relating  to  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  revenue  on  intoxicating   liquors,\r\n\r\ntobacco and petroleum. It is hoped to bring this law\r\n\r\ninto operation in the near future, when the existing\r\n\r\nLiquors  Revenue Ordinance, Tobacco  Duty  Ordinance\r\n\r\nand   the   Petroleum  Revenue  Ordinance  will   be\r\n\r\nrepealed.  In preparation for the coming into  force\r\n\r\nof  the new Ordinance, it is necessary to promulgate\r\n\r\nthe rules and regulations and subsidiary legislation\r\n\r\nrequired  to  implement the law. Hon.  Members  will\r\n\r\nhave noticed that today there have been tabled three\r\n\r\nSessional Papers, which include the regulations  and\r\n\r\nrules  which  have  been made  by  the  Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil under the new Customs Ordinance. These rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations have been published in the  Gazette\r\n\r\nfor the information of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessional Paper No. 20 contains the Liquors\r\n\r\nLicensing  Regulations, 1955,  which  supersede  the\r\n\r\nLiquors  Licensing  Rules, 1937. Several  amendments\r\n\r\nhave  been  incorporated in these  new  Regulations,\r\n\r\nmostly connected with bringing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting procedure into line with modern conditions.\r\n\r\nThe   opportunity  has  been  taken  to  incorporate\r\n\r\ncertain   recommendations  made   by   the   Liquors\r\n\r\nLicensing Law Committee. No change in fees has  been\r\n\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessional Paper No. 21 contains the Customs\r\n\r\nRegulations,  1955,  which have  been  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  in Council under section 114  of  the  new\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  which  consolidate  and  amend  the\r\n\r\nLiquors Revenue Rules, 1937, the Tobacco Duty Rules,\r\n\r\n1948,  the  Petroleum  Duty  Rules,  1948,  and  the\r\n\r\nPetroleum   Revenue  (Heavy  Oil  Engined  Vehicles)\r\n\r\nRules, 1948. Here again, the amendments proposed are\r\n\r\nmostly procedural, and they are aimed at making  the\r\n\r\nCustoms Department more efficient and adding to  the\r\n\r\nconvenience of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessional Paper No. 22 contains the Customs\r\n\r\n(Duties)  Order,  1955. This Order reintroduces  the\r\n\r\nrates of duty on tobacco, petroleum and liquor which\r\n\r\nwere  in force under the old Order. No change is  at\r\n\r\npresent contemplated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to introduce legislation\r\n\r\nconnected with the special rates of tax on  vehicles\r\n\r\nusing  heavy oil and diesel oil. This brings  me  to\r\n\r\nthe  motion standing in my name. As hon. Members are\r\n\r\naware, this duty is imposed under section 16 (2)  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Ordinance. Before moving the motion,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  the authority of His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor to do, I would like to draw attention to  a\r\n\r\nclerical  inadvertence which  has  occurred  in  the\r\n\r\nterms of the motion. Hon.

Cold  storage  accommodation   is\r\n\r\nprovided there at a rental of $10 a day for the fish\r\n\r\ntrade to enable it to accommodate glut supplies. The\r\n\r\nexisting  compressor was installed in 1937, suffered\r\n\r\nfrom  lack of maintenance during the Japanese  time,\r\n\r\nand is now becoming rapidly unserviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 106 refers to the supply of four Radio-Telephony sets for the Master Attendant's launches\r\n\r\nto  enable  communications to be maintained  between\r\n\r\nlaunches and between the shore and launches in times\r\n\r\nof  emergency; for example, during a fire  when  all\r\n\r\nvisual signalling is impracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 107 refers to the post of the Serjeant at\r\n\r\nArms.  Hon.

Mr Speaker returned late in March,  and\r\n\r\nit  became  a  matter of some urgency to  appoint  a\r\n\r\nSerjeant  at Arms, and it was decided to  offer  the\r\n\r\npost to Che Mahmood at a salary of $650 per month. I\r\n\r\nam very glad to say he saw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  way to accept, and this sum is now required  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  Head \"Legislature\" to enable his  salary\r\n\r\nto be paid with effect from the 21st of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 108 refers to a duplicator required by the\r\n\r\nGovernment Medical Store.

It has been announced already that\r\n\r\nMr  McNeice will be seconded for duty in connection\r\n\r\nwith the committee that is considering the City  and\r\n\r\nIsland Council Bill and other connected matters.  He\r\n\r\nmay  also be required for other services. His duties\r\n\r\nwill be full-time, and he will not be able to devote\r\n\r\nany  time  to  the  City Council.  It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary to create a Supernumerary Grade B post for\r\n\r\nMr   McNeice,  and  thus  free  the  post  of   the\r\n\r\nPresident,   City   Council,  for  the   substantive\r\n\r\npromotion of another officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 111 is an application for supplementary\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the Singapore Airport. Approximately\r\n\r\n$3.8  million  has been provided in the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  1955. It is now estimated  that  the\r\n\r\nwork,  which  will be completed in 1955,  will  cost\r\n\r\napproximately $10,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that under item 130 provision of\r\n\r\nC.D.  &  W. money to the extent of $1.4 million  is\r\n\r\nsought, and that under item 134 a revote of $208,340\r\n\r\nis  requested.  These,  with the  supplement  sought\r\n\r\nunder  item  111  and  the  money  provided  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  this  year,  will  make  up  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$10,000,000. This will be required for  the  runway,\r\n\r\ntaxi-tracks   and  parking  aprons  which,   it   is\r\n\r\nestimated,  will cost this year $3.8 million;  roads\r\n\r\n$1,000,000, electrical installations $1,000,000, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  on. I should say, at this stage, that the latest\r\n\r\nestimate  of  cost  for  the  Singapore  Airport  is\r\n\r\n$46,000,000, of which $10,000,000 will  be  provided\r\n\r\nby  C.D.  & W. Fund and $3.9 million by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Civil Aviation of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 112, 115, 117 and 125 can, with convenience,\r\n\r\nbe  taken  together,  since all  arise  out  of  the\r\n\r\nrevision  of  superscale salaries which  took  place\r\n\r\nlast  year.  With regard to Item 112,  the  post  of\r\n\r\nDeputy  Secretary to the Ministry  of  Commerce  was\r\n\r\npreviously  graded IB, M.C.S. When the  revision  of\r\n\r\nsalaries took place, all other Class IB M.C.S. posts\r\n\r\nwere upgraded to Grade E, with the exception of this\r\n\r\nparticular post. The result of the salaries revision\r\n\r\nin  this  case  was  not an upward  revision  but  a\r\n\r\ndowngrading. Since then, it has become  quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the post is under-graded at Grade F, and  that\r\n\r\nthe  duties  and  responsibilities  attached  to  it\r\n\r\nwarrant Grade E and that is now proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 115 refers to the post of Chief Inspector of\r\n\r\nSchools, which again was graded on revision at Grade\r\n\r\nF.  Having  regard to the expansion  of  educational\r\n\r\nfacilities  and the great increase in responsibility\r\n\r\nwhich  falls on the shoulders of the Chief Inspector\r\n\r\nof Schools, it has been decided that the post should\r\n\r\nproperly be graded at Grade E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 117 refers to the post of Director of\r\n\r\nBotanical Gardens, which should be upgraded to Grade\r\n\r\nF. Hitherto, before the revision of salaries, it was\r\n\r\nplaced on the same grade as Director of Museums  and\r\n\r\nDeputy Director of Broadcasting. On revision,  these\r\n\r\nposts  were graded Grade F, but the post of Director\r\n\r\nof Botanical Gardens was left, for no understandable\r\n\r\nreason,  at  Grade  G.  It is  now  clear  that  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and  status  of  the  Director  of\r\n\r\nBotanical  Gardens merit upgrading, and  it  is  now\r\n\r\nproposed that the post should be Grade F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, item 125 - Deputy Government Printer - on\r\n\r\nrevision of superscale salaries, the salary of  this\r\n\r\npost was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfixed  at  $1,300, which was in the  middle  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional officers' timescale. There was no  real\r\n\r\nreason  for creating this special superscale salary.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now  thought  desirable,  especially  having\r\n\r\nregard   to  the  duties  performed  by  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nGovernment  Printer,  that it  would  be  better  to\r\n\r\nsubstitute the upper segment of the timescale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing now to the other items, we come to item\r\n\r\n113 - Customs  Secret Service. Rewards are  paid  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  for information which leads  to  the\r\n\r\napprehension  of  smugglers and to  the  seizure  of\r\n\r\ndutiable   goods,  and  some  of  the  rewards   are\r\n\r\nsubstantial. $100,000 was provided in the Estimates,\r\n\r\nand  that is now exhausted, and there are  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  substantial rewards remaining to  be  paid.  In\r\n\r\n1954,  expenditure  under this  Head  came  to  over\r\n\r\n$300,000,  and it is possible that expenditure  this\r\n\r\nyear will be of the same order. Therefore, we seek a\r\n\r\nsupplement of $200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 116 - Refunds of Estate Duty - it sometimes\r\n\r\nhappens  that estate duty is overpaid and  a  refund\r\n\r\nhas to be made. At the present time, there is a case\r\n\r\noutstanding,  where duty has been  overpaid  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  $27,000, and we seek to  supplement  the\r\n\r\nVote, which stands at $10,000, by $26,907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 118 and 119 refer to two posts lit the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Lands - one for a (G.C.S. Clerk  and  one\r\n\r\nfor  a Stenographer. My hon. Friend the Minister for\r\n\r\nLocal Government, Lands and Housing, finds that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  is understaffed, and he seeks the creation\r\n\r\nof these two new posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 120. About two months ago, when the question\r\n\r\nof  entertainment  allowance  for  Mr  Speaker  was\r\n\r\nconsidered, it was felt that, like the Ministers, he\r\n\r\nmight call upon the block Entertainment Vote when he\r\n\r\nhad   to  entertain.  This  is  now  clearly   quite\r\n\r\nunsuitable,  and  it is desirable that  Mr  Speaker\r\n\r\nshould  have an entertainment allowance of his  own.\r\n\r\nIt  is not subject to any scrutiny or control by the\r\n\r\nTreasury.  It is therefore proposed that  we  should\r\n\r\ngive him an entertainment allowance of $400 a month,\r\n\r\nwhich is the same as that for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Chief Justice and the Chief Secretary. Provision\r\n\r\nis  now asked to pay this allowance from the 1st  of\r\n\r\nAugust this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 121 seeks further provision for the upkeep of\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker's house and grounds. Hon. Members  will\r\n\r\nrecall that at the first sitting of the Assembly,  I\r\n\r\nsought  provision for precisely this  service.  That\r\n\r\nprovision was based on an estimate of my own  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  sum required to upkeep Mr Speaker's house  and\r\n\r\ngrounds.  Now,  I fear I have rather under-estimated\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  Neither  did I  allow  for  sufficient\r\n\r\nservants nor did I propose to pay them enough. I  am\r\n\r\nnow satisfied that I have under-estimated the matter\r\n\r\nand now seek further provision to enable Mr Speaker\r\n\r\nto employ the minimum staff required to maintain his\r\n\r\nhouse  and  grounds till the end of the  year.  This\r\n\r\nprovision  also provides for the employment  of  one\r\n\r\n\"Tukang Kebun\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 122 is a very substantial item. It was\r\n\r\ndecided in August last year to invite the members of\r\n\r\nthe  Colombo  Plan  Consultative Committee  to  hold\r\n\r\ntheir  next  meeting in Singapore. It was considered\r\n\r\nappropriate that this should be done in  a  year  of\r\n\r\ngreat constitutional development in Singapore.  This\r\n\r\ninvitation  was extended in Ottawa and was  accepted\r\n\r\nwith very great pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting will fall into two parts. Firstly, in\r\n\r\nthe last week of September and the first two and a\r\n\r\nhalf  weeks  in October, there will be a meeting  of\r\n\r\nofficials from all the member countries to  consider\r\n\r\nthe  progress of the Colombo Plan over the  previous\r\n\r\nyear,  to  consider  the reports  from  the  various\r\n\r\nmember  countries, and to draft the statistical  and\r\n\r\nannual  reports  of  the  Colombo  Plan  itself  for\r\n\r\npresentation  to  the meeting of Ministers.  In  the\r\n\r\nthird week of October, Ministers from all the member\r\n\r\ncountries will attend and will discuss questions  of\r\n\r\npolicy  arising  from  the  implementation  of   the\r\n\r\nColombo Plan, economic developments of East Asia and\r\n\r\nother kindred matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that this is going to be a very\r\n\r\nconsiderable undertaking. A\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery high standard has been set at previous meetings\r\n\r\nin  London, Karachi, New Delhi and Ottawa and it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered   that  Singapore  should  endeavour   to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  same standard. The arrangements  which\r\n\r\nhave  been made so far in the Treasury are now being\r\n\r\nmade under the supervision of a Committee of Members\r\n\r\nof  this House, consisting of the Assistant Minister\r\n\r\nfor Commerce and Industry, the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Koon Teck), Mr Sutherland and myself.  I\r\n\r\nthink  all arrangements are up to date, and  I  feel\r\n\r\nconfident that we will be able to stage a conference\r\n\r\nin the same way and as successfully as has been done\r\n\r\nin other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, however, be a costly undertaking. The\r\n\r\nVictoria  Memorial Hall will have to be redecorated,\r\n\r\nand  the  first floor arranged and prepared  as  the\r\n\r\nmain  conference chamber. On the ground  floor  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  he built office accommodation for  various\r\n\r\ndelegations. This has been done at previous meetings\r\n\r\nin  the past. A secretariat for the conference  will\r\n\r\nhave  to be set up, and will have to consist of able\r\n\r\nofficers.  A very high standard of ability  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired to run this conference. Accommodation  will\r\n\r\nhave   to   be  provided  for  all  delegations   in\r\n\r\naccordance with precedent. Transport will have to be\r\n\r\nprovided, and there will have to be a certain amount\r\n\r\nof  entertainment, particularly at  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nlevel. We have estimated that the total cost will be\r\n\r\nsomewhere  between $270,000 and $300,000.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nsay  at the present time just exactly how much  will\r\n\r\nbe  spent.  Every  effort will  be  made  to  reduce\r\n\r\nexpenditure as much as possible, but I think it will\r\n\r\nbe  of  the  order of $270,000 to $300,000.  Members\r\n\r\nwill  also recall that this expenditure has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted  in  principle by the  entry  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates for 1955 of a token vote for the  cost  of\r\n\r\nthe Colombo Plan Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 123 refers to anti-malarial and other health\r\n\r\nprecautions which have to be taken at the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport  to comply with international civil aviation\r\n\r\nstandards. Previously, we sought a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvote of $100,000 for drainage works and $25,000  for\r\n\r\nthe  laying  of a piped water supply. Now,  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  further drainage work is required and  certain\r\n\r\nequipment  will have to be bought for  anti-malarial\r\n\r\nwork. Hence, we seek a supplement of $20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 124 refers to the construction of\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  a Police Ghurkha  contingent  at\r\n\r\nMount  Vernon on Bartley Road. This work falls  into\r\n\r\ntwo  phases.  The total cost is about the  order  of\r\n\r\n$3,000,000. Phase I has been virtually completed.  A\r\n\r\nsmall  revote of $200,000 is asked for later  on  in\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule.  The P.W.D. now find  that  they  can\r\n\r\npress on with Phase II this year. It was intended to\r\n\r\nenter  provision for Phase II in the Estimates,  but\r\n\r\nit   was  inadvertently  overlooked.  We  now   seek\r\n\r\n$1,250,000, which is required to complete Phase II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 126 seeks authority to create a post of\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Prisons. Under he Criminal Justice\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, and I think  under\r\n\r\nsection  13  of the Criminal Procedure  Code,  1955,\r\n\r\nprovision is made for two new types of detention.  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  are  called \"corrective  training\"  and\r\n\r\n\"preventive detention\", the object being that  while\r\n\r\na prisoner is detained, provided that he co-operates\r\n\r\nwith  the  prison authorities, he will be  sent  out\r\n\r\ninto  the world, on completion of his sentence,  fit\r\n\r\nto  take  his  place in society. As I say,  the  co-operation  of  the  prisoner  is  required.  It  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, essential that a man of great experience in\r\n\r\nthis  type  of  work be obtained to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nscheme  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  train  other\r\n\r\nofficers to expand and continue the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 127 seeks provision for the staff required by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister  in his  office  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.  It was, I think, envisaged  at  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the Constitution was drawn up that, as far  as\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister was concerned, the emphasis would\r\n\r\nbe  on a portfolio and that the officer holding  the\r\n\r\nportfolio  would be Chief Minister in addition.  The\r\n\r\nConstitution has developed very considerably in  the\r\n\r\nlast two months, and we find that the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibilities which are quite distinct  from  and\r\n\r\ncertainly not less important than those arising from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Commerce. It has been found that  if\r\n\r\nhe  is to do his work as Chief Minister, he requires\r\n\r\na  very  capable  staff,  and  the  staff  which  he\r\n\r\nrequires is shown in the first portion of item  127.\r\n\r\nThe  second portion of item 127 makes provision  for\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Adviser and for the staff required for\r\n\r\nhis sub-office. These posts, of course, will not  be\r\n\r\nfilled until an Economic Adviser is appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 128 makes provision for stationery and other\r\n\r\nmatters  of a similar nature required by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 129 seeks provision for new office furniture\r\n\r\nand equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 130 seeks the authority of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  draw $1.4 million of  the  $10,000,000\r\n\r\ngrant from the C.D.& W. Fund for expenditure on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Airport this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the remaining items, that is items 131 to 229,\r\n\r\nmake  up  a  very  formidable list of  Revotes,  the\r\n\r\nmajority of which refer to public works and  capital\r\n\r\nworks. These are presented in this Paper in the form\r\n\r\nin  which it has been customary to use in the  past;\r\n\r\nbut  having seen it in print, I now appreciate  that\r\n\r\nit would be desirable, and it would have been clearer\r\n\r\nto  hon. Members, if I had given details in columnar\r\n\r\nforms; for example, if I had laid out this Paper  in\r\n\r\nthe  following  way  in columns:   Amount  voted  in 1954:Amount spent in 1954: Balance unspent at the end\r\n\r\nof  1954:  Amount  revoted in  the  1955  Estimates:\r\n\r\nAdditional revote now required - that would give  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers all the information about the revotes  which\r\n\r\nthey  required. This new layout will be followed  in\r\n\r\nfuture. In the meantime, however, I have all  the necessary information here, and I will be  only  too\r\n\r\nglad to supply it to hon. Members in connection with\r\n\r\nany   item   they  may  wish  to  raise.  Of   these\r\n\r\napplications for revotes, items 134, 136, 137,  138, 140,  142, 145, 156, 161 to 169, 171, 176, 183, 184, 192,  193, 203, 204, 207, 209, 211, 223 to  227  are\r\n\r\nunforeseen  revotes, in addition to revotes  already\r\n\r\nshown in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  annual  Estimates. How these are arrived  at  I\r\n\r\nwill  make  it clear by quoting an example.  Let  us\r\n\r\nimagine  that  provision  has  been  made   in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates for a school costing $300,000. By the time\r\n\r\nSeptember comes round, when the Estimates are  being\r\n\r\nfinalised,  the  Director of Public Works  considers\r\n\r\nthat  a certain amount of work will have to be  left\r\n\r\nover  to  be  done  in the following  year  and  the\r\n\r\nestimated   cost  of  that  work  is  $100,000.   He\r\n\r\ntherefore  seeks  authority to  enter  a  revote  of\r\n\r\n$100,000  in next year's Estimates. After September,\r\n\r\nsomething  unforeseen happens - perhaps a dock  strike\r\n\r\nin  the  United  Kingdom or delays  in  delivery  of\r\n\r\nmaterial - and  when the accounts are finally  closed,\r\n\r\nit  is found that instead of $100,000 worth of  work\r\n\r\nundone,  $150,000  worth of work  was  left  undone.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   it  becomes  necessary   to   seek   an\r\n\r\nunforeseen revote of $50,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining items in the Schedule refer to\r\n\r\nrevotes  which were completely unforeseen  when  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  were drawn up in September  last.  Either\r\n\r\nthe  money for the project is voted too late  to  be\r\n\r\nspent  in 1955 or else something unexpected happened\r\n\r\nafter September, 1954, which prevented it from being\r\n\r\nspent.  In  the case of these unforeseen revotes - and\r\n\r\nwhen  I say unforeseen revotes, I refer to the  last\r\n\r\ncategory which I mentioned - where work has had to  go\r\n\r\non,  advances  have  been made by  the  Treasury  in\r\n\r\naccordance with previous practice. This practice is,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion, open to objection in so far  as  it\r\n\r\ncommits   funds   without  the   sanction   of   the\r\n\r\nLegislature,  and  it was partly  to  overcome  this\r\n\r\nobjection that I sought power at the last sitting of\r\n\r\nthe   Assembly   to  approve  revotes   in   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances in advance of the covering approval of\r\n\r\nthe    Assembly.    However,   I   appreciate    the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  apprehensions  of  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar in this connection, and  it  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen   arranged  that  applications  for   necessary\r\n\r\nunforeseen revotes will be made at the last  sitting\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly in each year. These  revotes  will\r\n\r\nmerely be rough guesses of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount left over unexpended at the end of the  year,\r\n\r\nbut  will enable work to continue uninterrupted into\r\n\r\nthe  next year. In the middle of the year, as we are\r\n\r\ndoing  now, after the accounts are closed,  we  will\r\n\r\ncome forward for an unforeseen revote of the balance\r\n\r\nremaining  unspent. This will obviate  the  need  to\r\n\r\nauthorise  advances as has been done  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nand,  at  the same time, obviate the need to approve\r\n\r\nrevotes   in   advance  of  the  approval   of   the\r\n\r\nLegislature,  as was proposed in the  last  sitting.\r\n\r\nThe  power  given  to  the Government  at  the  last\r\n\r\nsitting  of the Assembly will consequently  only  be\r\n\r\nused in cases of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these applications for revotes have been\r\n\r\nexamined  with  care  in the  Treasury  and  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Committee of the Council  of  Ministers  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that the need for the work continues  and\r\n\r\nthat  no  more  is  asked for than  is  required  to\r\n\r\ncomplete   the   job.  The  services  and   projects\r\n\r\nthemselves were approved by the Legislature  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance, because they were regarded as being\r\n\r\nessential services and works of top priority.  There\r\n\r\nare  some 90 items altogether. It will take too much\r\n\r\ntime if I have to explain each one in detail. In any\r\n\r\ncase, not all hon. Members are interested in all the\r\n\r\napplications.   In  the  circumstances,   it   would\r\n\r\nprobably be better if I left it, to hon.

When all  Members  have\r\n\r\nspoken  on  that  particular  item,  I  will  invite\r\n\r\nsuggestions or criticisms on another item.

Sometimes\r\n\r\nit  may  be  even more. Sir, I wonder  whether  this\r\n\r\nprocedure  of giving rewards to the Customs  Service\r\n\r\nto  find out the culprits is a very desirable  thing\r\n\r\nto  do. I feel that it amounts to a bribery from the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side,  and that the  existing  personnel\r\n\r\nshould  be asked to strengthen the service in  order\r\n\r\nto  enable  the culprits to be caught,  rather  than\r\n\r\nbeing  paid a reward for bringing these culprits  to\r\n\r\nbook.  I  feel, Sir, that investigations  should  be\r\n\r\nmade   into  tile  existing  procedure  of   finding\r\n\r\nculprits  and  to  see  whether  economy  could   be\r\n\r\neffected in spending this money. I do not think  the\r\n\r\npublic  of Singapore can afford to pay $300,000,  or\r\n\r\nsometimes  perhaps more, or a similar  sum  entirely\r\n\r\nfor  a  secret service of this nature. There are  so\r\n\r\nmany  other social services in abeyance.  The  other\r\n\r\npoint,  Sir,  I  wish to raise -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

They are\r\n\r\npaid  to members of the public who are prepared,  in\r\n\r\nsome cases, to risk their lives to give us notice of\r\n\r\nattempts  to smuggle dangerous commodities into  the\r\n\r\nterritory.  In many cases, the value  of  the  goods\r\n\r\nseized as a result of this information exceeds  many\r\n\r\ntimes  over  the amount of the rewards paid.  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, this money is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  spent.

Members are aware, it is a declared policy\r\n\r\nof  this Government to afford every encouragement to\r\n\r\npersons  in  the low income group to own  their  own\r\n\r\nhouses, and the Minister has been exploring ways and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  achieve  this  purpose.  One  ready   and\r\n\r\navailable  method  by which this  purpose  might  be\r\n\r\nachieved  is to facilitate the sale and purchase  of\r\n\r\nflat  units  which  could be made available  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  at  prices  substantially lower  than  those\r\n\r\nasked  for  houses  and bungalows.  As  Members  are\r\n\r\naware, flat units may be sold and disposed of in the\r\n\r\nsame  manner as other interests in land, but  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult   for   the   purchasers   to   obtain   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  title by reason of the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Registration of Deeds Ordinance. Section  5  of\r\n\r\nthat Ordinance provides that no deeds affecting land\r\n\r\nshall be admissible in court as evidence of title to\r\n\r\nany  land unless and until they have been registered\r\n\r\nas   directed  by  the  Ordinance;  and  under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 15 of that Ordinance, no  deed\r\n\r\nmay be registered unless the land affected by it has\r\n\r\nbeen surveyed and demarcated to the satisfaction  of\r\n\r\nthe Surveyor-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to flats, however, which entail a sub-division of a piece of land in horizontal strata one\r\n\r\nabove   the   other,  survey  and   demarcation   of\r\n\r\nboundaries  is  difficult, if not impossible.  There\r\n\r\nis,   however,  provision  for  exemption   in   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and there is contained in Rule 13 of  the\r\n\r\nRegistration  of  Deeds  Rules.  1934,  whereby  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Deeds is permitted to dispense with the\r\n\r\ncompliance  of certain provisions of the  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nParagraph  2  of  that Rule allows the  registration\r\n\r\nwithout   the  necessity  for  survey   and   proper\r\n\r\ndemarcation of boundaries of leases for a period  of\r\n\r\n21  years, or less in certain cases. This provision,\r\n\r\nSir,   enables   flats  to  be  registered   without\r\n\r\ndifficulty, but the leasehold title thereby acquired\r\n\r\nis limited to 21 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, which is the subject of this\r\n\r\nmotion, enables the leasehold title of an indefinite\r\n\r\nduration  to  be  secured for flat units,  and  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  and, it is hoped, greatly encourage  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of flats for sale and for their purchase by\r\n\r\nmembers of the public within the low income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is one which I venture to think will\r\n\r\nhave  the  full  support  of  very  Member  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.

Royal Malayan Navy ratings enter the Force either on a special service engagement to serve for 7 years in the Royal Malayan Navy and 5 years in the Royal Malayan Naval Reserve, or else on a continuous service engagement for 12 years, followed by reserve service. A rating performing special service may, if he wishes and is considered suitable, transfer to continuous service, but in no case does any rating enter for more than 12 years service in the first instance, although at the end of that period he may re-engage for a further period of 10 years, after which he is eligible to retire on pension.
