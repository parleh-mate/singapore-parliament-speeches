Allow me to spend  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes to explain why HDB made this move.  At that time,\r\n\r\nthe  previous HDB office, which was at Jalan Bukit Merah,\r\n\r\nwas  facing a severe space shortage, which was  affecting\r\n\r\nthe  level  of service as well as the working environment\r\n\r\nof  its  staff.  After considering several  options,  HDB\r\n\r\ndecided  in 1995, at a time when the Singapore's  economy\r\n\r\nwas growing robustly, to move to this new location in Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  Moving the office to a suburban location that was\r\n\r\nserved  by  an  MRT station would, obviously,  help  ease\r\n\r\ncongestion in the urban areas but, more importantly, also\r\n\r\nprovide greater convenience for HDB lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB hub in Toa Payoh was also a very integral\r\n\r\npart  of  the estate renewal strategy for Toa Payoh  Town\r\n\r\nCentre.   When  the move was made in 1995, HDB  did  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  impact on residents and  shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nBut  as  the  economy was doing well at  that  time,  HDB\r\n\r\nanticipated that it would be able to sell the HDB  Centre\r\n\r\nand  ensure  that there would continue to be activity  in\r\n\r\nthat   area.   But,  unfortunately,  the  market   turned\r\n\r\ndramatically.   And  as I informed the  House  yesterday,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a drop in demand for office space  island\r\n\r\nwide,  and this has resulted in over supply of  space  in\r\n\r\nthe  market.  Nevertheless, I recognise that this  is  no\r\n\r\ncomfort  to  the shopkeepers in Bukit Merah, and  I  will\r\n\r\nurge  HDB to redouble its efforts to bring in new tenants\r\n\r\nto the HDB Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mdm Cynthia Phua's question which\r\n\r\nis on a related topic, this time on the relocation of one\r\n\r\nof   the  neighbourhood  centres  in  Hougang.   This  is\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood South II.  I must, first of all,  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat when HDB plans new towns, it does so with many other\r\n\r\nagencies  - LTA, MOH, MOE, Library Board, PA and so on  - to   provide  a  wide  range  of  facilities   like   bus\r\n\r\ninterchange,  recreational facilities,  shopping  centres\r\n\r\nand so on.  But over time, as the town\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpands, it is sometimes necessary to relocate that  town\r\n\r\ncentre to better serve residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Hougang South Neighbourhood II, or\r\n\r\nKovan  City  as  it came to be called,  as  Hougang  town\r\n\r\nexpanded northwards, an MRT station and a new town centre\r\n\r\nwere  planned  at  Hougang Central,  Neighbourhood  VIII,\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is  more  centrally  located  within   the\r\n\r\nexpanded  town.  To better serve the residents,  all  the\r\n\r\nbus  services that were originally in Hougang South  were\r\n\r\nto be moved and centralised in the bus interchange at the\r\n\r\ntown   centre  or  Hougang  Central.   The  vacated   bus\r\n\r\ninterchange  site and the vacated Hougang  Branch  Office\r\n\r\nwould   be   designated   for  residential   development.\r\n\r\nObviously,  because  there is no  need  to  provide  more\r\n\r\nresidential  development  at this point in time,  nothing\r\n\r\nhas been done so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members of this House that decisions\r\n\r\nlike  this  to relocate town centres and therefore  cause\r\n\r\ndisruption to shopkeepers and even to residents, are  not\r\n\r\ntaken lightly, but sometimes they have to be taken.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are taken, certain measures are also  put  in\r\n\r\nplace   to   mitigate  the  impact.   For  example,   the\r\n\r\ndowngrading  is implemented gradually over several  years\r\n\r\nto  ensure that both residents and shopkeepers have  time\r\n\r\nto  adapt  to  the change.  Notice is given as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible.   In  the case of Kovan City, for example,  the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers were informed as early as 1986.  The  planned\r\n\r\nclosure of Hougang South bus interchange was conveyed  to\r\n\r\nthe  shopkeepers as early as 1992.  When the  shops  were\r\n\r\nsold  to  them  in 1993 under the Sale of Tenanted  Shops\r\n\r\nScheme,  HDB  took  this into account that  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndowngraded   from  a  town  centre  and  that   the   bus\r\n\r\ninterchange  will be closed.  So, HDB valued these  shops\r\n\r\nnot  as  town  centre  shops but as neighbourhood  centre\r\n\r\nshops, and re-priced them accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, HDB works closely with other agencies to\r\n\r\nschedule the relocation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfacilities  such  as bus interchange from  the  old  town\r\n\r\ncentre.   In  this  case  of Hougang,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\nrelocation  of  the  bus interchange coincided  with  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the  new Kovan MRT Station,  which  is  just\r\n\r\nacross  the road.  And, hopefully, when Kovan MRT Station\r\n\r\nis opened, this will help to balance part of the loss due\r\n\r\nto the relocation of the bus interchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where HDB can do so, it will assist the shopkeepers\r\n\r\naffected   by  relocation,  eg,  by  exercising   greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  change  of use  approvals,  by  allowing\r\n\r\nshopowners  to convert to shorter leases, by  sub-letting\r\n\r\nthe shops and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua also asked whether there is any\r\n\r\nagency that is overall in charge of land use in HDB  town\r\n\r\ncentres.   I will ask HDB to work with relevant  agencies\r\n\r\nto  take  the  necessary measures needed to minimise  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of such plans in future.  But I cannot  give  any\r\n\r\nundertaking that such relocations will never  take  place\r\n\r\nor that such relocations will only take place if there is\r\n\r\nno adverse impact on the shopkeepers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to respond to Mr Wee Siew Kim on wet\r\n\r\nmarkets,  as  Members would know, HDB used to  build  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  its housing estates.  But for public  health\r\n\r\nreasons,  after 1982, HDB replaced the wet  markets  with\r\n\r\ndry markets, and these dry markets comprise a cluster  of\r\n\r\nshops as well as a supermarket.  Unfortunately, these dry\r\n\r\nmarkets soon became wet again, and public health concerns\r\n\r\nresurfaced.   So,  in 1982, based on the  review  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and feedback from advisers and residents,  HDB\r\n\r\nstarted to build new markets  -  not wet, not dry  -  but\r\n\r\nnew.    These  are similar to wet markets  but  they  are\r\n\r\ndesigned with improved features, much cleaner, much  more\r\n\r\nhygienic,  larger market stalls and wider aisles  and  so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new markets are usually co-located with other\r\n\r\nretail  and  eating facilities in stand-alone  commercial\r\n\r\ncomplexes  at  neighbourhood centres.   These  integrated\r\n\r\nfacilities  have helped to provide a good  marketing  and\r\n\r\nshopping environment for the residents.  Some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers  may  be  aware  of such new  developments.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in Sengkang, we have Rivervale Plaza;  in   Chua\r\n\r\nChu Kang, we have the Yew Tee Shopping Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Mr Wee that HDB has also\r\n\r\nstarted  to tender out designated sites for the provision\r\n\r\nof  retail  marketing  and eating  facilities.   And  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful tenderer has the flexibility to build whatever\r\n\r\ntype  of  market facilities that he thinks the  residents\r\n\r\nneed  and want, whether it is a new market or whether  it\r\n\r\nis a supermarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan  provides short to medium term  planning  of\r\n\r\nland  use  and the intensity of individual land  parcels.\r\n\r\nThe  Master Plan 2003 aims to make Singapore a great city\r\n\r\nto  live,  work  and play.  But, how do  we  measure  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of our Master Plan?  We need to  define  key\r\n\r\nperformance  indicators to monitor the  progress  of  our\r\n\r\nMaster Plan.  To date, we have not defined any quality of\r\n\r\nlife  indicators  for  Singaporeans.   Sir,  we  need  to\r\n\r\ndetermine quantifiable indicators which Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nunderstand.   In  this way, we will all know  whether  we\r\n\r\nhave  planned successfully to maximise our  land  use  to\r\n\r\nprovide a quality living environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must commend the URA for adopting an open and\r\n\r\nconsultative approach to solicit public feedback for  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plans of different regions.  In order to develop a\r\n\r\nbetter  sense of belonging among Singaporeans, we  should\r\n\r\nreach  out  to  more  Singaporeans,  especially  the  HDB\r\n\r\nheartlanders  to  participate in  land  use  planning  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.    More  outreach  efforts  are  required   to\r\n\r\nencourage  active citizen participation in our  land  use\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) How much has been achieved in the Master Plan 1998?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What percentage of State land has its plot ratio\r\n\r\nincreased as compared to private land?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What measures have been taken to improve the\r\n\r\njobs and home accessibility for Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) What are the key performance targets of Master\r\n\r\nPlan 2003?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nURA's  move  to  give  developers  and  businesses   more\r\n\r\nflexibility  in their land use by having sites  with  new\r\n\r\nexpanded  white zoning under which a wider  mix  of  uses\r\n\r\nwill  be allowed, ranging from residential and commercial\r\n\r\nto  sports  and R&D facilities.  This also  implies  that\r\n\r\nlandowners have greater flexibility to change  a  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  uses  of their building in future  according  to\r\n\r\nmarket demands without attracting development charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I would like to suggest that when\r\n\r\ntenders  are invited for such plots, unless the intention\r\n\r\nis  merely  to  allow  greater flexibility,  some  weight\r\n\r\nshould  be  given to the proposed uses of the land  which\r\n\r\nmay  add  more  vibrancy to the area and thus  indirectly\r\n\r\nbring in more and wider economic benefits, than just  the\r\n\r\nbid  prices for the land.  Otherwise, for sites  such  as\r\n\r\nthose  next  to  the  Jurong East  MRT  Station  recently\r\n\r\nunveiled in the draft Master Plan 2003, the wider mix and\r\n\r\ncombination of uses allowed may be purely academic, since\r\n\r\ncommercial and residential uses would generally yield the\r\n\r\nhighest  residual land values.  Previous whites sites  in\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Area,  for instance,  have  been  developed\r\n\r\nlargely for commercial uses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to propose that for white sites,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry could, in future, instead of prescribing the\r\n\r\npermissible  uses of the land, provide an exclusion  list\r\n\r\nof  uses  that  are  disallowed,  because  they  will  be\r\n\r\nincompatible with the surrounding land use.   This  could\r\n\r\nallow for even more creative and flexible use of land and\r\n\r\nenable  land  owners  to adapt more quickly  to  changing\r\n\r\nmarket conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to land use, I would also like to ask\r\n\r\nwhat  the Ministry's thinking is with regard to land  for\r\n\r\nretirement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing.   I understand that feedback has been  given  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry regarding the need to look into provision of\r\n\r\nretirement  housing  in  view of  an  ageing  population.\r\n\r\nThere  are  already  lands designated for  nursing  homes\r\n\r\nwhich have been sold by the Government on 30-year leases.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  ask whether the Government  can  also\r\n\r\nconsider  designating  land for  retirement  housing  and\r\n\r\nselling them on, say, 30-year leases.  HDB already builds\r\n\r\ngranny  flats  and perhaps the private  sector  and  NTUC\r\n\r\naffiliated  organisations could be given the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto participate in this area of social provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one of the MPs in the west region, I am also\r\n\r\nvery  happy  to note that there are plans to improve  the\r\n\r\naccessibility within the Jurong area with  a  light  rail\r\n\r\nsystem for the future Jurong Regional Line.  I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  plans  to improve accessibility of the  area  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented as soon as possible, as this is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  reasons which makes the Jurong area less attractive\r\n\r\nto  live  in  than  the  East.  Tuas,  for  instance,  is\r\n\r\ninfamous as a place that employees try to avoid as  their\r\n\r\nplace of work.  Indeed, the ERC Report accepted as one of\r\n\r\nthe   recommendations  of the Land  Work  Group  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  invest  in transportation  infrastructure\r\n\r\nahead  of  demand if there are sound reasons  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nHence, I would like to ask the Minister how the proposals\r\n\r\nin  the  Master  Plan 2003 for this area  would  help  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the attractiveness of Tuas as a place for  work,\r\n\r\nif not, live and play.\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Sir, the setting up\r\n\r\nof  the 3-in-1 service centre in Jurong East took only 11\r\n\r\nmonths from approval to operation.  I would like to thank\r\n\r\nMND  for  this.   So,  instead of cutting  $100  off  the\r\n\r\nbudget, I believe maybe we should add $100.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of \"a first world oasis in a third world\r\n\r\nregion\"  gave Singapore a competitive advantage for  over\r\n\r\n30 years.  We clearly did well.  But the world has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanged.   Not only do we have to compete for investments\r\n\r\namong  cities,  we also have to compete to  be  the  best\r\n\r\nplace to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Esplanade is our latest pride. But when\r\n\r\nyou  travel along Sheares Bridge at night, it  is  hardly\r\n\r\nseen,  unlike  the  Fullerton  Hotel  which  is  brightly\r\n\r\nlighted  up.  Bright lights and big cities are a  natural\r\n\r\ncombination.   Think  of the theatre district  of  London\r\n\r\nwhere  the  flashing lights create a vibrant and  buzzing\r\n\r\natmosphere,  or  the  chaotic  and  colourful  shops   of\r\n\r\nShanghai,  and  Harajuku in Tokyo.  I am  glad  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has allowed some neon lights to add colour  and\r\n\r\nlife  to our night skies.  We have to make it well  known\r\n\r\nto  the  people and identify more areas for such  lights.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the countries came and learn from  us.   So  we\r\n\r\nshould  put  in  more effort in our much praised  \"Garden\r\n\r\nCity\",  if  not, it will be slowly losing its shine  when\r\n\r\ncompared with some other cities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our population too has changed. With economic\r\n\r\nwealth  and rising standard of living, their expectations\r\n\r\nhave  risen.   They  travel all  over  the  world.   They\r\n\r\ncompare  our  city  state  with  other  countries.    Our\r\n\r\nstudents  study  overseas and expect  to  have  the  same\r\n\r\nquality  living  conditions as the  best  cities  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.    The   competition  for  talent,  tourists   and\r\n\r\ninvestments has now become global.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should use this economic downturn period to\r\n\r\nsharpen  our competitive edge.  I would like to urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  increase  MND's  budget  further  to  re-energise   and  consolidate  our  development,   position\r\n\r\nourselves strategically for the next wave.  MND must  aim\r\n\r\nhigh  to make Singapore truly a city of excellence.   Our\r\n\r\nbuildings  should reflect our multi-cultural  and  multi-racial  background.  If we keep building boring and  \"so-so\"  looking buildings, Singapore will soon become a \"so-so\"  city.  We should start building buildings that  will\r\n\r\nstand  up to the best designed buildings in other cities.\r\n\r\nBetter still, we should encourage buildings designed  for\r\n\r\nour  humid and hot weather.  We would save money  through\r\n\r\nenergy  conservation  and we could even  become  a  world\r\n\r\nleader in design for the tropics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGood-looking  buildings  need  not  necessarily  be  more\r\n\r\nexpensive and less practical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should benchmark against the best cities in\r\n\r\nthe world.  When we built Changi Airport, we learned very\r\n\r\naggressively  from the best.  We should do the  same  for\r\n\r\neverything  that we do.

What are the planning\r\n\r\nconsiderations  taken  to ensure that  the  intensity  of\r\n\r\nliving  does  not cause social and communal  dislocation?\r\n\r\nThis   is   especially  important  where   good   private\r\n\r\nresidential   estates   are  now  faced   with   5-storey\r\n\r\napartments overlooking into their houses,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  view  of the plot ratio of 1.4 for landed residential\r\n\r\nestates.   The  mobility  of  residents  for  social  and\r\n\r\ncommunal  interactions,  as well as  personal  well-being\r\n\r\nwith regard to a 4-storey high public housing, has to  be\r\n\r\nstudied carefully before duplicating in other estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the planning considerations of the places\r\n\r\nof  worship,  especially in private residential  estates?\r\n\r\nAnd  what  are the planning considerations of columbarium\r\n\r\nwithin  these  places  of  worship?   This  is  extremely\r\n\r\nsensitive  in  private landed housing  estates.

Would  URA  consider\r\n\r\ndetailed planning at areas where it is a necessity?   For\r\n\r\nexample, Toa Payoh is such a vibrant town now because  of\r\n\r\nthe detailed development guide plan that was drawn up  in\r\n\r\n1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Michael Lim is not present. Dr\r\n\r\nWang Kai Yuen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, in land-scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore, everyone has the impression that in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere  is  always  going to be short of land,  Government\r\n\r\nlandfills notwithstanding.  Therefore, investing in  land\r\n\r\ncannot  be  that  wrong.  Government has also  reinforced\r\n\r\nthis  concept through very careful and controlled release\r\n\r\nof land through its tendering system.  As a result, often\r\n\r\ntimes,  property investment yields fantastic  result  not\r\n\r\nbecause   of   its   intrinsic  value  but   because   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  land  policies.   This  has  led  to  over-investment   in  land  by  businesses  and   individuals.\r\n\r\nRegardless  of  whether it is residential, commercial  or\r\n\r\nindustrial  land,  their  value has  escalated  over  the\r\n\r\nyears, leading to the current high land cost in Singapore\r\n\r\nand contributing much to our current difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was a surprise to learn from the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in his recent Budget Statement  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no shortage of industrial land in Singapore  - not  now,  not ever.  So, in a way, one wonders what  has\r\n\r\nJTC been doing over the years,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nallocating industrial land at ever increasing land price,\r\n\r\nuntil recently.  Sir, unwinding the current situation  is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult.  As the Minister  for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nindicated,  we  would all be very worried  if  Government\r\n\r\ncauses  a  collapse  in land price, leading  to  negative\r\n\r\nequity suffered by all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we were to leave the current\r\n\r\nsituation  to slowly digest the inflated land  price,  it\r\n\r\nwould  also  delay  our economic recovery.   In  the  ERC\r\n\r\nReport,  the  concept of competitive factor  pricing  for\r\n\r\nland  use has been introduced.  I would like to find  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister  how he proposes  to  implement  this\r\n\r\nconcept.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not present. Dr\r\n\r\nAmy Khor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, being the largest\r\n\r\nlandlord in Singapore owning some 90% of the land in this\r\n\r\ncountry,  the Government has repeatedly assured  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  an  adequate supply of land  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nstable property market and rein in price increases.   Its\r\n\r\nvast  land holdings give it leverage to steer the  market\r\n\r\nin its long-term strategic direction.  Most recently, DPM\r\n\r\nLee  has  assured  this House that  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nensure  an adequate supply of industrial land to  achieve\r\n\r\nstable and internationally competitive prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few days, and just a few minutes ago,\r\n\r\nit seems to me that many in this House have tried to make\r\n\r\nland  cost  the chief villian for our business woes,  the\r\n\r\ndestroyer  of  entrepreneurial drive  and  the  cause  of\r\n\r\nnational  embarrassment (as in the case of  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nMaersk and Evergreen to Tanjong Pelapas).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that our present business\r\n\r\nwoes  are  due to a combination of factors which  include\r\n\r\nland,  but  also  labour costs, other than  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaterials.  In fact, for most large companies, land costs\r\n\r\nmake  up  only  a  small fraction of  their  entire  cost\r\n\r\nstructure,  the  bulk  being  labour  costs  other   than\r\n\r\nmaterial costs.  In reality, to remain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitive, all costs must be reined in.  The danger, of\r\n\r\ncourse, is when land costs rise out of sync with the rest\r\n\r\nof the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a property consultant, I would also like to note\r\n\r\nthat  since  1996, land prices for almost all sectors  of\r\n\r\nthe  property market, including industrial and commercial\r\n\r\nland,  have fallen by about half or more.  So, too,  have\r\n\r\nrentals, and our office space occupancy cost is now lower\r\n\r\nthan  even  those of Mumbai and Beijing.  The  locational\r\n\r\npreferences of multinationals and blue chip names reflect\r\n\r\nmulti-dimensional  decision processes, including  quality\r\n\r\nof life and quality of infrastructure.  Land cost is only\r\n\r\none   of  these  factors.   For  this  reason,  while   I\r\n\r\nappreciate the difficulty of obtaining data, every effort\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  to  derive, as the  ERC  Workgroup  has\r\n\r\nproposed,  authenticated value added  per  land  area  by\r\n\r\nsector,  taking  into  account  the  entire  package   of\r\n\r\ninterests and liabilities that go with the land for  more\r\n\r\naccurate cost comparisons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While high land costs will make us uncompetitive,\r\n\r\nthere  is  also an opposite danger that an oversupply  of\r\n\r\nland,  and  thus built-up space, is a waste  of  valuable\r\n\r\neconomic resources.  For instance, island-wide, there are\r\n\r\ncurrently  more  than 43 million square  feet  of  vacant\r\n\r\nindustrial  space  and about 11 million  square  feet  of\r\n\r\nvacant  office space. This amount of vacant office  space\r\n\r\nis  nearly  three times the amount of space proposed  for\r\n\r\nthe  Business  Financial Centre and  enough  to  fill  12\r\n\r\nRepublic Plazas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a knowledge-based economy and with recent changes\r\n\r\nto  the  land  use groups in the Master  Plan  2003,  the\r\n\r\ndistinction between office and industrial space and  even\r\n\r\nresidential  space will become increasingly blurred  with\r\n\r\nthe  proliferation of business parks, home offices, live-work,  high-tech  industrial space, etc,  including  One-North.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is how would his\r\n\r\nMinistry  track  the  supply and demand  for  office  and\r\n\r\nindustrial space which impinges on the Government's  land\r\n\r\nsales programme, so as to avoid large\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvolatilities in the market as the traditional definitions\r\n\r\nof  such  spaces have become increasingly  obsolete,  and\r\n\r\nthere is considerable overlap between the two.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, let me respond\r\n\r\nto Dr Teo Ho Pin's questions on the Master Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, the Master Plan is reviewed every\r\n\r\nfive years.  The last review was done in 1998.  What  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan does is to translate the Concept  Plan  2001\r\n\r\ninto  more  specific land use plans for the medium  term,\r\n\r\nand  the Concept Plan 2001, in turn, ensures that we have\r\n\r\nenough  land to meet our development needs in the  longer\r\n\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked what has been achieved since the last\r\n\r\nMaster Plan review in 1998.  Let me just go through  some\r\n\r\nof the developments since then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, new towns such as Sengkang and Punggol\r\n\r\nwere  developed  after the Master Plan  1998.   New  rail\r\n\r\nnetworks such as the North East MRT Line and LRT  systems\r\n\r\nin  Bukit Panjang and Sengkang were also established.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as parks were concerned, there were new parks -  the\r\n\r\nHindhede  Nature  Park  for  one.   Existing  parks  were\r\n\r\nredeveloped,   for  example,  West   Coast   Park.    New\r\n\r\ncommercial  space  at  Novena Square,  Far  East  Square,\r\n\r\nCompass  Point  in  Sengkang  and  other  HDB  town   and\r\n\r\nneighbourhood centres were built.  New industrial estates\r\n\r\nand  business parks such as Woodlands Spectrum and Changi\r\n\r\nBusiness  Park were developed to provide jobs  closer  to\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Master Plan 2003? The new Master Plan\r\n\r\nwill  focus  on two things: (1) enhancing the quality  of\r\n\r\nour  living  environment through green  spaces;  and  (2)\r\n\r\nreinforcing the identity of familiar places in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs for the business community, we will be looking at ways\r\n\r\nto  provide  greater flexibility for businesses.   Please\r\n\r\nallow me to elaborate.\r\n\r\nThe  public has given great support for the proposals  in\r\n\r\nURA's Parks and Waterbodies Plan - a key part of our plan\r\n\r\nto realise our vision of Singapore as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"tropical  city in a garden\".  So, Master Plan 2003  will\r\n\r\nprovide  for  an additional 1,200 hectares of  parks  and\r\n\r\npark  connectors.  To give you an idea of what this means\r\n\r\n-  1,200  hectares  is equivalent to  something  like  20\r\n\r\nBishan  Parks, or if you consider the existing amount  of\r\n\r\nland that we set aside for parkland, it is another 45% of\r\n\r\nparkland  for the enjoyment of Singaporeans.    Residents\r\n\r\nin  several of our newer towns - Sengkang, Jurong West  - as well as in Woodlands, can look forward to new parks in\r\n\r\ntheir  neighbourhood.   And  for  existing  parks,   like\r\n\r\nLabrador and Pasir Ris, we will be extending them.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, unexplored areas, like the central\r\n\r\ncatchment, will be opened up for recreational activities.\r\n\r\nThere will be plans for canopy walk, an observation tower\r\n\r\nand  more  hiking  trails and boardingwalks.   All  these\r\n\r\nplans  will be obviously implemented in conjunction  with\r\n\r\nthe PUB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recognise and to safeguard our natural heritage,\r\n\r\nnature reserves and nature areas will be reflected in the\r\n\r\ndraft  Master  Plan 2003 for the first  time.   With  all\r\n\r\nthese  initiatives and programmes in place, there  should\r\n\r\nbe  no reason for Singaporeans to complain that there  is\r\n\r\nnothing to do in Singapore.  Indeed, even now, there  are\r\n\r\nsome  quite  breathtaking and very  beautiful  places  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  places like Sungei Buloh,  Chek  Java,  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  Nature  Reserve, Labrador  Park,  and  many  other\r\n\r\nplaces,  which I hope more Singaporeans will  take  their\r\n\r\ntime to visit and to appreciate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of this draft Master Plan\r\n\r\n2003  is the identity plan.  What the identity plan seeks\r\n\r\nto  do is to retain the unique identity of some parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Again, I am pleased to note that  this  plan\r\n\r\nhas  received  very strong support from  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Everyone of us has a favourite building,  park,\r\n\r\nor  place  in Singapore where we have enjoyed good  times\r\n\r\nwith  family and friends.  These physical markers in  our\r\n\r\nlives serve to root us in time and space.  We should  not\r\n\r\nunderestimate their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportance  in our ongoing efforts to forge a Singaporean\r\n\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Master Plan 2003, we intend to preserve both\r\n\r\nsuch   places.   The  identity  plan  goes  beyond   just\r\n\r\nretaining  old  buildings.  It also recognises  that  the\r\n\r\nexisting  community life, the streetscape, the activities\r\n\r\n-  all  these  contribute to the identity, character  and\r\n\r\ncolour   of  the  place.   MND  is  supportive   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   to  conserve   about   600   additional\r\n\r\nbuildings,  or  about  10%,  of  the  existing  stock  of\r\n\r\nconservation buildings.  There are four key nodes of  the\r\n\r\nidentity  plan,  namely, Balestier, Jalan Besar,  Tanjong\r\n\r\nKatong and Joo Chiat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to bear in mind that there is a limit\r\n\r\nto  conservation.   Much  as we  want  to  conserve  many\r\n\r\nbuildings and areas, this cannot, and should not, be  the\r\n\r\noverriding consideration when we plan for Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nlive  on  a small island with many competing land  needs.\r\n\r\nSo  land use planning is always a fine balancing act with\r\n\r\nmany  trade-offs  to be made.  Do we conserve  or  do  we\r\n\r\nsacrifice  some  infrastructure  that  is  important  for\r\n\r\neconomic  growth?   Do  we  conserve  and  diminish   the\r\n\r\neconomic value of some pieces of property?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library, for instance, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  asked  for  its  conservation.   But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it has to be relocated because of the need\r\n\r\nfor  a new road and tunnel system in the area which  will\r\n\r\nallow  our city to grow.  More recently, there were calls\r\n\r\nfor  the Portsdown Road area to be kept as it is.  Again,\r\n\r\nit  has  to  be  disturbed because there  is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nconstruct a vital road link through the area.  We can  of\r\n\r\ncourse try to mitigate the effects of these developments,\r\n\r\nand we will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU and the National Library Board are exploring\r\n\r\nways  to  capture  the  memory of the  existing  National\r\n\r\nLibrary.  JTC is trying to relocate the popular cold  bar\r\n\r\nrestaurant  to somewhere nearby.  But while  we  seek  to\r\n\r\npreserve memories\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  identity, it is not possible to conserve  everything\r\n\r\nand freeze our growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members, like Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mdm Yu-Foo, Mdm\r\n\r\nCynthia Phua, have commented that we need to improve  the\r\n\r\naccessibility   of  jobs  to  homes.   Mdm   Yu-Foo,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, asked whether we can find ways and  means  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  vibrancy of our city, to turn  it  from  a\r\n\r\nboring and so-so city into a wild city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> WOW City!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sorry. I heard it wrongly. While\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid that turning Singapore into a WOW city must\r\n\r\nbe the responsibility of other agencies as well, not only\r\n\r\nMND, we will contribute our part to that effort.  I would\r\n\r\nalso  like to thank Mdm Yu-Foo for the $100 ang pow which\r\n\r\nshe  has  contributed to the Ministry and  I  hope  that,\r\n\r\nafter she hears my reply, she will not withdraw it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, HDB does offer a wide range of facilities\r\n\r\nfor  accessibility.   Facilities,  like  schools,  parks,\r\n\r\npolyclinics,  community  centres  and  so  on,  are  well\r\n\r\nlocated  within  our new towns and they are  within  easy\r\n\r\nreach  of  residents.   That we  can  do,  and  we  will.\r\n\r\nRegional  centres, such as Tampines and Jurong,  will  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  into  an  integrated  live,  work   and   play\r\n\r\nenvironment.     Housing,   shops,   entertainment    and\r\n\r\ninstitutional  developments will be introduced  into  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Regional Centre.  And URA, HDB and SLA will  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  grassroots organisations to  allow  vacant\r\n\r\nstate land that is not needed in the short term to be put\r\n\r\nto interim community and recreational use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring jobs closer to homes, the Master Plan 2003\r\n\r\nwill  safeguard  more  industrial  lands  in  residential\r\n\r\nareas,  such as Sengkang, Sembawang, Hougang and Punggol.\r\n\r\nNew  housing  units will also be introduced in  the  west\r\n\r\nregion,  as  Dr Amy Khor pointed out.  This  will  be  in\r\n\r\nmature  estates,  such as Clementi as well  as  in  newer\r\n\r\nones, such as Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the central area is a major employment centre, we\r\n\r\nwill also increase\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  number of homes in the central area.  One area where\r\n\r\nwe  will  do this is in Outram.  URA will be proposing  a\r\n\r\nnew  high  density residential precinct at Outram.   This\r\n\r\nwill  capitalise on two very positive attributes of  this\r\n\r\narea,  one, the hilly terrain in the area; and, two,  its\r\n\r\ninternal city location.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support Mrs Yu-Foo's call for us to build a\r\n\r\ncity  of  excellence.  It is indeed  our  intention.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  if  Members  will recall, the URA  some  time  ago\r\n\r\nrevealed the landmark and gateways plan.  What this  plan\r\n\r\ndoes  is  to earmark certain strategic sites for landmark\r\n\r\ndevelopments,  landmark buildings.  We  have  started  to\r\n\r\nhold  design  competitions as  a  way  to  draw  new  and\r\n\r\ncreative  ideas.  For example, for the Duxton Plain  high\r\n\r\ndensity  public housing project, we held an international\r\n\r\ndesign competition in which many international architects\r\n\r\nparticipated in this competition.  I am pleased  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the  competition was won by a  local  architectural\r\n\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add even more buzz to the city, URA plans to\r\n\r\nestablish a cultural and activity loop around the  Marina\r\n\r\nBay  area.  So if you look at the Marina Bay area  today,\r\n\r\nyou  will  see the Esplanade, you will see the Fullerton,\r\n\r\nthe developments along One Fullerton, etc.  We would like\r\n\r\nto  develop  that even further around the Marina  Bay  so\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans can look forward to even  more  world-class  attractions to arts and cultural activities  along\r\n\r\nthe  waterfront and, hopefully, this will  contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore becoming a WOW city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will selectively increase density of residential\r\n\r\nland  around  MRT stations so that more people  can  live\r\n\r\nwithin easy reach of public transport.  This is a concern\r\n\r\nof  some  Members  that  we do not  have  a  sufficiently\r\n\r\nextensive rail network for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about increase of plot ratio on\r\n\r\npublic and private lands.  Let me explain, first of  all,\r\n\r\nthat  when we assign plot ratio to land in Singapore,  we\r\n\r\ndo  so on the basis of planning objective, and not on who\r\n\r\nowns the land, in other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwords,  not whether it is public or private.   While  the\r\n\r\nplanners will seek to intensify land use, they also  have\r\n\r\nto  be  guided by many other considerations, for example,\r\n\r\ntechnical  considerations.   There  are  tight   controls\r\n\r\nimposed  by,  say, flight paths, which need to  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  consideration.   And we  also  need  to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the need to maintain the ambience and  character\r\n\r\nof certain areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Master Plan Review 1998, there was\r\n\r\nalready  a  major  review  of land  use  and  development\r\n\r\nintensity  and many parcels of land had their plot  ratio\r\n\r\nincreased.   For  the  Master Plan 2003,  we  will  focus\r\n\r\nintensification on undeveloped lands, or  what  we  call,\r\n\r\nsoft lands, especially those near MRT stations.  This  is\r\n\r\ndone  with  the  knowledge that it will be sufficient  to\r\n\r\nmeet our medium term needs for housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on how we can allow greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in land use for businesses.   We  are  in  a\r\n\r\nrapidly evolving business environment.  So the ability to\r\n\r\nadjust quickly to changing business needs is important to\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness.  In this regard,  the  Master  Plan\r\n\r\n2003  has incorporated several features that will provide\r\n\r\nthis greater flexibility for businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on white sites, we propose to allow more uses\r\n\r\nwithin the so-called white sites.  As Members will  know,\r\n\r\nthe  white site concept was introduced to give developers\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility to allow a mix of uses - commercial,\r\n\r\nresidential, hotel - on such sites.  We will expand  this\r\n\r\nnew white site zone to allow for other uses as well, such\r\n\r\nas  sports and recreation, clean industrial uses and  R&D\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Secondly, we will introduce new Business One\r\n\r\nand Business Two zones (B1, B2 zoning).  Basically, these\r\n\r\nnew  zonings will also allow industrialists to change the\r\n\r\nuses  according  to changing business conditions  without\r\n\r\nthe need to apply for rezoning of industrial land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether we can allow more\r\n\r\ntypes  of  businesses  to  be  conducted  in  residential\r\n\r\npremises.  I remember this was a matter which was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  raised  last  year by several Members.   We  did  a\r\n\r\nreview  and I am pleased to inform Members of this House,\r\n\r\nyes,  we  will allow more uses in residential areas.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  be introducing a Home Office  Scheme  for\r\n\r\nboth HDB and private developments that allows home owners\r\n\r\nto  conduct  certain  small scale businesses  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes within zones that allow for mixed uses.  Under this\r\n\r\nscheme  entrepreneurs can operate small scale  businesses\r\n\r\nfrom  their  own  homes without incurring  high  start-up\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will adopt a negative list approach to kick off\r\n\r\nthis   scheme.   Uses  that  could  potentially  generate\r\n\r\ndisturbances, such as noise, pollution and traffic,  will\r\n\r\nbe excluded.  Examples include retail, maid agencies, car\r\n\r\ntrading  office,  commercial schools and  food  catering.\r\n\r\nUses  specified in the negative list will not be allowed.\r\n\r\nEverything  will be allowed, provided they  satisfy  some\r\n\r\nguidelines.     The  negative  list  will  be   regularly\r\n\r\nreviewed based on public feedback and I expect that  many\r\n\r\nsmall   businesses,  such  as  professional   consultancy\r\n\r\nservices,  design  offices, financial  planning  offices,\r\n\r\netc, will benefit from such a scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the premises do not become full-fledged offices and to protect the amenity of the\r\n\r\nresidential environment, some guidelines will be  put  in\r\n\r\nplace,  for  example,  the business  activities  must  be\r\n\r\nconfined  within the premises and the number of employees\r\n\r\nwill  be  limited.   I hope Members will  understand  why\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  for such rules to be  put  in  place.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those who have bought into these developments,\r\n\r\nwith the hope of enjoying some peace and quiet, will feel\r\n\r\naggrieved, and rightly so.  My Ministry is now finalising\r\n\r\nthe  details  of  the  Home Office  Scheme  and  we  will\r\n\r\nannounce the guidelines to them in the next few months.\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take up some Members' comments that\r\n\r\nflexibility in some cases can result in undesirable  side\r\n\r\neffects, like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincrease  in value of land.  Yes, today we do allow  some\r\n\r\nancillary  uses, eg commercial and supporting uses,  such\r\n\r\nas  childcare centres, canteens, showrooms,  etc,  within\r\n\r\nbusiness zones.  Mdm Cynthia Phua, in fact, asked why  do\r\n\r\nwe   not   extend   the  allowable  uses  in   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopments  to  other complementary uses,  particularly\r\n\r\ntoday   when  many  industrial  developments  are  under-utilised  or  not  utilised.  Industrial land  developers\r\n\r\nhave asked that pure office or retail users be allowed to\r\n\r\nfill  up  vacant industrial space.  There are  many  such\r\n\r\nrequests that my Ministry receives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, they appear quite reasonable. Why\r\n\r\ndo  we  zone land?  Why do we specify that this land  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  used for this purpose?  If land that was  zoned\r\n\r\nindustrial  were used for higher value uses, eg,  offices\r\n\r\nor  shopping centres, we would soon use up our  stock  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  land.   The price of industrial  space  would\r\n\r\nstart  to  escalate,  and  our competitiveness  would  be\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to zone land specifically to safeguard\r\n\r\nsufficient  land  for housing, parks  and  for  community\r\n\r\nuses, such as schools and hospitals.  Furthermore, zoning\r\n\r\nensures that uses are compatibly located.  For example, I\r\n\r\nam  sure we do not want our residents to live next  to  a\r\n\r\nchemical  factory or, suddenly, to find, after they  have\r\n\r\nmoved into a neighbourhood that, overnight, they have got\r\n\r\na repair workshop next door to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoning is also essential to ensure that the\r\n\r\ntransport  facilities  can  be  planned  to  match   such\r\n\r\nactivities.  For example, if we have a factory or part of\r\n\r\na  housing estate suddenly to be converted to a  shopping\r\n\r\ncentre,  we  can  expect a lot of traffic  congestion  in\r\n\r\nthese areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for all these reasons, I hope Members will\r\n\r\nappreciate why URA needs to enforce zoning controls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the draft Master Plan 2003 for the west region\r\n\r\nhas  been  launched.  This is the first in the series  of\r\n\r\nfive  regional plans that would be launched over the next\r\n\r\nfew months for the north, north-east,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neast  and the central regions.  All these plans  will  be\r\n\r\nexhibited.   Before firming up these  plans,  I  hope  to\r\n\r\nreceive views and suggestions from Members to help us  to\r\n\r\nimprove our plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the property market. Many\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House have asked what the Government  is\r\n\r\ndoing  to  ensure that our land prices do not hinder  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,   particularly   for   commercial    and\r\n\r\nindustrial land.  Other Members have highlighted that  in\r\n\r\nensuring that Singapore remains cost-competitive,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  inadvertently  destabilise the property  market  and\r\n\r\nerode  the  asset  values of existing land  and  property\r\n\r\nowners.  This House has already discussed industrial land\r\n\r\npricing in detail.  Deputy Prime Minister Lee has already\r\n\r\nexplained  that  we cannot match the lowest  land  prices\r\n\r\noffered  by  our competitors, nor do we need  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nBut,  the Government will safeguard and ensure that there\r\n\r\nis  an  adequate  supply of industrial land  released  to\r\n\r\nachieve competitive and stable prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the Government's land release\r\n\r\npolicy, in particular, for the commercial and residential\r\n\r\nsectors.  The Government's objective behind the supply of\r\n\r\nland  is  to sustain economic growth.  We will  safeguard\r\n\r\nsufficient land over the long term, and we will phase the\r\n\r\nrelease  of  this supply to generate growth.   Prices  of\r\n\r\nland  and  properties  will rise and  fall  according  to\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions.  Our aim is not to control property\r\n\r\nprices  in  the  short  term, eg, by  subsidising  it  to\r\n\r\nmaintain competitiveness when it is high, or boosting  it\r\n\r\nwhen  the  market  is  down  during  economic  downturns.\r\n\r\nRather, it is to ensure a stable property market over the\r\n\r\nmedium  term.  To achieve this, the Government's strategy\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure that there is a sufficient supply of  land\r\n\r\nreleased  to meet the end-users' medium-term  demand  for\r\n\r\nspace.   With sufficient supply, prices will not escalate\r\n\r\nsharply,  and  the market will be more stable.   One  way\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  releases  land  is  through   the\r\n\r\nGovernment Land Sales (GLS) programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor commented on the importance of taking\r\n\r\ninto account all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\navailable supply when determining the GLS programme.  Let\r\n\r\nme  assure  her  that  MND and URA will  take  this  into\r\n\r\naccount.   We  do account for all sources of supply  when\r\n\r\nplanning  for the GLS programme, ie, existing supply  and\r\n\r\nsupply  in  the pipeline, and those released  by  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers as well as Government agencies.  MND and  URA,\r\n\r\ntogether with MOF, MTI and MinLaw, are now studying  ways\r\n\r\nto see how we can improve this operating framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise, however, that it is difficult to\r\n\r\ndetermine  demand accurately, as the market  is  dynamic,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  the reason why in 2001 we  introduced  the\r\n\r\nreserve  list programme.  The reserve list system enables\r\n\r\nthe GLS programme to be more responsive to market demand.\r\n\r\nSites  will  only  be released for sale  when  developers\r\n\r\napply   for   them.   With  this  approach,   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncommercial space has remained, by and large, competitive.\r\n\r\nAs  Dr Amy Khor has pointed out, Singapore is competitive\r\n\r\nby  international standards, whether we are talking about\r\n\r\noffice  or retail space.  Property consultants do regular\r\n\r\nsurveys  and,  for  office space, we are  ranked  in  the\r\n\r\nlatest  survey, 35th in the list of global cities in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Our office rents, in fact, are cheaper than those\r\n\r\nin  Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and Sydney, even Mumbai,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold.   As  for retail space, again, property consultants\r\n\r\nhave  ranked  Singapore 12th in the world.  We  are  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive than cities like Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul and\r\n\r\nTokyo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office market is, however, currently in a state\r\n\r\nof  over-supply mainly because of shrinkage in demand due\r\n\r\nto the economic slowdown.  The private residential market\r\n\r\nis  more  stable.  Prices fell marginally  last  year  by\r\n\r\n1.8%.   But  sentiments in the property market are  still\r\n\r\nuncertain.  The Government has, therefore, taken  a  more\r\n\r\ncautious  approach towards the commercial and residential\r\n\r\nmarkets,  and  has  not released any  sites  through  the\r\n\r\nconfirmed  list of the GLS for residential or  commercial\r\n\r\ndevelopments  since the end of 2001.   We  also  deferred\r\n\r\nplans  to  release a site for the business and  financial\r\n\r\ncentre  in  the  first half of 2003,  and  tightened  the\r\n\r\ncontrols to ensure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat Government agencies build office buildings only when\r\n\r\nthere  are  no suitable alternatives.  However,  we  have\r\n\r\nstill  made  sites  available through the  reserve  list.\r\n\r\nDespite  the  Government's suspension  of  the  confirmed\r\n\r\nlist,  interested  parties  have,  to-date,  successfully\r\n\r\napplied  to release nine land sale sites.  Eight of  them\r\n\r\nhave  been  sold, and the tender for the last  site  will\r\n\r\nclose in the next few days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by restating that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  never  be as cheap as some other countries  with  a\r\n\r\nlarge  land  mass.  We cannot compete on property  prices\r\n\r\nand rentals alone.  There are serious implications to the\r\n\r\nrest  of our economy, if we deliberately depress the true\r\n\r\nmarket value of land.  It is far better to ensure that an\r\n\r\nadequate   supply   of  land  is  released   to   achieve\r\n\r\ncompetitive and stable prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, as a multi-religious society,\r\n\r\nwe  must  provide necessary places of worship to  fulfill\r\n\r\nthe  spiritual needs of Singaporeans.  The  present  open\r\n\r\ntendering  system  of allocating land for  our  religious\r\n\r\nactivities  does  not  provide a  satisfactory  means  to\r\n\r\nensure that places of worship are conveniently located to\r\n\r\nserve the needs of Singaporeans.  In fact, some places of\r\n\r\nworship  are  located  on remote industrial  sites  where\r\n\r\npublic access is difficult.  Others are located in  areas\r\n\r\nwhere there is no carpark available, resulting in serious\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion during religious occasions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to develop a master plan for places of\r\n\r\nworship  in  Singapore.   Based  on  the  proportion   of\r\n\r\ndifferent  religious groups, we should adopt  a  religion\r\n\r\nquota system to allocate land to the respective religious\r\n\r\norganisations.  At the same time, efforts must be made to\r\n\r\nencourage religious harmony through land use allocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What is the basis of allocating for places of\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worship?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What are the measures adopted by URA to promote\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religious harmony in Singapore through land use\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning? and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How can URA ensure that places of worship are\r\n\r\neasily  accessible to worshippers by public  and  private\r\n\r\ntransport?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we have a\r\n\r\nfast-aging  population.  Indeed, many Members have raised\r\n\r\nissues  relating to the elderly and, to be fair, many  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry have paid attention to these areas.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to add another to the list, and this is to resurface\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of retirement villages which was  brought  up\r\n\r\nbefore but has not quite taken off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea is to allow the elderly to live\r\n\r\ntogether and, from the logistics point of view, this  has\r\n\r\nmerit because it will allow for care-giving activities to\r\n\r\nbe  better  organised,  and it will  also  be  easier  to\r\n\r\nconceive recreational and safety facilities as well.  But\r\n\r\nit  has not quite taken off, because what we have at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  are some HDB blocks across Singapore and, as  one\r\n\r\nof  the social workers said to me, it is a colony of  the\r\n\r\nold,  the  frail and the sickly.  We will get  a  funeral\r\n\r\nevery  other week.  So, it is quite depressing.  We  have\r\n\r\norganised the hardware, but not really the software side.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,  this is a new concept, and it requires  some\r\n\r\nchange in mindset.  It also requires time for the idea to\r\n\r\ngain acceptance.  That is why people say it is far easier\r\n\r\nto  integrate  the  old  with the young,  so  that  their\r\n\r\nspirits can be uplifted as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this idea of retirement villages has, in fact,\r\n\r\nworked well in other countries, and perhaps we can  learn\r\n\r\nsome best practices and ideas from them as well.  In some\r\n\r\ncountries like Thailand, retirement villages are in  fact\r\n\r\nset up even through the lure of foreigners.  But I am not\r\n\r\nadvocating that this should be done for non-Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIt is just an idea for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we should move from the concept with just a\r\n\r\ncluster of houses, and we should add software to it,  eg,\r\n\r\nget it well\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanaged, get the facilities in.  But, as with all  things\r\n\r\nin Singapore, it would need to be spearheaded, championed\r\n\r\nand  sponsored.   Perhaps,  to  incentivise  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  or, in fact, the VWOs, we need to put  some  real\r\n\r\nincentives in it.  One of the main prohibitive  areas  is\r\n\r\nland  cost again.  That is why I have directed the  issue\r\n\r\nto  MND.   Perhaps  it  could  consider  making  it  more\r\n\r\naffordable, so that the whole idea can then take off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am saying here is that it remains a good\r\n\r\nidea  and we should not allow the lack of success in  the\r\n\r\npast to deter it.\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, three\r\n\r\nBudget  debates  ago, I asked the Minister  if  he  would\r\n\r\nconsider  granting gross floor area (GFA)  exemption  for\r\n\r\nspace   to  be  set  aside  in  business  and  industrial\r\n\r\ncomplexes for childcare or multi-service centres  as  one\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  a  total approach to  creating  a  family-friendly  environment in Singapore. The Minister  thought\r\n\r\nthat   developers  should  be  willing  to  provide  such\r\n\r\nfacilities on their own volition, as it would surely  add\r\n\r\nto the attractiveness of their developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the ERC report which was released just last\r\n\r\nmonth,   one  of  the  recommendations,  in  the  segment\r\n\r\naddressing  land issues, was to grant more GFA exemptions\r\n\r\nto   encourage  the  provision  of  communal  areas   for\r\n\r\nresidential developments and common areas for  commercial\r\n\r\ndevelopments, so as to improve the quality of the  living\r\n\r\nand  working  environment.  I am therefore encouraged  to\r\n\r\ntry  my luck at persuading the Minister yet again to make\r\n\r\nsimilar GFA concessions for space set aside, specifically\r\n\r\nfor   childcare   centres  in  business  and   industrial\r\n\r\ncomplexes,  as  I  cannot think  of  any  better  way  of\r\n\r\nimproving  the  living and working environment,  than  by\r\n\r\nproviding   more  on-site  or  near-workplace   childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare arrangement is one of the two most\r\n\r\nimportant factors cited by women\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  enabling  them  to  balance  their  work  and  family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.   Apart  from  the  quality   of   care\r\n\r\nprovided, convenience of location is an important factor.\r\n\r\nBest  for  the parents are childcare centres conveniently\r\n\r\nsited at a location near to home or a workplace centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, only big companies with large\r\n\r\nestablishments  would  even consider  having  an  on-site\r\n\r\nchildcare  centre, as it makes little sense for  a  small\r\n\r\ncompany with a small staff to set up one of its own.  The\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale to run such a centre  are  just  not\r\n\r\nthere  to  make  the  enterprise viable  without  a  huge\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  something small companies are not in a position\r\n\r\nto  undertake, and the number of staff benefit is  small.\r\n\r\nIn a big industrial or business development, however, the\r\n\r\nemployees  of many companies sited within such a  complex\r\n\r\nwould  find  a  childcare  centre,  conveniently  located\r\n\r\nsomewhere within the complex, most useful and, with their\r\n\r\ncombined   numbers,   make  the  running   of   such   an\r\n\r\nestablishment a viable proposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our on-going efforts to create a family-friendly environment - an important consideration, both\r\n\r\nfrom  the  perspective of our on-going attempts to  boost\r\n\r\nour  fertility rate as well as being an integral part  of\r\n\r\nthe  enhanced working environment that the ERC  seeks  to\r\n\r\nmake  a reality - I hope that the Minister will give this\r\n\r\nproposal consideration this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the topic of\r\n\r\nheavy vehicle parking must have been discussed many times\r\n\r\nin  this House.  Nonetheless, in new towns, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  see  some flexibility in the policy of heavy  vehicle\r\n\r\nparking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new towns, residents do not have much of an\r\n\r\noption  if  he drives a van with a high roof or  a  heavy\r\n\r\nprime-mover.  This is because multi-storey  carparks  are\r\n\r\nthe   norm.   Their  vehicles  just  would  not  get  in.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the new towns are generally further away  from\r\n\r\nthe  centres of employment.  So, one would empathise with\r\n\r\nthe frustration felt by many residents who are unable  to\r\n\r\nfind parking, especially for those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  have  to hit the road early and wind up the  workday\r\n\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there are rationally correct\r\n\r\narguments  that such vehicles are meant for business  and\r\n\r\nshould  not  be used as a mode of transport to  and  from\r\n\r\nwork or the employers must provide transportation for the\r\n\r\nemployees.   However, there is a human face  behind  each\r\n\r\nproblem and, if a solution also lessens business cost  as\r\n\r\nwell,  so  much  the better.  I hope  we  can  find  some\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise and safety considerations also merit the\r\n\r\nposition  that  heavy  vehicles should  be  kept  out  of\r\n\r\nresidential areas.  Noise and safety considerations  must\r\n\r\nbe  respected.   However, I hope that the Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider allowing the public and private sectors to build\r\n\r\nand operate heavy vehicle parks, say, 2-3 kilometres away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  dense  population  centres.  This  way,  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  drivers can either walk or cycle back and  forth\r\n\r\nbetween their home and the parking space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our much respected long-term town planning,\r\n\r\nland   earmarked  for  facilities  like  light-industrial\r\n\r\nestates - and possibly would not be built for some  years\r\n\r\n-  could  be temporarily released for such purposes.  The\r\n\r\nneed  is  more urgent, now that the recent amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Road  Traffic  Act  allow  for  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nenforcement  action on vehicles which are not  parked  in\r\n\r\ntheir statutorily declared sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, island-wide, there are many and adequate\r\n\r\nparking lots, but there is a wide disparity between where\r\n\r\nthe  lots are located and where people live and where the\r\n\r\ndemand  is.   I hope that in the new towns, the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  consider flexibility in the implementation of  the\r\n\r\npolicy on heavy vehicle parking, and that the plight, and\r\n\r\nthe  alleviation of the pains and frustrations, of  these\r\n\r\nkey   players  in  our  logistics  chain  be  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Istana, located along\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road, is the official residence of the President\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  where  he receives  and  entertains  State\r\n\r\nguests.   The  office of the President  is  also  at  the\r\n\r\nIstana.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire domain of the Istana occupies over 100\r\n\r\nacres.    The  Istana  Building,  which  was   known   as\r\n\r\nGovernment House, was completed in 1869. The Building  is\r\n\r\ndominated  by  a three-storey 28 metre high tower  block,\r\n\r\nand there are two-storey side wings.  There are extensive\r\n\r\ngrounds  and a nine-hole golf course.  Sri Temasek  is  a\r\n\r\n19th  century bungalow which was built in 1869.   It  was\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Secretary's residence.  The Villa was built\r\n\r\nin  1908,  and is the official residence of the  Aide-de-Camp.   It  later became the Private Secretary's bungalow\r\n\r\nin  1916.  Thereafter, in 1958, it became  the  Attorney-General's  house.  It is now used mainly  for  functions.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past,  the Villa was used to house many  foreign\r\n\r\ndignitaries  while they were guests of  the  State  which\r\n\r\nincluded Dr Mahathir, Mr Deng Xiaoping, President Suharto\r\n\r\nand Ex-President George Bush.  The Military Guardroom was\r\n\r\nbuilt in the early 1900s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a great deal of dignity and pride in\r\n\r\nthe  office  of  the President.  And we,  citizens,  have\r\n\r\ngreat respect for our President.  I wish only to raise an\r\n\r\nimportant issue about the maximisation of the use of  the\r\n\r\nphysical  land  space in the Istana.  I do recognise  the\r\n\r\ntranquility and the lovely ambience of the Istana.  I  do\r\n\r\nhope,  if changes do take place, it would not affect  the\r\n\r\noverall ambience of the Istana.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission Statement of National Development is,\r\n\r\nand  I  quote,  \"To create the best physical  and  living\r\n\r\nenvironment for building a robust economy, a vibrant city\r\n\r\nand   cohesive  communities.\"   The  Ministry's   desired\r\n\r\noutcomes  include,  inter alia, a vibrant,  central  area\r\n\r\ncontributing to a world-class city, sufficient  land  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment and provision of optimal greenery, parks  and\r\n\r\nrecreational space for quality living.  In line with  the\r\n\r\ndesired  outcomes  of the Ministry, my query  is  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is currently a maximum utilisation of the  grounds\r\n\r\nof the Istana.  Would it be better if part of the Istana\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  to be transformed into a public park for the better\r\n\r\nutilisation  of the same by the people of Singapore  and,\r\n\r\nfor visitors to Singapore, as a tourist attraction?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Istana is not open to the public,\r\n\r\nexcept  during the occasions of Istana Open  Houses,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  on  New Year's Day, Labour Day, National  Day,\r\n\r\nDeepavali,  Chinese  New Year and Hari  Raya  Puasa.  One\r\n\r\nwould  put  up  a  case  for and recommend  that  such  a\r\n\r\nbeautiful and tranquil place, which could give  peace  of\r\n\r\nmind  and  happiness  to  many in  Singapore,  should  be\r\n\r\nenjoyed by more people frequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please start wrapping up your speech,\r\n\r\nMr Mohan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> I understand our President\r\n\r\ndoes  not stay at the Istana.

Mr Mah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, in response to\r\n\r\nDr  Teo  Ho  Pin  on  the planning norms  for  places  of\r\n\r\nworship.  URA and HDB work together to ensure that  there\r\n\r\nis  adequate  land  for places of  worship  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndifferent religious needs of our residents. He asked what\r\n\r\nis  the  basis for allocating land.  The number  and  the\r\n\r\ndistribution of sites for the different places of worship\r\n\r\nare  based on planning norms and standards, which are set\r\n\r\nnot  just  by URA alone but in consultation with  various\r\n\r\nauthorities,  like the Ministry of Community  Development\r\n\r\nand Sports.  The key factors in determining the number of\r\n\r\nsites  include the size of the residential population  in\r\n\r\nthe area, as well as the needs of the different religious\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Places of worship are one of the many community\r\n\r\nfacilities  that are provided for residents  in  HDB  new\r\n\r\ntowns.  When HDB plans these new towns, various types  of\r\n\r\nreligious institutions are catered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor,  and they are distributed throughout the new  towns.\r\n\r\nAs a result, residents can pursue their own religion in a\r\n\r\nplace  of worship near their homes, well-served by public\r\n\r\ntransport  and  a good road network system.   But,  in  a\r\n\r\nfew  instances,  where land is not so readily  available,\r\n\r\nsites are also provided in industrial estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are sites allocated? They are allocated by open\r\n\r\ntender.   We  specify the type of religious  institution,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is church, Chinese or Hindu temple. I believe\r\n\r\nthat  this is a fair and transparent system.  Apart  from\r\n\r\ntender,  we also use the auction system.  As for mosques,\r\n\r\nthe   sites   for  mosques  are  traditionally  allocated\r\n\r\ndirectly to MUIS, and MUIS will do the development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Dr Teo that my Ministry is\r\n\r\nvery  mindful of the need to provide adequate  sites  for\r\n\r\nplaces  of worship for the different religious groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For  his information, we are  also  exploring\r\n\r\nthis  concept  of  community clusters,  where  civic  and\r\n\r\ncommunity facilities, such as community clubs and nursing\r\n\r\nhomes   are   allocated  together  with   one   religious\r\n\r\ninstitution  per cluster. We are trying out this  concept\r\n\r\nin  Punggol  21.  Apart from optimising land  use,  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  clusters will also serve as a focal  point,  a\r\n\r\ngathering point, for residents to interact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian raised the issue of retirement\r\n\r\nvillages.   I believe Dr Amy Khor also raised this  issue\r\n\r\nearlier  in her cut.  Let me, first of all, say that  the\r\n\r\nissue  of retirement villages was deliberated extensively\r\n\r\nwhen  the IMC for the Aging Population met and discussed.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all, we agreed that our priority was to  allow\r\n\r\nfor  \"aging  in-situ\". As I have explained,  we  try  and\r\n\r\nprovide good facilities so that the elderly can live with\r\n\r\ntheir  families  in places that they are  familiar  with.\r\n\r\nHaving  said that, of course, yes, there are  also  times\r\n\r\nwhen the elderly may want to live on their own.  For this\r\n\r\nreason,  the  HDB  has also provided the  housing  option\r\n\r\nknown  as  the  studio apartment. Studio apartments  were\r\n\r\noriginally built as stand-alone blocks. There  were  some\r\n\r\nvalid concerns\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  having  all  the elderly together  and,  for  this\r\n\r\nreason,  we  have  reviewed the situation.   We  will  be\r\n\r\nintegrating studio apartments in blocks with other 4- and\r\n\r\n5-room  residents,  so  that the young  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nelderly  can live together.  This scheme has  been  well-received  and  we will be doing more, as I  explained  to\r\n\r\nthis House yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there may be demands for other housing options\r\n\r\nfor  the elderly, such as retirement villages.  If  there\r\n\r\nis  such  a  demand  for  a retirement  village,  private\r\n\r\nproperty developers will cater to this demand.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is the business of Government to step in to meet\r\n\r\nthis  demand  for  private retirement villages.  We  have\r\n\r\nalready done so in the case of HDB residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we incentivise it? What we can do is to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that the norms, the building guidelines,  the\r\n\r\nplanning  guidelines  do  not  unnecessarily  impede  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of such retirement villages.  Just  to  give\r\n\r\nMembers a small example.  A feedback was that some of the\r\n\r\ncurrent  planning guidelines for developments in  general\r\n\r\nspecify  certain  minimum car parking  requirements.   We\r\n\r\nhave looked at it and we have decided that for retirement\r\n\r\nvillages, we can relax these guidelines because they  are\r\n\r\nnot relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I have said, I do not believe that Government\r\n\r\nshould directly incentivise the development of retirement\r\n\r\nvillages.   It is best left to the private  sector  as  a\r\n\r\nbusiness decision.  One feedback that we have received is\r\n\r\nto  provide  land on a shorter tenure.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\ninstead  of providing land for 99 years, why not  provide\r\n\r\nland  for  60 years or even 30 years?  This is  something\r\n\r\nthat we can consider, and if it is helpful for developers\r\n\r\nin  encouraging them to provide retirement villages, then\r\n\r\nwe  will certainly look into it favourably.  But, as  for\r\n\r\nland specifically zoned for retirement villages alone,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not believe there is any need for such specific  land\r\n\r\nuse zoning at this point in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee asked whether we will provide bonus\r\n\r\nGFA  for space used for childcare centres.  First of all,\r\n\r\nmay  I  spend  some time to explain why  we  provide  GFA\r\n\r\nexemptions  in certain situations.  GFA, or  gross  floor\r\n\r\narea,  is something that developers pay for.  They tender\r\n\r\nfor  it  and they bid on the basis of the specified  GFA.\r\n\r\nHaving  done  so,  they are allowed  certain  exemptions.\r\n\r\nExemptions  are  selectively granted to  satisfy  certain\r\n\r\nplanning objectives.  What are these?  For example, there\r\n\r\nmay  be a need to provide for greater design flexibility,\r\n\r\nfor  more pedestrian linkage, so there are GFA exemptions\r\n\r\nfor   covered  public  walkways.   Or  there  may  be   a\r\n\r\nrequirement to achieve more greenery within developments,\r\n\r\nand  so things like planter boxes, sky terraces, etc, are\r\n\r\ngranted GFA exemption.  But, GFA exemption should not  be\r\n\r\nfreely used as a tool to achieve every and any objective.\r\n\r\nSo,  for  example, if there is a need to  provide  social\r\n\r\nfacilities  like childcare centres, we should be  looking\r\n\r\nat  other ways of facilitating such developments,  rather\r\n\r\nthan look to GFA exemptions as the only way of doing  so.\r\n\r\nBecause  the moment you start to expand the GFA exemption\r\n\r\nlist you are, in effect, compromising the planning norms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these other incentives? Perhaps we can\r\n\r\nlook  at  tax incentives as one possibility.  But,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid in my reply three years ago, I still believe that it\r\n\r\nis  important for the market to be allowed to operate  in\r\n\r\nthis  case.   If  really there is  a  need  for,  say,  a\r\n\r\ncommercial development to have a childcare centre, or any\r\n\r\nother family-friendly facility, I believe that developers\r\n\r\nshould  seriously consider providing for such facilities,\r\n\r\nin the same way that it provides other facilities to make\r\n\r\nits development more attractive.  I believe that this  is\r\n\r\nan  attractive facility and that if there is a  childcare\r\n\r\nfacility, this would be a plus for that development.  But\r\n\r\nthis is a decision not for the Government to make, but  a\r\n\r\ndecision properly left to the developers to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issue of heavy vehicle parking by\r\n\r\nMr Wee Siew Kim.  This is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperennial  problem with developments in HDB estates,  and\r\n\r\nmany  MPs have approached my Ministry on this.   What  is\r\n\r\nthe  issue?   The issue really is whether  to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the disamenities - the disturbances,  noise  and\r\n\r\nsmoke caused to residents - or whether we put more weight\r\n\r\non  the  convenience of the heavy vehicle owners.   There\r\n\r\nare heavy vehicle parks located in HDB estates, but where\r\n\r\nthey are located directly inside HDB estates, we can  get\r\n\r\na  lot of complaints from the residents.  Five o'clock in\r\n\r\nthe  morning  the vehicles start up and they disturb  the\r\n\r\nresidents.   In  fact, recently, I have received  several\r\n\r\nrequests  from  MPs to actually re-locate  heavy  vehicle\r\n\r\nparks  outside HDB estates, and we have done so.  So,  we\r\n\r\nwill  provide  heavy vehicle parks close to HDB  estates,\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  space available, but we  have  to  also\r\n\r\nrecognise that heavy vehicles are not meant to be used as\r\n\r\na  personal transport.  They are, in fact, to be used for\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   We will try to accommodate the  demand  for\r\n\r\nsuch  parks on an interim basis, as Mr Wee suggested,  in\r\n\r\ncertain areas where land is available, where vacant  land\r\n\r\nis not required for development in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to recognise that in the longer term,\r\n\r\nall  the  heavy vehicle parks, once land is progressively\r\n\r\nused up, will have to start to move.  For this reason, we\r\n\r\nhave  provided  permanent heavy  vehicle  parks  in  many\r\n\r\npurpose  built heavy vehicle parks near workplaces,  like\r\n\r\nindustrial estates in Jurong, Kranji, Senoko, and so  on.\r\n\r\nAnd  when  we do so, the intention is to have  the  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  owners make their own transport arrangements  to\r\n\r\ntravel  between  their  home and the  designated  parking\r\n\r\nplaces of their heavy vehicle.  This is, I recognise, not\r\n\r\nthe  ideal situation.  Ideally, they would prefer to park\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles  just  next  to  their  flat  but,  as  I\r\n\r\nexplained,  this  is  not feasible and  it  is  also  not\r\n\r\nconducive  to the living environment of the estate.   Let\r\n\r\nme just add that there are sufficient parking lots island-wide  for heavy vehicles, and owners and drivers of heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles  should  not have problems  securing  a  parking\r\n\r\nspace for the vehicles in these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me address Mr Chandra Mohan's cut\r\n\r\nabout  the site of the Istana and his proposals.   As  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan pointed out, the history of the Istana is a\r\n\r\nvery  colourful and important one.  It was built in 1869.\r\n\r\nIt  has  housed many, many dignitaries, ranging from  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Colonial Governors, and all our Heads  of  State\r\n\r\nsince  self-government  and independence.   It  has  also\r\n\r\nplayed host to many important people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Istana site is zoned \"Civic and\r\n\r\nCommunity Institution\" (CNCI) in the Master Plan.  Should\r\n\r\nthe Istana grounds be better used, considering that it is\r\n\r\nsitting on prime land in the city area?  The Istana is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important part of our history.  During the Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation,  General Yamashita, who was the Commander  of\r\n\r\nthe  Imperial  Japanese Forces, resided in  it.   So  did\r\n\r\nGeneral  Tojo, who was then the Prime Minister of  Japan,\r\n\r\nwhen  he visited Singapore.  Lord Louis Mountbatten,  the\r\n\r\nBritish   Commander-in-Chief,  when  the  Allied   Forces\r\n\r\nreturned in 1945, lived in it and so did many others,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Mohan  pointed out.  If walls could speak,  it  would\r\n\r\ntell  fabulous  tales of Singapore's  past.   Within  the\r\n\r\nIstana  grounds  there  are  also  several  buildings  of\r\n\r\nsignificant  architectural and historical interests,  and\r\n\r\ntwo  of  these buildings have been gazetted  as  national\r\n\r\nmonuments in 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Istana is the official residence of the\r\n\r\nPresident.   This  is  where he receives  and  entertains\r\n\r\nState guests.  It is, therefore, a symbol of authority as\r\n\r\nthe  abode  of  the Head of State.  Due to  its  national\r\n\r\nsignificance, we should consider very seriously before we\r\n\r\nshift  it  around  or relook at its  use.   There  was  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion, in fact, made in the early 60s by Mr Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan, who was then the Minister for National Development.\r\n\r\nHe  suggested that we should free up the land for  public\r\n\r\nhousing  because,  at  that time, housing  was  in  short\r\n\r\nsupply and in great demand.  The Government rejected  the\r\n\r\nidea  because of the significance of the Istana.  Had  it\r\n\r\ndone  so,  instead  of  the Istana today,  with  all  the\r\n\r\ngrounds and all the buildings available, we would have  a\r\n\r\npublic housing estate, something like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho Swee, because at that time we were thinking  of\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should be building flats in  Bukit  Ho  Swee\r\n\r\nafter the Bukit Ho Swee fire, if Members recall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Istana should not be moved from its present\r\n\r\nlocation,  and there is no pressing need to free  up  the\r\n\r\nIstana  land, whether it is for use as a public  park  or\r\n\r\notherwise, because there is sufficient State land in  the\r\n\r\ncentral  area to meet our future development  needs.   As\r\n\r\nfar  as  park land is concerned, as I have just explained\r\n\r\nin  a previous response, we are providing more park land,\r\n\r\nmore  green  spaces for our residents to enjoy.   Indeed,\r\n\r\ncurrently,  the public can visit the Istana  grounds  and\r\n\r\neven  the  buildings  themselves.  There  are  plenty  of\r\n\r\nopportunities.   It is open five times a  year,  all  the\r\n\r\nfestivals  - Chinese New Year, Labour Day, National  Day,\r\n\r\nDeepavali, Hari Raya Puasa.  In addition, the  Istana  is\r\n\r\nused  for many important State and other large Government\r\n\r\nfunctions,  eg,  the Armed Forces, the Police,  teachers,\r\n\r\nnurses, VWOs, community leaders and workers.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\nopen  for use by members of the public and I am sure that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public have enjoyed the Istana  grounds\r\n\r\nduring  these  times.  The Istana is a  crucial  national\r\n\r\nsymbol  for Singapore, and we would preserve and maintain\r\n\r\nit for posterity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, AVA aims to provide a resilient\r\n\r\nsupply  of  safe  food to Singaporeans.  With  an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation and the vulnerability of food-borne  diseases,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to develop a more water-tight system to control\r\n\r\nthe  hygiene of food in Singapore.  Today there are  many\r\n\r\nreports  on  certain food compounds, such as  Thalidomide\r\n\r\nclaiming to cause cancer.

This\r\n\r\nfood\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  sometimes  come  from farms  which  use  pesticides,\r\n\r\ngrowth  hormones or antibiotics harmful to human  beings.\r\n\r\nBesides the control of food safety, we must also  have  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  supply of food to overcome any food  shortage\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:   What are the key policies in  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has a resilient supply of food to cope with any\r\n\r\nfood  shortage situations?  What are the anti-bio threats\r\n\r\nto  our  food  supply?  What are the  measures  taken  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our food supply? And, how can we  reduce  food\r\n\r\nprices in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to add to what Dr Teo Ho Pin has  raised.   I\r\n\r\njust  want to be sure that the AVA has adequate resources\r\n\r\nto  achieve  the desired outcome of \"safe  and  resilient\r\n\r\nsupply  of  food\",  and whether AVA will  look  for  more\r\n\r\ndiversified food sources which are competitive so that we\r\n\r\ncan have stable food prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another question is the import of genetically\r\n\r\nmodified food.  I believe we import them and so I want to\r\n\r\nmake sure that they are safe for consumption and that AVA\r\n\r\nwill check them.\r\n\r\n<br>12.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the meat that we consume in Singapore\r\n\r\ncan   be   classified   into  four  categories:   freshly\r\n\r\nslaughtered; chilled; frozen; and frozen for many  years.\r\n\r\nThey differ in price and, of course, in taste too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people want to pay a high price for the\r\n\r\nfreshly  slaughtered? Simple!  Because it  is  fresh  and\r\n\r\nhence tastes delicious. The moment you taste it, you will\r\n\r\nknow.  It has a natural taste.  Eating this type of fresh\r\n\r\nmeat is plain  enjoyment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we eat? There are people who eat in order to\r\n\r\nsurvive.  They  are also people who  eat  as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nenjoyment. To the former, it does not matter to them what\r\n\r\nthey  eat. So long as it is edible and can sustain  life,\r\n\r\nit is good enough. But, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe latter, they want to eat the best, the most delicious\r\n\r\nand  appealing food, never mind the price!  To them,  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  enjoyment in life is to have a deliciously  and\r\n\r\nwell-cooked meal at home or in a restaurant after a  hard\r\n\r\nday's  work.  For this purpose, they make sure  that  the\r\n\r\nmeat served to them is fresh and succulent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who go to Hong Kong enjoy the food\r\n\r\nthere.  This is because the Hong Kongers also  insist  on\r\n\r\nfresh  meat and vegetables. If the fish is not alive  and\r\n\r\nswimming, it will not make it to the table. Meat must  be\r\n\r\nfresh, even the chilled one may not qualify. Frozen  meat\r\n\r\nis  definitely  out. That is why the food  in  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nalways tastes better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the supply of meat in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   After the spread of Nipah virus in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nsome  years ago, one of the two abattoirs  was shut down,\r\n\r\nand  the supply of fresh meat was reduced by half.  Ducks\r\n\r\nand chickens are no longer permitted to be slaughtered in\r\n\r\nthe  wet  market. They are now being slaughtered  in  the\r\n\r\nauthorised  poultry slaughter-houses  the  night  before,\r\n\r\nand  supplied to the markets the following  morning.   We\r\n\r\nare  not as fortunate as the Hong Kongers, as far as  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of fresh meat is concerned.   There is a  Teochew\r\n\r\nsaying, \"If you do not have fish, shrimps will do.\"   So,\r\n\r\nwith no agricultural resources, we should count ourselves\r\n\r\nlucky that we have meat to eat at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that even the only abattoir in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be closed down. If that is the case, then the  best\r\n\r\nwe  can  get  will be the \"Air Pork\" which is  Australian\r\n\r\npork  air  flown from Australia to Singapore.  The  price\r\n\r\nwill certainly be higher, and it will taste as good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is also a rumour that\r\n\r\npoultry slaughter-houses will also be closed, because the\r\n\r\nimport of live chickens and ducks will soon be banned. If\r\n\r\nthat is the case, then we will not have any more good and\r\n\r\ndelicious  meat to eat in Singapore.  This  may  well  be\r\n\r\nanother  reason  for some people to want  to  migrate  to\r\n\r\nother countries.  Can the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  tell  us whether there is any  truth  in  these\r\n\r\nrumours?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we always\r\n\r\nenjoy  a good joke from Prof. Low.  I wish he could  keep\r\n\r\nhis jokes halal!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I visited an egg farm in Lim Chu Kang and\r\n\r\nalso  the  AVA  HQ  in  Jurong.   There,  I  learnt  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans consume one million eggs a day, most  of  it\r\n\r\nimported  though.  In these days of very health conscious\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   I   wonder   whether   that   is    good.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I am glad to learn that many of the sources\r\n\r\nof  egg  supply  are now run by companies with  Singapore\r\n\r\ninvestments,  although they are overseas.  Food,  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  is  of  strategic value,  and  in  these  days  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  including bio-terrorism, one  cannot  be  too\r\n\r\ncareful about our food supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also learnt that the egg farm I visited is the\r\n\r\nonly  one in Singapore.  I realise we are short of  land,\r\n\r\nbut  is one egg farm all that we can afford in Singapore?\r\n\r\nI would like the Minister to answer that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a wider issue, Sir, what is the progress of\r\n\r\nSingapore's efforts to be less dependent on food imports,\r\n\r\nand our move to be more self-sufficient in food supply?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was also very impressed by the work done by\r\n\r\nAVA,  specifically on food testing and food  control.   I\r\n\r\nsaw the growing use of technology at the AVA but also how\r\n\r\ncrammed the office space was.  Thus, I was glad to  learn\r\n\r\nthat  the  AVA  will  be moving to  its  new  and  better\r\n\r\npremises somewhere in Jurong too.  May I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  provisions  have  been made  to  meet  the  growing\r\n\r\nchallenge  of technology in meeting AVA's role, including\r\n\r\ncoping with genetically modified (GM) food?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, AVA\r\n\r\nis  responsible for the inspection of all imported  meat,\r\n\r\r\nseafood,  etc,  to ensure our food hygiene.   Last  year,\r\n\r\nthere  were  less than 1,000 cases of food  poisoning  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In  comparison, there were 10,000  cases  of\r\n\r\nfood poisoning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  New Zealand, and the number in Europe and the USA was\r\n\r\neven  higher.

They  are  very  impressive  indeed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I found that their office is too crowded.   Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  provide them with a bigger office, so that\r\n\r\nthey  have  a better working environment?  Now  that  the\r\n\r\nformer  HDB  Centre in Bukit Merah is  vacant,  can  some\r\n\r\narrangement be made to move the AVA office there?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the AVA possesses the professional skills and\r\n\r\ntechnologies  which are of  international  standards,  we\r\n\r\nshould  encourage them to make use of their expertise  to\r\n\r\nestablish a regional testing centre so as to go  regional\r\n\r\nand  even global.  At the moment,  AVA has a staff of 800\r\n\r\nand  their annual expenditure is $70 million.  Apart from\r\n\r\nthe  $20-odd  million  revenue  collected  from  services\r\n\r\nprovided,  they   still need about $40 million  to  cover\r\n\r\ntheir  activities and operational costs.  If we can allow\r\n\r\nAVA  to provide their professional services on a regional\r\n\r\nor  international basis, it would have derived revenue on\r\n\r\nits  own,  and  we  can  cut down on  dependency  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  With a steady source of income coming in, we\r\n\r\ncan avoid  retrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more of our food imports are coming\r\n\r\nfrom  China,  like  vegetables,  meat  and  canned  food.\r\n\r\nRecently,  some of our enterprises like the  pig  farmers\r\n\r\nhave gone to Qingdao, China,  to set up pig farms. At the\r\n\r\nmoment, they are having some 50,000 pigs there.  Once the\r\n\r\npigs  are slaughtered, they can be exported to Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  the businessmen do not have  confidence in the  food\r\n\r\ntesting  facilities over there, and whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nimport  will  be  approved  by the  health  authority  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If AVA can join up with the ICQ of  China  to\r\n\r\nset  up a testing centre in China, it will clear all  the\r\n\r\ndoubts  of our pig farmers there. Our entrepreneurs  will\r\n\r\nthen have more confidence to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngo  overseas to invest in pig farming, and the food price\r\n\r\nhere  can  then be lowered.

Third, can URA  allow\r\n\r\nmore flexibility to allow integrated uses of agricultural\r\n\r\nland?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second cut is on the Building and Construction\r\n\r\nAuthority  (BCA).   The BCA was formed to  spearhead  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry in Singapore.  Its mission  is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   an   advanced   and  competitive   construction\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, the construction industry still faces\r\n\r\nmany  problems and suffers from an image problem.  It  is\r\n\r\nflooded  with  problems  of  poor  quality  work,  unfair\r\n\r\nbusiness  practices, unprofessional conduct and  lack  of\r\n\r\ninnovation.  Despite all the quality schemes and  awards,\r\n\r\nwe  have  failed  to  develop  a  quality  culture  among\r\n\r\nbuilding  practitioners.  We need to restructure  BCA  to\r\n\r\nfocus  its  efforts to upgrade the construction industry.\r\n\r\nSelf-regulation  will  never  work  in  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   We  need rules and regulations to  provide  a\r\n\r\ntotal approach to improve business practices and increase\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  our  buildings.  We  need  a  top  down\r\n\r\napproach   where  authorities  would  guide   developers,\r\n\r\nconsultants and contractors to work jointly as a team  to\r\n\r\nproduce  quality  buildings for  users.   Without  strong\r\n\r\ncommitment from the Government, the construction industry\r\n\r\nwill  remain a dirty and dangerous industry.  In the last\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply, the Minister mentioned about forming\r\n\r\nan international advisory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommittee  for  the construction industry.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  update the House on the progress  of  this\r\n\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask three questions on this cut. What\r\n\r\nare the key achievements of BCA in upgrading our building\r\n\r\nindustry?  What is the output of the R&D efforts of  BCA?\r\n\r\nAre  there plans to corporatise BCA, and what are the key\r\n\r\nperformance indicators of BCA?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on CoreNet. I have three\r\n\r\nquestions   to  ask.   First,  what  is  the  status   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the CoreNet system and how much  has  been\r\n\r\nspent   on   CoreNet?    Second,   what   percentage   of\r\n\r\nconstruction   related   firms,  architects,   engineers,\r\n\r\nquantity  surveyors and contractors have adopted CoreNet?\r\n\r\nThird, has CoreNet increased the cost of business?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It will be good if Members can follow\r\n\r\nDr Teo's example.  Dr Amy Khor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I have one question, but\r\n\r\nit has got a preamble\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I acknowledge that bringing up the plight of\r\n\r\nour  local  contractors may sound like a  broken  record.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, however low the productivity of this sector,\r\n\r\nit  is  still a contributor to our GDP, with  probably  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of SMEs struggling to cope with the shrunken\r\n\r\ndemand for construction services.  On the positive  side,\r\n\r\nthe   value   of  construction  exports  by   our   local\r\n\r\ncontractors has also shown some increase in the last  two\r\n\r\nyears,  contributing to our efforts to expand our  second\r\n\r\nwing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many contractors have gone bankrupt due to the\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown.  Feedback from these  contractors  is\r\n\r\nthat  whilst many of the policies implemented by the  BCA\r\n\r\nand other relevant authorities are well intentioned, some\r\n\r\ncan be more flexible to alleviate the problems they face.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  whilst the BCA Contractors'  Registration\r\n\r\nSystem is to ensure minimum standards, there needs to  be\r\n\r\nsome  leeway given to contractors, most of whom have  had\r\n\r\nto downsize in such difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These contractors find that it is not practical to\r\n\r\nkeep a large pool of professional staff resulting in high\r\n\r\noverheads  when jobs are scarce.  But their grading  will\r\n\r\nbe  jeopardised if they were to reduce their professional\r\n\r\nstaff  strength.  Moreover, due to the scarcity  of  jobs\r\n\r\nand  the  desire by some to maintain their grading,  they\r\n\r\nengage  in  price wars with bids often below cost.   This\r\n\r\nhad  led  to the failure of many firms.  Those  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  inactive  in the last few years have  likewise  had\r\n\r\ntheir registration downgraded, with the result that  they\r\n\r\nwill  then be barred from tendering for the larger public\r\n\r\nsector  projects.  Getting downgraded also does not  help\r\n\r\nthem in their attempts to venture overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent introduction of e-bidding which allows\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  lowest bidders to bid again  every  five\r\n\r\nminutes  until  all  except one are  eliminated  is  also\r\n\r\nsqueezing their already low margins.  Undoubtedly, it  is\r\n\r\na very efficient system but brutal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new multi-skilling requirement of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  would  also, in the short term, further  squeeze\r\n\r\ntheir   already   razor-thin  margins  to   begin   with.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  contractors note that it  is  difficult  to\r\n\r\nimprove productivity in the sector as they face an uphill\r\n\r\ntask  trying  to  attract local workers to  work  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry,  whilst  foreign  workers  can  only  work   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  a fixed number of years.  To  corroborate\r\n\r\nwhat   the  Minister  for  Manpower  said  yesterday,   a\r\n\r\ncontractor told me that, recently, he advertised for  two\r\n\r\nlorry drivers.  There were many applicants but no takers,\r\n\r\nbecause all the applicants were Singaporeans and did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  work 28 days a month.  Moreover, he added  that\r\n\r\nmargins are so thin, and he would not be able to continue\r\n\r\nbusiness without hiring some foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further noted that conditions are so tough, many\r\n\r\ncontractors  now  feel  that with all  these  regulations\r\n\r\nimposed by the Government,  well-intentioned no doubt, it\r\n\r\nis  as if they are being pushed to what they say pai  tui\r\n\r\ntiou  lou, ie, queue up to commit suicide.  In fact, most\r\n\r\nrecently, the contractor for our own CC also went bust,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand we had to get another contractor to finish the work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully understand the undesirable consequences of\r\n\r\nover reliance on foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor, your one question is pretty\r\n\r\nlong!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sorry.

In sum, I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like to urge the relevant authorities  to  re-evaluate  the various policies that have been imposed  on\r\n\r\nlocal   contractors  to  see  if  their  plight  can   be\r\n\r\nalleviated.  Otherwise, our local contractors will become\r\n\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a pretty long sum! Mr Yeo Guat\r\n\r\nKwang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, one of the top five\r\n\r\ncomplaints the Consumers Association of Singapore  (CASE)\r\n\r\nreceives  is against renovation contractors.  The  claims\r\n\r\nrelate  to  defective works, unscrupulous  sales  tactics\r\n\r\nlike  not  giving a breakdown of the work to  be  carried\r\n\r\nout,  over-charging and unsatisfactory service  resulting\r\n\r\nin bad workmanship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that HDB has an approved list of\r\n\r\ncontractors.  But the list in itself does not guarantee a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard  of  service  of  HDB-approved  renovation\r\n\r\ncontractors.   I  would  like to  ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the basis for approving the list of\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contractors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How does HDB monitor the contractors on the list\r\n\r\nafter they have been approved?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the HDB consider doing more to ensure the\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  service standards of all the  renovation\r\n\r\ncontractors and enhance transparency in renovation deals,\r\n\r\nso as to protect the consumers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does the BCA play a role in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the Land Titles (Strata) Act\r\n\r\ngoverns  the  management of strata title developments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However,  many purchasers  of  strata  title\r\n\r\ndevelopments  do  not understand the  Act  and  also  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of communal living.  As a result, many  disputes\r\n\r\nhave  arisen  over the years among subsidiary proprietors\r\n\r\nconcerning  the management of strata title  developments.\r\n\r\nThis  problem is further compounded when there is a mixed\r\n\r\ndevelopment   comprising   commercial   and   residential\r\n\r\ndevelopments.  The limitations of the Act have  also  led\r\n\r\nto  a  lack  of  transparency and poor  management,  thus\r\n\r\ncausing many subsidiary proprietors to be unhappy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Will the Act be amended to cater to the needs\r\n\r\nof  different  subsidiary  proprietors  in  strata  title\r\n\r\ndevelopments?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How can we ensure good corporate governance of\r\n\r\nmanagement corporations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Are there plans to improve the professional\r\n\r\nmanagement of strata title developments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I have three questions\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister to consider when reviewing the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As long as they are short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Firstly, share value. The\r\n\r\nexisting COB's guidelines for share values have  been  in\r\n\r\nuse  for  more  than  20 years.  To overcome  the  common\r\n\r\ncomplaint of home owners that they have to bear the  same\r\n\r\namount of maintenance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncharge, even though their unit is much smaller, it  would\r\n\r\nbe   better  to  refine  the  floor  area  groupings   by\r\n\r\nincorporating  more bands than to leave the  share  value\r\n\r\nallotment  entirely to the developer.  Having  a  set  of\r\n\r\nguidelines  would  provide some level  of  certainty  and\r\n\r\ntransparency to both buyers and sellers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the role of managing agents. Unlike the\r\n\r\nmore  popular and perceived \"sexy\" professions,  say,  in\r\n\r\nthe  financial  or legal sector, there is no  legislation\r\n\r\ngoverning the minimum standards of professional  property\r\n\r\nmanagers.  While SPRING Singapore has published a set  of\r\n\r\nguidelines  on  the appointment of managing  agents,  the\r\n\r\nperformance  standards  required  of  them   still   need\r\n\r\narticulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure that management personnel\r\n\r\nemployed by the managing agents possess the proper  skill\r\n\r\nsets  and  qualifications, I would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  a system of accreditation for managing  agents.\r\n\r\nThis is to be developed with inputs from the professional\r\n\r\norganisations and practising property managers.  I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that  accreditation, in this  instance,  could  be\r\n\r\nviewed  as interventionist, because it is in the interest\r\n\r\nof the home owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the role of the Strata Titles Board. Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister to consider enlarging  the\r\n\r\nrole  of the Strata Titles Board.  Presently, the  Strata\r\n\r\nTitles  Board  is empowered to consider only  14  matters\r\n\r\nunder  its  jurisdiction.   It  is  suggested  that   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Strata Titles Board could be  widened\r\n\r\nto   deal  with  conflicts  relating  to  management  and\r\n\r\noperation, so that the parties need not resort  to  court\r\n\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, my concerns are as follows.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to strongly call for a separate management\r\n\r\ncorporation for the different and diverse unit owners  in\r\n\r\na  mixed development.  Presently, all the different types\r\n\r\nof  unit  owners  in a mixed development  belong  to  one\r\n\r\nmanagement    corporation.    For    complex    mixed-use\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   it   is  difficult  for   one   management\r\n\r\ncorporation  to accommodate the different and conflicting\r\n\r\nneeds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the different user groups.  For example, the high car\r\n\r\npark  charges  would be welcomed by the residents  as  it\r\n\r\nwould  mean more income for the maintenace of the  common\r\n\r\nproperty.   However, for the commercial units,  high  car\r\n\r\npark charges mean less customers coming in to the shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we seek to review the Land Titles (Strata) Act\r\n\r\n(LTSA), some of the issues are more fundamental, ie, they\r\n\r\narise at the time the strata is subdivided and not at the\r\n\r\ntime  of management, for example, the sharing of the  car\r\n\r\npark  between  the residential users and  the  commercial\r\n\r\nusers.   If  the  car  parks  for  the  residential   and\r\n\r\ncommercial users are clearly and physically separated  at\r\n\r\nstrata  subdivision level, ie, clearly defined,  the  car\r\n\r\npark  can  then  be  separately  managed  once  the  LTSA\r\n\r\nconsiders  multi-management corporations  for  the  mixed\r\n\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am requesting the relevant authorities, while\r\n\r\nreviewing the LTSA, to take the opportunity to review the\r\n\r\nstrata  subdivision guidelines under the URA  too.   This\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that the review of the LTSA is thorough  and\r\n\r\nresolve some management issues of the strata property  at\r\n\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the National\r\n\r\nParks  Board  manages some 287 parks and a million  trees\r\n\r\nall  over  Singapore.  The public parks  in  HDB  estates\r\n\r\nparticularly have provided the residents with a sense  of\r\n\r\nserenity and a place to relax in.  However, the Authority\r\n\r\ncan  further  improve the facilities of  these  parks  by\r\n\r\nproviding more car parks, food kiosks, public toilets and\r\n\r\nexercise corners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Adopt-a-Park\" scheme has been well supported by\r\n\r\nmany  schools in the neighbourhood.  This is a very  good\r\n\r\nconcept.  More schools and civil organisations should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to adopt the parks near their vicinity  so  as\r\n\r\nto  promote  a sense of identity with these  parks.   One\r\n\r\nother  thing that warrants our attention is the  security\r\n\r\nmeasures.  The Bukit Gombak GROs had formed a Park  Watch\r\n\r\nGroup  to further enhance the security at the Bukit Batok\r\n\r\nNature Park.  But we need money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the Ministry should initiate a \"Park Activities\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund\" for this purpose. The private sector  can\r\n\r\ndonate  towards  this fund so that we can provide  better\r\n\r\nfacilities for the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Sir, it is difficult to talk about\r\n\r\nfood at lunch time.  That is our task, I guess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, given its limited land resources, has to\r\n\r\nimport  most  of its food requirements.  It is  therefore\r\n\r\nimperative  that we ensure that our external  sources  of\r\n\r\nfood  supply  are stable and resilient.  In a  time  like\r\n\r\nthis,  I  think it is equally important that our  imports\r\n\r\nmeet  Singapore's stringent food safety  standards.   The\r\n\r\nAVA adopts a strategy of diversifying our food sources so\r\n\r\nthat  our  food  traders can quickly turn to  alternative\r\n\r\nsources  to  meet any disruption, due to  either  disease\r\n\r\noutbreak or even a terrorist act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore imports vegetables from 33\r\n\r\ncountries, meat from 25 countries, fish from 91 countries\r\n\r\nand  fruits from 40 countries.  The AVA will continue  to\r\n\r\nseek out new sources of food and by maintaining free  and\r\n\r\nopen  market  competition among these sources  will  also\r\n\r\nhelp to keep the food prices in check.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AVA organises trade missions and provides\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance to facilitate overseas ventures  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies in agriculture and food  production.\r\n\r\nSingapore investors have gone into pig farming in  China,\r\n\r\npoultry  farming  in  Malaysia, and  fish  processing  in\r\n\r\nVietnam,  Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Mr  Ang  Mong\r\n\r\nSeng  had  asked if AVA could form a private  company  to\r\n\r\nassist  local SMEs who have to set up farms overseas.   I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to inform him that the AVA actually established\r\n\r\nthe  company  in  October  2000  to  provide  consultancy\r\n\r\nservices  to companies investing overseas on measures  to\r\n\r\nassure  food  safety as well as on the use of appropriate\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure that the food we consume\r\n\r\nmeets international safety\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstandards,  the AVA has an integrated food safety  system\r\n\r\nwhich   includes   accreditation   at   source,   product\r\n\r\ninspections   and  laboratory  tests.   To  enhance   its\r\n\r\ncapabilities,  a  new  veterinary public  health  centre,\r\n\r\nlocated at the Agri-Bio Park at Lim Chu Kang, will  start\r\n\r\noperations by the middle of this year.  The AVA's testing\r\n\r\ncapabilities  will be expanded and it  will  include  the\r\n\r\ncapability to test genetically modified food.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the AVA adheres to the guidelines set up by\r\n\r\nthe National Genetic Modifications Advisory Committee for\r\n\r\nthe  safe  import,  release and use of such  products  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The new centre would also have a level  three\r\n\r\nbiological safety laboratory to handle the more hazardous\r\n\r\norganisms and toxins.  The new centre would also  address\r\n\r\nthe  concerns  of  both Mr Ang and Mr Zainul  Abidin  for\r\n\r\nbetter working conditions for the staff of AVA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is impossible to predict when and how an act\r\n\r\nof  terrorism  involving the deliberate contamination  of\r\n\r\nfood  may occur.  In the event of such an act, an  Inter-Ministry Committee, coordinated by the Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,   will  be  activated  to  handle  the  threats,\r\n\r\nincluding those involving chemical and biological agents.\r\n\r\nIf  necessary,  the AVA will play a part in  coordinating\r\n\r\nfood  recalls  to  prevent the  spread  of  such  agents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,   the  AVA  has  enhanced  its  vigilance   in\r\n\r\ninspection and testing, to look out for tampering of food\r\n\r\nproducts.   In  addition, our food industries  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen made aware of their vulnerabilities and also to take\r\n\r\nappropriate   measures   to   prevent   the    deliberate\r\n\r\ncontamination of their food products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for Singapore to be self-sufficient in food production. But having said that, we\r\n\r\nproduce  5%  of  our vegetable needs,  10%  of  our  fish\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  30%  of  our  egg  requirements.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy on farming is to  allow  farming  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as long as land is available and as long as the\r\n\r\ninvestors  find  it  commercially viable.   The  AVA  has\r\n\r\nissued  273  licences for activities such as  vegetables,\r\n\r\nfish,  egg  layers  and  cattle farming.   The  AVA  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide  assistance to farmers in the form  of  technical\r\n\r\nassistance and training in the areas of animal and  plant\r\n\r\ndisease  control  and prevention.   The  AVA  also  works\r\n\r\nclosely  with  farmers to develop and  adopt  appropriate\r\n\r\nfarming technology in order to optimise production.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land zoned as agricultural land is intended for\r\n\r\nagricultural  and  agricultural-related  uses   such   as\r\n\r\nfarming,  processing and the packing  of  farm  products.\r\n\r\nThe  current guidelines already allow for some  ancillary\r\n\r\nuses  to support the main agricultural activities in  the\r\n\r\nfarms.  For example, small visitor centres, display areas\r\n\r\nand  snack bars that are related to the main agricultural\r\n\r\nactivities   are  allowed.   We  can  consider   allowing\r\n\r\nintegrated agricultural activities provided the  intended\r\n\r\nactivity   is   compatible  with  the   farm's   existing\r\n\r\nactivities  and  will  not impact the  surrounding  farms\r\n\r\nadversely.    For   example,  orchid  cultivation   which\r\n\r\nrequires  the  use  of pesticides would  not  be  allowed\r\n\r\nwithin or near egg layers, as the poor chickens would  be\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has sought clarifications on the\r\n\r\nrumours  about abattoirs being asked to cease operations.\r\n\r\nLet me reassure him that there are no plans to close down\r\n\r\nthe pig abattoirs and the poultry slaughterhouses as they\r\n\r\ncan  cater  to  consumers like him and  many  others  who\r\n\r\nprefer  freshly  slaughtered meat.  These slaughterhouses\r\n\r\nwill continue to operate as long as they are economically\r\n\r\nviable.   It is also not true to say that there  is  only\r\n\r\none  licensed  egg layer farm in Singapore.   While  some\r\n\r\nfarms  have stopped operations recently, there are  still\r\n\r\nfive of these egg farms which today meet 30% of our local\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the cut from Mr Ang Mong Seng\r\n\r\nrelating to National Parks Board (NParks).  NParks  takes\r\n\r\ninto account the requirements of all park users.  In this\r\n\r\nrespect,  it is not just the question of maintaining  the\r\n\r\nparks  but also ensuring that other facilities,  such  as\r\n\r\ncar  parks,  toilets and security measures  that  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nmentioned,  are provided for.  In addition, we  are  also\r\n\r\ncatering  to an expanding group of park users,  including\r\n\r\nthe elderly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby   providing  things  like  hand  rails   for   sloping\r\n\r\nfootpaths, building ramps instead of steps, and providing\r\n\r\ncoverings over drains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from just physical facilities, we also have to\r\n\r\ncater  for  programmes  and activities  within  the  park\r\n\r\nitself.   NParks'  role has therefore evolved  from  just\r\n\r\nphysically  developing  and  maintaining  parks  to  also\r\n\r\nmeeting   the   social  and  lifestyle   needs   of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   While  the Government  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the basic maintenance and infrastructure  in\r\n\r\nour  parks,  efforts are also being made to increase  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement of the wider community.  An example  of  that\r\n\r\nis  the  Adopt-a-Park scheme that Mr Ang  mentioned.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that such activities and recreational programmes\r\n\r\nwill  help  to  encourage bonding and rootedness  amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Mr  Ang  would be pleased  to  know  that\r\n\r\nNParks is in the process of setting up a fund called  the\r\n\r\n\"Garden   City  Fund\"  which  will  support   more   such\r\n\r\nactivities  in  the  parks.   Specific  details  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister for National Development,\r\n\r\nI  would like to thank the MPs - Dr Teo, Dr Amy Khor,  Mr\r\n\r\nYeo Guat Kwang and Mdm Cynthia Phua - for their questions\r\n\r\nand their useful suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo asked about the key achievements of BCA.\r\n\r\nBefore  I answer this question, I think we need  to  know\r\n\r\nthe  core  missions of BCA.  There are  two:  first,  BCA\r\n\r\nensures the safety of all buildings in Singapore,  public\r\n\r\nas  well  as  private; second, BCA is a promoter  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction   industry.   Therefore,  Sir,   the   first\r\n\r\nachievement  is  that  BCA has  made  buildings  safe  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  like Parliament House is safe,  certified  by\r\n\r\nBCA.   And  BCA  has achieved this star with distinction.\r\n\r\nSir,  the second achievement of BCA is that it has worked\r\n\r\nwith  various  agencies, including MOM and the  Singapore\r\n\r\nContractors'   Association   (SCAL),   to   improve   the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the industry which, admittedly,  is  low,\r\n\r\nbut  we are trying to raise the productivity level.   And\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nefforts are documented in the Construction 21 Report.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third achievement of BCA has many limbs.\r\n\r\nThere  are at least three.  I will talk about them.   BCA\r\n\r\nhas facilitated companies to expand overseas by, firstly,\r\n\r\nactively  leading  missions overseas  and  marketing  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Inc. brand name.  I am not sure whether Dr  Teo\r\n\r\nread  yesterday's Straits Times' business page, page A19.\r\n\r\nIt  reads, \"NeoCorp breaks new ground in Fiji and India.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  according  to the Managing Director of  NeoCorp,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  he  is  able  to penetrate the  Fijian  and  Indian\r\n\r\nmarkets  against the Australian, New Zealander and  other\r\n\r\nMNCs  because,  if  I  may quote  him,  \"because  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore brand name.\"  The Singapore brand name has been\r\n\r\nnurtured by all contractors, together with BCA.  So  this\r\n\r\nis a significant achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other limb of the achievement is that BCA has\r\n\r\nencouraged  and  facilitated  consultants  and  different\r\n\r\ncompanies to form consortiums on overseas projects using,\r\n\r\nas  I  just  mentioned, the Singapore Inc. approach.   An\r\n\r\nexample  is  the very successful housing project  in  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Andra  Pradesh in India, and the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState himself led a mission some time, I think, last year\r\n\r\nto  seal  the deal.   And BCA brought together a team  of\r\n\r\ntown    planners,   engineers,   architects,   surveyors,\r\n\r\nlandscape  architects,  contractors  and  developers  and\r\n\r\ntogether they went as one team and they shared the spoils\r\n\r\namong  themselves.   So this is the second  limb  of  the\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third limb of the achievement is that BCA is a\r\n\r\ncollecting  agency of all information and it disseminates\r\n\r\nthe  information to all contractors.  In fact, BCA has  a\r\n\r\nresource  centre in Chongqing, China.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself,  for  example,  actively  sources  for\r\n\r\nprojects  overseas for the construction  industry.   Last\r\n\r\nyear, he mounted a mission to different parts of China to\r\n\r\npromote the Singapore brand name.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the progress of the international\r\n\r\nadvisory board for BCA.  We have not formed it  yet.   We\r\n\r\nare  still in the process of looking for a suitable name.\r\n\r\nIf  he  knows  of  any  suitable  name,  we  welcome  his\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the R&D efforts of BCA? Sir, there are\r\n\r\nmany.   A  few  key  ones  are BCA has  promoted  quality\r\n\r\nconstruction.  Admittedly, the quality can  be  improved,\r\n\r\nbut  BCA  has  made some headway.  BCA has developed  the\r\n\r\nCONQUAS  score.   Today, the CONQUAS score  is  a  highly\r\n\r\nsought-after score by developers.  Because  with  a  high\r\n\r\nCONQUAS  score,  developers can sell their  flats  for  a\r\n\r\nhigher price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other achievement of R&D is that BCA has\r\n\r\ndeveloped   and  facilitated  the  use  of  IT   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.   It has developed  the  CoreNet.\r\n\r\nThe  CoreNet has different layers.  It has an  electronic\r\n\r\nplan  submission  layer.   It has  information  retrieval\r\n\r\nlayer and it has got a plan checking layer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the progress of CoreNet. I am\r\n\r\npleased to report that, today, 33% of all submissions are\r\n\r\nthrough  CoreNet.  A plan checking system would be  ready\r\n\r\nby  2005.   The  first  two layers  are  completed  -  e-submission and e-information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the start-up cost to the system.\r\n\r\nIt  is  low  because  it uses existing office  automation\r\n\r\nsystem   -   PCs,  printers,  telephone  lines,  Internet\r\n\r\nservices.   For those who do not even want to  invest  in\r\n\r\nthis  small start-up cost, they can go to any of the  six\r\n\r\nagencies  -  BCA is one, FFSB, URA - to use  the  e-kiosk\r\n\r\nfree  of  charge.  There will be a staff stationed  there\r\n\r\nwho  has been trained by BCA to guide the user to  submit\r\n\r\nthe  plans  through the e-kiosk free  of  charge.   Total\r\n\r\ncommitted  cost on CoreNet so far is $13  million.   Over\r\n\r\n1,500  users  have  registered for e-submission,  another\r\n\r\n6,000 for e-information, and the usage of CoreNet is free\r\n\r\nof charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other achievement in R&D is that BCA has\r\n\r\ndeveloped a system of pre-cast and pre-fab components  in\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith  the  assistance  of  a  few  developers,  BCA   has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  that pre-cast and pre-fab  construction  is\r\n\r\npossible  on  site.   It  is not overly  expensive.   The\r\n\r\ninitial investments will pay off through long-term  gains\r\n\r\nand  you  need  not  have a big project  to  harvest  the\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale.   But of  course,  the  bigger  the\r\n\r\nproject,  the  lower the unit cost.  But even  for  small\r\n\r\ndevelopments, like landed terrace houses, pre-casting  is\r\n\r\npossible.  I brought the GPC to see a project and I think\r\n\r\nthey are quite impressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA has also facilitated research in environmental\r\n\r\nrecycling to ensure that waste materials can be  used  on\r\n\r\nconstruction   site.    BCA   has   also    raised    the\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  of  the industry by providing  a  medium\r\n\r\nbetween   the  professionals,  the  academics   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has suggested a top-down approach - Government leading, sending instructions, guiding. They\r\n\r\n(the  industry) prefer a consultation approach.  In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  are moving away from a prescriptive approach where we\r\n\r\nthink  we  know everything, or know best, to a system  of\r\n\r\nperformance-based,  where  we  will  specify  the  design\r\n\r\noutcomes  and  the  industry  decides  how  to  go  about\r\n\r\nachieving  the outcomes.  Of course, where red  tape  and\r\n\r\nbureaucracy exist, we will bulldoze them away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other R&D achievement is the development of the\r\n\r\nenergy  efficiency  index to promote energy  conservation\r\n\r\nwithin  buildings.  It has also piloted R&D with  NUS  to\r\n\r\neliminate the heat island effect that is building  up  in\r\n\r\nsome parts of Singapore because of the concentration of a\r\n\r\nlarge number of concrete buildings over a small area.  To\r\n\r\nachieve  all  these, there are tax incentives.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthem   are  the  Local  Enterprise  Technical  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme,    Innovation   Development   Scheme,    Industry\r\n\r\nProductivity  Fund,  etc.  These are  all  available  for\r\n\r\ncontractors to apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked if there are plans to corporatise BCA.\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is  a  categorical  no.   BCA  will  not  be\r\n\r\ncorporatised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked what are the performance indicators of\r\n\r\nBCA.   First, coming back to the core mission,  buildings\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   be  safe.   That  is  a  very   important\r\n\r\nperformance indicator, and there is no compromise on this\r\n\r\nindicator.  Second, MND has set BCA a productivity target\r\n\r\nof 1% to 2% over the next few years when all the policies\r\n\r\ncome  into play.  These are buildable design legislation,\r\n\r\nthe  multi-skilled workers policy comes into  play  after\r\n\r\n2005 and the man-year entitlements.  When all these three\r\n\r\nare  fully harvested in the next three years, we will ask\r\n\r\nBCA to raise the productivity to between 1% and 2%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo, Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Cynthia Phua have also\r\n\r\nraised some suggestions on the proposed amendments to the\r\n\r\nLTSA,  in  particular, their views on  how  to  encourage\r\n\r\nmixed  use development are very useful.  Because this  is\r\n\r\nan  area  where  the practitioner on the ground  and  the\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  proprietors (SPs) are very concerned.   There\r\n\r\nare  many views on how LTSA should be amended.  Different\r\n\r\nstakeholders have different perspectives, as Dr Amy  Khor\r\n\r\nalluded  to.   Even  the  same  stakeholder  may  hold  a\r\n\r\ndifferent perspective at different times.  For example, a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  proprietor may not want a  high  share  value\r\n\r\nwhen  it comes to paying maintenance.  But he may want  a\r\n\r\nhigher  share  value  to  ensure his  voting  rights  for\r\n\r\ndecisions like collective sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For share allotment, how to allot the share, who to\r\n\r\nallot  the  share, is one area we should discuss  at  the\r\n\r\ncoming forum.  BCA has had a public consultation session.\r\n\r\nNot  long ago, we have collated the views and we will put\r\n\r\nthese  views  for a focused discussion with  experts  and\r\n\r\nstakeholders  in April.  The key issues  that  are  under\r\n\r\nconsideration so far are allotment of share values -  how\r\n\r\nto  allot share values, who to allot share values, how to\r\n\r\nfacilitate mixed use developments in a single development\r\n\r\nwhere  you  have residential, commercial and,  sometimes,\r\n\r\noffice space.  Then the issue of representation of multi-unit  owners - one or two owners hold majority shares  in\r\n\r\nthe  condominium.   Also  council  members  who  are   in\r\n\r\narrears, should they be allowed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto stand for election in a management corporation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue we also want to take is how to\r\n\r\ndecriminalise some of the offences in the LTSA.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthe so-called offences are not very serious.  I think  we\r\n\r\nwant to decriminalise them.  How to ensure good corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance?   Hopefully, the new LTSA,  after  amendment,\r\n\r\nwill promote good governance.  At the end of the day, the\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  proprietors  must  take  ownership   of   the\r\n\r\nproblem.   They must know who to bring into  the  office,\r\n\r\nwho  to  vote out, what questions to ask and how to  read\r\n\r\nthe reports, basically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the three MPs are practitioners of LTSA, I would\r\n\r\nask  BCA  to  invite the three MPs to this public  forum.\r\n\r\nAll  views will be fully ventilated and I expect lots  of\r\n\r\nviews  from  these three MPs on that day.  The discussion\r\n\r\nof  this forum will form the basis for BCA's proposal for\r\n\r\nthe  LTSA  amendment.   MND has  asked  BCD  to  put  the\r\n\r\namendments  on  the fast track.  MND will move  the  LTSA\r\n\r\namendment in this House some time in the second  half  of\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, BCA is working with SPRING to\r\n\r\nreview  the  technical reference on  the  performance  of\r\n\r\nmanaging  agents with a view to upgrading it to Singapore\r\n\r\nstandard.  I am not sure if Dr Amy Khor has gone  through\r\n\r\nthe  technical  manual in her capacity  as  President  of\r\n\r\nSISV.  She has participated in it, I am sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accreditation of managing agents, I think I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  leave that at least for now, to the  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietors and the management corporation who they  want\r\n\r\nto  appoint.  There are enough qualified managing  agents\r\n\r\nin town for them to select.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor asked for a review of the Strata Titles\r\n\r\nBoard.   I am afraid that comes under the purview of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law  and I would pass  her  request  to  my\r\n\r\ncolleague there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked about the need to revise certain\r\n\r\npolicies in the construction\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindustry  at  a  time when the industry  is  quite  down.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  industry is down, not because  of  all  these\r\n\r\npolicies  -  all  these policies are meant  to  help  the\r\n\r\nindustry sail through this difficult period - the problem\r\n\r\nlies  with the low volume of construction because of  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  economic conditions.   At  the  peak  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  boom  in  1997,  the  market  was\r\n\r\ndishing out something like S$24.4 billion.  Last year, it\r\n\r\nwas   something  like  $14  billion.   It  will  probably\r\n\r\nstabilise to between $12 billion and $15 billion  in  the\r\n\r\nnext few years, probably outside $15 billion.  So because\r\n\r\nof  a shrunken market, there are just not enough jobs for\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  of  contractors around.   Therefore,  2-3\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  BCA decided, together with MOM,  on  how  to\r\n\r\nreorganise  the  industry so that  they  will  be  better\r\n\r\nprepared to meet this downturn in the first instance  and\r\n\r\nbetter capture a bigger market share in the region in the\r\n\r\nnear  term because the market here is very limited.   So,\r\n\r\ncompanies   like   Neo   Corporation   has   successfully\r\n\r\npenetrated Fiji and India.  Some companies have  gone  to\r\n\r\nChina and many of them are in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new CRS system, the registry system, actually\r\n\r\nhelps  to  pool the resources of many smaller contractors\r\n\r\ntogether  to become a big contractor.  As experience  has\r\n\r\nshown, it is companies like Neo Corporation, a fairly big\r\n\r\ncontractor,  that are able to leap beyond  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nshores  to  the region.  Small contractors are  just  not\r\n\r\npossible.  I think it is better that they have  jobs  and\r\n\r\nthey  work  as  subcontractors to good main  contractors.\r\n\r\nBecause even if you were to put a small contractor  in  a\r\n\r\nbig league, when it comes to tender, the small contractor\r\n\r\nwill  be outbidded by the main contractor anyway.  So  we\r\n\r\nactually want to nurture a few good contractors  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will be able to stay in Singapore, nurture  in  the\r\n\r\nhomeland  and  also  move overseas.  We  share  the  main\r\n\r\nconcern  with Dr Amy Khor and, that is, we want  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  industry  and  keep it alive,  and  not  to  see  it\r\n\r\ndisappear.   We also help the contractors to lower  cost,\r\n\r\nfor example.  In the past, the levy was quite high.  Some\r\n\r\nyears ago, we decided to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferentiate   skilled  and  unskilled   workers.    For\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers,  the levy was $470;  skilled  workers\r\n\r\nwent  all  the  way  down to a mere $30.   And  this  has\r\n\r\nachieved  one  desired outcome, ie, many of  the  workers\r\n\r\nhave become skilled to capture the low levy.  So, we have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  go  one step further by making  the  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  even more skilled.  We say that if  he  has  one\r\n\r\nskill,  maybe he should try for another skill and  become\r\n\r\ntwo-skilled, and we call him a multi-skilled worker.   If\r\n\r\nhe  is  unskilled, maybe he can learn something to become\r\n\r\nskilled.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to do that, we will lower the\r\n\r\nlevy  for a one-skilled worker to $320.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nfrom  next  year  onwards, all  new  foreign  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be on two levies.  Existing workers  will\r\n\r\nnot  be affected.  So, from next year, there will be  two\r\n\r\ncategories  of new workers - either he is one-skilled  or\r\n\r\ntwo-skilled.   If  he is two-skilled, we  will  call  him\r\n\r\nmulti-skilled,  the levy is $320.  If he is  one-skilled,\r\n\r\nthe  levy is $30.  So, these are ways to lower costs  for\r\n\r\nthe contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked if BCA and HDB\r\n\r\nregulate  renovation contractors.  BCA does not  regulate\r\n\r\nrenovators.   HDB  has  a  list  of  approved  renovation\r\n\r\ncontractors.  The purpose of this list is to ensure  that\r\n\r\nrenovators do not create any nuisance or do damage to HDB\r\n\r\nproperty  while working in the flats.  This is  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause unauthorised renovation can do structural  damage\r\n\r\nto  the entire block of flats, and lives and limbs are at\r\n\r\nrisk.   HDB  does not control the pricing, work  schedule\r\n\r\nand  quality of these renovators.  Such arrangements  are\r\n\r\nstrictly  private  deals  between  the  lessees  and  the\r\n\r\nrenovators, because HDB is not privy to the price nor the\r\n\r\nscope of work between the lessee and the contractor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo, are you withdrawing the\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State  and  the  Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary for their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  answers.

Yet, I notice that all the blocks at Lorong\r\n\r\n8,  Toa  Payoh,  on  average, are  older  than  the  ones\r\n\r\nselected  for  LUP by at least 10 years.   The  lifts  at\r\n\r\nLorong  8,  Toa Payoh, are about 28 years  old,  and  are\r\n\r\ndefinitely  due for replacement.  The lifts there  should\r\n\r\nhave  early  priority for the LUP,  but  they  have  been\r\n\r\nneglected  by  the MND.  According to HDB  guidelines,  a\r\n\r\nlift  is  due for replacement when it is about  25  years\r\n\r\nold.  By these guidelines, all the lifts at Lorong 8, Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh, should be upgraded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB itself has admitted in a letter to the Town\r\n\r\nCouncil that all the lifts at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, should\r\n\r\nbe  upgraded  soon.  Many blocks in the nearby  Kim  Keat\r\n\r\nneighbourhood and 10 blocks of flats, ie, Blocks  225  to\r\n\r\n234  further up the road at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh, have all\r\n\r\nbeen given their LUP, and yet the lifts at Lorong 8,  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh, in my constituency have been glaringly left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents in Potong Pasir are asking whether\r\n\r\nthe  LUP at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh shall be made an election\r\n\r\nissue  at  the next election.  Many people are  wondering\r\n\r\nwhy  Singaporeans  residing in Opposition  constituencies\r\n\r\nshould be discriminated against.  Why must they vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  candidates at the election before they  can  be\r\n\r\nentitled to the benefits\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   the  national  policies?

At 4,000, if the Potong Pasir Town  Council\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  last in the queue, it would take  something\r\n\r\nlike  333 years before it can get upgrading of the lifts,\r\n\r\nassuming that it takes one year to complete 12 blocks!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you wrap up your speech, Mr\r\n\r\nChiam?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, I will be finishing. Sir,\r\n\r\nit  would  be a waste of money if the Potong  Pasir  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil were to carry out its LUP and then, suddenly, the\r\n\r\nMND  changes its mind and wants to carry out the  LUP  at\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir.  For this reason, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to confirm whether the blocks in Lorong  8,  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh,  in the Potong Pasir constituency shall  be  given\r\n\r\nthe Lift Upgrading Programme within the next two or three\r\n\r\nyears.  Logically, it is long overdue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, I want to distinguish\r\n\r\ntwo  issues: the cyclical replacement of lifts on the one\r\n\r\nhand, and the Lift Upgrading Programme on the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12 blocks and 29 lifts that Mr Chiam brought up\r\n\r\nare   old,   and  some  of  them  are  due  for  cyclical\r\n\r\nreplacement.   As  far  as  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment is concerned, the Town Council should proceed\r\n\r\nto  replace  those  lifts  according  to  schedule.   The\r\n\r\nquestion of lift upgrading, whilst it may be related,  is\r\n\r\na separate issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address Mr Chiam's question about\r\n\r\nwhether  there will be any wastage of resources,  if  the\r\n\r\nlifts  are replaced first, and subsequently undergo  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading.   I  have checked with the HDB and  they  have\r\n\r\nassured me that all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork  done by the Town Council to replace the lifts  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  wasted, because that same lift cabin  and  shaft\r\n\r\nwill be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Lift Upgrading Programme goes far beyond\r\n\r\nsimply  replacing the lifts.  It will involve,  depending\r\n\r\non  the  configuration of the blocks, either the creation\r\n\r\nof  new lift shafts, lift landings, mechanisms, etc.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  additional cost incurred to do lift upgrading\r\n\r\nis  significantly higher than that incurred just for  the\r\n\r\nprovision of a lift replacement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, we have decided to keep these two\r\n\r\nprogrammes separate.  Lift replacement will be done on  a\r\n\r\ncyclical  basis  by  the Town Council using  its  Sinking\r\n\r\nFund,  as  that is the correct position as it should  be.\r\n\r\nThe  Lift  Upgrading  Programme is a  national  programme\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  funded by the Government, together  with\r\n\r\ncontributions  from  the Town Councils  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nresidents.   This is a national programme in which  there\r\n\r\nare  3,500 blocks in the queue.  At the current rate that\r\n\r\nwe  are doing lift upgrading, it will not take 300 years.\r\n\r\nIt  will take something like 15 years before we work  our\r\n\r\nway through the queue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be in a position to give Mr Chiam, or any\r\n\r\nother  Member for that matter, an exact position  in  the\r\n\r\nqueue  today.   We  have  announced  the  Lift  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme  recently,  and those  blocks  that  have  been\r\n\r\nannounced  will  proceed.  Every year, depending  on  the\r\n\r\nbudgetary  position of this Government, and on the  needs\r\n\r\nand  requirements of the population, we will work through\r\n\r\nthose 3,500 blocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say categorically that, as a Government,\r\n\r\nwe  have  said  that we will look after all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand  we  will  continue to look after  all  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is not possible for Mr Chiam, or  any  other\r\n\r\nMember for that matter, to insist that simply because the\r\n\r\nlift  is old, his residents must have eligibility or,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   must   receive   the  Lift  Upgrading   Programme\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, are you withdrawing your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for  his  answer  and beg  leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TJ 2100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB has liberalised its change of use policy\r\n\r\nfor its shops.  Shopowners and operators appreciate this.\r\n\r\nIt shows that the HDB understands the needs of the market\r\n\r\nand  is  prepared to let market forces  work.   But  this\r\n\r\nunderstanding is not all encompassing.  The HDB is  still\r\n\r\nhesitant  in liberalising the change of use of  shops  to\r\n\r\nfamily  restaurants and eating houses,  and  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncommon spaces for open recreation areas (ORAs).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the concerns of the HDB. But it should\r\n\r\ntrust  the  market to do its work, even with restaurants,\r\n\r\neating  houses  and ORAs.  With a good transport  system,\r\n\r\nthe  concern for a good mix of shops is no longer a must.\r\n\r\nConsider  Holland Village.  It has become a food  centre,\r\n\r\nwith  no  loss of functionality to nearby residents.   In\r\n\r\nfact, they enjoy the good food.  They hop onto buses  and\r\n\r\ntrains to buy whatever else they want from other shopping\r\n\r\ncentres.  They have the best of many worlds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shop wants to become a food establishment, they\r\n\r\ncan be made to pay an equalisation fee, as owners of food\r\n\r\nshops  have paid more for their shops.  This equalisation\r\n\r\nfee  should  not  be  refundable,  if  the  eating  house\r\n\r\nbusiness fails and the owner or operator requests  for  a\r\n\r\nchange  of use to other businesses.  The rental can  also\r\n\r\nbe  adjusted.  Owners and operators must decide  if  they\r\n\r\nare   prepared  to  pay  this  hefty  equalisation   fee,\r\n\r\nincreased rentals and the renovation cost to change it to\r\n\r\na  food  business.  If they are prepared to do so because\r\n\r\nthey  really believe that the business is there, then  so\r\n\r\nbe it.  Thereafter, let competition win, and let the best\r\n\r\nman or woman win.  Customers will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefit  from better food, more variety, better  services\r\n\r\nand prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with ORAs. ORAs, in fact,\r\n\r\nbring life to the place.  ORAs along Orchard Road and  in\r\n\r\nthe  town  areas  are welcoming sights.  Can  we  imagine\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road without the ORAs?  We should  do  the  same\r\n\r\nwith  ORAs  in  the HDB neighbourhood centres.   What  is\r\n\r\nimportant  is that they are properly managed.  Rules  can\r\n\r\nbe established and rent can be charged for the use of the\r\n\r\ncommon  areas.   We  should  apply  these  rules  to  all\r\n\r\nshophouses  which  want to use the common  areas  outside\r\n\r\ntheir  shops.  They must manage these areas.  These rules\r\n\r\nshould  be rigorously enforced to ensure that the use  of\r\n\r\nthe common areas does not turn them into eyesores and  an\r\n\r\nobstruction  to  pedestrians.  If they flout  the  rules,\r\n\r\nthen penalties can be imposed to bring them in line.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, can you start asking your\r\n\r\nquestions, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, we are trying to build a\r\n\r\ncreative   entrepreneurial  society,   one   that   makes\r\n\r\ndecisions  for  itself and takes responsibility  for  the\r\n\r\noutcome.

If there are no measures that can be  taken,\r\n\r\nwould  HDB, being the biggest landowner, carry  out  some\r\n\r\nintensive research into this problem?\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in 1997, the\r\n\r\nHougang  Town Council wrote to the HDB, alerting them  to\r\n\r\nthe  condition  of  a lamp-post which we  discovered  was\r\n\r\ncorroded  and  could  pose a danger  to  the  public  and\r\n\r\nrecommending  to  the HDB to carry out major  replacement\r\n\r\nworks.  HDB refused to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, we wrote again to the HDB, making the same\r\n\r\nrecommendation, and HDB again turned it down.   It  asked\r\n\r\nthe   Town  Council  to  continue  carrying  out  routine\r\n\r\nmaintenance  works  to  replace lamp-posts  whenever  the\r\n\r\ncondition warrants it.  HDB also informed us that it  has\r\n\r\nno  cyclical maintenance programme for the replacement of\r\n\r\ncar park lamp-posts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these lamp-posts have been installed more than\r\n\r\n15  years ago.  Their condition has deteriorated and  the\r\n\r\nHDB  has no plans to replace the lamp-posts.  Is  it  the\r\n\r\nintention of the HDB to push the responsibility  to  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  to  replace all the lamp-posts eventually  when\r\n\r\nthey  are all corroded?  Is this fair?  First of all,  it\r\n\r\nwill  place a heavy burden on the financial resources  of\r\n\r\nHougang  Town  Council.   I  do  not  know  of  PAP  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils, maybe they are richer and can afford to do  so.\r\n\r\nSecondly, is it fair to ask the Town Council to do so  by\r\n\r\nusing  money  contributed  by the  residents  by  way  of\r\n\r\nconservancy charges?  Do not forget, the HDB owns the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncar  park,  collects  the parking fees  and  pockets  the\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past years, in the interest of the residents,\r\n\r\nHougang Town Council had no choice but to replace quite a\r\n\r\nnumber  of lamp-posts with corroded base to ensure public\r\n\r\nsafety  was  not compromised. However, Sir, the  question\r\n\r\nreally  is:   to  what  extent would  routine  inspection\r\n\r\nensure  100% safety without cyclical replacement  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting lamp-posts?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hougang Town Council recently conducted a\r\n\r\nsampling size of 10 lamp-posts to ascertain their general\r\n\r\ncondition by digging out the lamp-posts and exposing  the\r\n\r\nlamp-posts'  bases buried underground. The result  showed\r\n\r\nthat all the 10 dug-out lamp-posts have different degrees\r\n\r\nof  corrosion around their bases. Although the structural\r\n\r\nintegrity  of all the 10 dug-out lamp-posts has  not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  compromised,  the  question  is:  when  would   the\r\n\r\ncorrosion  set in to the extent that it would  compromise\r\n\r\npublic safety without cyclical replacement? Does the  HDB\r\n\r\nexpect  Town  Councils to dig out all the  lamp-posts  to\r\n\r\nexpose their bases for inspection and then cover them  up\r\n\r\nagain  every week or every month to ensure that there  is\r\n\r\nno  falling lamp-post that will cause a tragedy?  I would\r\n\r\nlike to know what is the HDB's response to the above.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is said that the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not treat all Singaporeans alike.  Those\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who reside in Opposition wards  do  not  get\r\n\r\nthe benefits of the national policies as of right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, residents in Potong Pasir Constituency\r\n\r\ncould get upgrading of their flats only if they voted for\r\n\r\nthe  PAP candidate, although some of the flats at  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  were  definitely due for upgrading.   These  flats\r\n\r\nwere  about  23 years old at the time of the election  in\r\n\r\n1997.   However, the flats of many PAP wards  which  were\r\n\r\nmuch younger than that benefited from upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the election of 2001, the same tactics were used\r\n\r\nby the ruling Party.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresidents at Potong Pasir were told that if they did  not\r\n\r\nsupport the PAP candidate, the North East MRT line  might\r\n\r\nnot  run  through the Potong Pasir Constituency. When  it\r\n\r\nbecame  clear  that  the North-east MRT  line  would  run\r\n\r\nthrough  Potong Pasir, it was made known by the PAP  that\r\n\r\nif   residents  in  Potong  Pasir  did  not  support  its\r\n\r\ncandidate at the General Election of 2001, the station at\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir would not be opened.  It shall only remain a\r\n\r\n\"box\" and trains shall not stop at that station but  only\r\n\r\nrun  through it. The name of that station would  also  be\r\n\r\ncalled  Sennett  MRT  station and not  Potong  Pasir  MRT\r\n\r\nstation as many have expected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, during the heat of the election, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself came to visit Potong Pasir and  made  a\r\n\r\npromise  that  the  majority of the residents  at  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  need not vote for the PAP candidate in  order  for\r\n\r\nthem to get upgrading.  Any one of the five precincts  in\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir  need only to give the PAP  candidate  more\r\n\r\nthan   50%  and  that  precinct  would  be  entitled   to\r\n\r\nupgrading.  The  private estate, ie, the Sennett  Estate,\r\n\r\nwould   not   normally  be  entitled  to  the  Government\r\n\r\nupgrading.  But if they voted for the PAP candidate, they\r\n\r\nwould  have  got the upgrading.   As it turned  out,  the\r\n\r\nresidents there gave the PAP candidate about 51%  of  the\r\n\r\nvotes.  Thus,  the  Sennett Estate  was  entitled  to  be\r\n\r\nupgraded by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that one precinct at Potong Pasir has given its\r\n\r\nmajority  votes to the PAP candidate, it is  left  to  be\r\n\r\nseen  whether  the  Government shall  keep  its  promise.\r\n\r\nInitially,    the   Minister   tried   to    shirk    his\r\n\r\nresponsibility, but now the Prime Minister confirmed that\r\n\r\nSennett  Estate is one of the private estates that  shall\r\n\r\nbe  included in the upgrading.  I would like to know from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister when would the upgrading at Sennett  Estate\r\n\r\nbegin.   And  I  would  ask that the upgrading  programme\r\n\r\nincludes the alleviation of floods there, the enlargement\r\n\r\nof  the roads and repairs of the drains to make sure that\r\n\r\nwater  do  not stagnate in them but can flow freely,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the erection of railings to make the monsoon drains\r\n\r\nsafer.

As far as\r\n\r\nshopkeepers are concerned, the HDB does allow shopkeepers\r\n\r\nto  change the use of their shops, except in cases  where\r\n\r\nthe  conversion is likely to cause disamenity   to  their\r\n\r\nneighbours and to other HDB residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has allowed shops to be converted into\r\n\r\nfamily  restaurants.  I  want to  emphasise  that  family\r\n\r\nrestaurants are different from eating houses. In the case\r\n\r\nof a restaurant, it is managed by a single operator, with\r\n\r\na  single  kitchen.  However, the HDB does not allow  the\r\n\r\nchange  of use of shophouses into eating houses.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot a price issue. Eating houses are large, purpose-built\r\n\r\npremises  where  the  operators will usually  sublet  the\r\n\r\ninternal  spaces  to individual stallholders,  and  where\r\n\r\ntransit  bins  and  high  electrical  loads  have  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided,  in  order  to ensure the smooth  operation  of\r\n\r\nthese  premises.   As  the retail  shops  are  very  much\r\n\r\nsmaller in size, the conversion of such shops into eating\r\n\r\nhouses  is  very  likely  to cause  disamenity  to  their\r\n\r\nneighbours because of heat, noise and smell nuisance  and\r\n\r\nbecause  the premises were not designed for such uses  in\r\n\r\nthe first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB does allow Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORAs) for\r\n\r\neating  houses. The size of an ORA would  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nlocation  of  the  premises and whether  it  would  cause\r\n\r\nobstruction  along the walkways, and, in  particular,  on\r\n\r\nthe  volume of human traffic along those walkways. As far\r\n\r\nas  family  restaurants are concerned, HDB will  have  to\r\n\r\nevaluate  such  requests on a case-by-case  basis.   But,\r\n\r\nobviously,   because  of  the  smaller  scale   of   such\r\n\r\nbusinesses, it would be inappropriate for a large outdoor\r\n\r\nrefreshment area to be provided for such premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the next question by Mdm Cynthia\r\n\r\nPhua  on spalling concrete.  I think Members would recall\r\n\r\nthat there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas a long debate on this issue last year.  She has asked\r\n\r\nwhether  this is a natural deterioration process after  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 3-5 years and what are the measures which  can\r\n\r\nbe  taken to prevent this from happening.  Let me  handle\r\n\r\nthe latter question first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spalling concrete is a natural process which could\r\n\r\npotentially occur in all concrete buildings.  It  is  due\r\n\r\nto deterioration, due to a process called carbonation, in\r\n\r\nwhich  corrosion  of steel bars within the  slab  occurs,\r\n\r\nfollowed  by expansion and then cracking and falling  off\r\n\r\nof  concrete.   To reduce or minimise the  occurrence  of\r\n\r\nspalling  concrete, flat lessees are advised to seal  any\r\n\r\ncracks or holes in their flats immediately, as well as to\r\n\r\nhave  their  flats painted regularly.   A  few  coats  of\r\n\r\nquality  paint  will also help slow down the  carbonation\r\n\r\nprocess by minimising the ingress of oxygen, moisture and\r\n\r\ncarbon   dioxide  into  the  concrete.  Without   oxygen,\r\n\r\nmoisture  and  carbon  dioxide, the  steel  bars  in  the\r\n\r\nconcrete will not corrode.  In addition, flat lessees are\r\n\r\nalso  advised to keep the level of humidity  low  in  wet\r\n\r\nareas  such as kitchens, toilets and bathrooms by keeping\r\n\r\nthe doors, windows and vents open wherever possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lease, HDB flat owners are responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  repair  of spalling concrete within the flats.   HDB\r\n\r\nflat owners who encounter spalling concrete problems  can\r\n\r\nreport  to  the HDB branch offices which can  assist  the\r\n\r\nflat  owners to investigate the cause of the problem  and\r\n\r\nrecommend  appropriate remedial action.  For flat  owners\r\n\r\nwho  have  difficulties  in  finding  a  suitable  repair\r\n\r\ncontractor on their own, HDB will also assist to  provide\r\n\r\nthem with a list of repair contractors with whom they can\r\n\r\nnegotiate the price on a private basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I turn to the first question, which is, what is\r\n\r\nthe cause.  I think the real question there really is who\r\n\r\nis  responsible.  I suspect that is what  she  is  really\r\n\r\nafter.  I will not do anything here except to quote  what\r\n\r\nmy  Minister  said previously on spalling  concrete.   He\r\n\r\nmentioned two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissues.  The first issue is on the cause of the  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete. If the cause of the spalling concrete is due to\r\n\r\nthe design, as some Members suspected, or alleged, and if\r\n\r\nthat  can be proven to be so, then obviously it is  HDB's\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to fix it, either in  the  flat  that  is\r\n\r\ncurrently affected or in future designs.  But if it is  a\r\n\r\nmatter   of   natural  wear  and  tear  and   a   natural\r\n\r\ndeterioration process which occur to all buildings,  then\r\n\r\nobviously  the  responsibility must  lie  with  the  flat\r\n\r\nowners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I move on to car parks and, in particular,\r\n\r\ncorroded lamp-posts.  I listened with great anxiety  when\r\n\r\nI  heard Mr Low say that he had noted corroded lamp-posts\r\n\r\nas  far back as 1997, and subsequently in the year  2000,\r\n\r\nin car parks maintained by Hougang Town Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if Mr Low is aware, but his Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  has signed a maintenance agreement with the  HDB\r\n\r\nto  maintain the car parks, and HDB pays his Town Council\r\n\r\na  monthly  amount,  I think, in excess  of  $22,000,  to\r\n\r\nperform  the maintenance of car parks.  In this contract,\r\n\r\nan  agreement, which I have a copy of, Schedule  A  lists\r\n\r\nthe  things  which are supposed to be done  by  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil.   It is stated very clearly, around  here,  \"the\r\n\r\nrepair   and   replacement  and  painting  of  lamp-post,\r\n\r\nincluding faded lamp-post numbers and luminaries.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if any corroded lamp-post in a car park\r\n\r\nmaintained  by  the  Hougang Town Council  leads  to  any\r\n\r\nproblems  or  loss  of lives and limbs or  property,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility and liability will be entirely that of the\r\n\r\nTown  Council.  I would strongly suggest that Mr  Low  go\r\n\r\nimmediately  to rectify all those faults.   If  his  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil feels that it is not able to maintain car  parks,\r\n\r\nthen,  please  do not enter into an agreement  with  HDB.\r\n\r\nThe  contract  will  expire at  the  end  of  this  year.\r\n\r\nConsider, perhaps, excusing himself and handing over  the\r\n\r\njob  to someone else who can do the job more properly and\r\n\r\ncompetently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if his question was who is responsible, my\r\n\r\nanswer  to  him, unequivocally, is that it  is  his  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil  which is responsible.  And I think in the  light\r\n\r\nof recent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nevents,  his Town Council, and indeed all Town  Councils,\r\n\r\nbetter  make sure that they address this problem speedily\r\n\r\nand comprehensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to Mr Chiam's point. I was not sure, at\r\n\r\nthe  end of his speech, what the real question was.   The\r\n\r\nestate upgrading programme in Sennett Estate was approved\r\n\r\nby the Ministry of National Development in response to  a\r\n\r\nrequest put up by the Citizens' Consultative Committee of\r\n\r\nPotong   Pasir  and,  in  particular,  the  neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Sennett  Estate  itself.    This  is  also\r\n\r\nentirely  consistent with the promise made by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister before the election. The working committee right\r\n\r\nnow is working on the details of the upgrading programme.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as  the  Ministry  of  National  Development  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the faster they complete the planning and  the\r\n\r\nexecution of this upgrading, the better.  We have already\r\n\r\nset  aside  funds.   With  the  cooperation  of  all  the\r\n\r\nrelevant Government agencies to embark on this upgrading,\r\n\r\nthe  residents of Sennett Estate can look forward  to  an\r\n\r\nenhanced   living  environment.   The  key  thing   here,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is  to  make sure that as many people  who  are\r\n\r\nliving in Sennett Estate as possible get involved in this\r\n\r\nprocess   of   deciding   what   necessary   or   desired\r\n\r\nimprovements should be made, and then get it executed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Low.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarifications, Sir. My\r\n\r\nquestion  was:  why is there no cyclical  maintenance  or\r\n\r\nreplacement of the lamp-posts?  Secondly, Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe way the lamp-posts are constructed and installed,  is\r\n\r\nthere  not a potential problem or a likelihood of falling\r\n\r\nlamp-posts,   because  of  the  difficulty   in   routine\r\n\r\ninspection?  Does he agree that actually, it is safer for\r\n\r\nHDB to replace the lamp-posts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I thought the answer has been given\r\n\r\nquite fully, but, anyway, Dr Balakrishnan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> If the lamp-posts need to\r\n\r\nbe  replaced, they should be replaced.

By setting our\r\n\r\npublic  hospitals into two clusters, it  has  been  noted\r\n\r\nthat each cluster has taken more efforts to publicise and\r\n\r\nwoo  as  many referrals and patients to their  respective\r\n\r\nclusters.  In other words, they are trying to outdo  each\r\n\r\nother.   Is  this not creating unhealthy demands  on  our\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system?   Sir, as consumers  cannot  exercise\r\n\r\ntheir  sovereignty  in purchasing the appropriate  amount\r\n\r\nand  level  of  medical  care in  most  cases,  they  are\r\n\r\ninvariably dependent on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe expert judgement of the providers.  Are our hospitals\r\n\r\nand doctors incentivised to effect higher demands for our\r\n\r\nhealthcare services?  Should our healthcare providers not\r\n\r\nbe  subjected to the ethical codes of conduct and to  the\r\n\r\naudit  of  an  effective watchdog body with a  system  of\r\n\r\nchecks and balances?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to the economic downturn, C class hospital\r\n\r\nwards  are  in  great  demand as  patients  opt  for  the\r\n\r\ncheapest  beds  to  save  medical  cost.   Of  late,  our\r\n\r\nhospitals  have  frequently  run  out  of  these   highly\r\n\r\nsubsidised   beds  and  have  been  temporarily   putting\r\n\r\npatients  up in a higher class ward while waiting  for  C\r\n\r\nclass  beds  to become available.  Thus, may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health whether there should be  a  further\r\n\r\nrevision  upwards on the availability of  C  class  beds,\r\n\r\nwhich  should form 18% of all hospital beds provided,  by\r\n\r\nthe year 2010, according to the White Paper on Affordable\r\n\r\nHealthcare?   Have we achieved the 18%  target  yet?   In\r\n\r\nview  of  the  higher  demand  for  C  class  wards,  are\r\n\r\nhospitals deploying more personnel, nurses and doctors to\r\n\r\ncope  with  this  increased demand?   Are  doctors  under\r\n\r\npressure  to  discharge patients earlier to make  more  C\r\n\r\nclass   beds  available?   Are  patients  sent  home   or\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the community hospitals prematurely?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  a  system in place to monitor and  check  on  this\r\n\r\npossible  unfavourable outcome, because C class wards  in\r\n\r\nhospitals are bursting at the seams?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Ministry of Health on another\r\n\r\nissue, and that is, what are the extra cautions that have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  by our hospitals with regard to  the  latest\r\n\r\nhighly  contagious  atypical pneumonia,  which  had  been\r\n\r\ngiven  a  new  name of Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome\r\n\r\n(SARS)?   It has been reported that some of our  hospital\r\n\r\nproviders  who  looked after the patients with  SARS  had\r\n\r\nbeen  infected.   May I ask how many  of  our  healthcare\r\n\r\nproviders were affected?  Is there special care given  to\r\n\r\nthose  hospital  providers exposed to the infection,  but\r\n\r\nhave not shown any symptoms?  Is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  taking  extra  emergency  steps  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the spread of SARS, especially in our hospitals,\r\n\r\nand  safeguard  our doctors, nurses and  other  patients?\r\n\r\nWhat has the Ministry done to better inform the public of\r\n\r\nSARS?   Is  there any collaboration with other Ministries\r\n\r\nto  better  contain the spread of the  disease?   Is  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health taking extra effort to identify  the\r\n\r\ncausative agent of SARS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas   informed   this   House   that   the   Government's\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals would be run on a  not-for-profit\r\n\r\nbasis.   This has indeed provided assurance to the public\r\n\r\nat  large  that  there  will  not  be  the  typical  pre-occupation with making profits that a commercial  concern\r\n\r\nwould   have,   which   can   otherwise   undermine   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   intent   to   make   healthcare   services\r\n\r\naffordable  to  all.  Sir, some lingering concerns  still\r\n\r\nexist,  for which I seek the Minister's response.   These\r\n\r\nrevolve  around, firstly, the motivation for cost control\r\n\r\nin  order  to ensure overall affordability; and secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  alignment of interests of medical practitioners with\r\n\r\nthe hospitals and, ultimately, with the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within the not-for-profit framework, how do\r\n\r\nhospitals  control costs, both recurrent in the provision\r\n\r\nof  healthcare and in the maintenance of facilities which\r\n\r\nare,  to  a  large extent, overheads?  I  realise  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  predict patient demands.  But  how  do  we\r\n\r\nguard  against  the over-supply of beds  in  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals?  Over-capacity attracts some maintenance cost,\r\n\r\neven  if  sections  are  closed.   If  nothing  else,  it\r\n\r\nreflects an opportunity cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to echo Dr Lily Neo's sentiments\r\n\r\non the state of the healthcare delivery system today.  We\r\n\r\nnow  have  two clusters, SingHealth and National  Health,\r\n\r\nwith  the  respective  complements  of  specialities  and\r\n\r\nfacilities.   How  much  oversight  is  there,   at   the\r\n\r\nstrategic planning level, to ensure that there  will  not\r\n\r\nbe  unnecessary  duplication of capabilities,  or,  worse\r\n\r\nstill, no spiralling up of manpower cost from the limited\r\n\r\ntalent pool?  Furthermore, how do hospitals within\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neach   cluster   operate   within   this   not-for-profit\r\n\r\nframework?   How  much  latitude do  they  have  in  cost\r\n\r\ncontrol measures?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as restructured hospitals attend to both\r\n\r\nsubsidised  and  private  patients,  there  is  always  a\r\n\r\nnagging  suspicion  that it is run  on  a  not-for-profit\r\n\r\nbasis  for  the  subsidised patients, but  on  a  totally\r\n\r\ncommercial one for private patients.  Some even  conclude\r\n\r\nthat  medical practitioners are remunerated according  to\r\n\r\nhow  much revenue they can bring in;  in other words, how\r\n\r\nmany  private patients they see.  In short, many wondered\r\n\r\nif  there  is a disincentive to treat subsidised patients\r\n\r\nproperly.  I am not advocating that the same basis should\r\n\r\nbe  applied  to  both, but it would  be  useful  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to explain how doctors are remunerated  at  the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, one can argue that the best test of what is\r\n\r\nthe   right   level  of  subsidy  and  what   constitutes\r\n\r\naffordable  healthcare might be to extend the  subvention\r\n\r\nto  the  private hospitals.  Generally, private hospitals\r\n\r\ncontemplate capital expenditure carefully.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the luxury of building ahead of demand and can thus\r\n\r\nprovide   a   useful   benchmark  for  the   restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.   I  would  be interested  in  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Arthur Fong is not present. Dr\r\n\r\nChong Weng Chiew.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, let me\r\n\r\nfirst  declare  my  interest as the CEO  of  Ang  Mo  Kio\r\n\r\nCommunity Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Minister consider allowing\r\n\r\nMedisave  to  be used to pay for domiciliary medical  and\r\n\r\nnursing  services, otherwise known as home care services.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  had raised this issue earlier in Parliament  too\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister had turned down the request.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  appeal to MOH to relook into this matter  again\r\n\r\nbased on the following reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is becoming an ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  and  rising healthcare cost  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nconcerns of an ageing population.  Home care is known  to\r\n\r\nbe one of the ways of curbing rising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost as it would be the alternate  route  for\r\n\r\nquite  a  number of patients to hospitalisation, provided\r\n\r\nthat the illness is one that could be treated at home  by\r\n\r\na  visiting  doctor  and  not requiring  hospitalisation.\r\n\r\nAlso,  home  care is one that could allow the doctors  in\r\n\r\nacute hospitals to send certain patients home earlier  as\r\n\r\nthe doctors and nurses of the home care team could attend\r\n\r\nand  monitor these patients at their homes.  Thus, as you\r\n\r\ncan  see it, the home care element not only enhances  the\r\n\r\nconvenience  and  comfort  of  the  patients  and   their\r\n\r\nfamilies, it also helps cut down the number and length of\r\n\r\nhospitalisations of many patients - all these  equate  to\r\n\r\nbringing down healthcare cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Minister has cited that Medisave is\r\n\r\none  that prepares us when we get old, to be used  during\r\n\r\nin-patient hospitalisation.  I agree with him.   However,\r\n\r\nwith the changing trend in medical treatment, should  MOH\r\n\r\nnot be moving along with time too to allow Medisave to be\r\n\r\nused in home care?  As pointed out by myself earlier  on,\r\n\r\nhome  care  would  cut down on health  expenditure,  with\r\n\r\nfewer  numbers of hospitalisation and also the length  of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation.   Thus,  if  a  patient  could  not  use\r\n\r\nMedisave  for home care, what is the point  of  having  a\r\n\r\nlarge  amount in his Medisave and he could not use it  on\r\n\r\nwhat  is  useful to him?  I was previously  a  practicing\r\n\r\nmedical doctor in a VWO providing home care services.   I\r\n\r\ncan  tell  the  House that one of the main problems  that\r\n\r\nacute   hospitals  and  home  care  providers   face   in\r\n\r\nencouraging  patients  to  take  up  home  care  is   the\r\n\r\ninability of the patients to fork out cash for  the  home\r\n\r\ncare services, despite the fact that they have sufficient\r\n\r\nMedisave.  If MOH thinks that home care is the way to  go\r\n\r\nfor an ageing population, which I believe so, and MOH has\r\n\r\nfunded operators of home care services, then it must also\r\n\r\npave  the  way  by  allowing Medisave to  be  used.   For\r\n\r\notherwise,  those patients who could actually be  treated\r\n\r\nat  home would still opt for the more expensive treatment\r\n\r\nin  hospital, just simply because they could use Medisave\r\n\r\nin  hospitals  and  not  home care.   Thus,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to review my suggestion; otherwise we would end\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup  with a service that we know is good, but could not be\r\n\r\nused.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Today, 90% of the working\r\n\r\npopulation  is  covered under MediShield or  one  of  the\r\n\r\nMedisave-approved  insurance schemes.   The  majority  is\r\n\r\ncovered  under MediShield.  Over the last few years,  MOH\r\n\r\nhas improved the benefits and features of MediShield.  It\r\n\r\nis  important  that the Government continues  to  enhance\r\n\r\nMediShield  to  make it relevant and  responsive.   In  a\r\n\r\nlimited  way,  Sir, MediShield provides portable  medical\r\n\r\ncoverage  for Singaporeans as long as premiums are  paid,\r\n\r\nregardless of employment status.  However, the system  is\r\n\r\nnot  without  weaknesses.  First, it  principally  covers\r\n\r\nonly catastrophic illnesses and does not cover general in-patient,    day   surgery   and   specialist   outpatient\r\n\r\ntreatments.   Now that the ERC has formally endorsed  the\r\n\r\nportable  medical  benefit scheme, I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  review  or revamp  MediShield  in  that\r\n\r\ndirection.  This can be done by widening the coverage and\r\n\r\nclaim  limit.   If  need be, the premium  for  MediShield\r\n\r\nshould also be reviewed to facilitate such a move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I am also concerned that more than a quarter\r\n\r\nmillion  of  Singaporeans have opted out  of  MediShield.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the Government doing to encourage them  to  opt\r\n\r\nback  to  the  MediShield scheme?   Will  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider making MediShield a compulsory national  medical\r\n\r\ninsurance scheme so that no Singaporean is left out?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on the issue of premiums. We know that the\r\n\r\nolder  we  get, the MediShield premiums we  pay  will  be\r\n\r\nhigher.  This is not just for MediShield but also for all\r\n\r\nkinds  of medical insurances.  In fact, the premiums  are\r\n\r\nhigher  when  a worker retires than when  he  is  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   But the older he gets, it is  most  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  he  will  be  able to pay for  the  high  expensive\r\n\r\npremiums.   I suggest the Government consider introducing\r\n\r\nthe  \"pre-funding\"  element to  MediShield   -   let  the\r\n\r\nworker pay higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npremium  when  he  is working, so that  by  the  time  he\r\n\r\nretires,  he would already have \"pre-funded\"  his  future\r\n\r\npremiums and to continue receiving insurance coverage.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo, since Dr Warren Lee is not\r\n\r\nhere, you can go on to your next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, my next cut is on\r\n\r\nhealthcare  insurance scheme.  Why is the Government  not\r\n\r\nconsidering  expanding  the scope  of  Medisave  approved\r\n\r\nmedical insurance schemes?  Medisave should be allowed to\r\n\r\nbe  used  to  pay  for the premiums of all  portable  and\r\n\r\ntransferable medical insurance schemes.  In fact, I would\r\n\r\ntake  the  argument  a step further.  Since  Medisave  is\r\n\r\nalready  compulsory,  then it should  be  compulsory  for\r\n\r\nMediShield  to  be  a  national basic  medical  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme  for  all.  It will also be universal and  no  one\r\n\r\nwould  be  left out, as I have mentioned just now.   More\r\n\r\nso, there will be a great pooling of risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I understand that there are weaknesses in an\r\n\r\ninsurance-based medical coverage system.  It may lead  to\r\n\r\nthe  buffet syndrome, as we all worry about.   But  since\r\n\r\nthey  have  already paid for the premium, they  would  do\r\n\r\nwhatever they like, and get as much as they could.   This\r\n\r\nis   why  I  will  prescribe  two  key  features  in  the\r\n\r\ncompulsory national Medisave insurance scheme, and we can\r\n\r\nbe sure that it would not be made a buffet for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it must only cover the basic medical needs.\r\n\r\nFor those who prefer to have wider coverage, they can use\r\n\r\ncash  or other options. Medisave should be used only  for\r\n\r\nthe basic tier of the coverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there should be an appropriate level of co-payment to encourage personal responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if the system is properly constructed and\r\n\r\napplied,  it  can lead to universal coverage and  greater\r\n\r\npersonal   responsibility.   Introducing   a   compulsory\r\n\r\nnational  Medisave-approved  insurance  scheme  providing\r\n\r\nbasic medical coverage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill be a significant step to greater portability in  our\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system.  This will significantly enhance  the\r\n\r\nwell-being  and  provide for the  medical  needs  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on Medisave, even as the Government considers\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave-approved insurance schemes, it should  also\r\n\r\nconstantly  review the criteria for the use of  Medisave.\r\n\r\nThe  criteria  should be responsive  and  appropriate  to\r\n\r\ntoday's   needs.    Currently,  the  use   of   Medisave,\r\n\r\nparticularly  for  inpatients, is largely  based  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  hospital days.  However, with the  increasing\r\n\r\npopularity  of  day  surgery,  this  criterion  will   be\r\n\r\noutdated and irrelevant.  The bottom line is that the use\r\n\r\nof  Medisave should be based on medical condition  rather\r\n\r\nthan  hospital  stay.   I  hope  that  the  Ministry  can\r\n\r\nconsider all my suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, over the past week,\r\n\r\nMOH  has been rather busy with its media blitz to  inform\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  about  affordable  healthcare.    We   have\r\n\r\nMedisave, MediShield and Medifund to provide that  cover.\r\n\r\nThe radio advertisement spoke about the importance of the\r\n\r\nabove  three schemes to make healthcare affordable.    It\r\n\r\nsaid  that  99%  of appeals for Medifund  were  approved.\r\n\r\nThat  is reassuring indeed.  May I ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nis  the  experience with Medisave and MediShield, whether\r\n\r\nthey  both  are meeting the needs of average Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes  to  meeting hospital  bills?   How  have\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  coped  with the total  hospital  bill  when\r\n\r\nMedisave  and MediShield can only cover partial  cost  of\r\n\r\nthe   hospital   bill  and  also  for   selected   health\r\n\r\nsituations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about outpatient charges? From feedback, it is\r\n\r\nnot cheap.  My own personal experience is that when I got\r\n\r\nmy finger caught in the door, it cost more than $100 just\r\n\r\nfor treatment and to visit the specialist.  What more can\r\n\r\nMOH  do  to  moderate charges at outpatient clinics,  and\r\n\r\nthus make healthcare more affordable?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, very\r\n\r\noften, during the meet-the-people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsessions,  senior citizens come forward complaining  that\r\n\r\nmedical  costs  are  too  much for  them  to  bear,  even\r\n\r\nchoosing to die earlier  if the choice were theirs.  Such\r\n\r\nis  the  state  of  affairs on the ground.   It  is  thus\r\n\r\nheartening  to know that the Ministry of Health  will  be\r\n\r\nrevising   Medisave  withdrawal  limits  based   on   the\r\n\r\nresources needed, and not hospitalisation days to treat a\r\n\r\nmedical  condition.   However,  I  am  not  referring  to\r\n\r\nsurgeries  or hospital days, but outpatient treatment  or\r\n\r\nlong-term  prescribed medication that can  be  expensive.\r\n\r\nDoes  a person need to be hospitalised to be able to draw\r\n\r\nfrom his Medisave and MediShield?  The question here  is:\r\n\r\nare we too restrictive?  Can more be done in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to step back for a minute and look at the\r\n\r\nmacro  picture that I am about to paint.  We worry  about\r\n\r\nsurging ahead in the age of globalisation with its  rapid\r\n\r\ntechnological  and economic change, and  we  tinker  with\r\n\r\nideas  of  remodelling Singapore.  Indeed, such  concerns\r\n\r\nare   pertinent.   We  are  doing  our   job.    However,\r\n\r\nsimultaneously,  we  need  to  grapple  with  demographic\r\n\r\nchanges  and implications.  Among other things, a  longer\r\n\r\nlife  expectancy,  the aged, the non-working  population,\r\n\r\nout  of  which 88% have not saved enough for  retirement.\r\n\r\nThey   spend  too  much  on  housing  perhaps,  but  this\r\n\r\nrealisation will not solve the problem for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, with increased unemployment, the issue\r\n\r\nof  medical coverage arises. Those in between jobs  often\r\n\r\ndo   not   enjoy   medical  benefits.   The   two-pronged\r\n\r\npredicament  is  banging on our door  for  effective  and\r\n\r\nimmediate attention.  On this subject, the Government has\r\n\r\naccepted  the  recommendation of the ERC and  intends  to\r\n\r\nencourage  companies to provide portable medical  benefit\r\n\r\nscheme or the transferable insurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we do more besides encouraging the\r\n\r\ncompanies?   We  are not a welfare state  and  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that we try to be one now, just because we are\r\n\r\nin  trouble.  However, we are also here because  we  have\r\n\r\nmade a commitment to the man-in-the-street.  Where do  we\r\n\r\ndraw  this  line?   When is it a hand-out  and  is  it  a\r\n\r\nresponse of genuine call for help?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob Jurong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, over the last one\r\n\r\nyear, I have received a number of requests for help  from\r\n\r\nresidents  in  my  constituency to settle  their  medical\r\n\r\nbills.   Those  who  face  great  difficulties  are   the\r\n\r\nelderly,  those with long-term illnesses  and  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  lost their jobs.  Under our system, those  who  are\r\n\r\nreally  poor and needy can look towards Medifund to  help\r\n\r\nthem.   But  there  are a number who  are  sandwiched  in\r\n\r\nbetween.   They  are neither poor enough to  fulfill  the\r\n\r\nstringent requirements stipulated under the Medifund but,\r\n\r\non the other hand, they cannot afford the existing rates.\r\n\r\nOne  approach  would be to provide them  with  short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial   assistance  or  loans  or  longer  instalment\r\n\r\npayments.  But these are largely temporary measures.   In\r\n\r\nthe  long  term,  a  fundamental issue  that  has  to  be\r\n\r\naddressed  is  what can we do to ensure  that  healthcare\r\n\r\ncosts remain affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now, the CPI for healthcare has been\r\n\r\nhigher than the overall CPI rate. One explanation on  how\r\n\r\nto  contain costs is through the presence of two hospital\r\n\r\nclusters.   But  to  Singaporeans,  having  two  hospital\r\n\r\nclusters  have not helped to reduce costs, as costs  have\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  go  up.  There seems  to  be  problems  of\r\n\r\ncoordination and economies of scale as well.  The  recent\r\n\r\nexample  of  different  prices  being  charged  for  non-standard medicines by the polyclinics and hospitals, even\r\n\r\nwithin the same cluster and across clusters, is a case in\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also public concerns over means\r\n\r\ntesting.   Means testing is currently used  in  step-down\r\n\r\ncare  services, those moving from private to restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals, and from upper class to lower class  wards  in\r\n\r\nthe  restructured hospitals.  Recently, the Ministry  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  may  extend  means  testing  to  patients\r\n\r\nreferred  from  polyclinics to the specialist  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinics  in  the  restructured hospitals  as  well.   The\r\n\r\nproblem with means testing is that the criteria and basis\r\n\r\nfor it as well as the administrative cost of doing so are\r\n\r\nnot very clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following questions to ask of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health.  What is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeing  done  to contain healthcare costs and ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey  remain affordable to Singaporeans?  Secondly,  what\r\n\r\nis  the  Ministry  of Health's policy on  means  testing?\r\n\r\nWhat  are the criteria and basis that it intends to  use?\r\n\r\nHow  will  the Ministry ensure that really needy patients\r\n\r\nare   not  denied  access  to  healthcare?    And  before\r\n\r\nintroducing  means  testing  in  other  areas,  will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  first inform and educate the public widely,  so\r\n\r\nthat there is no confusion and anxiety?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, our healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem is amongst one of the best in the world.  We  have\r\n\r\na  wider  coverage  for  our  population  vis-a-vis  many\r\n\r\ncountries  in the world.  We have fine-tuned our  system,\r\n\r\nincluding  tweaking and competition, by  introducing  two\r\n\r\nclusters of medical providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, our healthcare expenditure is close\r\n\r\nto  4% of our GDP.  However, if we age adjust it to  that\r\n\r\nof,  say, the United Kingdom, it would be about  7.2%  of\r\n\r\nour GDP.  Hence, if we want to maintain the same level of\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  in  a  few years' time when  our  demography\r\n\r\nreaches that of the UK, we would expect to spend 7.2%  of\r\n\r\nour  GDP.   If  we  continue to  raise  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare, the total expenditure will probably  be  much\r\n\r\nhigher than the 7.2%.  Sir, I would like to know if  this\r\n\r\nlevel of GDP spending  is sustainable in the long run for\r\n\r\nour country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our population gets older, less people would be\r\n\r\npaying  taxes.  So, would our average Singaporeans  still\r\n\r\nbe  able to afford to pay for their healthcare?  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's measure to make sure that our  healthcare\r\n\r\nproviders  do their best to contain the cost and  operate\r\n\r\nin a cost efficient manner?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern of other MPs who spoke earlier\r\n\r\nabout the two clusters and whether they are operating  in\r\n\r\na very cost efficient and cost effective manner.  I think\r\n\r\none  of the problems is probably the cost recovery model,\r\n\r\nwhich  may  not incentivise the operator to be  efficient\r\n\r\nbecause  he  may  just  pass on  the  cost  back  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumer, the patient and also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government who gives him the subsidies.  So, I would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Ministry to review the approach for this\r\n\r\ncost  recovery,  maybe a  price minus  model   where  the\r\n\r\nprice  of a service is being fixed and the operator  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  work backwards in order to recover and to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that he is able to provide the service at  a  price\r\n\r\nthat is affordable to our patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to talk about ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, you do not have much time to\r\n\r\ntalk about whatever you want to talk about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> I want to talk about competition\r\n\r\nin the healthcare service, a point which I will allude to\r\n\r\nin my later cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, our Government has given the promise\r\n\r\nthat  no  one will be denied basic affordable healthcare.\r\n\r\nWe  are very proud that we have delivered this promise so\r\n\r\nfar.

I am confident that the Ministry of Health  would\r\n\r\nhave  seriously considered various avenues  available  to\r\n\r\ntry  and  reduce or minimise healthcare costs.   However,\r\n\r\nmany  lower  income, average Singaporeans  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nresidents  have shown deep concern about the increase  in\r\n\r\nand  escalation of healthcare costs.  As the standard  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  rises, healthcare costs would  tend  to  rise\r\n\r\nalso.   Cost of medical equipment, scientific and medical\r\n\r\nexamination,  professional  and  staff  costs  and  other\r\n\r\nexpenses  must  inevitably increase as the years  go  by.\r\n\r\nWhat are the positive steps taken by the Ministry to  try\r\n\r\nand  reduce healthcare costs?  Do we need such high class\r\n\r\nhospitals  like  Singapore  General  Hospital,   National\r\n\r\nUniversity Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  as  they\r\n\r\nappear  to  reach  almost five-star hotel  status?

Does the Ministry of Finance  expect  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health to recoup all or most of the cost  and\r\n\r\nbe in the black within a time limit, resulting in medical\r\n\r\ncost going up and making the patients pay more?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Does the Ministry try to have rules and\r\n\r\nguidelines to ensure that specialist doctors are directed\r\n\r\nto assist by not charging too high consultancy fees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Does the Ministry have rules and regulations on\r\n\r\npharmaceutical companies and medical equipment  companies\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the  cost  of supply  of  drugs  and  medical\r\n\r\nequipment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, last year, I raised the\r\n\r\nconcern  on  the cut-off of the Ministry's means  testing\r\n\r\nthat  would  result  in only half of the  patients  being\r\n\r\neligible for subsidised healthcare.  I was relieved  when\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  implemented  the  means  testing  at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospital last year.  It was done in a  gradual\r\n\r\nmanner  to  phase in the impact.

By setting the means test cut-off\r\n\r\nat  50%, those in between, the not so poor and yet not so\r\n\r\nrich,  will  be  deprived of good medical  services  they\r\n\r\ncould  afford.   Let me elaborate.  For  example,  it  is\r\n\r\ncommon for a husband and wife, both working and with  two\r\n\r\nchildren,  to  earn about a combined salary  of  slightly\r\n\r\nmore   than  $5,000.   This  will  be  above  the  median\r\n\r\nhousehold income and the family will fail the means test.\r\n\r\nWhen the means test is kicked in fully, say, at the acute\r\n\r\nhospitals, and the husband is unfortunate that he needs a\r\n\r\nbypass  operation  that would cost  $20,000,  the  family\r\n\r\nwould  have a problem forking out four months'  worth  of\r\n\r\ntheir  total  income either in cash or it will  wipe  out\r\n\r\ntheir  Medisave savings very fast.  This would be a great\r\n\r\nburden on average Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing healthcare cost, most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  look  to  the  Government  for   good   and\r\n\r\naffordable  medical service.  The Government should  cast\r\n\r\nits  net  wider  when  applying healthcare  subsidies  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Sir, I am speaking for the lot who are out\r\n\r\nof  the band to qualify for subsidies and yet poor enough\r\n\r\nto  be  stressed  by the rising healthcare  cost.   While\r\n\r\nmeans test has not kicked in at the acute hospitals  yet,\r\n\r\nmost are already anxious about their ability to meet  the\r\n\r\nrising costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Ministry to relook at the details of\r\n\r\nmeans testing for the healthcare services and ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  healthcare subsidies are given to a wider  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans so that they are not deprived of  affordable\r\n\r\nhealthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Primary Care Partnership Scheme\r\n\r\n(PCPS)  is a scheme set up to provide outpatient  medical\r\n\r\nservices  at polyclinic rates for those who are 65  years\r\n\r\nand above and have a per capita income\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  $700  per  month  or less.  May I  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether it is correct to say that, to-date, only 50%,  or\r\n\r\nthereabouts, of those eligible have registered  for  this\r\n\r\nscheme and, that being the case, is his Ministry planning\r\n\r\nto  better  promote this scheme in order to  benefit  the\r\n\r\nrest of those who are eligible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister why is there restriction on\r\n\r\nthe  type of medical conditions that can be treated under\r\n\r\nthe scheme?  I find it odd that chronic diseases, such as\r\n\r\nhypertension  and  diabetes, are  not  eligible  for  the\r\n\r\nscheme as it is chronic diseases like these that are more\r\n\r\nprevalent  in the elderly.  They are the ones  that  most\r\n\r\ncrucially  call  for  good  treatment  and  follow-up  to\r\n\r\nprevent   the   complications   which   usually   require\r\n\r\nhospitalisation and incur higher healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing patients with chronic diseases to be cared\r\n\r\nfor  under  this  scheme will provide  more  convenience,\r\n\r\nbetter  compliance and the achievement of  secondary  and\r\n\r\ntertiary prevention of illnesses and problems.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the resultant cost need not be much higher than  by\r\n\r\nlimiting  such treatment at polyclinics.   The  price  of\r\n\r\nmedicines can be pegged to polyclinic rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, with\r\n\r\nthe   introduction  of  the  PCPS,  many  residents  have\r\n\r\nbenefited from the scheme.  I am glad that the scheme was\r\n\r\nexpanded further last year.  I think it has been  a  very\r\n\r\neffective and worthwhile scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, qualified patients no longer need\r\n\r\nto  travel  all  the way to Government  polyclinics,  but\r\n\r\ninstead  they can be treated at any participating private\r\n\r\nclinics  near  them,  while paying subsidised  polyclinic\r\n\r\nrates.   The best part is that the scheme does  not  cost\r\n\r\nthe Government any additional subsidy as the same subsidy\r\n\r\nwould  have been borne by the Government had the patients\r\n\r\ngone to the polyclinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it has the benefit of reducing the\r\n\r\nqueues at the polyclinics as well\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  give  business  to the private  clinics.   Given  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of the scheme, I would like to urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider relaxing some of the qualifying criteria  so\r\n\r\nthat more patients can benefit from this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only senior citizens who pass the means\r\n\r\ntest  and  those  who  are under  public  assistance  can\r\n\r\nqualify for the scheme.  I would like to propose that the\r\n\r\nscheme   be  extended  to  three  additional  categories.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the non-senior citizens who may pass the  means\r\n\r\ntest.  These are those in the lower income group and they\r\n\r\nwould benefit from some savings in the cost of travelling\r\n\r\nto  the  polyclinics.   Secondly, for  patients  who  are\r\n\r\nhandicapped, travelling is always a major task  for  this\r\n\r\ngroup of people, and it would be good if we can save them\r\n\r\nthe  inconvenience.  Thirdly, patients  who  suffer  from\r\n\r\nchronic  diseases  that  require  long-term  and  regular\r\n\r\nmedication  or  treatment.  These  patients  are  already\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  critical  illnesses  and  we  can   help\r\n\r\nalleviate  their  sufferings by  including  them  in  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe these three groups of people deserve some\r\n\r\nhelp.   I  feel that we can afford to open the scheme  to\r\n\r\nthem because these groups can be clearly defined and they\r\n\r\nare  small  in number after all.  They are, in any  case,\r\n\r\nmost  likely  to  be  patients of Government  polyclinics\r\n\r\nalready.   If we open the scheme to them, it is  unlikely\r\n\r\nto  result in widespread abuse, or a significant increase\r\n\r\nin Government subsidy.  Yet, it would undoubtedly benefit\r\n\r\nthose who really deserve it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be most delighted if the Minister could\r\n\r\nconsider my suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare  is  one of the foundations of our  healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem.   Over  the  years, the Ministry  of  Health  has\r\n\r\nintensified  and  strengthened  the  primary   healthcare\r\n\r\ndelivery network. This is indeed commendable.  I would be\r\n\r\ngrateful if the Minister could update us on the following\r\n\r\nmatters:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the night polyclinics. I understand that\r\n\r\nseven night polyclinics are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnow  in  operation. What is the response of the residents\r\n\r\nto  these night polyclinics?  Does the Ministry intend to\r\n\r\nopen more such night polyclinics?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry piloted the Primary Care\r\n\r\nPartnership Scheme (PCPS) three years ago and extended it\r\n\r\nnationwide last year, making it much more convenient  for\r\n\r\nthe  residents in various parts of Singapore. In view  of\r\n\r\nthe successful implementation of PCPS, would the Ministry\r\n\r\nreview its policy on polyclinic development? How many new\r\n\r\npolyclinics  are in the pipeline? What is the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nguideline  in opening new polyclinics in the  new  towns?\r\n\r\nFor  example,  I  understand that  Pasir  Ris  Polyclinic\r\n\r\nstarted  operation only one year ago, whereas  Pasir  Ris\r\n\r\nNew  Town has been developed for quite some time.  I hope\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   can  coordinate  the  opening   of   new\r\n\r\npolyclinics with the development of new towns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Interim Disability Assistance Programme\r\n\r\nfor  the  Elderly  (IDAPE).  The scheme was  launched  to\r\n\r\ncover   older  Singaporeans  who  are  unable   to   join\r\n\r\nElderShield  due to age limit or pre-existing disability.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  good  scheme.   I  want  to  know  how  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have benefited from the programme  and  how\r\n\r\ndoes  the Ministry plan to reach out to those who qualify\r\n\r\nfor the scheme but may not be aware of it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Michael Lim is not present. Dr\r\n\r\nWarren Lee is also not present.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I want to\r\n\r\nbring to the attention of the Ministry of Health one area\r\n\r\nof  high cost which I think we should look into.  At  the\r\n\r\nspecialist outpatient clinics, when patients go  and  see\r\n\r\nthese  specialists,  they know the  cost.   If  it  is  a\r\n\r\nconsultant,  they  know how much to  pay.   If  it  is  a\r\n\r\nRegistrar,  they know how much to pay.  But  then,  after\r\n\r\nthe  consultation, a prescription is usually given.   And\r\n\r\nit  is  this  prescription that I want to  bring  to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the drugs that are given to the patients are\r\n\r\nvery expensive drugs.  For\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  who  suffer  from  heart illness  and  high  blood\r\n\r\npressure, cholesterol raised, the drugs used to treat all\r\n\r\nthese  conditions  are really very expensive.   Normally,\r\n\r\nthey  are given a three-month supply of medication  which\r\n\r\nis actually a lot.  The cost can be a lot.  Sometimes, it\r\n\r\nis  as  much as $500.  So I am suggesting that we  should\r\n\r\nadvise  the  specialists to give maybe a two-week  supply\r\n\r\nfirst.   If  it  is agreeable, then you  have  a  further\r\n\r\nextension  of  the purchase of whatever drugs.   Because,\r\n\r\nmany a time, some of the patients do not agree with these\r\n\r\ndrugs.  And I think it is a lot of wastage here.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry will look into it.  One way perhaps  is\r\n\r\nto  ask  the pharmacists to advise the patients maybe  to\r\n\r\njust  take a two-week supply first before they resort  to\r\n\r\ntaking more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee, since we are on the\r\n\r\nsame amendment, I remember you want to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the problems\r\n\r\nthat  we  face in the current downturn is when people  go\r\n\r\nand   see   a   private  practitioner  and  the   private\r\n\r\npractitioner   tells  the  patient  that  a  specialist's\r\n\r\nopinion is needed.  Up to now, the practice has been that\r\n\r\nif  the  private  practitioner refers the  patient  to  a\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospital, it becomes a private consultation\r\n\r\nwith  high  cost.   Usually, this  is  justified  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds that, after all, you are choosing to have a named\r\n\r\nspecialist.   Although I know this has been  a  perennial\r\n\r\nproblem,  I  would  still  urge  that,  when  a   private\r\n\r\npractitioner  refers  a patient to  a  hospital  to  seek\r\n\r\nconsultation on a given medical discipline, but not  with\r\n\r\nthe  named specialist in mind, consideration be given for\r\n\r\nthese referrals to be done at subsidised rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, Singapore probably has\r\n\r\none   of  the  highest  cases  of  specialist  outpatient\r\n\r\nreferrals in the world.  As the population gets more  and\r\n\r\nmore  educated, our people invariably get  more  informed\r\n\r\nabout  their  healthcare  needs.   Likewise,  people  are\r\n\r\ngetting more demands for specialist referrals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a minor indigestion that could be\r\n\r\ntreated  with a simple prescription of antacid could  now\r\n\r\nresult   in  lengthy  and  numerous  medical  tests   and\r\n\r\ninvestigations at patients' demand.  All this  drives  up\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause of this phenomenon would probably be\r\n\r\nhow  easy  it  is  for polyclinics to make  referrals  to\r\n\r\nspecialist  outpatient clinics (SOCs) and  the  low  cost\r\n\r\nwhen referrals are made from these clinics.  It is as low\r\n\r\nas $21, equivalent to seeing a private GP.  Also, once  a\r\n\r\nreferral  is  made  to SOC, it is almost  certain  to  be\r\n\r\ncaught  in  a loop of subsequent referrals for years  and\r\n\r\nmonths.  For most patients, if they are told to come back\r\n\r\nfor more referrals, most would obediently follow, despite\r\n\r\nthe  fact that many of these cases could actually be sent\r\n\r\nback to GPs or polyclinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state that, while there is no evidence of\r\n\r\nabuse,  such a system that we have currently is  an  open\r\n\r\ninvitation  for abuse.  I am particularly concerned  with\r\n\r\ngraduating  patients from this loop  of  endless  further\r\n\r\nreferrals and appointments with the specialists.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,   our  public  specialist  doctors  have   little\r\n\r\nguidance  on taking patients out for more future  visits.\r\n\r\nPatients themselves would either adhere to future  visits\r\n\r\nobediently,  out of ignorance, or simply because  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies  and are not deterred by the cost of subsequent\r\n\r\nreferrals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there is a need to regulate the specialist\r\n\r\noutpatient  clinics with either a set of new  guidelines,\r\n\r\nor  a department housed in the Ministry, to monitor that.\r\n\r\nIn   Queensland,  Australia,  for  example,   there   are\r\n\r\nguidelines  for  SOCs  where  SOCs  must  follow  certain\r\n\r\nguidelines  which spell out periodic audits to  ascertain\r\n\r\nif  the individuals still require the appointment.  These\r\n\r\nguidelines  spell out, amongst other things, the  waiting\r\n\r\ntime  before a patient gets to see his or her  doctor  as\r\n\r\nwell.  To ensure the audits are competently carried  out,\r\n\r\nthe  Audit  Committee comprises peers  from  the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession.  Currently, we do not have this audit  system\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the containment of rising medical cost in\r\n\r\nSingapore needs a multi-pronged approach.

This has been highlighted\r\n\r\nby  many  Members who spoke earlier and I, too,  share  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  concern.   With the current  economic  downturn,\r\n\r\nmany  workers  are  retrenched and  a  vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nworkers also experience wage cuts or a wage freeze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical cost has become a major burden on the\r\n\r\nordinary  workers, especially for those who are  affected\r\n\r\nby  the  economic  downturn, and  many  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nfacing reality by seeking medical treatment at subsidised\r\n\r\nwards.    I  wish  to  ask  the  Minister  whether   more\r\n\r\nsubsidised wards in Government or restructured  hospitals\r\n\r\nwould be provided if the situation warrants.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  many  workers have raised their  concerns  to  me.\r\n\r\nMany workers who had sought medical treatment provided by\r\n\r\ntheir  employers at non-subsidised rates before could  no\r\n\r\nlonger   continue  the  same.

Or, at least, if cost increase is  necessary,\r\n\r\ncan it be kept as low as possible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a humane approach in dealing with this\r\n\r\nhuman  problem.   This  will go a  long  way  in  further\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the  bond  between  the  people  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health has provided Singaporeans with  a\r\n\r\nhigh standard of healthcare comparable to the best in the\r\n\r\nworld.   This is possible not only because we have access\r\n\r\nto  good doctors but also because we have access  to  the\r\n\r\nbest  in  medical technology and devices.   The  Ministry\r\n\r\nmust   be  careful  about  putting  in  place  healthcare\r\n\r\npolicies which will add to healthcare cost.  Some of  its\r\n\r\npolicies  may have the unintended effect of raising  cost\r\n\r\nof healthcare for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent policy, ie, the change in the regulation\r\n\r\nfor  the  control  of medical devices in Singapore,  will\r\n\r\neventually  translate  into higher  healthcare  cost  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   The  policy aims to control  the  use  of\r\n\r\nmedical devices, and medical devices include all products\r\n\r\nused   in   healthcare  for  the  diagnosis,  prevention,\r\n\r\nmonitoring  or  treatment  of illness  or  handicap,  but\r\n\r\nexclude  drugs.  The stated aim of the new regulation  is\r\n\r\nto  strike  a  balance between ensuring  product  safety,\r\n\r\nquality and effectiveness, and providing the public  with\r\n\r\ntimely access to medical devices.  It further states that\r\n\r\nit  will  expedite availability and access of new medical\r\n\r\ndevice  technologies  to  patients,  consumers  and   the\r\n\r\nclinical community in Singapore while preventing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  entrance of unsafe and ineffective devices into  the\r\n\r\nSingapore market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paper, it looks fine. But, in reality, what are\r\n\r\nits  implications?   The submission format  is  extremely\r\n\r\ntedious and onerous and requires substantial data  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted. The requirements are even more stringent  than\r\n\r\nthat   of  FDA  requirements.   If  we  do  follow  these\r\n\r\nregulations,  we  will probably become the  most  tightly\r\n\r\nregulated  market  in the world for medical  devices.   I\r\n\r\nwould  advise that this is not one of the things that  we\r\n\r\nshould  aim to be number one in the world.  We  must  not\r\n\r\nfollow blindly and make our system the most stringent  of\r\n\r\nall  regulations. We do not have a big market and neither\r\n\r\ndo  we have the resources.  We cannot, and must not,  act\r\n\r\nlike  the  FDA.  While the manufacturers are prepared  to\r\n\r\nspend  tremendous amounts of money and resources  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  devices accepted in the US or EU market, they  are\r\n\r\nnot  likely to want to spend significant resources for  a\r\n\r\nsmall market like Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even FDA-approved products and CE-marked products\r\n\r\nfrom EU will be subject to our stringent regulations  and\r\n\r\nare  not exempt as well. Feedback from manufacturers  and\r\n\r\ndistributors  indicate that the Singapore market  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall  and,  if  they  were to be subject  to  all  these\r\n\r\nadditional  paperwork  and cost, it  will  not  make  any\r\n\r\neconomic sense for them to bring in some of their medical\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Ministry, firstly, why do we need\r\n\r\nto  change the system? What are the shortcomings  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent system that have resulted in the desire to change\r\n\r\nit  to  a  highly tedious and onerous system?  Are  there\r\n\r\nmedical device failures in the past that have compromised\r\n\r\nhealthcare  outcomes in Singapore where the manufacturers\r\n\r\nhave not taken responsibility?  I hope that this is not a\r\n\r\ncase  of  finding more work to do, so that more  revenues\r\n\r\ncan be generated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that the new regulation\r\n\r\nstates  that it will expedite availability and access  of\r\n\r\nnew medical device\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntechnology  to  patients,  consumers  and  the   clinical\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore, while preventing the entrance  of\r\n\r\nunsafe and ineffective devices into the Singapore market.\r\n\r\nHowever,   does  the  Ministry  or  the  Health  Sciences\r\n\r\nAuthority  (HSA)  have  the resources  to  perform  these\r\n\r\nduties  diligently, professionally and without  delay  in\r\n\r\nits  review  process?  I have serious  doubts.   Clinical\r\n\r\ndata require special in-depth knowledge and also end user\r\n\r\nexperience which is not available in HSA.  So  I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve that HSA has the resources or the ability to view\r\n\r\nthese  documents  in  a  timely fashion.   Neither  do  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  they have the expertise to understand  all\r\n\r\nthe  technical  data, the clinical data  that  they  have\r\n\r\nrequested  the manufacturers to submit.  If that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase,  why  does the HSA want such voluminous amounts  of\r\n\r\ndata?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up, Dr Lim. Dr\r\n\r\nChong  Weng Chiew, you have two cuts.  Please  take  them\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> The ERC has highlighted that\r\n\r\nwe   could  develop  our  medical  services  further  and\r\n\r\ntransform Singapore into a medical hub.  On reading that,\r\n\r\nI  was  really  wondering what direction should  our  two\r\n\r\nlargest  clusters of medical services, namely, SingHealth\r\n\r\nand  NHG, be heading to.  Would it be to further  enhance\r\n\r\nour  medical services to one that is world-class  and  to\r\n\r\nattract  patients  from neighbouring countries,  or  even\r\n\r\ncountries  far away?  Or should they be concentrating  on\r\n\r\nproviding   basic   affordable   health   services    for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans or maybe both, as what they are doing now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my humble opinion, achieving both is almost\r\n\r\nimpossible with the limited talent pool in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nalso the limited resources that the two groups have.   To\r\n\r\nbe  able to provide world-class medical services and  yet\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  meet  the basic needs is  like  asking  our\r\n\r\nnational body-builder to strive for the Olympics  but  to\r\n\r\nkeep slim to fit into a small-sized T-shirt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a lot of resources of our two clusters\r\n\r\nare  spent on meeting world-class medical demands and  we\r\n\r\nhave achieved\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  in many of our medical services.  Our Heart  Centre\r\n\r\nat SGH is perhaps among one of the best in the region and\r\n\r\nit  stands  shoulder-to-shoulder among some of  the  best\r\n\r\nheart clinics in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in our bid to top the medical\r\n\r\ndeliverables, some of the hospitals in the  two  clusters\r\n\r\nhave to pay high wages for top-notch doctors and to equip\r\n\r\nthe   hospitals  with  the  most  modern  and  up-to-date\r\n\r\nequipment  and facilities.  Given the finite  subventions\r\n\r\nthat  our hospitals receive, the cost of such talent  and\r\n\r\nequipment will naturally have to be borne somehow.  It is\r\n\r\neither  passed down to consumers and hence the perception\r\n\r\nthat  the  healthcare  cost is high,  or  some  areas  of\r\n\r\nservices will have to suffer a reduction in allocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not helpful or healthy for public\r\n\r\nmisconceptions  to  persist, while our  medical  services\r\n\r\nwork  very  hard  to give Singaporeans the  best  medical\r\n\r\nservices there are.  Perhaps, the Minister could  provide\r\n\r\na  clear  direction for the roles the healthcare clusters\r\n\r\nshould  play  so that they could meet healthcare  demands\r\n\r\nadequately.   I  would also like to ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nstudy the feasibility of introducing a third cluster that\r\n\r\nwill  look  into the ERC's recommendation of spearheading\r\n\r\nSingapore into providing excellent medical services. This\r\n\r\nthird  cluster  could  address  the  demand  for  premier\r\n\r\nhealthcare services, while NHG and SingHealth could focus\r\n\r\non   providing  adequate  basic  healthcare  upon   which\r\n\r\nGovernment subsidies can be applied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I would like to move on to my second\r\n\r\ncut.  Under my second cut, I have two points to make. The\r\n\r\nfirst  was  raised earlier on by Dr Lily  Neo  about  the\r\n\r\nsurge  in  recent requests for C class beds and the  call\r\n\r\nfor  more  allocations of C class beds in  hospitals.   I\r\n\r\nshall  not dwell on that further.  The second point which\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to speak on focuses on those Singaporeans\r\n\r\nopting  for  higher class of services only  to  find  out\r\n\r\nlater on how unaffordable they are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to address the growing concerns about\r\n\r\nthe level of understand-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ning  the  public  has on the ability  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost.  It has become apparent that  a  growing\r\n\r\nnumber of Singaporeans are not too clear on how they  can\r\n\r\ngo  about paying for their healthcare cost.  I have  seen\r\n\r\nreports that the expenditure for more expensive hospital-based services has increased, primarily because they  are\r\n\r\nperceived to be of a higher quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of many cases where the next-of-kin, upon\r\n\r\nadmitting  their loved ones for surgery, would invariably\r\n\r\nopt  for a higher class bed.  Many thought that they  are\r\n\r\njust  being  filial by giving their loved ones  a  better\r\n\r\nclass without realising the level of subsidy, or the lack\r\n\r\nof  it.  They would later question why the treatment  for\r\n\r\ntheir father or mother is so expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the possible reasons for this? In my\r\n\r\nhumble opinion, the main reason is that there are serious\r\n\r\nmisconceptions about the quality of healthcare  available\r\n\r\nin  the  different wards and in the different  hospitals.\r\n\r\nThis  is despite the fact that MOH has re-emphasised time\r\n\r\nand   again  that  the  level  of  medical  and   nursing\r\n\r\nprofessionalism is irrespective of the class and ward you\r\n\r\nstay in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a considerable ignorance on the part\r\n\r\nof  the  public  with  regard to the  limit  of  Medisave\r\n\r\ncoverage,  creating  an  illusion  that  more  money   is\r\n\r\navailable than there really is, and what it can  be  used\r\n\r\nfor.   Many also erroneously perceive Medisave  funds  as\r\n\r\nfrozen  assets and, if unspent, will be retained  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  All  these  misgivings  have  induced   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to opt for more luxurious services than they\r\n\r\nwould have consumed otherwise.  This is a serious problem\r\n\r\nand  it  could lead to a situation where no funds  remain\r\n\r\nfor their old age when they are more likely to need it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would therefore like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinistry to make greater efforts in embarking on a public\r\n\r\neducation  exercise to educate the public about potential\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost and the means through which this cost can\r\n\r\nbe managed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance, in\r\n\r\nhis Budget Statement,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannounced the introduction of market-testing for non-core\r\n\r\nGovernment  services  this  year,  beginning   with   new\r\n\r\nservices.   Public sector agencies will  be  required  to\r\n\r\ncompare  the  cost  of  providing  the  service  in-house\r\n\r\nagainst the price quoted by private sector vendors.  If a\r\n\r\nprivate sector vendor can deliver the service more  cost-effectively, it will be engaged to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an excellent approach to make sure that\r\n\r\nwe  get  value  for our money.  I urge  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  to  also consider introducing market  testing  in\r\n\r\nhealthcare, allowing the private medical providers to bid\r\n\r\nfor   the   service  in  the  public  healthcare  sector.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the two healthcare clusters enjoy  a  captive\r\n\r\nmarket.  They also practise cost-recovery.  It is  almost\r\n\r\nlike  a monopoly.  There is little incentive for them  to\r\n\r\noperate cost effectively as whatever the cost is it  will\r\n\r\nbe  recovered from the Government subsidy and  topped  up\r\n\r\nwith the fee payable by the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not surprising to hear that one could avoid\r\n\r\nthe   long  queue  at  a  specialist  clinic  to  get   a\r\n\r\nconsultation at a private clinic for an average  fee  of,\r\n\r\nsay,  $60-$80.  I believe this is not much different from\r\n\r\nthe  subventions from MOH to all these specialist clinics\r\n\r\nplus  the  fees payable by the patients.  As  an  example\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas,  in  a  comparative  study  between   the\r\n\r\nNational  Health  Service (NHS) of UK  and  a  non-profit\r\n\r\nprivate  medical service provider, Kaiser Corporation  in\r\n\r\nCalifornia, it was concluded that Kaiser achieved  better\r\n\r\nperformance  at roughly the same cost as the NHS  because\r\n\r\nof   integration   throughout   the   system,   efficient\r\n\r\nmanagement  of hospital use, the benefits of competition,\r\n\r\nand greater investment in information technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order for us to become the regional hub of\r\n\r\nmedical  excellence,  allowing  the  private  sector   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the provision of public healthcare  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  much-needed competition in  this  sector.\r\n\r\nThis would result in lower healthcare cost to our nation.\r\n\r\nI urge the Minister to consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Most of the\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House have already voiced their  concerns\r\n\r\nabout  the high cost of Government hospitals. Some of  it\r\n\r\nare  due to the clustering section that is occupying  80%\r\n\r\nof  the market share of the total hospital services  that\r\n\r\nare provided by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would try not to repeat the concerns of the\r\n\r\nMembers which I support, but I would just like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether occupying 80% of the hospital share  of\r\n\r\nthe market in Singapore is going to be the long-term view\r\n\r\nof  the Government.  And, if so, can the Minister make it\r\n\r\nclearly known to the House so that we can be prepared for\r\n\r\nthe  high cost that we will be expecting in the years  to\r\n\r\ncome.   When I was looking at the Budget Book, subvention\r\n\r\nfunds  for restructured hospitals rose from $769  million\r\n\r\nin FY 2000 to $1.6 billion for FY 2003, almost double the\r\n\r\namount spent in the year 2000.  If this trend is going to\r\n\r\ncontinue, the House must be prepared for it.  However, if\r\n\r\nit  is not going to continue that way, can I suggest that\r\n\r\nmaybe  we  privatise certain hospitals in  the  clusters,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  Government keeps one or two  large  hospitals\r\n\r\nlike  the Singapore General Hospital and the NUH together\r\n\r\nwith  other research facilities?  The Government can then\r\n\r\nregulate   the  cost  of  medical  services  of   private\r\n\r\nhospitals  through  a subvention fund  and  leave  market\r\n\r\nforces to determine which hospital is more cost-efficient\r\n\r\nthan the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  thank  all  the Members for raising  issues  and\r\n\r\nconcerns on keeping healthcare cost affordable. This is a\r\n\r\nperennial issue and it must remain the main focus of  our\r\n\r\nefforts.  Let me first just give the overall picture  and\r\n\r\nafter  that,  I  will  go into the  details  of  how  the\r\n\r\nMinistry is proceeding to control healthcare cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the overall picture. Healthcare cost went up\r\n\r\nby 4% last year.  We must see this in comparison with the\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost in other countries.  It went up  by  4.6%\r\n\r\nin the US and 6.6% in Australia. We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot avoid healthcare cost going up, because we buy the\r\n\r\nsame  pharmaceuticals, we buy the same drugs, we use  the\r\n\r\nsame high quality medical devices, we use the most recent\r\n\r\nmedical technology, unless Members are serious in  saying\r\n\r\nthat  we do not progress as much as other countries.   If\r\n\r\nwe  want to keep up, then I think this is the price  that\r\n\r\nwe  have to pay.  But what we do is to try and keep  this\r\n\r\ncost down as much as possible, while still providing good\r\n\r\nquality care to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite healthcare cost going up by 4% last\r\n\r\nyear,  our  overall national healthcare expenditure  last\r\n\r\nyear  accounted for about 3.5% of GDP.  Members will have\r\n\r\nnoticed that this has gone up compared to previous years.\r\n\r\nIn  previous years, it was 3%.  The main reason this  has\r\n\r\ngone  up  is  because  our  GDP  did  not  increase  very\r\n\r\nsubstantially in the last two years.  The denominator has\r\n\r\ngone  down and so our national healthcare cost has  crept\r\n\r\nup  to 3.5%.  3.5% is still quite low, compared to 7%-15%\r\n\r\nof GDP in other developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other parameter that we should be aware of is\r\n\r\nthat  the average Singaporean household spends only  3.3%\r\n\r\nof  the  household expenditure or $120 a month on medical\r\n\r\nservices,   meaning   the   out-of-pocket   expense    by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is $120 per month.  This is about  the  same\r\n\r\namount  that a household spends on telephone,  pager  and\r\n\r\nInternet charges.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, our healthcare expenditure is not high.\r\n\r\nOur  problem  is  that healthcare expenditure  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsteady  outlay across the population, nor is it a  steady\r\n\r\noutlay   throughout  our  lives.   In  fact,   healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure is very lumpy, and comes mainly when we  grow\r\n\r\nold.   That is why we have to deal with the lumpiness  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and the incidence during the last 5-10  years\r\n\r\nof  our lives. And that is the reason why we need a very,\r\n\r\nvery sound healthcare financing system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have developed our 3M framework - Medisave, MediShield\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand Medifund - over the last 20 years.  This 3M framework\r\n\r\nhas served us well, but we need to constantly adapt it so\r\n\r\nas  to meet our future needs.  There are two main reasons\r\n\r\nfor this.  First, our population is ageing.  Today, 7% of\r\n\r\nour  population is aged 65 years and above.  This  number\r\n\r\nwill  increase  to 19% by the year 2030.   We  know  that\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenditure for an elderly person is between 3-4  times higher than that for a younger person.   So,  as\r\n\r\nthe  society ages, we can expect the national  healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure to increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second trend is that our economic growth is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  slow down.  We managed an economic growth  of\r\n\r\n7.3%  per  year in the last 15 years.  We could therefore\r\n\r\nafford  to spend more on healthcare without the share  of\r\n\r\nthe  GDP  going  up  by very much.  The  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee,  however,  estimates  that  GDP  growth  going\r\n\r\nforward  will slow to 3-5% per year, in the medium  term.\r\n\r\nWith  this  slowing  of  our economic  growth,  and  with\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost  still going up  by  between  4-6%,  our\r\n\r\nnational healthcare expenditure, as a percentage  of  our\r\n\r\nGDP, will therefore increase as a result.  So, this is  a\r\n\r\nvery  major challenge for us.  We expect healthcare  cost\r\n\r\nto go up, and we expect healthcare cost as a share of the\r\n\r\nGDP to go up.  So how do we address this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has worked out three strategies to deal\r\n\r\nwith  it.  First, we have to strengthen the 3M framework.\r\n\r\nSecond,  the  money that the Government  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nspend,  the subsidies that the Government is prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive, should be targeted at those who are most deserving.\r\n\r\nThird,  we should take all steps to manage cost.  Let  me\r\n\r\ndeal with the first strategy, which is to strengthen  the\r\n\r\n3M framework.  Let me start with the first M - Medisave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave, as we all know, is the foundation. We\r\n\r\nmust build up sufficient savings, otherwise we would  not\r\n\r\nhave enough savings to pay for healthcare cost.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why  we have decided to raise  the  Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution rate by an extra 1% in the near future.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is also pitching\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  by  paying a higher interest rate of 4%,  instead  of\r\n\r\n2.5%,  for the Medisave account.  We have done  so  since\r\n\r\n2001.   Last  year, for example, the Government  paid  an\r\n\r\nadditional  $380  million  into  Singaporeans'   Medisave\r\n\r\naccounts  because  of  this change  in  paying  a  higher\r\n\r\ninterest  rate.   This is to help Singaporeans  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir  Medisave account.  Let me stress that the Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  of between 6-8% is  really  not  very\r\n\r\nhigh.   In France, the equivalent contribution is 20%  of\r\n\r\nthe  employee's salary.  In Germany, it is 13.5%  of  the\r\n\r\nemployee's  income.  So Medisave funds are not  infinite.\r\n\r\nWe know there are many competing demands for it.  Members\r\n\r\nhave  raised  it  all  the time.   We  use  Medisave  for\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  expenses, for health insurance  premiums\r\n\r\nand   for   certain  outpatient  treatments.   We   must,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  strike  a balance between extending  Medisave\r\n\r\nfor  more healthcare uses and preserving it for the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  it is most needed, ie, hospitalisation expenses  in\r\n\r\nold age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medisave contribution and savings account is\r\n\r\ndesigned such that, for the average worker, he will  save\r\n\r\nenough  in his Medisave account to pay for around  eleven\r\n\r\nepisodes in the hospital.  Our study shows that a  normal\r\n\r\nperson  would  probably  have three  episodes  before  he\r\n\r\nreaches 65 years old and, therefore, the remaining  eight\r\n\r\nepisodes  are for the last 5, 10, 15 years of  his  life,\r\n\r\ndepending on how long he lives.  So when we look  at  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  account,  he  must keep eight-eleventh  of  his\r\n\r\nMedisave  total savings for his old age.  If he  were  to\r\n\r\ndeplete  his Medisave account very early, then  he  would\r\n\r\nnot have enough for his old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am very sympathetic to Dr Chong Weng Chiew's\r\n\r\nrequest.  He kept raising the point whether we can extend\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  Medisave for home medical and home  nursing\r\n\r\nservices.   I have explained previously that by  allowing\r\n\r\nMedisave   to  be  used  to  pay  for  the  premiums   of\r\n\r\nElderShield,  we  are,  in fact,  extending  the  use  of\r\n\r\nMedisave to the more severely disabled, so that they  can\r\n\r\nuse the payouts to pay for home medical, home nursing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  nursing  home services.  For those who  are  not  so\r\n\r\nseverely  disabled,  and if they meet  our  income  means\r\n\r\ntest,  they  will be highly subsidised by the Government.\r\n\r\nAn  average  home medical visit, after subsidy  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, would therefore range between $30-$60, and an\r\n\r\naverage  home  nursing  visit,  after  subsidy   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, will be between $13-28.  So, these levels  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  should be affordable, and seen as  the  same\r\n\r\nrange as outpatient GP cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept Dr Chong Weng Chiew's argument that if,\r\n\r\nindeed,  home  care is a substitute for in-patient  care,\r\n\r\nthat  means,  if there is medical evidence  to  say  that\r\n\r\ninstead of being hospitalised, home care is sufficient to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  problem,  and instead  of  eight  episodes  in\r\n\r\nhospital,  you  only need four episodes in the  hospital,\r\n\r\nand the funds that we set aside for the four episodes can\r\n\r\nnow  be  spent for home medical and home nursing, then  I\r\n\r\nthink  there is a case to extend it.  So we will  examine\r\n\r\nthis,  and I will be very happy if he can give us  proper\r\n\r\nscientific evidence to say that home medical, in fact, is\r\n\r\na  substitute for in-patient.  Then I think Medisave  can\r\n\r\nbe extended for home medical and home nursing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all these, we are not frozen in time.\r\n\r\nWe   have  regularly  adjusted  the  Medisave  withdrawal\r\n\r\nlimits.  We have also progressively extended the  use  of\r\n\r\nMedisave   to   more  outpatient  treatments.    Medisave\r\n\r\nwithdrawals increased by 62%, from $250 million  in  1991\r\n\r\nto  $400  million in 2001.  If we had frozen the criteria\r\n\r\nfor  Medisave  withdrawals, you will not see  this  major\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  withdrawals.  But I  agree  with  many\r\n\r\nMembers  -  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, among others - who  raised\r\n\r\nthe  point that Medisave withdrawals ought to be  attuned\r\n\r\nto  the medical condition, and that our present system of\r\n\r\nallowing  Medisave withdrawals by days in hospitalisation\r\n\r\nand by the tables of operation, is outdated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, today I would like to announce that from 1st\r\n\r\nJuly 2002, my Ministry will reset the Medisave withdrawal\r\n\r\nlimits  based  on the DRG system.  This new  system  will\r\n\r\nallow Singaporeans to withdraw more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMedisave for the more severe medical conditions.  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Medisave withdrawal limits are set based\r\n\r\non  the number of days of hospitalisation and the type of\r\n\r\nsurgeries performed.  This is a very blunt tool  that  is\r\n\r\nnot  customised  to take into account the seriousness  of\r\n\r\nthe  medical  conditions and the resources  required  for\r\n\r\ntreatment.  In some instances, it is also restrictive  as\r\n\r\nsub-limits  are set on the amount patients  can  withdraw\r\n\r\nfor each surgery performed.  With improvements in medical\r\n\r\ntechnology,  some  patients may  require  very  intensive\r\n\r\ntreatment,  but only require a very short hospital  stay,\r\n\r\neg,   for  certain  types  of  heart  surgery.   In  such\r\n\r\ninstances,  the  amounts that the patients  can  withdraw\r\n\r\nfrom  Medisave may not be commensurate with their medical\r\n\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DRG system is based on the resources required to\r\n\r\ntreat  the  medical  conditions, ie, the  more  resources\r\n\r\nrequired,  the higher the severity level,  the  more  the\r\n\r\npatient can withdraw from Medisave.  This means that they\r\n\r\nwill  need to pay less out-of-pocket cash.  These changes\r\n\r\nwill  apply  to in-patient episodes and day surgeries  at\r\n\r\nboth  the  public  and  private  hospitals.   With  these\r\n\r\nchanges,  more  than 96% of B2 patients  can  have  their\r\n\r\nentire bill paid for by Medisave, compared to 80%  of  B2\r\n\r\npatients  today.  This means that more Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nnot  need  out-of-pocket cash for their  hospitalisation.\r\n\r\nLet  me  now  ask the Parliament staff to distribute  the\r\n\r\nbrief  on these changes, which contains some examples  of\r\n\r\nhow   patients  with  serious  medical  conditions  would\r\n\r\nbenefit from these changes.  [Copies of brief distributed\r\n\r\nto hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me turn to the second M - MediShield. We\r\n\r\ndiscussed  this last year and I mentioned that MediShield\r\n\r\nin  fact  plays a very limited role in our  3M  framework\r\n\r\ncurrently.  Today, MediShield payouts account for  around\r\n\r\n1.1%  of  our national healthcare expenditure.   This,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  limits  the  role  of insurance  in  our  overall\r\n\r\nhealthcare   financing  framework.    My   Ministry   has\r\n\r\nattempted   to   make,  over  the  years,   changes   and\r\n\r\nenhancements\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  MediShield, to try and keep up with the  medical\r\n\r\ncost,  but  we  have  been  constrained  by  not  raising\r\n\r\npremiums.   Premiums  have remained unchanged  since  the\r\n\r\nscheme was introduced in1990.  So, these enhancements are\r\n\r\nreally not adequate to keep up with the medical needs  of\r\n\r\ntoday.   As a result, today, 4 in 10 B2 bills are  higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  existing  MediShield claimable  limits,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  MediShield does not fully cover catastrophic\r\n\r\nbills,  as  it is meant to do.  And this number  of  non-coverage would go up with medical inflation.  So we  need\r\n\r\nto  make quite major adjustments to our MediShield if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  meet  the  objectives that  many  Members  have\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang gave many suggestions on how to\r\n\r\nenhance  MediShield.  I am happy to note that Mr  Yeo  is\r\n\r\nsupportive of increases in the premiums for the  enhanced\r\n\r\nMediShield  scheme.  I agree with Mr Yeo that  we  should\r\n\r\nalso go for pre-funding of the policies, so that you  pay\r\n\r\nmore  when you are younger and you are covered  when  you\r\n\r\nare older.  This is in line with our move to make medical\r\n\r\nbenefit  more  portable.   So I  assure  the  House  that\r\n\r\nchanges   to  the  insurance  element  of  our  financing\r\n\r\nframework  will  be a major item in our agenda  over  the\r\n\r\nnext two years.  We need to make many changes, if we want\r\n\r\nto  allow  MediShield to play a bigger role in  providing\r\n\r\ncoverage for Singaporeans, not only during employment and\r\n\r\nin   between  jobs  but,  more  importantly,  also  after\r\n\r\nretirement.  These are very major changes and we need  to\r\n\r\nprioritise  the changes, otherwise Singaporeans  may  not\r\n\r\nunderstand and keep up with these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the first priority is to raise the MediShield\r\n\r\nclaimable limits.  Today, the MediShield claimable limits\r\n\r\nare  set  too  low and we must raise it so  as  to  allow\r\n\r\npatients  with high hospitalisation bills to  claim  more\r\n\r\nfrom  MediShield when they most need it.  They then  need\r\n\r\nto  withdraw  less  Medisave and pay  less  out-of-pocket\r\n\r\ncash.   And,  we have to adjust the MediShield  claimable\r\n\r\nlimits  in  line  with the DRG system.   I  hope  Members\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  role  of MediShield  as  a  catastrophic\r\n\r\ninsurance scheme.  This means\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  as  the medical bills go up, you cover the  highest\r\n\r\nbill.  For the average bill, Singaporeans are able to pay\r\n\r\non  their  own using the subventions from the  Government\r\n\r\nand  using  Medisave.  But for very high bills,  this  is\r\n\r\nwhere   you  want  the  MediShield  to  kick  in.    And,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we  must  raise  the  upper  limits  of   the\r\n\r\nMediShield claimable limit so that it covers the top  end\r\n\r\nof  the bill.  My Ministry will announce more details  of\r\n\r\nhow  we will enhance MediShield subsequently.  But, as  I\r\n\r\nsaid, we need other changes, and we will definitely  come\r\n\r\nback  to  the  House over the next few years  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big issue that we have to discuss and decide,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  is the issue of whether we  want  to  make\r\n\r\nmedical  insurance compulsory.  Mr Yeo Guat  Kwang  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry has any plans to  make  MediShield\r\n\r\ncompulsory.   Let me say that this is a very  major  step\r\n\r\nand we will need to consider this very carefully.  Today,\r\n\r\nmore  than 90% of the working population is covered under\r\n\r\neither  MediShield  or  one  of  the  MediShield-approved\r\n\r\nprivate medical insurance schemes.  This is quite a  high\r\n\r\nparticipation  rate.  But, of course, as Mr  Yeo  pointed\r\n\r\nout, more than 200,000 are not covered, and many of these\r\n\r\nare  the  non-working  spouses or people  who  are  self-employed,  and these are the most vulnerable people.   So\r\n\r\nwe  will have to evaluate whether or not we want to  make\r\n\r\nMediShield compulsory.  But as I said, this is a very big\r\n\r\nstep.    What  we  can  do  right  now  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  not to opt out of MediShield.   Because  if\r\n\r\nthey opt out and when they retire or become jobless, they\r\n\r\nwill not be covered by their employers.  There is also no\r\n\r\nguarantee that when they are no longer covered  by  their\r\n\r\nemployers  that  they will be insurable  at  that  stage,\r\n\r\nbecause   they  may  then  have  pre-existing  illnesses.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think  our  first  step  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to opt back into MediShield while  they  are\r\n\r\nstill young and healthy.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also suggested other changes to\r\n\r\nMediShield, so as to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  it  a national scheme, eg, covering only the  basic\r\n\r\ntier  and  to have appropriate levels of co-payments.   I\r\n\r\nthink  these  are very important principles,  because  we\r\n\r\nwant to minimise the buffet syndrome.  If you introduce a\r\n\r\nnational  medical insurance scheme and you have a  buffet\r\n\r\nsyndrome, it will lead to escalating premiums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just describing to some Members during the\r\n\r\nbreak   just  now  the  experience  of  Taiwan.    Taiwan\r\n\r\nintroduced a national medical insurance about five  years\r\n\r\nago  and  they  extended the medical insurance  to  cover\r\n\r\nvisits  to the GP.  In Singapore, Singaporeans visit  the\r\n\r\nGP,  on the average, six times a year.  In Taiwan, it  is\r\n\r\naround  11-12  times.   Why is that  so?   The  Taiwanese\r\n\r\nHealth  Minister  told me that in  some  clinics  in  the\r\n\r\nsuburbs,  it is very common for school children to  visit\r\n\r\nthe clinic and pick up pocket money from the GP,  because\r\n\r\nevery  time the GP sees a patient he can claim, say,  $20\r\n\r\nfrom the state.  So, he gives a small pocket money to the\r\n\r\nstudent,  and  there is no way you can stop  this  abuse,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is entirely within the right of a school  boy\r\n\r\nto go to a clinic, complain of headache or tummy ache and\r\n\r\nbe seen by the GP.   So, you may run very elaborate audit\r\n\r\nsystems,  but if the national average has gone up  to  11\r\n\r\ntimes,  the school boy is entitled to visit his GP  11-12\r\n\r\ntimes and collect his pocket money.  Although we do  want\r\n\r\nto  make sure that we have good coverage, we also want to\r\n\r\nmake sure that it does not lead to abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the third M, which is Medifund.\r\n\r\nMedifund  kicks in for the small minority of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  able to pay for their share of  healthcare\r\n\r\ncost,   even  after  Government  subsidy,  Medisave   and\r\n\r\nMediShield.  Over the years, the Government has  steadily\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  the Medifund capital sum.  It grew  from  $200\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1993  to $900 million this  year,  with  the\r\n\r\nlatest  $100  million  injection,  as  announced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance.  I remember one Member  mentioned\r\n\r\nwhy  is  the Ministry of Finance injecting an extra  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  when, in fact, the Ministry of Health  is  quite\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with  $800 million and  using  the  interest\r\n\r\nincome from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  $800  million.  The answer is that we  believe  that\r\n\r\nMedifund  is  a very important safety net and,  with  the\r\n\r\nadditional funds given by Ministry of Finance, MOH is now\r\n\r\nin  a  position  to  gradually  extend  the  coverage  of\r\n\r\nMedifund.   For  example, when the  Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\nraised  the capital sum last year, MOH is able to  extend\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  Medifund  to step-down care  organisations.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we will continue to make full use of  MediFund\r\n\r\nto  provide assistance to needy Singaporeans.  So, I urge\r\n\r\nMembers  that  when  they come across  a  deserving  case\r\n\r\nduring  their  meet-the-people sessions,  such  as  those\r\n\r\nmentioned by Mr Zainudin and other Members, whether  they\r\n\r\nare  the elderly, the handicapped or the retrenched,  for\r\n\r\nchronic  cases  and  other cases, do refer  them  to  the\r\n\r\nmedical social workers at the hospitals and clinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, more than 99% of Medifund applications are\r\n\r\napproved.  And with the additional funds that we have  in\r\n\r\nthe Medifund, I can assure you that Medifund, as a safety\r\n\r\nnet, will continue to be there for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second prong of our strategy is to increasingly\r\n\r\ntarget  subsidies to the most deserving.  With increasing\r\n\r\nhealthcare  costs, the Government would do  its  part  to\r\n\r\nincrease  its share of healthcare expenditure.   We  have\r\n\r\ndone   so.    Government  subsidies   for   Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nhealthcare  costs through the hospitals, the  polyclinics\r\n\r\nand  the VWOs have increased by more than 34% in the last\r\n\r\nfour  years.   For  example, in FY 2000,  we  spent  $896\r\n\r\nmillion  in such subventions.   And this year, we  expect\r\n\r\nto spend $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan wonders whether it is wise for us to\r\n\r\nkeep  this  80% market share because this will result  in\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  to the Government, as he observed the  higher\r\n\r\nbudget  that the Ministry of Health is given  year  after\r\n\r\nyear.  His suggestion is to privatise the hospitals,  but\r\n\r\nI  notice the other Members are, in fact, asking for more\r\n\r\nC  class  wards and more B2 Class wards.  So, we have  to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance somehow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all of us know that financial resources\r\n\r\ngiven to healthcare cannot be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunlimited and, therefore, I hope Members will agree  with\r\n\r\nme  that  Singaporeans  who are able  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\nmedical  bills  should do so themselves,  or  with  their\r\n\r\nfamilies' help.  Then the resources that we have, we  can\r\n\r\ntarget  these  subsidies  at Singaporeans  who  are  most\r\n\r\ndeserving.   In  line  with  this  philosophy,  we   have\r\n\r\nselectively  implemented means testing  for  the  Primary\r\n\r\nCare  Partnership  Scheme (PCPS) and also  the  step-down\r\n\r\ncare  and  home  care services managed by  the  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, my Ministry will consider extending\r\n\r\nmeans   testing  gradually  and  selectively,   to   more\r\n\r\nhealthcare  services.   If there  are  proxy  methods  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  demand  and  target the services  to  the  more\r\n\r\ndeserving,  then  there is less need for  means  testing.\r\n\r\nBut  if our proxy methods are not effective, then I think\r\n\r\nwe  have to consider means testing, so that the subsidies\r\n\r\ncan  be more equitably distributed to those who are  more\r\n\r\ndeserving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members raised the situation in the specialist\r\n\r\noutpatient  clinics.   Dr Chong Weng  Chiew  and  several\r\n\r\nothers said that there are long queues and that it  could\r\n\r\nbe  abused  because  the  fees are  only  $21,  which  is\r\n\r\nsometimes  cheaper than a visit to the GP.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nknow that they can enjoy substantial Government subsidies\r\n\r\nsimply   by  obtaining  polyclinic  referrals.   So   the\r\n\r\npolyclinic  referrals,  as a proxy,  are  not  discerning\r\n\r\nenough  to  differentiate between those who are deserving\r\n\r\nand those who are not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means testing at the SOCs will make the distribution\r\n\r\nof  Government  subsidies  more  equitable  by  delinking\r\n\r\nsubsidies  from  the referral source.  It will  therefore\r\n\r\nenable us to redirect public healthcare resources and  do\r\n\r\nmore for the lower income.  But we will have to study the\r\n\r\nimplications of this and we will have to make  sure  that\r\n\r\nif  we  do implement means testing, that it achieves  the\r\n\r\npurpose set.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah is right that if you want to do means\r\n\r\ntesting, the criteria must be made clear.  And to us, the\r\n\r\nfairest and simplest criterion is per capita income.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with both Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong Seh\r\n\r\nHong that we need not run a single means test system.  It\r\n\r\nis  possible to vary the income cut-off, depending on the\r\n\r\ncost  of  service.   So, even though we have  implemented\r\n\r\nmeans  testing  in the step-down care sector,  previously\r\n\r\nthe  subsidy in the step-down care sector was a  standard\r\n\r\n50%.  When we introduced means testing, we provided three\r\n\r\ntiers   -  75%, 50% and 25%.  So, it went down very  well\r\n\r\non  the  ground.   But  it does not  mean  that  we  will\r\n\r\nnecessarily  use  this  same method  for  the  hospitals,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  hospitals today, Singaporeans already  enjoy\r\n\r\n80%  subsidy in C class wards, 65% subsidy in  B2  wards;\r\n\r\n50%  subsidy in the B2-plus wards and 20% subsidy in  the\r\n\r\nB1  wards.   So it is possible for us to vary the  income\r\n\r\ncut-off as well as the level of subsidy, depending on the\r\n\r\ncost of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third prong of our strategy is really getting\r\n\r\ndown to the brass tacks and managing cost increases.  How\r\n\r\ndo  we do so?  My Ministry plays the role of purchaser of\r\n\r\nhealthcare services on behalf of Singaporeans, especially\r\n\r\nthe  low  and middle income.  As a purchaser, I  wish  to\r\n\r\nreassure  Mr  Zainul Abidin, Mdm Halimah and  Mr  Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan  that  my  Ministry will ensure that  clusters  are\r\n\r\naccountable and that their interests are aligned with the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  goal  of providing good and affordable  basic\r\n\r\nhealthcare to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that performance\r\n\r\nmeasurement is necessary to do so.   And to this end, the\r\n\r\nMinistry has set out its requirements and expectations of\r\n\r\nthe  two  clusters in a service agreement with them.   We\r\n\r\nwill  review  the  service agreement  with  the  clusters\r\n\r\nperiodically to make sure that they abide by it and  that\r\n\r\nit  is  relevant and effective.  In addition, my Ministry\r\n\r\nprovides  the  strategic  oversight  on  overall   public\r\n\r\nhealthcare capabilities and facilities.  We want to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  on capabilities, we have in place  a  medical\r\n\r\ncapability   framework  to  ensure  that  there   is   no\r\n\r\nunnecessary duplication of the more specialised and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost costly services and facilities.  Such facilities and\r\n\r\nservices  are concentrated in the tertiary hospitals  and\r\n\r\nnational centres.  On facilities, the Ministry determines\r\n\r\nthe  number of beds and its distribution by ward  classes\r\n\r\nin  every public hospital to minimise over supply at  the\r\n\r\nnational  level.  Public hospitals also need to seek  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's   approval  before  they  can   expand   their\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a purchaser, my Ministry will also ensure that\r\n\r\nthe clusters provide quality care that is appropriate  to\r\n\r\nneeds  and  not  drive up healthcare costs unnecessarily,\r\n\r\neg,  the  example which Dr Lily Neo raised that they  use\r\n\r\nmore expensive stents when a cheaper one is adequate.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we have several mechanisms in place to prevent such\r\n\r\nthings from happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first mechanism is, of course, all healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals  are  bound to abide  by  their  respective\r\n\r\nethical   codes.   Breaching  the  code  could  lead   to\r\n\r\nhealthcare  professionals being  asked  to  defend  their\r\n\r\nactions and, ultimately, to face disciplinary proceedings\r\n\r\nfor professional misconduct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mechanism is that the Ministry regularly\r\n\r\nproduces  clinical practice guidelines, so as  to  assist\r\n\r\nhealthcare  practitioners to manage their patients  based\r\n\r\non the best available evidence to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Ministry also monitors key clinical,\r\n\r\nfinancial  and  other  operational indicators  so  as  to\r\n\r\ndetect   trends   and  outliers  that   deserve   further\r\n\r\ninvestigation  or  audit.  Let me just  use  the  example\r\n\r\nwhich Dr Chong Weng Chiew raised that the specialist  may\r\n\r\nask  patients to make extra follow-up visits beyond  what\r\n\r\nis  necessary.  We track this and our data over the  last\r\n\r\nthree years have shown that the ratio of re-attendance to\r\n\r\nfirst  visit is very stable.  It is between 3.6 and  3.8.\r\n\r\nSo there is no escalation in repeat visits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members like Dr Lily Neo and Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua also asked whether the remuneration structure for the\r\n\r\ndoctors in the public hospitals is properly set,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  as  not to create the wrong incentives.  This is  so.\r\n\r\nWe make sure that the doctors pay equal attention to both\r\n\r\nprivate  and  subsidised  patients.   Their  remuneration\r\n\r\ntakes  into  account several factors, of  which  clinical\r\n\r\nservice load of the doctor is only one of them.   I  also\r\n\r\nwant  to  assure Members that the clinical  service  load\r\n\r\nincludes both private and subsidised patients seen by the\r\n\r\ndoctors.   So  the public sector doctors do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nfinancial incentive to order more expensive tests, drugs,\r\n\r\nor  stents, because they do not personally get a cut from\r\n\r\nthese  items.  The revenue from these items goes  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital.  And at the hospital level, my Ministry has put\r\n\r\nin  place  a  revenue cap framework to  discourage  over-servicing.   Under  this framework, excess  revenue  that\r\n\r\nexceeds  a pre-determined cap will not be allowed  to  be\r\n\r\nretained  by  the hospitals.  So there is less  incentive\r\n\r\nfor over-servicing and over-pricing.  What this means  is\r\n\r\nthat,  every  year,  we  do not allow  the  hospitals  to\r\n\r\nincrease costs beyond a certain limit.  So if they charge\r\n\r\nmore, they do not keep the money.  The money goes back to\r\n\r\nthe Government which will then reuse it for subsidies for\r\n\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the purchaser, my Ministry will ensure that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  get  the best value  for  money  for  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare services.  My Ministry is not obliged  to  buy\r\n\r\nonly  from  the  public sector restructured institutions.\r\n\r\nDr  Ong Seh Hong and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua have suggested, and\r\n\r\nI  think several others as well, that the Government  buy\r\n\r\nservices from the private sector as well.  I am  open  to\r\n\r\nthis  option.  If the private sector can offer lower cost\r\n\r\nwith  the  same or better quality in service, my Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  consider contracting the service from them once  we\r\n\r\nput  the  proper framework in place.  For example,  under\r\n\r\nthe PCPS, the Government engages private GPs and dentists\r\n\r\nto  provide outpatient medical and dental services to the\r\n\r\nneedy  elderly.  The patients pay polyclinic charges  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  provides a subsidy to the  participating\r\n\r\nGPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also put in place a similar\r\n\r\nframework for the step-down care\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector.    This  framework  will  include   means   test,\r\n\r\naccredited  private sector facilities,  properly  audited\r\n\r\nnorm  cost  and revenue caps.  So the accredited  private\r\n\r\nsector  nursing homes will be able to take in  subsidised\r\n\r\npatients as of 1st April this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many Members have raised this whole issue\r\n\r\nabout  healthcare  cost.  Dr Lily  Neo  and  Mdm  Halimah\r\n\r\nsuggested  a  watchdog body to monitor  healthcare  cost.\r\n\r\nLet  me just say that controlling and managing healthcare\r\n\r\ncost  is a job for all of us.  It is not the job  of  MOH\r\n\r\nalone,  although, as I have outlined earlier, we  have  a\r\n\r\nvery  comprehensive scheme in place.  The individual  and\r\n\r\nhis  family  must also take the effort to understand  the\r\n\r\ncost implications of their choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew suggested that we do public\r\n\r\neducation  and  counselling  to  make  sure  that  people\r\n\r\nunderstand what is the cost implication of their choices.\r\n\r\nWe  have done this.  If anything else, we err on the safe\r\n\r\nside.   We  counsel them and many of them  then  take  up\r\n\r\nclass  B2  or C.  And this is part of the reason  why  we\r\n\r\nhave  an  over  demand  for these subsidised  wards.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  over time, as the medical insurance  component\r\n\r\nincreases, I hope that the insurance companies will  also\r\n\r\nbuild   up   the  competence  and  interest  to   control\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, over the next 10 minutes, cover the\r\n\r\nother  specific issues which have not been covered in  my\r\n\r\nreply so far.  Let me take it systematically.  First,  in\r\n\r\nthe  primary  care sector, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked  about\r\n\r\nnight  clinics.   We have night clinic  services  now  in\r\n\r\nseven polyclinics.  The reason why we introduced it is to\r\n\r\nmake  it  much more convenient for Singaporeans  to  seek\r\n\r\ncare  at  night, instead of having to wait till the  next\r\n\r\nday.    As   these   night  clinics  are  popular   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  my Ministry plans to extend night  clinics\r\n\r\nto five more polyclinics this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about our plans for development of\r\n\r\nnew  polyclinics.  As we have announced earlier, we  plan\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndevelop new polyclinics in Sengkang, Jurong West and also\r\n\r\nto redevelop Queenstown Polyclinic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked about the Primary Care\r\n\r\nPartnership  Scheme (PCPS).  I thank  Members  for  their\r\n\r\nfavourable comments on PCPS.  We agree that the scheme is\r\n\r\nworking  well.  But we really need to reach out  to  more\r\n\r\nelderly  to make sure they sign on under PCPS.   Dr  Lily\r\n\r\nNeo said that, today, we have probably achieved less than\r\n\r\n50%  of  those who are eligible.  I agree with  her.   We\r\n\r\nshould  work  harder so that we could reach out  to  more\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, some 6,200 elderly are participating in PCPS.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   who   are  on  public   assistance,   are\r\n\r\nautomatically  eligible  regardless  of  their  age.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry,    together    with   the    other    community\r\n\r\norganisations,  like CDCs and VWOs, has started  a  joint\r\n\r\nprogramme  to promote subscription to PCPS and the  IDAPE\r\n\r\nscheme.   Voluntary organisations, like the Home  Nursing\r\n\r\nFoundation, are doing a lot of promotion and I would also\r\n\r\nlike to encourage Members, when they do block visits,  to\r\n\r\nhelp us distribute these brochures to get more elderly to\r\n\r\nsign on the PCPS scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo suggested that we extend PCPS to chronic\r\n\r\ncare.  Mr Gan Kim Yong also wanted PCPS to be extended to\r\n\r\nthe  handicapped, the other low income group, as well  as\r\n\r\npeople   with   chronic  diseases.   These   are   worthy\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and we will consider possible extensions  of\r\n\r\nPCPS  later.  Because right now, our priority must be  to\r\n\r\nreach  out  to all the elderly who are eligible  but  who\r\n\r\nstill have not signed on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to the hospital sector. Mr Nithiah\r\n\r\nNandan  wants  to  know if more class  C  beds  would  be\r\n\r\ncreated  in the tertiary hospitals.  The answer  is  yes.\r\n\r\nDr  Lily Neo wanted to know whether we are deploying more\r\n\r\ndoctors and nurses to areas where there is an increase in\r\n\r\ndemand.   The answer is also yes.  NUH will increase  its\r\n\r\nnumber of class C beds from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n56  to  160  beds, an increase of 104 beds by April  this\r\n\r\nyear.  And SGH will increase its class C beds from 134 to\r\n\r\n214 beds, an increase of 80 beds by September this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that any patient who requests\r\n\r\nfor subsidised beds in a particular class ward and if the\r\n\r\nclass ward is already full, he will be lodged in a higher\r\n\r\nclass ward temporarily.  But he will continue to pay only\r\n\r\nthe subsidised rates of the class ward of his choice.  So\r\n\r\neven  though  we may not have renovated the  class  C  or\r\n\r\nclass  B2  wards to meet the demand, anybody who requests\r\n\r\nfor  such  a subsidised ward, if it is already  full,  we\r\n\r\nwill temporarily lodge him in a higher class ward but  he\r\n\r\npays  the  rates  of  the subsidised  ward  that  he  has\r\n\r\nrequested  for.   When the bed is available, we  transfer\r\n\r\nhim  back  to B2 or C class ward.  So he is not penalised\r\n\r\nin  any way if there are temporary shortages in the B2 or\r\n\r\nC class wards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members also raised about the difficulty of\r\n\r\nspecialist  outpatient clinic patients  who,  because  of\r\n\r\nchanges  in  their financial situation, may  request  for\r\n\r\ndowngrading.  I assure Members that, if indeed  they  are\r\n\r\nin genuine financial difficulties, please raise them with\r\n\r\nthe  medical  social workers and they will take  care  of\r\n\r\nthem,  and if they do qualify, they will provide Medifund\r\n\r\nsupport for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock wants to know whether the\r\n\r\nspecialist outpatient patients can request to break  down\r\n\r\ntheir   prescriptions   or   medications   into   smaller\r\n\r\nallocations so that they do not have to pay three months'\r\n\r\nworth  of medication at one go.  In general, I would  not\r\n\r\nwant to interfere with the doctor's judgement of how much\r\n\r\nprescription  is needed.  But I would like to  assure  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Cheng Bock that indeed if a patient tells his doctor\r\n\r\nthat he cannot afford it and he prefers a shorter period,\r\n\r\nsay,  two weeks, as Dr Tan Cheng Bock suggested, I  think\r\n\r\nthe doctor will accede to his request.  But as a rule,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think the Ministry wants to impose the rule  that\r\n\r\ndoctors  should only prescribe two weeks first,  and  not\r\n\r\nthree  months.   I  think we have  to  leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\nprofessional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njudgement  of the doctor.  If he prescribes too  short  a\r\n\r\nperiod, then we will be forcing the patient to make  more\r\n\r\nreturn  visits to SOC or to the pharmacy.  If  indeed  he\r\n\r\nfaces  financial problems, please do talk to his  doctor.\r\n\r\nHe or she is there for him to talk to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the whole issue about the way we\r\n\r\norganise  the  clusters, whether we should  have  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  and how we should encourage competition.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  jury is still out.  Some can argue that if you  have\r\n\r\nmore  competition, you bring healthcare cost down.  Other\r\n\r\nMembers have made out an equally cogent case to say  that\r\n\r\ncompetition  means the clusters try very  hard  and  they\r\n\r\ninduce demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, today, we have decided to have two\r\n\r\nclusters.   Why?  Because we want to make  sure  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  full,  integrated service and that the  services\r\n\r\nprovided  to Singaporeans are seamless between  different\r\n\r\nlevels  of institutions, whether it is from the  national\r\n\r\ncentres  to  the  tertiary  hospitals,  to  the  regional\r\n\r\ngeneral  hospitals  or  to the polyclinics.   Because  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that integrated care is the most cost  effective\r\n\r\nsetting.  If you have an integrated care, the doctor  can\r\n\r\nassign  the  right level of care commensurate  with  your\r\n\r\nmedical  condition.  If your condition is not so serious,\r\n\r\nhe  can  assign  you to the polyclinic.  If  it  is  more\r\n\r\nserious, he can assign you to SOC.  Or if it is even more\r\n\r\nserious, he can assign you to the tertiary centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise duplication, we make sure that the more\r\n\r\nspecialised   services  are  located  in   the   tertiary\r\n\r\nhospitals  and the national centres so that the  regional\r\n\r\ngeneral  hospitals focus on the management of the  common\r\n\r\nmedical conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew suggested that we keep the two\r\n\r\nclusters to only doing the frills and we set up  a  third\r\n\r\ncluster  to focus on the top-end medical treatment.   Let\r\n\r\nus try out the two clusters system first.  If we create a\r\n\r\nthird  cluster,  I think there will be a lot  of  unhappy\r\n\r\ncomparison between what is available in the third cluster\r\n\r\ncompared to the other two clusters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a likely discussion about what we\r\n\r\nshould  do with the ERC's recommendation on the  regional\r\n\r\nmedical hub.  Our position is that we will encourage  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector health institutions, facilitated  by  the\r\n\r\neconomic agencies, such as the EDB, IE Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Toursim Board, to spearhead this effort.   The\r\n\r\npublic  sector healthcare institutions will play  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  role to support these efforts,  especially  in\r\n\r\nthe area of training and research.  But the main focus of\r\n\r\nthe  public  healthcare institutions must be  to  provide\r\n\r\ngood  and affordable healthcare to Singaporeans,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1993 White Paper on Affordable Healthcare, we\r\n\r\nstipulated  that  no public sector hospital  should  have\r\n\r\nmore  than 13% Class A beds to serve private and  foreign\r\n\r\npatients.   In  that White Paper, we also envisaged  that\r\n\r\nthe  overall private sector market share would grow  from\r\n\r\n20%  to  30%.   I  believe  these  guidelines  are  still\r\n\r\nrelevant today and my Ministry would continue to  support\r\n\r\nthe   private  sector  institutions  in  achieving  these\r\n\r\nguidelines.  And we will ensure that the public hospitals\r\n\r\nremain  focused on their role to service the majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to two other issues. Dr Michael Lim has\r\n\r\nspoken  on  HSA's  role.  We need  to  strike  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween regulating medical devices so that they are safe.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time,  we do not want to  impose  so  much\r\n\r\nregulation that they incur cost.  I assure Dr Michael Lim\r\n\r\nthat  HSA's  regulatory  requirements  would  be  closely\r\n\r\naligned   with  those  set  out  like  their  counterpart\r\n\r\nregulatory agencies in the USA, EU, Canada and Australia.\r\n\r\nWe  will  keep ourselves in line and we will not be  more\r\n\r\nstringent  than them.  More importantly,  HSA  will  have\r\n\r\nregular  meetings, every six monthly,  with  the  medical\r\n\r\ndevice  industry to obtain industry feedback.   So  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  HSA  will  get  in touch with Dr  Michael  Lim  and\r\n\r\nencourage him to bring up the specific instances where we\r\n\r\nhave  over  regulated,  and we will  evaluate  the  cases\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about the precautions taken for\r\n\r\nSARS and how we are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprotecting our healthcare providers.  As Members may have\r\n\r\nread  in the newspapers this is a worldwide problem.   We\r\n\r\nsuspect  the  cases could have emanated  from  Guangdong,\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and  Hanoi.  That is why we have  set  out  a\r\n\r\ntravel  advisory, advising Singaporeans not to travel  to\r\n\r\nthese places, unless it is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we have 23 reported cases, 21 in the\r\n\r\nhospitals and two have been discharged.  All these  cases\r\n\r\nstemmed from three index cases, ie, three original source\r\n\r\ncases,  and  then they spread to the others.   They  have\r\n\r\nspread  to eight healthcare workers and 12 family members\r\n\r\nand friends.  So, if we are able to contain the situation\r\n\r\nby  not allowing it to spread further, over time, we will\r\n\r\nfind  fewer  and fewer cases, and the situation  will  be\r\n\r\ncompletely  under  control.  But if Singaporeans  travel,\r\n\r\nget   infected  overseas,  come  back  and  infect  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  then I am afraid the cycle will  continue.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  reason why we made it a  point  to  advise\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to avoid travelling to these three  places,\r\n\r\nunless absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through these difficulties before. A\r\n\r\nfew years ago, we had an outbreak of the Nipah virus.  In\r\n\r\nthat  situation, fortunately for us, we were able to  cut\r\n\r\noff further infection by not allowing pigs to be imported\r\n\r\ninto   Singapore.   Therefore,  by  cutting  off  further\r\n\r\ninfection,  we  were  able  to control  and  contain  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  In the SARS case, the infection is brought in\r\n\r\nby  humans.  So, unless we encourage Singaporeans not  to\r\n\r\ntravel  and  avoid being infected overseas,  we  have  no\r\n\r\neffective means to stop the chain reaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let me emphasise, please avoid these places,\r\n\r\nunless  absolutely  necessary.   We  are  monitoring  the\r\n\r\nsituation  very  carefully together with  our  regulatory\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in Hong Kong.  We have got assistance  from\r\n\r\nWHO and from the CDC in the US.  So far, things are under\r\n\r\ncontrol.   It will require us another 10 to 14 days,  ie,\r\n\r\ntwo more incubation cycles, before we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan declare it all-clear, if all things go well.  But  if\r\n\r\nthere are additional infections, then I am afraid we will\r\n\r\nhave to continue with the current measures.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.05 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the healthcare workers, I must say I am very\r\n\r\nproud    of    them.    They   have   discharged    their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  admirably, taken all  the  precautions,\r\n\r\neven  though  eight of them have been  infected.   I  can\r\n\r\nassure Members that we will spare no efforts to make sure\r\n\r\nthat they are well looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed out one point about cost management, ie,\r\n\r\njust  to  emphasise that the cost that  we  set  for  the\r\n\r\nhospitals   is  not  on  a  cost-recovery   basis.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  provides the norm cost,  and  we  expect  the\r\n\r\nhospitals to manage their cost within that level.  So, it\r\n\r\nis  very  similar  to  your  price-minus  proposal.   The\r\n\r\nhospitals  are not allowed to incur cost and then  expect\r\n\r\nthe  Government to pay for all cost increases.   This  is\r\n\r\npart of the discipline of managing cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to Mr Chandra Mohan who described SGH as\r\n\r\na  5-star hotel, I am very flattered.  I am sure the  SGH\r\n\r\nwould be very flattered.  SGH was built 20 years ago and,\r\n\r\nif  it  leaves the impression that it is a 5-star  hotel,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think it is doing a good job in maintaining  the\r\n\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I want to clarify that I did not\r\n\r\nmention  anything on stents or the price of stents  which\r\n\r\nthe Minister gave the answer to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my cut on doctors, in June last year, strict\r\n\r\nnew  limits on work hours for American medical  residents\r\n\r\nwere  imposed by the American Accreditation  Council  for\r\n\r\nGraduate  Medical Education.  It said that up to 120-hour\r\n\r\nwork-weeks  were  harmful  to  young  doctors  and  could\r\n\r\nendanger  patient care.  In America, thousands of  people\r\n\r\ndie annually from medical mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new rules, the normal resident work-week\r\n\r\nwould be limited to 80 hours.  The standards also imposed\r\n\r\nmandatory  rest periods of 10 hours between  shifts,  one\r\n\r\nday  a  week off, restrictions on moonlighting, and close\r\n\r\nfaculty supervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the Straits Times four months ago\r\n\r\nthat junior doctors here work on a 34-hour shift.  May  I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister if such long shifts are not  affecting\r\n\r\ntheir  concentration and standard of patient  care?   Are\r\n\r\nour junior doctors not subjected to long, unhealthy work-weeks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morale has been low among junior doctors for many\r\n\r\nyears.  Lately, there had been another issue contributing\r\n\r\nto  this.  It seems that there was favoured-treatment  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean medical graduates from overseas, as  compared\r\n\r\nto  locally-graduated doctors serving under bonds.  Could\r\n\r\nthe Minister enlighten us on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to pay attention to the\r\n\r\ntraining  of our junior doctors to ensure the  competency\r\n\r\nof future generations of our healthcare providers.  May I\r\n\r\nask the Minister for Health what steps have been taken to\r\n\r\nensure this?  May I also ask whether our hospital doctors\r\n\r\nare too preoccupied with daily routines that require them\r\n\r\nto  manage  maximal  numbers of patients  and  leave  the\r\n\r\nseniors with little or no time to teach the juniors  who,\r\n\r\nin turn, have no time to be trained?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nand  the Ministry of Manpower have launched the Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower  Conversion Programme for the healthcare  sector\r\n\r\nrecently.

It also provides an on-the-job wage  support\r\n\r\nto  sponsoring institutions that hire these  individuals.\r\n\r\nI  must  take  this  opportunity to  compliment  the  two\r\n\r\nMinistries,  as  this is indeed a good programme  and  it\r\n\r\nbrings relief to our current employment status.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTimes are bad.  Encouraging individuals to re-skill  into\r\n\r\na  sector  that is critically understaffed is  definitely\r\n\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must say that we are spending a lot of\r\n\r\nresources  and effort on this programme.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nimperative that we do not spend all this money,  only  to\r\n\r\nlose   the  individuals  once  they  are  fully   trained\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  I would urge the Minister to put in place\r\n\r\na  clear  career  path  for  these  individuals,  with  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  compensation plan, so that the  trainees  do\r\n\r\nnot  take  this  as  a  stop-gap measure  and  leave  the\r\n\r\nindustry the moment the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the competition for healthcare staff in the\r\n\r\nglobal arena is very competitive.  We need to be vigilant\r\n\r\nto  guard  this  pool  of manpower  resources  jealously.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  other  countries  would  draw  away  our  new\r\n\r\nnursing talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, if one were to visit\r\n\r\nour  local  hospitals,  especially when  approaching  the\r\n\r\nnurses' station, one sometimes wonder whether one was  in\r\n\r\nManila!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds us how short we are in terms of our\r\n\r\nlocal  nurses.   Indeed, there is a  shortage  of  nurses\r\n\r\nworldwide.  Just as our nurses are sought after from  all\r\n\r\nover the world, including the Middle East and the UK,  we\r\n\r\ntoo  open our hospitals to foreign nurses.  I believe  we\r\n\r\nhave  employed  nurses from various countries,  including\r\n\r\nChina and the Philippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which other countries do we have nurses from? What\r\n\r\nwas  the  experience like with these  foreign  nurses  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  quality  of  their  professional  nursing\r\n\r\nskills?  Are there plans to open the door to nurses  from\r\n\r\nother countries too?  In addition, Sir, what is MOH doing\r\n\r\nto attract and train more local nurses?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, the nursing profession is\r\n\r\nthe  backbone of the medical industry.  There is no doubt\r\n\r\nabout  it.  In meeting the manpower requirements  of  our\r\n\r\nnursing  profession,  we spare no efforts  in  recruiting\r\n\r\nnurses,  both locally and from abroad.  In fact, we  have\r\n\r\nnurses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom the Philippines, India, China and elsewhere.  At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  foreign  nurses form about 25%  of  our  nursing\r\n\r\nworkforce.  There are more than 4,000 foreign  nurses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recruited them, we similarly spare no efforts\r\n\r\nin  training and orientating our foreign nurses to enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  perform  according to the way nursing  care  is\r\n\r\nadministered here.  We have also given due recognition to\r\n\r\nour  foreign nurses' professional qualifications and  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  their contribution through  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  upgrading and career advancement.  Yet, in spite  of\r\n\r\nall  these, many of these foreign nurses do not  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  long.  Some stay in their jobs  for  only\r\n\r\nbetween six months and two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global competition for professional nurses is\r\n\r\nhot, and definitely getting hotter.  For instance, the UK\r\n\r\nmade  no  bones  about their shortage of  nurses.   Until\r\n\r\nrecently,   they  have  gone  on  aggressive  recruitment\r\n\r\ncampaigns in some of our sources of foreign nurses,  such\r\n\r\nas  the Philippines as well as China.  The campaigns also\r\n\r\ninclude  Singapore, where they advertised in our  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes to recruit our nurses.  Attractive carrots, such as\r\n\r\noffers up to treble their salaries, free flights,  and  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  see another part of the world, were  used  to\r\n\r\nentice them to work in Britain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are up against fierce competition and need\r\n\r\nstronger  measures to retain our foreign nursing  talent.\r\n\r\nMany  of  my  colleagues in the healthcare  industry  are\r\n\r\nlamenting  the  short-term nature of our foreign  nursing\r\n\r\nprofession here, after investing vast resources on  them.\r\n\r\nThe  people who join the nursing profession do so because\r\n\r\nthey are driven by more than just the will to serve,  and\r\n\r\ndefinitely  less  by the motivation of money.   I  simply\r\n\r\nrefuse to believe that having being here they would leave\r\n\r\nfor  other  destinations by the pure motivation  of  more\r\n\r\nmoney.    The   slogan  of  the  nursing  profession   is\r\n\r\ndefinitely not the quest for more money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we need to look at other areas on how we can\r\n\r\ndo more to retain these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign nurses in Singapore.  Have we done enough to make\r\n\r\nthem feel at home?  We need to treat them not so much  as\r\n\r\ncommodities  but as human resources.  If  we  treat  them\r\n\r\nlike  commodities, they will behave like one and  go  off\r\n\r\nthe  moment  their  contract is up.   Thus,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide   for   their  welfare,  especially  recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities  outside their work, and their  commitment  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We need to do more to make them really  feel\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is also part of them.  I therefore  hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health could show leadership on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lily Neo, you can take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, 99 patients, or 11%, of the 924\r\n\r\npatients admitted to St Luke's Community Hospital in 2000\r\n\r\nhad  to be re-admitted to a general acute hospital within\r\n\r\none week.  Fifteen died after their return.  Another four\r\n\r\ndied  before re-admission.  These deaths were  attributed\r\n\r\nto  early  discharge  of  unstable  patients  from  acute\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  St  Luke's  Community  Hospital.   It  was\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the medical problems these  patients  had\r\n\r\nwere  not  adequately worked out before  their  discharge\r\n\r\nfrom the acute hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our community hospitals cannot and should not\r\n\r\nbe expected to provide the level of care available in the\r\n\r\nacute  hospitals  and, therefore, there  should  be  more\r\n\r\ncaution  on  discharging patients.  Has the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  done any surveys on this?  What has the  Ministry\r\n\r\ndone  to improve this situation?  With casemix in  force,\r\n\r\nwhen hospitals are reimbursed on the diagnosis of medical\r\n\r\nconditions of patients and not on the length of stay, are\r\n\r\ndoctors under pressure to discharge patients even earlier\r\n\r\nand, thus, exacerbating this problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, patients in the subsidised wards in the public\r\n\r\nhospitals  now  have to pay full price once  the  doctors\r\n\r\ncertify  them  as  ready  to  be  discharged.   But  many\r\n\r\npatients,  especially the older ones, may still  consider\r\n\r\nthemselves as not fit to be discharged, and also may  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to leave the hospitals for various reasons.  Are\r\n\r\nthey not penalised unduly?  With\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncasemix,  will there be more patients subjected  to  this\r\n\r\ntype of discharge?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my next cut on nursing homes, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health has introduced means-testing to decide on  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  to be given to patients in nursing homes,  based\r\n\r\non  a person's per capita family income.  In other words,\r\n\r\nthis  means-testing is based on the total income of older\r\n\r\nfamily  members divided by the number of members  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThis means-testing is thus unfavourable to small families\r\n\r\nand  will  be felt by even more people in time  to  come,\r\n\r\nbecause the trend has been tending towards smaller  units\r\n\r\nof  families.   Often  times,  it  is  difficult  to  get\r\n\r\ninformation on income from all the members of  a  family,\r\n\r\nand  many  elderly fail to get subsidy because  of  this.\r\n\r\nOther times, family members of applicants are not willing\r\n\r\nor  unable  to  submit their documents for a  variety  of\r\n\r\nreasons,   such   as  confidentiality  or   self-employed\r\n\r\nsituations.  Would the Ministry of Health further  refine\r\n\r\nthis method of subsidy in view of these factors?\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidies are only given to those with less than\r\n\r\n$1,000  per  capita family income. Would the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth raise this cut-off point so that more elderly  can\r\n\r\nqualify?   May  I  also  ask  whether  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ncentralised  government-run  \"means-testing\"  agency   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate and expedite applications and services?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Jennifer Lee, please take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> It has been over three years since\r\n\r\nthe  report  of  the  IMC  on the  Aging  Population  was\r\n\r\npublished  in  November 1999.  One major area  identified\r\n\r\nwas  for attention to be paid to healthcare needs of  the\r\n\r\nelderly.    In the period, since the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nhas   moved  many  initiatives  and  programmes  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  I  would  like  to ask  the  Minister  for  his\r\n\r\nassessment  and  satisfaction with the progress  made  so\r\n\r\nfar,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   to   put   forward  a  few  suggestions   for   his\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like his observation with\r\n\r\nregard to the following components in the delivery of  an\r\n\r\nintegrated healthcare service to elderly Singaporeans:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The roles of GPs in the system;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The role of VWOs in the private sector in the\r\n\r\nprovision of residential care;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Raising standards of care and service of\r\n\r\nproviders; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Assessing subsidies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the GPs, I know that the Minister has\r\n\r\nalready responded to earlier speakers on the PCPS.  I  do\r\n\r\nhave  one  additional point to make on the subject.   The\r\n\r\nMinister has said that extending the reach of the PCPS is\r\n\r\nthe current priority.  However, I believe that there is a\r\n\r\nneed  to  enrol both senior citizens as well as  sign  up\r\n\r\nmore GPs into the scheme.  Dr Lily Neo has spoken of  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  management  by  the  GPs   of   chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses and this may be a reason why some GPs have  not\r\n\r\nsigned  up. If there is a concern that GPs are not  quite\r\n\r\nup  to the job, should we not be looking to upgrading the\r\n\r\nskills  and competence of the GPs since they form a  wide\r\n\r\nnetwork?   Indeed, the intent captured in the 1992  White\r\n\r\nPaper  was that 80% of primary care is to be provided  by\r\n\r\nGPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry had invested in a grant with the\r\n\r\nCollege  of  Family Practitioners in 1999 to develop  the\r\n\r\nGraduate   Diploma  in  Family  Medicine   (GDFM).   That\r\n\r\ninvestment   has   yielded   good   results,   with   GPs\r\n\r\ndemonstrating  that they are keen to upgrade  and  indeed\r\n\r\nwilling to invest in their own development. Three batches\r\n\r\nof  GPs have since signed up for the two-year course. The\r\n\r\nfirst  batch  of  40 had graduated and the  latest  batch\r\n\r\nnumbers  70.   These  GPs pay their  own  fees  of  about\r\n\r\n$3,600. Why not take the route to widen the scope of  the\r\n\r\nPCPS, and tie it into the GDFM qualification? It would be\r\n\r\na win-win situation for all involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provision of residential care,\r\n\r\nMOH  has  set  aside  17 parcels of land  for  commercial\r\n\r\nnursing homes to encourage the development of the private\r\n\r\nsector.  What is the Minister's level of satisfaction  on\r\n\r\nhow  this is progressing?  Three parcels of land had been\r\n\r\nawarded.   What  have  the outcomes  been?  What  is  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  thinking  regarding VWOs versus  private  sector\r\n\r\nprovision  of residential care services for the  elderly?\r\n\r\nIf the intent is to promote private sector participation,\r\n\r\nI  believe that we must set the parameters so that we  do\r\n\r\nnot  end  up  with  developers jumping  into  the  arena,\r\n\r\nthinking  there  is an opportunity for a  property  play.\r\n\r\nOne hears the usual private sector feedback that they are\r\n\r\nsomewhat squeezed between competing with the restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  for  staff and in this sector, competing  with\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs whose capital costs are highly subsidised.  The\r\n\r\nresult  may  be a tendency to warehousing, to squeeze  as\r\n\r\nmany  batches as possible out of each project  with  less\r\n\r\nthan satisfactory standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to standards of care, I expect that,\r\n\r\nwith  notable  exceptions of course, there  is  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement in this area. The question is how to  achieve\r\n\r\nthis.   Currently, many VWOs, while having  the  best  of\r\n\r\nintentions,  say that their efforts are compromised  with\r\n\r\nthe  constant concern regarding finding adequate  funding\r\n\r\nfor their activities, despite Government subsidies.  Norm\r\n\r\ncosts  that  are  calculated based on  current  level  of\r\n\r\nactivity and standards will likely be too low and tie the\r\n\r\nVWOs into a vicious cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, might we want to consider putting in place a two-tiered level of norm cost, with the top set at a very\r\n\r\ngenerous  level  but tied in rigorously  to  professional\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  stringent requirements on  standards  of\r\n\r\ncare while the bottom level can stay at current norms?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regarding assessing of funding and\r\n\r\nsubsidies, most of my points have already been  taken  up\r\n\r\nby Dr Lily Neo. The only other point I wanted to bring up\r\n\r\nwas that, as the patient navigates through\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvarious parts of the system, from outpatient and day-care\r\n\r\nto  residential care and home care, the process of means-testing  is  sometimes  repeated  over  and  over  again,\r\n\r\nbecause  each provider requires slightly different  items\r\n\r\nof  information based on their estimation  of  what  they\r\n\r\nsubsequently  need to satisfy an MOH auditor.   Might  it\r\n\r\nnot be a good idea for the Ministry to specify a standard\r\n\r\nset  of assessment criteria since all the subsidies  that\r\n\r\nmay  be  disbursed  through it,  and  if  some  are  also\r\n\r\ndisbursed  through  MCDS, then to engage  MCDS  into  the\r\n\r\npicture,  so  that  we can do the processing  only  once?\r\n\r\nThese are for the Minister's consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second cut, Sir, may I declare at this point\r\n\r\nthat I sit on the Board of the Tsao Foundation which is a\r\n\r\nnot-for-profit organisation providing home healthcare for\r\n\r\nthe needy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2002, MOH implemented subsidy for home\r\n\r\ncare  providers.   This  was a  significant  step  as  it\r\n\r\nsignalled the importance that the Ministry puts  on  home\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and  the  funding is much  appreciated.   The\r\n\r\nsubsidy provided is subject to means-testing and is  tied\r\n\r\nto  a   norm cost of $120 per doctor visit for up to  two\r\n\r\nvisits  per  month and $55 per nurse visit, up  to  eight\r\n\r\nvisits   per   month.   This  approach   of   per   visit\r\n\r\nreimbursement  in  home care is  not  ideal  in  that  it\r\n\r\nperversely encourages providers to be less efficient  and\r\n\r\nmake more frequent visits. This is even more so when  the\r\n\r\nnorm  cost of both doctor and nurse visits based on  Tsao\r\n\r\nFoundation  experience is low on a per visit  basis,  but\r\n\r\npotentially  very generous on a yearly  basis.   You  can\r\n\r\nclaim  up  to  $2,880 for doctors and $5,280 for  nurses,\r\n\r\nadding up to a total of $8,160 per annum. So there  is  a\r\n\r\ntendency  to  encourage them to make more visits,  rather\r\n\r\nthan   just  what  is  necessary.   Might  the   Ministry\r\n\r\ntherefore  wish to consider reimbursement based  on  care\r\n\r\nover  a specified period, say, monthly, rather than on  a\r\n\r\nper visit basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has responded to Dr Chong Weng Chiew\r\n\r\nregarding  the  use of Medisave for home  healthcare.   I\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  to  pick  up on the Minister's point regarding  the\r\n\r\npossibility, indeed, I believe the likelihood, that  good\r\n\r\nhome  healthcare  will  reduce  in-patient  episodes.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  a  comprehensive study  and  cost  benefit\r\n\r\nanalysis  into the cost of keeping elderly patients  well\r\n\r\ncared  for in the home environment, compared to the  cost\r\n\r\nthat  is  incurred  the  moment a  patient  needs  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted to a general hospital for acute episodes  of  an\r\n\r\nillness, a community hospital for rehabilitative care  or\r\n\r\na  nursing home, will be most helpful to the Ministry, as\r\n\r\nthe trade-offs and balances in setting long-term policies\r\n\r\nand  decide on resource allocation for many services  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly  that need to be established and  developed,\r\n\r\nincluding  the issues of level of norm cost and subsidies\r\n\r\nand use of Medisave.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Sir, at the moment, the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Health  is  organising  step-down   health\r\n\r\nservices  for  the elderly around three  zones,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nwest,  central  and  east.  Each zone  will  be  anchored\r\n\r\naround   an   acute  regional  hospital  with   geriatric\r\n\r\ndepartment, for example, Changi General Hospital  in  the\r\n\r\neast, Tan Tock Seng in the central zone, and Alexandra in\r\n\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the needs of the elderly change over time, with\r\n\r\nsome  having disabilities that require extended care  and\r\n\r\nstep-down facilities, may I ask the Minister what are the\r\n\r\nfuture  plans  the Health Ministry has in healthcare  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly?

In fact, over time, all of us will be  part  of\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that in the Minister's reply to\r\n\r\nmy earlier question the Ministry has been working closely\r\n\r\nwith the operators to ascertain the reasons for the lower\r\n\r\nthan  expected take-up rate and it will review the scheme\r\n\r\nat the appropriate time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthree  specific  areas in reviewing  this  scheme.  These\r\n\r\nareas  arose  from  a  survey that I  have  conducted  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  some  students  from  the  university.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the  premium.  Many  residents  feel  that  the\r\n\r\npremium is too high. Some feel that they could not afford\r\n\r\nit,  especially  those who are already  affected  by  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis. As a new scheme, I understand that it is\r\n\r\nnot  easy to determine what premiums will be appropriate.\r\n\r\nHowever,  after  we  have gained some experience  in  the\r\n\r\nclaim  patterns,  I hope the Ministry  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nreview the premiums.  It may even be possible to consider\r\n\r\na  rebate  system  to return some of the surpluses  after\r\n\r\nproviding for reasonable profits for the operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the qualifying criteria may need to be\r\n\r\nrelaxed. The second most common complaint is against the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstringent   criteria   to   qualify   for   the    claim.\r\n\r\nPsychologically, it is difficult for a person to  imagine\r\n\r\na  situation where he or she cannot perform three of  the\r\n\r\nsix daily routines.  If it occurs, there is a good chance\r\n\r\nthat  the person might have many other problems to  worry\r\n\r\nabout.    Then,  the  amount  of  the  payout  from   the\r\n\r\nElderShield  will be of no comfort to him.   It  will  be\r\n\r\nmore meaningful and more attractive if a lower degree  of\r\n\r\ndisability  is  adopted,  perhaps,  different  levels  of\r\n\r\npayout can be given to different degrees of disability so\r\n\r\nthat it is not an all-or-nothing situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a higher payout will make the scheme more\r\n\r\nattractive.  One of the key attractions of any  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme  is  to  have  peace of mind.  Therefore,  a  half\r\n\r\nsolution  sometimes  is no solution  at  all.   Yes,  the\r\n\r\npayout will be helpful somehow but it is not designed  to\r\n\r\nprovide  full financial support.  It therefore  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  the  much needed peace of mind.  If  the  payout\r\n\r\ncannot be increased without increasing the premium,  then\r\n\r\nwe  can consider an add-on scheme with higher payout  and\r\n\r\nhigher premium for those who really want to have complete\r\n\r\npeace of mind and can afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ElderShield provides a much needed safety net,\r\n\r\nespecially for the lower income families.  It is of grave\r\n\r\nconcern  that many of the lower income Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nopted  out of the scheme.  I hope that the Ministry  will\r\n\r\nreview  the  scheme as soon as practicable with  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  adjustments so that, hopefully, fewer people  will\r\n\r\nopt  out of the scheme. And I know that the Minister will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Give the scheme some time to operate and  we  will\r\n\r\nreview it in good time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall patiently and eagerly await for the\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian:</b> Sir, I would just like to comment\r\n\r\non  the  Interim Disability Assistance Programme for  the\r\n\r\nElderly (IDAPE).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last July, the Ministry of Health announced a very\r\n\r\ngenerous scheme,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsetting aside $300 million for the disabled elderly for a\r\n\r\nperiod of five years and with monthly allowances of  $100\r\n\r\nor $150, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, an elderly has to be at least over\r\n\r\n70  years  old, and must be possessed of at  least  three\r\n\r\ndisabilities  and also come from a family with  not  more\r\n\r\nthan $1,000 income per head.  Since the inception of  the\r\n\r\nscheme,  and as at 1st November, I understand  that  only\r\n\r\nslightly more than 2,000 people have qualified and  about\r\n\r\na  quarter million dollars has been disbursed.  If we  do\r\n\r\nsome  Mathematics, at $100, we should have  about  50,000\r\n\r\npeople, and for $150, about 33,000 should qualify.  So it\r\n\r\nwould  appear that not many people have qualified, and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest a few revisions for the Minister to\r\n\r\nkindly  consider, now that we have about nine  months  of\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the age limit ought to be reduced to, say,\r\n\r\nover   55  years  old.   Secondly,  there  should  be   a\r\n\r\nredefinition  of disability again, so as to capture  more\r\n\r\npeople.  I was a little taken aback that a patient  in  a\r\n\r\nwheelchair  was  told  that she was not  disabled  enough\r\n\r\nbecause  she  can sell tissue papers to  earn  a  living.\r\n\r\nUnder  such  difficult conditions, we ought to reconsider\r\n\r\nthe  definition  of  disability.  Thirdly,  we  can  also\r\n\r\nincrease the allowance of $100-150 because it does cost a\r\n\r\nlot  more to look after a disabled patient.  So  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to kindly reconsider  because  it  is\r\n\r\nreally  heartening  to  know that  under  such  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes,  a very generous fund has been set up, but  it  is\r\n\r\nnot very meaningful if not too many people qualify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First, let me address the issues\r\n\r\nof  junior  doctors raised by Dr Lily Neo.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nher  that  we  want to set in place sensible requirements\r\n\r\nfor  our doctors, especially the junior doctors, to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  when  they serve the people, their  hours  of\r\n\r\nservice are reasonable.  And, at the same time, when they\r\n\r\nundertake  training,  they have  time  to  develop  their\r\n\r\ncareer further.  The situation in the past had not been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nentirely satisfactory and that is the reason why we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  progressively setting tougher and tougher standards\r\n\r\nfor the clusters to meet.  Right now, my Ministry closely\r\n\r\nmonitors  the  number  of night calls  performed  by  our\r\n\r\njunior  doctors, and the latest figures we have is  that,\r\n\r\nin  the  two  clusters, 74% of our junior doctors  do  an\r\n\r\naverage  of six night calls, or less, per month.   So  we\r\n\r\nare  setting higher standards for the clusters  to  meet,\r\n\r\nand  the  clusters  are  working  hard  to  increase  the\r\n\r\npercentage of junior doctors who do six night  calls,  or\r\n\r\nless,  per  month.  So, I want to assure the Member  that\r\n\r\nthe  clusters  will progressively set better  and  better\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also asked the clusters to ensure, as far as\r\n\r\npossible, that the junior doctors are able to go off work\r\n\r\nby  lunch time, the day after their night call,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe total duration of the call is not more than 28 hours.\r\n\r\nThe  clusters  are, again, trying to  achieve  this.   We\r\n\r\nobviously monitor the working hours guidelines  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries, and we are benchmarking against them.   But  I\r\n\r\nhope  Members will understand that based on  the  current\r\n\r\nmanpower  situation,  we  cannot adopt  these  benchmarks\r\n\r\novernight and, therefore, we are working closely with the\r\n\r\nclusters to try and improve this situation.  The clusters\r\n\r\nare  actively recruiting more foreign-trained doctors  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  shortage of junior doctors  in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector  hospitals.   I believe these recruitment  efforts\r\n\r\nwould  be greatly facilitated by the recent expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe Schedule under the Medical Registration Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her second point about the different training,\r\n\r\nwhether   you  are  a  foreign-trained  or  local-trained\r\n\r\ndoctor, let me assure the Member that there is no  policy\r\n\r\nof  discrimination in our public sector hospitals, either\r\n\r\nfor or against overseas-trained Singaporean doctors.  All\r\n\r\ndoctors  are  appraised  and  assessed  based  on   their\r\n\r\nperformance  and  ability, and not which  medical  school\r\n\r\nthey  come from.  Similarly, all opportunities for higher\r\n\r\ntraining and career advancements are awarded on the basis\r\n\r\nof  the  doctor's individual merit and whether he or  she\r\n\r\nhas satisfied the necessary professional criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need to make sure that our junior doctors are\r\n\r\nadequately trained, I totally agree with her.  We need to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  the  training  of  our  junior  doctors\r\n\r\ncontinues  to be a major priority area for  us.   We  are\r\n\r\nworking  with  our  partners, like the Singapore  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil  and the Joint Committee on Specialists Training,\r\n\r\nto  set  the training objectives, the standards  and  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes   for  both  the  housemen  and  the   medical\r\n\r\nofficers,  as  well as specialist trainees.   We  have  a\r\n\r\nsystem in place to look at and monitor the training  that\r\n\r\nis conducted.  To audit this training programme we have a\r\n\r\nsystem  of collecting trainee feedback so that we can  be\r\n\r\nassured  that  these training programmes are  effectively\r\n\r\ncarried out on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the comments raised by several\r\n\r\nMembers  on  nursing.   The nurses are  a  very  critical\r\n\r\ncomponent  of our healthcare system.  We have to  do  all\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  to train more nurses and to  retain  them,\r\n\r\nwhether  Singaporean or foreign nurses.  So we have  done\r\n\r\nseveral  things.  First of all, to set the backdrop,  the\r\n\r\npublic  healthcare sector is short by about  364  nurses,\r\n\r\nwhich means a vacancy position of about 4%.  We are aware\r\n\r\nof the current shortage of nurses around the world and we\r\n\r\nknow   that   we  have  to  compete  for  these   nurses.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the onus is on us to make sure  that  we  can\r\n\r\nattract more local nurses to join the profession, and the\r\n\r\nforeign nurses that we attract to come to Singapore, stay\r\n\r\nwith us as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked with the Nanyang Polytechnic and the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Technical Education  to  raise  the  total\r\n\r\nnursing  student intake.  The target now has been  raised\r\n\r\nfrom 728 to 820.  Because of the extensive publicity that\r\n\r\nwe  have  done,  both  with the  clusters  and  with  the\r\n\r\neducational  institutions, we managed to  attract  almost\r\n\r\n900 nursing students last year.  So we hope to do just as\r\n\r\nwell this year.  More importantly, as Dr Chong Weng Chiew\r\n\r\nraised,  is really to make sure there is a proper  career\r\n\r\npath  for nurses.  I believe he understands what we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  trying  to do the last few years.  It is  not  just\r\n\r\nadjusting the pay to be more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  It is also giving the nurses a wider  range\r\n\r\nof  career  prospects so that they  can  develop  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement   arena,  if  they  want  to,   administration\r\n\r\nmanagement or they can be educators and trainers, or they\r\n\r\ncan be specialist nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also widened the scope of training\r\n\r\npossibilities.  Many of our nurses now go overseas for  a\r\n\r\nstint   of   training  and  attachment  under  the   HMDP\r\n\r\nprogramme,  and  they  are very,  very  happy  with  this\r\n\r\narrangement.  Similarly, for foreign nurses.  We  attract\r\n\r\nforeign nurses from all over, and over time we would like\r\n\r\nto   reduce   our   dependence   on   them   but,   quite\r\n\r\nrealistically,  I  do not see the  day  when  we  can  be\r\n\r\ntotally localised.  We have to have both local nurses, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  foreign nurses, for the simple reason  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  top  up our talent.  We need to  attract  these\r\n\r\nnurses  to come here to work with us, and those  who  are\r\n\r\nbetter,  we  would like them to sink roots in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  assure Members that this is an area that  we  are\r\n\r\ndefinitely  very  concerned  about  and  we   will   work\r\n\r\ncontinuously to improve the career path for nurses,  both\r\n\r\nfor the local as well as foreign nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the several questions raised on the\r\n\r\nstep-down  care  sector.  First, Dr  Jennifer  Lee  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  I  am  happy with the progress so far  since  we\r\n\r\nstarted seriously to develop this framework two or  three\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  There has been some progress, but  obviously\r\n\r\nwe  need to make more improvements.  We still have a long\r\n\r\nway to go.  I think we have done quite well in developing\r\n\r\nand  becoming adequate in terms of facilities.   We  have\r\n\r\nput more funding into the step-down care, but we need  to\r\n\r\ndo more now on standards and making sure that the care is\r\n\r\nproperly  integrated across the board.  We have also  put\r\n\r\nin place means-testing for all the step-down facilities - a  three-tier subsidy level.  So, I think we have set  in\r\n\r\nplace the key things that we want to do.  But, as I said,\r\n\r\nthere are many improvements, and the questions raised  by\r\n\r\nMembers point to the improvements.  So let me take  these\r\n\r\nquestions one at a time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on means-testing. The most equitable way of\r\n\r\nmeans-testing is per capita income.  This means  dividing\r\n\r\nthe household income by the number of family members.  So\r\n\r\nit  does  not  discriminate  against  bigger  or  smaller\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  The per capita approach is really  the  most\r\n\r\nequitable  and  it  makes sure that there  is  a  minimum\r\n\r\nincome  level  per head.  If we use family  income  as  a\r\n\r\nmeasure,  then it will disadvantage the larger  families.\r\n\r\nSo  the per capita income approach, to me, seems the most\r\n\r\nsensible approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On how we go about adducing the income, how we go\r\n\r\nabout assessing the means-test, we require the family  to\r\n\r\nproduce  income statements.  I think this is a  pragmatic\r\n\r\napproach  rather than asking them to self-declare.   And,\r\n\r\nwe are prepared to accept a number of different documents\r\n\r\nas  evidence of family income - whether it is their  pay-slip,  income tax statement, CPF statement, or bank  book\r\n\r\nshowing  their monthly salary.  We are prepared  also  to\r\n\r\nreview  this  and accept self-declaration  provided  they\r\n\r\nalso authorise us to check with IRAS on their income.  So\r\n\r\nif  the person says, \"I declare this is my income  and  I\r\n\r\nauthorise the Government to check with IRAS that that  is\r\n\r\nthe   income\",  I  think  we  can  examine  that   as   a\r\n\r\npossibility.  But basically we need to have the means  to\r\n\r\ndetermine income and I do not think the various  measures\r\n\r\nthat we have adopted are overly onerous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether we will raise the cut-off\r\n\r\npoint.  As I have explained earlier, previously the step-down  care  had  a single level of subsidy  of  50%.   We\r\n\r\nraised it to 75% for the more deserving, and then we have\r\n\r\na  three-tier system.  Obviously, in due course, we  will\r\n\r\nlook  at the income cut-off, but I just want to make  the\r\n\r\npoint that when we changed over, we were already doing it\r\n\r\nin a more generous way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether we would have a centrally-run\r\n\r\nmeans-testing mechanism.  There are pros and cons.  If we\r\n\r\nhave  a centrally-run bureaucracy for means-testing, some\r\n\r\nMembers  earlier preferred variable criteria and variable\r\n\r\nmeans-testing  to  tailor  it  to  the  different  needs,\r\n\r\nwhether it is in-patient, SOC or step-down\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncare.  We have to be quite realistic.  The subsidy levels\r\n\r\nare  quite  different.   What is suitable  for  step-down\r\n\r\ncare,  because  the person goes in, spends  weeks,  maybe\r\n\r\nmonths,  may  not  be suitable for in-patient  where  the\r\n\r\nepisode may be 4-5 days and you want a very quick way  of\r\n\r\ndoing means-testing.  But we are prepared to look at  the\r\n\r\nvarious possibilities.  Whether or not we should have the\r\n\r\nsame  system  with MCDS, this is something  that  we  are\r\n\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo pointed to some statistics about the\r\n\r\nhigh   unscheduled  discharge  rate  and  the   premature\r\n\r\ntransfers from acute hospitals to community hospitals.  I\r\n\r\nagree  that  this  is  not  entirely  satisfactory.   Our\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals are not fully functioning as a  step-down community hospital because they have not quite built\r\n\r\nup  their  sub-acute capabilities.  I have to be  candid.\r\n\r\nSome  of  our community hospitals are just a  little  bit\r\n\r\nbetter  than nursing homes and, therefore, over the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years,  we have aggressively moved to upgrade  their\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   Having  said  so,  we  are   not   slowly\r\n\r\nupgrading, particularly the sub-acute capabilities of our\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals, and so as we progress in this  area,\r\n\r\nI am confident that this unscheduled discharge rate would\r\n\r\ndrop.   In fact, a survey by MOH for the last quarter  of\r\n\r\nlast  year  showed that the average unscheduled discharge\r\n\r\nrate was 3.7% overall, and St Luke's Hospital achieved  a\r\n\r\nrate of 5.4%.  So there is some improvement.  But I agree\r\n\r\nwith  Members that we have to move aggressively  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  community hospitals are able to receive the patients\r\n\r\nand take care of them.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that casemix does not\r\n\r\nincentivise  or  encourage  the  doctors  to  prematurely\r\n\r\ndischarge  patients  from the acute hospitals.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause, over and above the funding based on the episode,\r\n\r\nif  a  doctor  says that the patient is not ready  to  be\r\n\r\ndischarged  and the patient is an outlier, the additional\r\n\r\ndays  that the patient needs to stay in the hospital will\r\n\r\nbe  funded by the Ministry of Health on a per diem basis.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder DRG, we fund based on the norm cost per episode  as\r\n\r\nwell as on a per diem basis if it is an outlier.  This is\r\n\r\nto  remove  the concerns by Members that if we just  only\r\n\r\nfund per episode, then there may be a wrong incentive  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  patients  early.  I  have  assured  the  House\r\n\r\nearlier that we also fund outliers on a per diem basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, we are counting on the doctors to\r\n\r\nbe    professional   and   to   make   the   professional\r\n\r\ndetermination  when a patient is ready to be  discharged.\r\n\r\nAnd if the patient is not ready to be discharged, we will\r\n\r\ncontinue to fund that case as an outlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the step-down care has been\r\n\r\nprogressing reasonably well.  Today, we have  51  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  with  about 6,700 beds.  75% of the  nursing  home\r\n\r\nbeds are run by the VWOs, for which our Ministry provides\r\n\r\n90%  of  the  capital  cost  as  well  as  the  operating\r\n\r\nsubsidies,   depending  on  the  means-testing   of   the\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have encouraged the private players to come into\r\n\r\nthe  nursing home sector by making land sites  available.\r\n\r\nThe means-testing allows us to channel subsidies to those\r\n\r\nwho  are  financially deserving, and  such  patients  can\r\n\r\neither  be  managed at the VWO homes or in the accredited\r\n\r\nprivate nursing homes.  As I said, our attention  now  is\r\n\r\nto  focus  on quality, and we do so through our licensing\r\n\r\nmechanism  and through several clinical quality assurance\r\n\r\ninitiatives as well as a fairly stringent clinical audit.\r\n\r\nIt  is our intention to develop this clinic audit so that\r\n\r\nevery  nursing  home will be inspected  and  audited  for\r\n\r\nquality every year.  We have also produced guidelines  to\r\n\r\nhelp  providers enhance the standard of care.  So I agree\r\n\r\nwith  Members totally that quality will be the focus from\r\n\r\nhere on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee also wants to know whether we can\r\n\r\ninvolve  more GPs in the Primary Care Partnership  Scheme\r\n\r\n(PCPS).  Today, we have 600 GPs in the scheme, and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure all Members know of the clinics participating in the\r\n\r\nscheme  in  their constituencies.  In Telok Blangah,  for\r\n\r\nexample, for each of the estate that I look\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafter,  whether it is Telok Blangah, Dover Road or  Depot\r\n\r\nRoad, there are at least two clinics participating in the\r\n\r\nscheme.   And  we  do  that systematically  for  all  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies to make sure that there are enough clinics\r\n\r\nfor the elderly to have access to the GPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think accessibility to the clinics is\r\n\r\na problem.  But we will continue to encourage more GPs to\r\n\r\nsign  up.  Right now, we have 600 and we will try  harder\r\n\r\nto get more to sign up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards norm cost, we will continue to review it.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very  important.   If  we  set  norm  cost  too\r\n\r\ngenerously, then, of course, we are encouraging inflation\r\n\r\nand higher cost.  We want to set a sensible norm cost and\r\n\r\ntry  to persuade the providers to try and meet this  norm\r\n\r\ncost.  Of course, if we set it too low, then Members  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  that this will be at the expense  of  quality.\r\n\r\nSo we will have to review it regularly and make sure that\r\n\r\nthe  norm cost is sensible and, at the same time, it does\r\n\r\nnot lead to cost escalation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan wants to know the plan for the number of\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospitals.   Our  intention  is  to  have  one\r\n\r\ncommunity hospital co-located with each regional  general\r\n\r\nhospital.  So, for the next general hospital that we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding  in  Jurong, we will have a  community  hospital\r\n\r\nthere  too.  Through this plan, we are confident that  we\r\n\r\nwill  have enough community hospitals to serve the  needs\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intention is to increase the proportion of\r\n\r\nprivate  nursing homes from the current  25%  to  40%  by\r\n\r\n2010,  so that the private sector can contribute actively\r\n\r\nin  this  step-down  care sector.  We have  tendered  out\r\n\r\nseveral sites.  The development is on schedule.   So  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the  private nursing homes  is  coming  on\r\n\r\nstream  as  we planned.  And by extending the subsidy  to\r\n\r\nthe  private nursing homes, we are, in fact,  creating  a\r\n\r\nlevel  playing  field between the VWOs  and  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  In so doing, we think this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  incentivise the private sector to participate  more\r\n\r\nactively in this sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, my Ministry runs annual dialogues\r\n\r\nwith the key providers in the step-down care sector.   To\r\n\r\nthis  end, we will welcome any new initiatives  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  to  develop the  step-down  care  sector\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on ElderShield and IDAPE. I commend Mr Gan\r\n\r\nKim  Yong for his patience and his perseverance.  I  hope\r\n\r\nhe  will  continue  to  be patient,  because  the  claims\r\n\r\npattern  cannot be determined in a matter of months.   It\r\n\r\nmust  be  clear after a matter of years.  So I  think  we\r\n\r\nneed  time  for the claims pattern to settle.  With  that\r\n\r\nclaims  pattern data, we will be able to make a  sensible\r\n\r\nreview of ElderShield.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong is an extremely sensible person and\r\n\r\nhe  knows  that  there  is  this trilateral  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  premiums, pay-outs and qualifying criteria.   We\r\n\r\ncannot have low premiums, high pay-out and low qualifying\r\n\r\ncriteria.  Something has to give.  So we will look at the\r\n\r\nsystem  when we get better claims history.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure  him that we do have  a  clause  in  our\r\n\r\ncontract  with the two private sector insurers,  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  pay-out is less than what they anticipated in  their\r\n\r\ncalculation of the premiums, there will be a rebate.   It\r\n\r\nis in the contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Fang Ai Lian asked about the IDAPE pay-outs. To\r\n\r\ndate,  more  than 3,600 Singaporeans are benefiting  from\r\n\r\nthe  monthly IDAPE pay-outs.  I agree with her  that  the\r\n\r\nbudgetary  provision  for the IDAPE  has  been  set  very\r\n\r\ngenerously, because we expected a higher pay-out pattern.\r\n\r\nAs  it turned out, the people who qualify are fewer  than\r\n\r\nbudgeted.  But we have to work this system for a few more\r\n\r\nmonths  to  be confident that this pattern is indeed  the\r\n\r\nlevel of disabilities in our senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also qualify that for those who are already\r\n\r\nhandicapped  or  severely  disabled,  there  is  no   age\r\n\r\ncriterion.  Age criterion above 70 years old is only  for\r\n\r\nthose who are currently not disabled.  And if they become\r\n\r\ndisabled subsequently,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen they qualify under IDAPE.  For those who are already\r\n\r\nhandicapped and below 70 years old, they already qualify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take into account her suggestions, but let me\r\n\r\nrespond  quickly.  First, to reduce the age limit.    The\r\n\r\nreason  why  we set the age limit at 70 is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nthose  below  70 to opt into ElderShield.   What  we  are\r\n\r\nsaying is that if we put those above 70 in the risk  pool\r\n\r\nof  the ElderShield, it will cause a very high burden  on\r\n\r\nthe  rest of the people in the risk pool.  The Government\r\n\r\nundertakes to fund the risk of those above 70 years  old,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  premiums of those in the ElderShield  risk\r\n\r\npool  is  lower.  So the age limit is determined on  that\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of disability, we chose three\r\n\r\nADLs,  because that is the market standard.  This is  the\r\n\r\ncurrent insurance standard.  We are working with the  GPs\r\n\r\nvery  actively to make sure that their assessment of what\r\n\r\nconstitutes three ADLs is consistent and sensible  across\r\n\r\nthe  board.  With experience, I am sure we can  sit  down\r\n\r\nwith  the  College of Family Physicians  and the  SMA  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that the criteria can meet the needs  of  the\r\n\r\ninsurance companies and can serve the needs of Government\r\n\r\nwithout  causing a huge pay-out if we change the criteria\r\n\r\ntoo  drastically.  I think there is scope for us to fine-tune the criteria of what constitutes three ADLs as we go\r\n\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we can increase the allowance, this is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  have  go back  to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.   The fact that we have over budgeted  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that we can increase the allowance.  We have to  go\r\n\r\nback  to  MOF  and  make  out a  sensible  case  why  the\r\n\r\nallowance  of $100 or $150 ought to be increased  further\r\n\r\nto help these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed most of the issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, can I seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, when I listened to the\r\n\r\nMinister's reply to Dr Lily Neo's query on the statistics\r\n\r\nof  mortality at the community hospitals, I am  a  little\r\n\r\nbit  disturbed.  Because, sometime ago, when casemix  was\r\n\r\nbrought  before this House, I did warn the Ministry  that\r\n\r\nthey  must  be  able to match the casemix programme  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  introducing with the high end step-down  care.\r\n\r\nWhen  the Minister says that the community hospitals  are\r\n\r\ninadequate to take care of the acute cases discharged  by\r\n\r\nour  hospitals, I think it is very telling.  We have  not\r\n\r\nactually planned for this high end care very well  before\r\n\r\nwe  introduced casemix.  What I want is an assurance from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that more funding should be put  into  this\r\n\r\nhigh  end care, or else we will get more mortality,  like\r\n\r\nthe  statistics given by Dr Lily Neo.  I am  asking  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister should, first, make sure that the discharged\r\n\r\npatients  are  carefully  evaluated;  and,  second,  more\r\n\r\nfunding for this high end step-down care.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I have explained in my\r\n\r\nanswer,  first  of  all, casemix is not  the  culprit  in\r\n\r\ndischarging patients.  We have to trust the  doctor.   If\r\n\r\nthe  doctor  says  that  the  patient  is  ready  to   be\r\n\r\ndischarged, that is his professional opinion.  I think we\r\n\r\nhave   to  trust  him.   The  casemix  system  does   not\r\n\r\nincentivise  the doctor or the hospital to discharge  the\r\n\r\npatient,  because, under casemix, we are subventing  both\r\n\r\nthe funding per episode, and if the patient needs to stay\r\n\r\nlonger in the hospital, we will continue to fund on a per\r\n\r\ndiem  basis. That has been my assurance and that is  what\r\n\r\nis happening on the ground.  When Dr Lily Neo quoted this\r\n\r\nstudy done on St Luke's Hospital which showed a very high\r\n\r\nunscheduled discharge, the sub-acute capabilities of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospitals  are still  not  there  yet,  and  I\r\n\r\nreadily admit to it.  And that is the reason why  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding  the  capabilities.  We have a regional  general\r\n\r\nhospital  with  a  geriatric department  supporting  each\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospital, so that the hospital does  not  just\r\n\r\ndischarge  the patient and shed its responsibility.   The\r\n\r\nregional  general  hospitals  continue  to  provide   the\r\n\r\nprofessional  support  to the nursing  homes  within  the\r\n\r\nregional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncatchment.   We  are  providing  the  funding   for   the\r\n\r\ncommunity   hospitals   to  develop   their   capability,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the sub-acute areas, as I mentioned.  And\r\n\r\nas  a  result,  our survey showed that the situation  has\r\n\r\nimproved  and  my Ministry will continue to monitor  this\r\n\r\nand make sure that the situation gets better and better.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to assure Dr Tan Cheng Bock that casemix\r\n\r\nis  not the cause for premature discharge.  He and I must\r\n\r\nagree  that,  in  the  end, we  have  to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nprofessional judgement of the doctors in signing off  the\r\n\r\ndischarge.  And I believe that all our doctors  discharge\r\n\r\nthat   responsibility  professionally.    They   do   not\r\n\r\ndischarge a patient if they, in their opinion, think that\r\n\r\nthe patient is not ready.  And our system is such that if\r\n\r\nthe  patient  is not ready, the patient continues  to  be\r\n\r\nfunded by us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you, Minister, for the\r\n\r\nassurance.   Sir, in year 2000, the Health Ministry  here\r\n\r\nset up a Group Purchasing Office to buy drugs in bulk  at\r\n\r\nbetter prices for the entire public sector.  This led  to\r\n\r\nsavings  of $12 million a year, despite the fact that  it\r\n\r\nbought only roughly 700 essential drugs this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals and polyclinics bought other non-standard\r\n\r\ndrugs  themselves from drug companies.  This has resulted\r\n\r\nin differences in the selling prices for certain drugs at\r\n\r\nthe  various public hospitals and polyclinics.  May I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister why the Group Purchasing Office  could  not\r\n\r\nextend  its service to include buying all drugs  for  the\r\n\r\npublic   institutions?   Now  that  the  Government   has\r\n\r\ninvolved  the  private sector in the care  of  subsidised\r\n\r\nneedy patients as in the Primary Care Partnership Scheme,\r\n\r\nwhy  has  this  scheme not been extended to  include  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to save patients' medicine costs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the liver damaging drug \"Slim 10\"\r\n\r\nwas   brought   into  Singapore  and  sold   as   Chinese\r\n\r\nproprietary medicine.  Chinese proprietary medicines and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealth  supplements were sold over the  counter  products\r\n\r\nthat  could  be  purchased  without  prescription.   This\r\n\r\ncontrasts  with  western medicines that  are  stringently\r\n\r\nevaluated  by  the  Health Sciences Authority  for  their\r\n\r\nquality, safety and efficacy before marketing is granted.\r\n\r\n\"Slim  10\"  has caused two persons to suffer  from  liver\r\n\r\nfailure and one person to die from liver failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Ministry of Health done to-date to\r\n\r\nprevent  such  repeat incidents?  As most  consumers  are\r\n\r\ntrusting  the  local system that the  Government  has  in\r\n\r\nplace to ensure that products available for sale are safe\r\n\r\nfor  consumption, are there now more stringent  marketing\r\n\r\nregulations for Chinese proprietary medicines and  health\r\n\r\nsupplements?  What has the Ministry done to  improve  our\r\n\r\nsystem to ensure that no adulterated drugs are sold?  Has\r\n\r\nthe  Health Sciences Authority been more proactive in the\r\n\r\nsurveillance  of  the  available  drugs  sold  over   the\r\n\r\ncounter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I go on to my next cut, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you.

Whilst  this\r\n\r\nholds  the promise of tremendous advantages for  mankind,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  finding new treatments for  diseases  and\r\n\r\npromises  of vast monetary benefits in a new economy,  we\r\n\r\nmust be sensitive to the ethical, legal and social issues\r\n\r\nin this area, especially in our multi-cultural and multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Ministry of Health done to ensure\r\n\r\nproper  conduct  in  the  various  aspects  of  research,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  clinical trials and human stem  research?\r\n\r\nAre  patients  and  donors able  to  make  voluntary  and\r\n\r\ninformed  choices?

Should not such research be effectively  and\r\n\r\nefficiently monitored and regulated?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong Aljunied -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, I declare my interest as a\r\n\r\npractising psychiatrist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may boast to have one of the best\r\n\r\nhealthcare systems in the world, I am afraid that we  may\r\n\r\nnot  say the same for our mental health service.  We  are\r\n\r\nabout  50  years  behind time in the  way  we  treat  our\r\n\r\npsychiatric patients.  Sir, in the past, before effective\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment  was  found for  the  mental  illness,\r\n\r\npatients  with severe psychiatric illness were locked  up\r\n\r\nin  jails, or in asylums.  Such a custodial approach  was\r\n\r\nnot only inhuman but was detrimental to the overall well-being of the patient.  Many of them became, what we call,\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised,  lost  their  identity  and  literally\r\n\r\nbecame a zombie.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the discovery of effective medical treatment\r\n\r\nand  a  better  understanding of the  underlying  organic\r\n\r\ncauses of mental illness, coupled with the realisation of\r\n\r\nthe deplorable state of mental institutions, the movement\r\n\r\nto  deinstitutionalise  mental  patients  and  help  them\r\n\r\nreintegrate  back  to the communities was  started  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of developed countries in the middle of the  last\r\n\r\ncentury.   While  there have been  some  hiccups  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  deinstitutionalisation  in  some  of   these\r\n\r\ncountries, the overall result has so far been positive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we missed the opportunities to move towards a\r\n\r\ncommunity care model when the Woodbridge Hospital was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nredesigned and rebuilt in the late 1980s and  1990s.   By\r\n\r\nthen,  much of the world already had moved on or  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of closing down mental institutions and  getting\r\n\r\ntheir   psychiatric  patients  to  move   back   to   the\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Yet, in Singapore, we continue to lock them\r\n\r\nup.   Worse  still, we miss another opportunity  recently\r\n\r\nwhen  the Ministry of Health started the process of, what\r\n\r\nthey call, \"decanting\" long-stay patients from Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital  to the Pelangi Village Complex under MCDS,  and\r\n\r\nthis  continues the approach of custodial care.   To  use\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"decanting\" is what I find  demeaning  to  the\r\n\r\nmental  patients.  This process, to me, I would  describe\r\n\r\nit   as  \"trans-institutionalisation\",  ie,  moving   the\r\n\r\npatient from one institution to another institution.  One\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  way in which this complex is  constructed,\r\n\r\nwith  high fencing and with patients pacing about in  the\r\n\r\ncomplex,  stuck in their catatonic state, you  will  know\r\n\r\nwhat I mean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, I urge the Ministry to review its overall\r\n\r\napproach   and  philosophy  towards  the  mental   health\r\n\r\nservice.   I would like to suggest that the Ministry  set\r\n\r\nup  a  Mental  Health  Service  Committee  consisting  of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from the patients and  their  advocates,\r\n\r\nmental  health  professionals  and  policy  makers.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee  should be tasked to: (1) chart  the  long-term\r\n\r\ndirection  of  our  mental  health  service  based  on  a\r\n\r\ncommunity care model with comprehensive support  for  the\r\n\r\npatients, in terms of their medical care, rehabilitation,\r\n\r\npsycho-social  needs, housing and employment  assistance;\r\n\r\n(2)  educate  the  public in order  to  destigmatise  the\r\n\r\nmental  illness; (3) review and revamp our mental  health\r\n\r\nlegislation  to facilitate community care and  treatment.\r\n\r\nI  also  suggest that the Ministry set up a Mental Health\r\n\r\nService Directorate, with the appropriate budget, to take\r\n\r\nfull  charge of the implementation of this mental  health\r\n\r\nservice as proposed by the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are already half a century behind in the way\r\n\r\nwe  view this mental health service.  But it is time  for\r\n\r\nus  to  make changes.  All is not lost.  Because we could\r\n\r\nlearn  from  those  countries  who  have  undertaken  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  deinstitutionalising  their  mental   health\r\n\r\nservices.  We can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearn  from  their experience, avoid their  mistakes  and\r\n\r\nthus  shorten  our  learning curve.   Sir,  we  owe  this\r\n\r\nobligation to this group of our fellow citizens  who  are\r\n\r\nunfortunate enough to suffer from mental illness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Sir, I want to thank Dr Lily Neo and Dr Ong\r\n\r\nSeh  Hong for their questions.  I begin, first,  with  Dr\r\n\r\nLily Neo's question on bulk purchasing and Slim 10.  With\r\n\r\nregard to bulk purchasing, the Group Purchasing Office of\r\n\r\nthe  two hospital clusters already bulk purchase standard\r\n\r\ndrugs  and  commonly  used  non-standard  drugs  for  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics  and health institutions.   As  Dr  Lily  Neo\r\n\r\nnoted,  this has resulted in a lot of savings.   But  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions  have  also carried out some  of  their  own\r\n\r\npurchases for non-standard drugs where smaller quantities\r\n\r\nare  needed because it is more efficient and flexible  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  their  needs.  The Ministry of Health  has  also\r\n\r\nrequested  that clusters should explore the extension  of\r\n\r\nthese  services  with  willing partners  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Chinese proprietary medicines (CPM)\r\n\r\nand  the  Slim  10 incident, the regulatory controls  for\r\n\r\nChinese  proprietary medicines were introduced in  phases\r\n\r\nfrom  September  1999  and  were  fully  implemented   by\r\n\r\nSeptember  2001.   All CPM importers, wholesalers,  local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  and  repackers must  be  licensed  by  the\r\n\r\nHealth  Sciences  Authority.  Among the things  that  the\r\n\r\nHealth  Sciences Authority looks at include an assessment\r\n\r\nof  the  safety and quality of these medications.   There\r\n\r\nare  also  full  labelling requirements before  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed for local sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the Slim 10 incident in 2002, MOH has\r\n\r\nfurther  enhanced  the control of CPM through  additional\r\n\r\nmeasures.   Since January 2003, all CPMs  must  carry  an\r\n\r\nadditional  label  on  the outer  sealed  packs  in  both\r\n\r\nEnglish  and Chinese.  This label says \"Allowed for  sale\r\n\r\nas a Chinese Proprietary Medicine\".  This helps consumers\r\n\r\nto better differentiate CPM from western drugs.  From 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2004, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntest  reports issued by accredited laboratories  will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised and accepted by HSA.  The existing product and\r\n\r\nquality  surveillance programme carried out  by  HSA  has\r\n\r\nbeen  enhanced  and strengthened.  Also,  all  local  and\r\n\r\noverseas  CPM manufacturers will be subjected to periodic\r\n\r\ngood  manufacturing practice audits, in  accordance  with\r\n\r\ninternational standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPM regulatory framework in Singapore has\r\n\r\nalready been enhanced to a considerable extent and we now\r\n\r\nhave  one  of the strictest framework in the  world.   In\r\n\r\nspite  of  this, no system, short of complete prohibition\r\n\r\nof  products, can absolutely guarantee the prevention  of\r\n\r\ndeliberate  adulteration, as  occurred  in  the  Slim  10\r\n\r\nincident,  and which can potentially occur  in  even  the\r\n\r\nstrictest of systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo's next question was with regard to\r\n\r\nregulation of clinical trials.  For clinical drug trials,\r\n\r\na  clinical trial certificate is required from the Health\r\n\r\nSciences  Authority by law before research  can  proceed.\r\n\r\nIssuance  of  a trial certificate is conditional  on  the\r\n\r\nresearch  meeting  the  requirements  stipulated  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Guidelines  on Good Clinical  Practice,  which\r\n\r\ninclude   specific  requirements  for   proper   informed\r\n\r\nconsent.   For other forms of clinical research involving\r\n\r\npatients  or human subjects, there are ethical guidelines\r\n\r\non  research  involving  human  subjects  issued  by  the\r\n\r\nNational   Medical   Ethics   Committee.    Under   these\r\n\r\nguidelines,  hospitals  and  institutions,   where   such\r\n\r\nresearch is carried out, have Ethics Committees to review\r\n\r\nthe ethics of research projects and approval is necessary\r\n\r\nbefore such research can proceed.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo was also concerned about human embryos.\r\n\r\nUnder  the guidelines for private healthcare institutions\r\n\r\nproviding assisted reproduction services, Regulation 4 of\r\n\r\nthe  Private  Hospitals and Medical Clinics  Regulations,\r\n\r\nthere  are guidelines regulating the use of human embryos\r\n\r\nbelow  14  days  created  through in-vitro  fertilisation\r\n\r\ntechniques but which are not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nused  in  assisted  reproduction  treatments.   This   is\r\n\r\npermissible,  provided stringent regulatory  stipulations\r\n\r\nare met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to donation of parts for research, no\r\n\r\nperson is under any compulsion to give, nor is any person\r\n\r\nunder  an  obligation to accept these  donations.   These\r\n\r\nprovisions   in  the  Medical  (Therapy,  Education   and\r\n\r\nResearch)  Act  ensure that patient donors are  protected\r\n\r\nthrough having to make informed choices and are not under\r\n\r\nany  financial  inducement.  But to further  enhance  our\r\n\r\nregulatory  oversight  over biomedical  R&D  areas  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  greater  ethical concerns,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  is  in the process of drafting a new  Bill  which\r\n\r\nwill  provide  for  the regulation  of  human  stem  cell\r\n\r\nresearch  and  human  tissue research  and  banking,  and\r\n\r\nprovisions to extend the regulation to selected new types\r\n\r\nof  biomedical  R&D as these evolve.  It  will  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary regulatory and enforcement provisions to enable\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  to  issue  licences  for  biomedical  R&D\r\n\r\nfacilities,  and monitor and control selected  biomedical\r\n\r\nR&D  activities.   MOH  intends  to  enact  the  new  Act\r\n\r\nsometime this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong was concerned about insane patients\r\n\r\nbeing  locked up in hospitals.  I want to assure  Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  come a long way since the  day  when  all\r\n\r\ninsane patients were just locked up in asylums.  In fact,\r\n\r\nwe   have  moved  into  the  area  of  preventive  mental\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   We have put in place a comprehensive  range\r\n\r\nof  community  and institution-based programmes  for  the\r\n\r\nmentally disordered.  These include various public health\r\n\r\ninitiatives  and  community  services,  such  as  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes,   rehabilitation  homes  and  day   rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two major initiatives have been implemented in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They aim to educate the public on prevention\r\n\r\nstrategies,   decrease   stigmatisation,   and   increase\r\n\r\nawareness  of  mental  conditions  and  availability   of\r\n\r\ntreatment.   The first initiative is the Mind  Your  Mind\r\n\r\nProgramme,  which  is  a  10-year  prevention   programme\r\n\r\nstarted by the Health Promotion Board in 2001 as part  of\r\n\r\nthe National Mental Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe second initiative is the Early Psychosis Intervention\r\n\r\nProgramme,   which  is  a  comprehensive  and  integrated\r\n\r\ntreatment programme that targets the reduction of chronic\r\n\r\ndisability amongst schizophrenic patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge Hospital has also formulated long-term\r\n\r\nand  immediate  action plans to achieve a  more  balanced\r\n\r\nmodel  of  community and institutional psychiatric  care.\r\n\r\nThese  plans include enhancing the quality of  in-patient\r\n\r\ncare   and   ramping  up  the  development  of  community\r\n\r\npsychiatric  care  services in the  next  three  to  five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, whether a patient should\r\n\r\nremain  in an institution or whether the patient  can  be\r\n\r\nsent  home is a clinical decision, which we will have  to\r\n\r\nleave  to the competent psychiatrists at our institutions\r\n\r\nto decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the health of workers is a key\r\n\r\nfactor in influencing their productivity.  As the economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  is heavily dependent on its  workforce,  a\r\n\r\nhealthy    workforce   will   enhance    the    country's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in an increasingly global market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With about 2.1 million or 65% of Singaporeans aged\r\n\r\n15  years  or  more working, the workplace  is  an  ideal\r\n\r\nsetting  for  the  development  and  delivery  of  health\r\n\r\npromotion  programmes to the workers.   Workplace  health\r\n\r\npromotion  programmes  should include  a  combination  of\r\n\r\neducational, organisational and environmental  activities\r\n\r\ndesigned  to support behaviour that is conducive  to  the\r\n\r\nhealth of employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Ministry of Health help strategise the\r\n\r\nuptake  of  workplace  health promotion  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector with the following four emphasis:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) As management remains the main driver behind\r\n\r\nthese programmes, there is need, therefore, to secure the\r\n\r\nsupport  of a company's management with the provision  of\r\n\r\nadequate   support  of  the  administrators   or   health\r\n\r\nfacilitators,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npreferably facilitators with a healthcare background;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) There should be an expansion of the local scope\r\n\r\nof   occupational  health  and  safety  to  include   the\r\n\r\npromotion of workers' health through healthy living;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Financial assistance in the form of grants would\r\n\r\nbe   of   value   to  help  jumpstart  health   promotion\r\n\r\nprogrammes, particularly for small workplaces; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Have in place guidelines on how to organise\r\n\r\neffective  workplace  health  promotion  programmes   for\r\n\r\nworkplaces of different workforce and industry sector  to\r\n\r\nadopt.

One other main concern that I would like  to\r\n\r\nshare  with the House on preventive healthcare is how  to\r\n\r\nhelp Singaporeans reduce health risk factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these risks? They are the risks arising\r\n\r\nfrom  not  eating  right,  not  exercising  enough,   and\r\n\r\nsmoking.   Let us take our diet, for example.  We  should\r\n\r\nreduce salt and saturated fat intake, and eat more fruits\r\n\r\nand vegetables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Report 2002 showed that three-quarters of heart disease and stroke could be attributed\r\n\r\nto  tobacco use, low fruit and vegetable intake, and lack\r\n\r\nof  exercise.   More than half of deaths  and  disability\r\n\r\nfrom  heart disease and stroke can be cut down.   All  it\r\n\r\ntakes  are  national  effort and  individual  actions  to\r\n\r\nreduce  health risk factors, such as smoking, high  blood\r\n\r\npressure, high cholesterol and obesity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have put in much time and resources\r\n\r\nto  promote and facilitate intervention programmes at the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   We  do  it  at the  tripartite  level  as  a\r\n\r\ncollective effort, involving the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment,  union,  employers and all  Singaporeans.   I\r\n\r\ncommend the efforts of the HPB, but we have to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we need to do next? We have to \"awake the\r\n\r\ngiant    within\"   Singaporeans   and   cultivate   self-responsibility through health risk management.  Today, we\r\n\r\nstill   see  Singaporeans  choosing  \"not  to  face   the\r\n\r\nreality\".  They avoid health screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make a collaborated and structured effort to\r\n\r\nmake all Singaporeans aware of their own health risk.  We\r\n\r\ncan  start with basic health screening, followed by  ways\r\n\r\nof    empowering    Singaporeans   to    take    personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for their health risk  factors.   We  can\r\n\r\nhelp  create the \"internal drive\" within Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nstay  healthy.  In short, raise their awareness and  help\r\n\r\nthem  to  create the drive to take action.  What are  the\r\n\r\nactions  we  are talking about?  It is just  as  easy  as\r\n\r\nsaying  CHEERS,  which stands for Cease smoking,  Healthy\r\n\r\nEating, Exercise Regularly, manage Stress!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last two years, the NTUC Health\r\n\r\nOutreach  Programme has helped 50,000  workers  to  start\r\n\r\nbasic screening and monitoring their health risk factors.\r\n\r\nI  would like to ask the Ministry of Health for an update\r\n\r\nof  what  it  plans to do to help Singaporeans  regularly\r\n\r\nassess  and  monitor their own health  risk  factors  and\r\n\r\nbasic  health profile, and better manage all  these  risk\r\n\r\nfactors for better health.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, I propose that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health re-examine and explore more  ways\r\n\r\nin which minority races can learn about the importance of\r\n\r\ngood health in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare promotion plays an integral part in\r\n\r\nensuring  that  Singaporeans  are  better  equipped  with\r\n\r\nknowledge  critical  to living a healthy  lifestyle  well\r\n\r\ninto   their   golden  years.   It   is   important   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  develop healthy habits  through  health\r\n\r\npromotion  programmes.  The nation-wide Community  Health\r\n\r\nScreening  Programme is not only a good exercise  but  an\r\n\r\nimportant one at that.  It would at the very least ensure\r\n\r\nthat our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  are  able to manage their health in a proper  and\r\n\r\neducated manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through health screening, Singaporeans will then be\r\n\r\nable  to  spot  the tell-tale signs warning  of  possible\r\n\r\nillness  early  and to seek treatment in time.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  true for cases of hypertension and  diabetes.\r\n\r\nWe  have  a  variety  of healthcare promotion  programmes\r\n\r\ninitiated by the Health Promotion Board.  However, I  was\r\n\r\ndisappointed  to learn that a significant  proportion  of\r\n\r\nminority  races  do  not know enough about  these  health\r\n\r\npromotion programmes.  I discovered that this was because\r\n\r\nthe  methods  used  to  disseminate  information  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public,  although widespread,  could  be  better\r\n\r\ntargeted.  It is critical for us to reach out to our non-mainstream language speaking minorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the health promotion exercise in Singapore\r\n\r\nassumes  that the audience is proficient in English.   It\r\n\r\nassumes  this  of  the  many  elderly  targeted  by   the\r\n\r\nCommunity Health Screening Programme.  As many Members in\r\n\r\nthis House will attest to, most of these individuals  are\r\n\r\nusually  conversant in dialects and speak  little  or  no\r\n\r\nEnglish.   For  example,  I  have  come  across   several\r\n\r\ninstances where some minority race constituents  are  not\r\n\r\naware  of  the reasons why the Community Health Screening\r\n\r\nProgramme is conducted, much less how they can  go  about\r\n\r\ngetting  a  health  screening done.  This  was  primarily\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was not explained to them in a  manner  they\r\n\r\ncould  understand or, more specifically,  in  a  language\r\n\r\nthey  could  understand through the various  media  forms\r\n\r\nemployed now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to consider how healthcare\r\n\r\npromotions  can  better  reach  the  minority  races   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Perhaps, it would be helpful if  the  ethnic\r\n\r\nself-help  groups' assistance could be enlisted.   Having\r\n\r\nmore  promotional  materials in  Malay  and  Tamil  would\r\n\r\ncertainly help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nreasonably health-conscious, both in terms of making sure\r\n\r\nthey are healthy, and also in terms of knowing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  about  health matters.  Our Government,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Health and the medical fraternity,  has\r\n\r\ndone a great deal to try and enhance health promotion and\r\n\r\ndissemination of health-related knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that prevention is better than cure. In\r\n\r\nthis  connection,  Sir, what more  can  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  do  to bring about greater health promotion,  ie,\r\n\r\nhaving  a  healthy  nation  of  citizens,  and  propagate\r\n\r\nknowledge  on health, diseases, etc?  Would the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  stepping  up the use of  the  mass  media,  eg,\r\n\r\nnewspapers, TV, radio, Internet and the MOH website,  and\r\n\r\nalso the schools and workplaces, to promote knowledge  on\r\n\r\nhealth  matters  on a higher scale?  For  example,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  more TV shows and radio talks to educate  our\r\n\r\npeople  about diseases and health care in simple language\r\n\r\nin the four major languages.  A great deal can be done in\r\n\r\nour  primary  and  secondary schools,  and  our  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions too, to promote health, guidance on  healthy\r\n\r\nliving, knowledge on health, preventive measures to avoid\r\n\r\nor   reduce  health  problems.   There  should  be  well-organised healthcare and health knowledge classes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health promotion may be enhanced also if there is\r\n\r\nless  tension  in  life.  In this  connection,  does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health do progressive research in  and  work\r\n\r\nwith  other  Ministries, eg, the Ministry  of  Education,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  and  the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports, to coordinate health  promotion\r\n\r\nthrough   education,   proper   lifestyle,   sports   and\r\n\r\nrecreation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, as\r\n\r\nof  October 2002, 24% of adult Singaporean residents aged\r\n\r\n18-69 are overweight, while another 6% are obese.  Weight\r\n\r\nproblems are largely attributable to a less than  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyle,  and  we note that there are  well-established\r\n\r\nrelations  between excessive body weight and  conditions,\r\n\r\nsuch as diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Ministry for having embarked on large-scale programmes to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncombat   obesity  among  children,  such  as  the  School\r\n\r\nTuckshop Programme and the Trim and Fit Programme.  These\r\n\r\nprogrammes have certainly helped to reduce obesity  among\r\n\r\nchildren  from  14% in 1992, to 10% in 1996,  and  having\r\n\r\nremained steady after that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has also started the Workplace\r\n\r\nHealth Promotion Grant in 2001.  Its target audience  is,\r\n\r\npresumably, our workers.  The question is: how  effective\r\n\r\nhas  this grant been among our workers?  How many of  our\r\n\r\nworkers have benefited from this grant and how have  they\r\n\r\nbenefited?   In  1998, our death rate of 76  per  100,000\r\n\r\nfrom  coronary heart disease is higher than the rates  of\r\n\r\n58  and  60  in Canada and Australia, respectively.   Our\r\n\r\ndeath  rate of 29 per 100,000 from stroke is also  higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  rate of 14 in Canada and Australia.  Have  our\r\n\r\nfigures improved since then?\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also seek to ask whether the Ministry has\r\n\r\nconducted  a  detailed profiling of our adult  population\r\n\r\nwith  medical  conditions  to  see  whether  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrelation between their cultural or ethnic backgrounds and\r\n\r\na  propensity  towards certain diseases.  Is  educational\r\n\r\nlevel  also a relevant factor in this relation?   If  so,\r\n\r\nSir, I ask whether there are in place specific programmes\r\n\r\nthat   target   these  specific  groups.  Such   targeted\r\n\r\nprogrammes  would be more effective in  reaching  out  to\r\n\r\nthese  groups who may speak certain languages,  prefer  a\r\n\r\ncertain diet and subscribe to certain cultural practices.\r\n\r\nThese programmes can be more culture-sensitive and should\r\n\r\nresult in better buy-in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a recent study in the US shows that the\r\n\r\nweight patients vary in their readiness to adopt specific\r\n\r\nweight  loss behaviours.  For instance, some are  willing\r\n\r\nto  exercise  more  but not reduce  fat  in  their  diet.\r\n\r\nOthers are willing to eat more fruits and vegetables  but\r\n\r\nare  not willing to eat smaller portions of food.  So  if\r\n\r\ndoctors can identify which behaviour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npatients  are  willing to change, they can assist  in  an\r\n\r\neffective weight-loss programme.

Will  the  Ministry consider  studying  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  individual  obesity  counselling   and\r\n\r\nperhaps later start a grant to encourage the same?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the promotion of healthy\r\n\r\nliving,  such as having a well-balanced diet,  exercising\r\n\r\nregularly  and  not smoking, is essential to  maintain  a\r\n\r\npopulation of healthy citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many diseases can be prevented by maintaining\r\n\r\nhealthy lifestyles.  This means that the Health Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  should not just be persistent but also  accelerate\r\n\r\nsuch promotion. The hallmark of success of such promotion\r\n\r\nis to be able to reach as many people in the community as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the publication of information booklets,\r\n\r\norganising  of  health  talks and  health  screening  may\r\n\r\nincrease  the  level of awareness among  Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\nhealth  matters but it does not make Singaporeans healthy\r\n\r\nif they do not act on this information or advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to adopt a more structured approach to\r\n\r\nensure that health promotion messages are disseminated to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the heartlanders and they  adopt\r\n\r\nhealthy lifestyles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in North-West CDC, we have formed the largest\r\n\r\nnetwork of brisk walking clubs in Singapore. To-date,  we\r\n\r\nhave 75 clubs, comprising over 8,000 members who exercise\r\n\r\nregularly  to  keep  healthy.  I  hope  that  the  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board can be more proactive, to  work  closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  CDCs  to have more effective outreach  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what kind of promotion has\r\n\r\nbeen done to achieve the healthy lifestyle message?   Has\r\n\r\nthis  programme been successful in reaching the community\r\n\r\nat  large? Are there plans to partner with the  CDCs  and\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  key  performance targets  of  the  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion Board?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I want to thank Members\r\n\r\nfor their interest in health promotion. We have made good\r\n\r\nprogress   in   improving  the  health  of  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  need  to reduce the prevalence  of  cancer,\r\n\r\ncoronary  heart disease and stroke, the major  causes  of\r\n\r\nill health and deaths among Singaporeans.  Other diseases\r\n\r\nof public health concern include myopia and osteoporosis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Promotion Board was established two years\r\n\r\nago to spearhead national health education, promotion and\r\n\r\ndisease prevention programmes.  The main thrusts  of  the\r\n\r\nHealth Promotion Board (HPB) are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to educate the public on healthy living. The\r\n\r\nfour pillars of a healthy lifestyle are regular exercise,\r\n\r\nhealthy  eating, no smoking and managing  stress.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad to note that many Members mentioned all these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, where it is cost-effective, screen children,\r\n\r\nadults  and  elderly for common illnesses to  detect  and\r\n\r\ntreat these conditions early for better outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, collaborate with voluntary and community\r\n\r\norganisations, including CDCs, professional organisations\r\n\r\nto ensure a wide reach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, create a supportive environment for healthy\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang brought up issues\r\n\r\non  workplace health promotion.  HPB has been encouraging\r\n\r\ncompanies  to implement a comprehensive workplace  health\r\n\r\npromotion  programme.   Several strategies  are  used  to\r\n\r\nsecure  management support, for example, chief  executive\r\n\r\nofficers  and senior management are invited to  sign  the\r\n\r\nHEALTH  charter,  ie, Helping Employees Achieve  Lifetime\r\n\r\nHealth.    And   through  this  charter,   pledge   their\r\n\r\ncommitment to implement Workplace Health Promotion  (WHP)\r\n\r\nprogrammes in their workplace.  There are also  breakfast\r\n\r\nand  lunch  meetings  which are organised  for  CEOs  and\r\n\r\nsenior management to inform them of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of implementing WHP programmes.  A  booklet\r\n\r\nand  a video CD targeted at CEOs have been developed  and\r\n\r\ndistributed to CEOs to facilitate their understanding  of\r\n\r\nworkplace health concepts. A matching WHP grant of up  to\r\n\r\n$5,000 for each workplace was made available from 2001 to\r\n\r\nencourage  workplaces to implement  WHP  programmes.  To-date,  about 200 workplaces have been awarded the  grant.\r\n\r\nFor a more holistic approach to workplace health, HPB has\r\n\r\nintegrated  occupational health and safety,  productivity\r\n\r\nand worklife balance in the WHP programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPB conducts training courses to equip facilitators\r\n\r\nof workplaces with skills to organise, plan and implement\r\n\r\nWHP  programmes. A guidebook and a video CD  on  WHP  for\r\n\r\nfacilitators  have been developed to help them  plan  and\r\n\r\nstart WHP programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the components of a WHP programme is basic\r\n\r\nhealth  screening.  HPB, in its consultancy and  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for workplaces, emphasises the importance  of\r\n\r\nconducting  basic  health screening  for  their  workers.\r\n\r\nWorkplaces  are  encouraged  to  include  screening   for\r\n\r\nhypertension,  diabetes, high blood cholesterol  and  for\r\n\r\nobesity  in  their health screening packages.   They  are\r\n\r\nadvised  to  monitor  the results of screening  of  their\r\n\r\nworkers and to organise intervention programmes for  them\r\n\r\nbased on the results of screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis wanted to know whether MOH has a\r\n\r\nprofile  of persons suffering from various diseases.   He\r\n\r\nsuggested that health promotion programmes be targeted at\r\n\r\nhigh-risk  groups.  The major causes of  ill  health  and\r\n\r\ndeath  among  Singaporeans are  coronary  heart  disease,\r\n\r\ncancer  and stroke.  The risk factors for coronary  heart\r\n\r\ndisease   are   smoking,   high  blood   pressure,   high\r\n\r\ncholesterol  levels,  obesity,  physical  inactivity  and\r\n\r\ndiabetes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national health surveys conducted regularly by\r\n\r\nMOH  provide information on the prevalence of these  risk\r\n\r\nfactors  by age, sex and ethnic groups.  The 1998  survey\r\n\r\nshowed that the prevalence of these risk\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfactors  is higher among the Malays and Indians, compared\r\n\r\nwith  the  general population.  For example, the  smoking\r\n\r\nhabit  is  most prevalent among Malay men, 43%,  compared\r\n\r\nwith Indian men, 30%, and Chinese men, 24%.  Smoking rate\r\n\r\namong Malay women aged 18-24 years is 13%, compared  with\r\n\r\n5%  among  Chinese  women, and  2%  among  Indian  women.\r\n\r\nDiabetes  is  more  prevalent among  Indians  (16%)  than\r\n\r\nMalays (11%) or Chinese (8%).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health promotion programmes are planned based on the\r\n\r\nresults   of   the  national  health  surveys.    Special\r\n\r\nprogrammes  targeted at the high-risk  groups  have  been\r\n\r\nimplemented.  For example, a special programme  known  as\r\n\r\nthe  Ramandan programme has been implemented  to  address\r\n\r\nthe  high  smoking  rate among the Malay  community.  The\r\n\r\nprogramme is a collaboration between HPB, MUIS and  other\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong had asked about health promotion\r\n\r\nactivities  aimed at minority groups. In general,  health\r\n\r\npromotion  programmes,  such  as  the  National   Healthy\r\n\r\nLifestyle  Campaign, National Smoking  Control  Campaign,\r\n\r\nNational  Myopia  Prevention  Programme,  Breast   Screen\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Osteoporosis  Prevention  Programme\r\n\r\ntarget  all ethnic groups and media campaigns are carried\r\n\r\nin  the four official languages through television, radio\r\n\r\nand the newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the higher prevalence of risk factors for\r\n\r\nchronic diseases among Malays and Indians, special  media\r\n\r\nprogrammes   have  been  produced.   A  20-part   cooking\r\n\r\nprogramme  was  aired  on  Suria  to  educate  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity   on  cooking  tasty  and  healthy  traditional\r\n\r\ndishes.   In  addition, \"Rentak Sihat\" a  13-part  health\r\n\r\nprogramme was also telecast on Suria and focused  on  how\r\n\r\nMalays  can  keep  fit  and stay healthy  through  simple\r\n\r\nexercises.  HPB also works closely with Berita Harian  to\r\n\r\npublish   stories  on  a  variety  of  health   promotion\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Tamil media, a 13-part health\r\n\r\nprogramme  addressing health issues such as diabetes  and\r\n\r\nhypertension, prevention and proper treatment to  prevent\r\n\r\ncomplications  was  produced in  Tamil  for  telecast  on\r\n\r\nVasantham  Central.   We  will  continue  to  focus   our\r\n\r\nattention  on high-risk groups and provide more publicity\r\n\r\non  health  promotion activities in the Malay  and  Tamil\r\n\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are correct that prevention is better than\r\n\r\ncure.  To achieve a healthy lifestyle, we need to  change\r\n\r\nthe  mindset  of  Singaporeans.

And,  in\r\n\r\nFebruary,  a second case was reported. Again, the  doctor\r\n\r\nwas  jailed by the Courts and suspended from practice for\r\n\r\nsix  months  by  the  Singapore  Medical  Council.   Both\r\n\r\ndoctors were ordered to pay penalties of over three times\r\n\r\nthe amount of unpaid taxes by the Courts.  The doctors in\r\n\r\nboth  instances were rightly punished by the  Courts  for\r\n\r\ntheir  offences  but  they were  also  penalised  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I have the Minister for Health's comments on\r\n\r\nthis  kind of \"double punishment\"?  Is the suspension  by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Medical Council, especially the six months,\r\n\r\nnot  too  harsh?  As medical care is a very  personalised\r\n\r\nservice  and  patients under the doctors' care  would  be\r\n\r\naffected   by   the   suspensions,  do   we   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration   the   patients'   needs?    Rather   than\r\n\r\nsuspension  from  practice, would it  not  be  better  to\r\n\r\ndeploy  them to work without pay in our public hospitals,\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals or VWOs?\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health has been recruiting\r\n\r\ndoctors  from  non-traditional sources from  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  such  as  Myanmar whose medical  degrees  were\r\n\r\nrecognised before.

Sir,  I applaud the  mammogram  subsidy\r\n\r\nscheme  for breast cancer by the Health Promotion  Board.\r\n\r\nThis scheme has been a great success in attracting a  big\r\n\r\njump  in  the  number  of  women  going  for  mammograms.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to the increased demand, the women  have  to\r\n\r\nwait  much  longer, almost one month, for the results  of\r\n\r\nthe mammogram.  Sir, I am concerned, especially for those\r\n\r\nwomen  who were told that they needed to go for a retest.\r\n\r\nThere  were  3,500 such women last year, as they  had  to\r\n\r\nwait  a  further six weeks for their results.   The  long\r\n\r\nwait, especially after retest, gave the women much mental\r\n\r\nanguish and anxiety from the suspense of whether they had\r\n\r\nbreast  cancer.  Although the second test  proved  to  be\r\n\r\nunnecessary  for  hundreds of them,  they  were  recalled\r\n\r\nbecause  the  radiologist preferred to play  safe.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  8%  of the women tested were recalled and  all  of\r\n\r\nthem had to pay for the retest, and many of the less well-off found the extra cost to be a burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Health whether our public\r\n\r\ntest  centres  are  able  to cope  with  the  demand  for\r\n\r\nmammograms?

I would like to express\r\n\r\nmy  concern  on  the  high incidence  of  myopia  amongst\r\n\r\nchildren  in  Singapore.   Myopia  is  a  common  disease\r\n\r\namongst  children in Singapore.  One only has to look  at\r\n\r\nthe  photograph of an O-level class and he will see  that\r\n\r\nalmost  all the students in that photograph wear glasses,\r\n\r\nevidencing  that they are myopic.  It is inconvenient  to\r\n\r\nwear  glasses.  Girls do not like to wear glasses because\r\n\r\nit spoils their looks.  As for boys, if they have to wear\r\n\r\nglasses it may affect their chances of being accepted  in\r\n\r\na  sports team, especially in contact sports.  Boys  with\r\n\r\nacute  shortsightedness may not be  accepted  in  certain\r\n\r\njobs,  eg,  a  fighter pilot or to be a commando  in  the\r\n\r\nArmed Forces.  The best situation is, of course, one  who\r\n\r\nhas  good  eyesight and does not need to wear glasses  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the papers recently that myopia can\r\n\r\nbe  completely cured with lasik surgery, but the cost  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  treatment is rather prohibitive.   The  cost  of\r\n\r\nlasik   surgery  for  one  eye  is  almost  $2,400   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it is not possible to get every myopic  person\r\n\r\nto  be cured of the myopia by this form of surgery.   The\r\n\r\nmore  practical  solution  would  be  if  myopia  can  be\r\n\r\nprevented  amongst our children.  I read  in  the  papers\r\n\r\nthat  in  China,  the schools there have a  programme  to\r\n\r\nengage  school children in exercising and relaxing  their\r\n\r\neyes to cut down on the incidence of myopia.  Sir, do  we\r\n\r\nhave such a programme in Singapore?  I also would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether the Government has set aside  a\r\n\r\nbudget to do research on how to prevent our children from\r\n\r\ngetting myopia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, 1 in 4 pregnancies, or 14,000\r\n\r\nbabies  get  aborted each year, and almost 60%  of  these\r\n\r\nabortions were sought by married women.  The reasons\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngiven  by  these women were that they were not  ready  to\r\n\r\nstart  a  family,  or  they did not  want  to  have  more\r\n\r\nchildren.    Would   the  Ministry  of  Health   consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  innovative  ideas  aimed  at  reducing   our\r\n\r\nabortion rates?  We should certainly have more programmes\r\n\r\nto  teach  the  various  methods  of  contraception,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  contraception  and  the   trauma   of\r\n\r\nabortion,   targeting  especially  the   married   women.\r\n\r\nMarried   women   should   be   persuaded   to   practise\r\n\r\ncontraception rather than resort to abortion as  a  means\r\n\r\nof  contraception.  Could there be even more  counselling\r\n\r\nmandated at the crucial time of decision making?  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  it  is time that we looked into giving these  women\r\n\r\nmore  genuine  alternatives,  such  as  less  complicated\r\n\r\nadoption  choices for those who really cannot  afford  to\r\n\r\nhave  more children, and match nanny-services for working\r\n\r\nmothers to rely on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenage abortions are on the increase.

It should be noted  that  in\r\n\r\none  of the tax evasion cases, the SMC granted the doctor\r\n\r\none  month's deferment of his order of suspension so that\r\n\r\nhe  could  have  time to transfer his patients  to  other\r\n\r\nspecialists  for  care  and  management.   The  range  of\r\n\r\npenalties  available  to the SMC  is  prescribed  by  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Registration Act.  The SMC has no  authority  to\r\n\r\nrequire  these  doctors to perform  compulsory  community\r\n\r\nservices, as suggested by the Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo was also concerned about the quality of\r\n\r\ndoctors  from  non-traditional  source  countries.   Non-traditional  source  (NTS) doctors  refer  to  those  who\r\n\r\ngraduated   from   medical   schools   that   have    not\r\n\r\ntraditionally  been  included  in  any  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nversions  of  the Schedule of Registrable Basic  Degrees.\r\n\r\nSuch doctors may be granted temporary registration by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Medical Council to work under  supervision  as\r\n\r\nmedical  officers within the public sector.  A  total  of\r\n\r\n<br><br>258&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTS  doctors  were  granted  temporary  registration\r\n\r\nbetween 2001 and 2002 to fill the vacant MO positions  in\r\n\r\nour  public  sector  hospitals.  These doctors  graduated\r\n\r\nfrom   medical  schools  in  countries  such  as   China,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  India, Myanmar and the Philippines.   Another\r\n\r\n19 doctors from medical schools that were in the pre-1993\r\n\r\nSchedule were also granted temporary registration  during\r\n\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of all temporary registered doctors\r\n\r\nis   closely  monitored  by  their  supervisors  who  are\r\n\r\nrequired to submit assessment reports to the SMC  in  the\r\n\r\nthird  month  of  their appointment, and  at  six-monthly\r\n\r\nintervals  thereafter,  until the  doctor  leaves.   Only\r\n\r\ndoctors  with  satisfactory performance reports  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to have their registration renewed for up to  one\r\n\r\nyear at a time.  All doctors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  poor  or  unsatisfactory reports will  either  have\r\n\r\ntheir  contract terminated immediately, or after  further\r\n\r\nmonitoring,  if  they fail to show improvement  in  their\r\n\r\nperformance.   Only  6%  of the  NTS  doctors  registered\r\n\r\nbetween  2001  and  2002 had their contracts  terminated.\r\n\r\nThe  majority were terminated by the employers  for  poor\r\n\r\nperformance, including poor command of English.  However,\r\n\r\nnone  of  these  NTS doctors have been  involved  in  any\r\n\r\ncomplaint or disciplinary case investigated by the SMC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from our clusters on these NTS doctors\r\n\r\nhas  generally been favourable.  Compared  to  our  local\r\n\r\nMOs,  they are often more experienced, having worked  for\r\n\r\nat  least six years, and many also possess some  form  of\r\n\r\npost-graduate qualification.  There have been some issues\r\n\r\nrelating  to  adjustments to a different work environment\r\n\r\nbut,  on the whole, the clusters have found many of these\r\n\r\ndoctors to be hardworking and committed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo, on behalf of Mr Yeo, had asked about\r\n\r\ntraining  for step-down care personnel and  how  much  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has allocated for this training.   My  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  set  aside $3.3 million for the next three years  to\r\n\r\nprovide advanced training in elderly and continuing care.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  programme, doctors, nurses and allied  health\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  such  as  physiotherapists,  occupational\r\n\r\ntherapists,  medical social workers, case  managers,  and\r\n\r\nothers working in step-down care services, can apply  for\r\n\r\nfunding  support to pursue training or skills  attachment\r\n\r\nat  local  or overseas healthcare institutions  in  areas\r\n\r\nsuch  as  geriatric  medicine, geriatric  rehabilitation,\r\n\r\ndementia and mental health and palliative care.  Trainees\r\n\r\nmust  be Singapore citizens or permanent residents.   MOH\r\n\r\nwill fund 75% of the approved training expenditure, while\r\n\r\nthe   VWOs  will  fund  the  remaining  expenses  of  the\r\n\r\ntrainees.  They will be required to sign a bond  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  VWO upon completion of training.  The duration\r\n\r\nof the bond will depend on the length and location of the\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to ensure that patient care is not\r\n\r\ndisrupted, my Ministry will provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance  of up to  75%  of  the  salary  of\r\n\r\ntemporary  staff employed to cover the work of the  staff\r\n\r\nwho   is   away  on  training.   To  encourage   training\r\n\r\nattachments in local healthcare institutions  such  as  a\r\n\r\npublic  hospital for between 1-3 months,  MOH  will  fund\r\n\r\n100%  of the salary of temporary staff.  We estimate that\r\n\r\na  budget  of  $3.3 million will be adequate  to  provide\r\n\r\ntraining for 90 staff over the three years, comprising 10\r\n\r\nmedical  traineeships in geriatrics,  rehabilitation  and\r\n\r\npalliative  medicine; 12 nursing traineeships in  advance\r\n\r\ngerontology;   and  70  traineeships   in   other   areas\r\n\r\nidentified  to  be  of high priority for  step-down  care\r\n\r\nservice development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that the number of\r\n\r\ntraineeships only serves as an estimate to work  out  the\r\n\r\nbudget.  My Ministry is prepared to support more trainees\r\n\r\nwithin  the  budget allocated.  We are also  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider more funding support, if required.  Our plan  is\r\n\r\nto offer this as part of our overall operating subsidy to\r\n\r\nstep-down  care  service  providers.   We  have   started\r\n\r\ninviting proposals from the VWOs for these awards for  FY\r\n\r\n2003.   The  deadline for submission is 31st March  2003,\r\n\r\nand the feedback has been positive so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked about standards of breast\r\n\r\nscreening  in  Singapore.  Breast Screen  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nnational  breast cancer screening programme, was launched\r\n\r\nin  January  last  year.  A stringent  quality  assurance\r\n\r\nprogramme was implemented from the start of the programme\r\n\r\nto ensure that clinical quality and service standards are\r\n\r\nmet  for both mammograms and the assessment of women with\r\n\r\nabnormal  mammograms.  The programme has also  instituted\r\n\r\nminimum   service   standards  for  waiting   times   for\r\n\r\nappointments   for   mammogram   screenings    and    for\r\n\r\nassessments.  Breast Screen Singapore is available  at  a\r\n\r\ntotal of 11 centres, ie, in 10 polyclinics and the Health\r\n\r\nPromotion Board building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the quality assurance standards are\r\n\r\nmet, the centres are audited\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  accredited every two years.  Hands-on  training  and\r\n\r\ncontinuing education by international experts are carried\r\n\r\nout  on  a  continuing basis for all health professionals\r\n\r\ninvolved in the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo noted that the recall rate for assessment of\r\n\r\nwomen  with abnormal mammograms is about 8%.  This recall\r\n\r\nrate   is  comparable  to  the  national  breast   cancer\r\n\r\nscreening programmes in other countries.  At present, the\r\n\r\naverage  waiting time is three weeks for a mammogram  and\r\n\r\ntwo weeks for an assessment.  My Ministry is prepared  to\r\n\r\nuse private sector services in the national breast cancer\r\n\r\nscreening  programme,  provided they  meet  our  clinical\r\n\r\nquality standards, and we are looking into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam noted that many young people in our schools\r\n\r\nwear  glasses.  My Ministry recognises that myopia  is  a\r\n\r\nmajor  health  problem which needs to be addressed.   The\r\n\r\nHealth   Promotion  Board  launched  a  national   myopia\r\n\r\nprevention programme in August 2001.  The programme  aims\r\n\r\nto  prevent and reduce myopia progression as well  as  to\r\n\r\ndelay the onset of myopia in children.  As the onset  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of myopia occurs mainly during childhood, the\r\n\r\nprogramme    targets   mainly   children   in    schools,\r\n\r\nkindergartens and childcare centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main component of the national myopia prevention\r\n\r\nprogramme  is public education, particularly in  schools,\r\n\r\non  good  eye care habits.   The main message is to  take\r\n\r\nvision  breaks  after every 30-40 minutes of  near  work,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  reading or using the computer.   HPB  has  also\r\n\r\nproduced updated guidelines for teachers on promotion  of\r\n\r\nvision  care  in  schools,  kindergartens  and  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancement of existing vision screening programmes\r\n\r\nin  schools is also emphasised, placing greater  emphasis\r\n\r\non  follow-up  of  students detected to have  myopia  and\r\n\r\nproviding  more intensive counselling and  education  for\r\n\r\nthis  group.  There has also been introduction of  vision\r\n\r\nscreening  in  kindergartens  and  childcare  centres  to\r\n\r\nidentify  children with early myopia or  amblyopia,  lazy\r\n\r\neye syndrome.  For the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlatter,  early  treatment can prevent the development  of\r\n\r\nfunctional   blindness  in  the  lazy  eye.    Pre-school\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are  detected  to  have  defective  vision\r\n\r\nthrough  screening  are referred to  specific  refraction\r\n\r\nclinics in polyclinics for further assessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, about half a million students from Primary\r\n\r\n1  to  Secondary 5 and 43,000 students in kindergarten  2\r\n\r\nwere screened.  In 2003, a similar number of kindergarten\r\n\r\n1  students will also be screened for myopia.  Since  our\r\n\r\nprogramme started, three new refraction clinics have been\r\n\r\nset   up   in  polyclinics  to  provide  refraction   and\r\n\r\ncounselling  services  for pre-school  children  referred\r\n\r\nfrom the screening programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about lasik. At the present time,\r\n\r\nlasik  is  an accepted treatment for treating  myopia  in\r\n\r\nadults.   However, it is still not a standard  treatment.\r\n\r\nAnd the day all eye surgeons give up their glasses and go\r\n\r\nfor  lasik,  we  know it is time to make  it  a  standard\r\n\r\ntreatment!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience in lasik treatment for children is\r\n\r\neven  less  than  adults.  So, that is  why  we  are  not\r\n\r\nadvocating lasik as a standard treatment at this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo was concerned about abortions and\r\n\r\nabortion  numbers in Singapore, and we share her concern.\r\n\r\nThe  total  number of abortions performed has  decreased,\r\n\r\nfrom  16,476  in  1993  to 12,749  in  2002.   Under  the\r\n\r\nTermination of Pregnancy Act, all healthcare institutions\r\n\r\nauthorised  to  perform  termination  of  pregnancy,  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  provide pre-abortion counselling  to  women\r\n\r\nseeking termination of pregnancy.  In addition, 48  hours\r\n\r\nmust  elapse  after  counselling  before  termination  of\r\n\r\npregnancy  can be performed.  This is to allow the  woman\r\n\r\nrequesting  for termination time to review the  situation\r\n\r\nand  decision in the light of information and counselling\r\n\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also working with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development  and  Sports   to   enhance   the\r\n\r\ncounselling process to address the social issues faced by\r\n\r\nmarried women seeking abortion, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  encourage  them  to  continue their  pregnancies   by\r\n\r\nproviding appropriate help.  We are also concerned  about\r\n\r\nteenage  pregnancies and we are working with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  on  this. The Ministry  of  Education  has\r\n\r\nimplemented  a  sexuality education programme  for  upper\r\n\r\nprimary and secondary students.  The programme which  was\r\n\r\ndeveloped  together with the Health Promotion Board  aims\r\n\r\nto  provide  knowledge  about  human  sexuality  and  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  sexual  activity.   It  is  hoped  that\r\n\r\nthrough  this  programme, students would develop  healthy\r\n\r\nattitudes  towards  sexuality  and  be  able   to   build\r\n\r\nresponsible relationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not\r\n\r\nanswered my question on whether or not the Government has\r\n\r\nset  aside  a  budget  to do research to  prevent  myopia\r\n\r\namongst children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Currently, SNEC is conducting\r\n\r\nresearch on myopia and they have a budget for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State\r\n\r\nabout  non-traditional source doctors.  He  said  earlier\r\n\r\nthat  those doctors who showed poor performance and  poor\r\n\r\ncommand  of English had been sent back.  May  I  ask  him\r\n\r\nwhether  it  was fair to have subjected our  patients  to\r\n\r\ntheir care before they were sent back?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On mammograms, could I ask the Minister of State\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry of Health will consider waiving  the\r\n\r\ncharges for retests for the less well-off women?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, with regard to the first\r\n\r\nquestion  on non-traditional source doctors,  during  the\r\n\r\ntime  they  were being assessed when they first  came  to\r\n\r\nwork,  they  were under close supervision of  the  senior\r\n\r\ndoctors.  So there was no compromise on patient care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to her second question, she can send in\r\n\r\na request and my Ministry will study it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Dr Neo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OD 3600.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the Health Sciences Authority\r\n\r\nchanged the blood donor recognition programme for all new\r\n\r\nblood donors with effect from 1st July 2002.  This ruling\r\n\r\nremoved the scheme that subsidises certain consultations,\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  and  day  surgery  charges  for  regular\r\n\r\ndonors.   For example, if hospitalised, there  is  a  50%\r\n\r\ndiscount on ward and meal charges for up to $200 per day.\r\n\r\nAlso,  all  consultations  at polyclinics  are  free.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve this costs the Government about $1.7 million each\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Sciences Authority said that the discount\r\n\r\nsystem  was  stopped  to ensure that  donation  is  truly\r\n\r\naltruistic.  Nonetheless, this ruling has now created two\r\n\r\ngroups  of donors  -  the old donor group that  is  still\r\n\r\nenjoying  the  discount system and  a  disadvantaged  new\r\n\r\ngroup  that  does  not.  Sir, may I ask the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  whether  other  methods of  encouraging  altruism\r\n\r\ncould  have  been  adopted rather than  taking  away  the\r\n\r\ndiscount system?  May I also ask whether this ruling  has\r\n\r\ncaused a decrease in the number of new donors?  Will this\r\n\r\nruling  further exaggerate the perpetual shortage in  our\r\n\r\nblood bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, please go on to your next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singapore's birth rate today has\r\n\r\nsunk  to  a historic low of 1.42, way below the  required\r\n\r\nreplacement rate of 2.1.  It has been reported  that  one\r\n\r\nin  five  married  couples  in  Singapore  now  finds  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to conceive.   The 20% figure shows  Singapore\r\n\r\nmoving  into  the upper end of infertility  rate  in  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries, which ranges between  15-25%.   The\r\n\r\ninfertility rate here has risen steadily since the  early\r\n\r\n1980s when it stood at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naround 10%.  The best productive age for men and women is\r\n\r\nin  their  20s and early 30s, but more men and women  are\r\n\r\npostponing  marriage and procreation.   The  reasons  are\r\n\r\nvaried, and they include the emphasis on careers,  choice\r\n\r\nof   lifestyles  and  economic  considerations.   Couples\r\n\r\nseeking  fertility  treatment  often  undergo  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nanguish  and  stress,  physically, mentally  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfinancially.  I feel that more help should be rendered by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health to such  couples.   Apart  from\r\n\r\nraising  the  amount of Medisave that can be used,  could\r\n\r\nthe  limit of three treatment cycles be further increased\r\n\r\nbecause fertility treatments are often costly?  Would the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Health  consider  subsidising   fertility\r\n\r\nprocedures  and drugs to ease the burden for patients  at\r\n\r\nall fertility clinics in the public hospitals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the Ministry of Health doing anything with\r\n\r\nregard  to  our  low birth rate?  Should  there  be  more\r\n\r\npublic  awareness  raised  with  regard  to  the  various\r\n\r\naspects  of  reproduction,  highlighting  especially  the\r\n\r\nmarital  aspects that are detrimental and  other  aspects\r\n\r\nthat are favourable to procreation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, with regard to Dr Neo's\r\n\r\nquestion  on  the  rescinding of medical benefits  scheme\r\n\r\n(MBS),  it  was  in  line  with  the  best  international\r\n\r\npractices  and  the latest development in  blood  banking\r\n\r\nthat  HSA  rescinded  the  medical  benefits  scheme  for\r\n\r\nregular  blood donors and nominees prospectively for  all\r\n\r\nnew  blood donors with effect from 1st July 2002.  To  be\r\n\r\nfair  to donors from the past, this change does not apply\r\n\r\nto  or affect regular blood donors who are already in the\r\n\r\nMBS by virtue of their previous blood donation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood donors are proactively informed of the change\r\n\r\nin  the MBS.  HSA has also continued to emphasise to  all\r\n\r\nblood donors and to our public the importance of donating\r\n\r\nblood  voluntarily and in the spirit of altruism  without\r\n\r\nexpectation of reward.  If we follow Dr Neo's advice  and\r\n\r\ngive them something for donating blood, then it will  not\r\n\r\nbe altruistic any more.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nline   with  this,  HSA  and  our  national  blood  donor\r\n\r\nrecruiters,  the Singapore Red Cross Society,  have  been\r\n\r\ntaking  steps  to  enhance  the blood  donor  recognition\r\n\r\nprogramme   in  ways  that  do  not  involve  significant\r\n\r\nmaterial  incentives.   This has  included  upgrading  of\r\n\r\nblood  donation  facilities  to  provide  donors  with  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable and pleasant environment and enhancing  donor\r\n\r\nservices to make the blood donor experience more positive\r\n\r\nand  enjoyable.  The Champion Blood Donor Award programme\r\n\r\nhas  also  been  improved  to include  special  ruby  and\r\n\r\ndiamond  awards  at  the 75th and  125th  blood  donation\r\n\r\nrespectively.    Special  youth  programmes   have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  encourage  our  youths  to  donate  blood\r\n\r\nregularly  as part of the healthy lifestyle and community\r\n\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood donors have, on the whole, responded\r\n\r\npositively to the message.  The number of blood donations\r\n\r\ncollected  by HSA in 2002 was 74,750, compared to  66,028\r\n\r\nin  2001,  which  is  a 13% increase.   This  shows  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  respond to a call for altruistic  donation.\r\n\r\nThe  number of new donors has increased 12%, from  13,537\r\n\r\nin  2001  to 15,121 in 2002.  HSA will continue  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore  Red Cross  Society  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nadequacy and safety of the national blood programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo has also asked whether the Government could\r\n\r\nsubsidise  fertility procedures and drugs.  The resources\r\n\r\nwhich  we can devote to healthcare are finite and  should\r\n\r\nbe  targeted  at  the majority of patients  with  medical\r\n\r\nconditions.   Couples can already use their Medisave  for\r\n\r\nassisted  conception procedures and that is  the  current\r\n\r\nassistance  that  they get from the  Government.   But  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  Dr Neo that the real problem is that  people\r\n\r\nare  postponing  their  marriages  and  having  children.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  biological clock in all  women  and  it  is\r\n\r\nticking all the time.  You are most fertile in your  20s,\r\n\r\nand  that is when you should get married and try and have\r\n\r\nchildren.   So  we encourage couples to marry  early  and\r\n\r\nhave their children early.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, can I clarify?

This is probably the  tip  of  the\r\n\r\niceberg as the stigma attached to mental conditions stops\r\n\r\npeople  acknowledging the conditions and seeking  medical\r\n\r\nhelp.  In Singapore, a study in 1998 showed that 9.3%  of\r\n\r\nadults  suffered from anxiety disorders and 7.8% suffered\r\n\r\nfrom  depression.   This incidence  must  have  increased\r\n\r\nlately  with  the economic downturn and the  record  high\r\n\r\nunemployment in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxiety disorder is a condition where sufferers are\r\n\r\nexcessively  worried  about  everything  all  the   time.\r\n\r\nDepression  sufferers  feel  a  deep  sadness  and   lose\r\n\r\ninterest,  sleep  and  appetite  for  prolonged  periods.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are depressed are often dismissed  by  family\r\n\r\nmembers   as  attention  seekers  and  they   are   often\r\n\r\nmisdiagnosed  because they tend to  complain  to  doctors\r\n\r\nabout physical pains, like backache and headache, instead\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaying  what  they  really feel.  Other depression  cases\r\n\r\nseek  treatment  in hospitals; frequently  doctor-hopping\r\n\r\nfrom one specialist to another and thus wasting a lot  of\r\n\r\npersonnel and public resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Ministry of Health whether it is\r\n\r\nabout  time  we  have  more public  awareness  on  mental\r\n\r\nillness?   And what are the preventive measures taken  to\r\n\r\ncushion this impending disability problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, when times are bad, and\r\n\r\nyou  have lost your job, or in danger of losing your job,\r\n\r\nfeeling anxious and depressed is normal.  This is  called\r\n\r\nreactive  depression.   But  it  is  testimony  to  human\r\n\r\nresilience that we all recover from this after  a  while,\r\n\r\nas  we  look for ways to solving the problem.  But  where\r\n\r\ndepression or anxiety occurs for no good reason, that  is\r\n\r\na mental illness and requires treatment and, if possible,\r\n\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health recognises the importance of\r\n\r\npromoting mental health among Singaporeans to prevent all\r\n\r\nmental  illnesses, including endogenous  depression.   To\r\n\r\nplace  greater emphasis on mental health, a mental health\r\n\r\neducation  programme \"Mind Your Mind\" was implemented  in\r\n\r\n2001  by the Health Promotion Board and the Institute  of\r\n\r\nMental  Health.   The programme aims  to  promote  mental\r\n\r\nwellness  and raise awareness of the importance of  early\r\n\r\ndetection and treatment of common mental conditions, such\r\n\r\nas    stress,    depression,   anxiety   disorders    and\r\n\r\nschizophrenia.    The  programme  is  targeted   at   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans - children and adolescents, adults  and  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   A variety of strategies is used to  reach  the\r\n\r\ntarget  groups.   Mass media, talks,  public  forums  and\r\n\r\nexhibitions are carried out to create public awareness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To impart skills to healthcare professionals for the\r\n\r\nearly detection of these diseases, workshops and training\r\n\r\ncourses are carried out.  The programme focuses on stress\r\n\r\nmanagement  in  2001.  We have reached out  to  students,\r\n\r\nadults and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelderly  educating  them on how to manage  stress.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  the  programme focused on the destigmatisation  of\r\n\r\nmental  illness.   We  have tried to  change  the  public\r\n\r\nperception  and  attitudes  towards  mental  illness  and\r\n\r\npeople  suffering from mental disorders.  This year,  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  will  focus on depression and  aims  to  raise\r\n\r\npublic  awareness of the signs and symptoms and treatment\r\n\r\nof depression.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,950,477,220 for Head O ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,593,924,500 for Head O ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have five minutes left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY REPORTING PROGRESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Suspension of Standing Orders)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consent of Mr Deputy Speaker, Question put,\r\n\r\nand agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, progress\r\n\r\nbe   reported  now  and  leave  be  asked  to  sit  again\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\" - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the\r\n\r\nCommittee and took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nreport  that  the  Committee of Supply has  made  further\r\n\r\nprogress  on  the  Estimates  of  Expenditure   for   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  2003/2004, and ask leave  to  sit  again\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Lim Hng\r\n\r\nKiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-eight minutes</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">past Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
