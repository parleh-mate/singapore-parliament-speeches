Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy\r\n\r\nto  note  that the Government, schools, grassroots, and  non-governmental  organisations have taken  pro-active  steps  to\r\n\r\nbuild  bridges and promote understanding between the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities.   For  example, MOE has formed  a  committee  to\r\n\r\npromote   broader   and   deeper  inter-racial   mixing   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  in  schools.   The  Muslim  Religious  Council\r\n\r\n(MUIS) will foster greater understanding about Islam and  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  through  goodwill  visits,  dialogues  and\r\n\r\nactivities with grassroots and other organisations.  A strong\r\n\r\nnetwork of informal links between the respective agencies and\r\n\r\ncommunity organisations enable efforts to be coordinated  and\r\n\r\nexperiences to be shared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Inter-Racial Confidence\r\n\r\nCircles (IRCCs) and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Harmony  Circles, these would be important  vehicles  to\r\n\r\ncatalyse  action  on  the ground and  to  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  trust and confidence.  To guide and  coordinate\r\n\r\nthese  efforts, we have set up a National Steering  Committee\r\n\r\nfor  the IRCCs.  The National Steering Committee can  play  a\r\n\r\nuseful  role to monitor and integrate the efforts of  various\r\n\r\norganisations, both through the formal committee  process  as\r\n\r\nwell as dialogues and sharing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo asked about the criteria for monitoring\r\n\r\nprogress in fostering racial harmony.  The building of  trust\r\n\r\nand  confidence among the different races and religions is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  process.   Organisations  such  as  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  do  monitor the participation  rate  of  various\r\n\r\ncommunities.  This  serves  as  a  broad  indicator  of   our\r\n\r\nintegration efforts.  However, what is important in fostering\r\n\r\nracial  harmony  is  not  to  set rigid  success  indicators.\r\n\r\nRather,  we  must  see  constant  conscientious  efforts   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SEXUAL ABUSE CASES INVOLVING WOMEN AND CHILDREN</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports (a) what is  the  trend  of\r\n\r\nsexual abuse cases involving women and children and (b)  what\r\n\r\nmeasures  are being put in place to deal with and deter  such\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the number of sexual\r\n\r\nabuse  cases  involving children and women in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen  constant  for the past 3 years.  There were  about  400\r\n\r\ncases  investigated by the Police per year for the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  for girls below 16 years.  There was a slight decrease\r\n\r\namong  those aged 16 years and above from 805 in 2000 to  711\r\n\r\nin 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victims are given professional help and support to\r\n\r\nminimise the traumatic impact so that they are able  to  lead\r\n\r\nmeaningful   lives.   In  the  event  that  the  victim   and\r\n\r\nperpetrator  are  staying in the same household,  the  victim\r\n\r\nwill be removed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  place of safety.  The National Standards on the Protection\r\n\r\nof  Children  launched by my Ministry in February  this  year\r\n\r\nensures  that  the management of child protection,  including\r\n\r\nsexual  abuse,  will be prompt and handled with  the  child's\r\n\r\ninterest  as a priority.  The courts also mete out  deterrent\r\n\r\nsentences on perpetrators of child abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the preventive level, key professionals, including\r\n\r\nmedical social workers, doctors, police, social workers, pre-school  and  child  care  teachers are  trained  to  identify\r\n\r\nsymptoms   of   abuse  and  reach  out  to   victims   early.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the Police preventive measures of sexual  abuse\r\n\r\nrun  at  two  levels.   For  the general  population,  Police\r\n\r\nconducts  school  talks for students  on  the  prevention  of\r\n\r\nsexual  abuse, for example, how not to fall prey to molesters\r\n\r\nand  avert  sex predators on the prowl in the Internet  Relay\r\n\r\nChat.   Students are also advised on what to do if one  is  a\r\n\r\nvictim.   A total of 243 such school talks were conducted  in\r\n\r\n2001.   In  addition,  Police  disseminates  advice  on   the\r\n\r\nprevention  of  sexual  abuse through brochures  and  posters\r\n\r\ndisplayed  at  service  counters  of  police  establishments,\r\n\r\nschools  and family service centres.  'Crimewatch' is another\r\n\r\nmedium which Police uses to educate the public on such  crime\r\n\r\nprevention messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For specific target groups, the Criminal Investigations\r\n\r\nDepartment  (CID)  conducts  training  sessions  on  the  law\r\n\r\ngoverning  various  types of sexual offences  and  on  police\r\n\r\nprocedures  to  deal with them.  These target groups  include\r\n\r\nMOE school teachers and members of the Parents Advisory Group\r\n\r\nfor  the Internet (PAGi).   As these individuals have regular\r\n\r\ncontact  with  children and adolescents in  their  respective\r\n\r\nvocations, the training provided by CID creates awareness  on\r\n\r\nhow  to prevent, detect and report instances of sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nWith greater awareness, caregivers and victims alike can take\r\n\r\nnecessary steps to prevent sexual abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, can the Minister give\r\n\r\nus  a  profile of the families at risk, ie, the families that\r\n\r\nare involved in such cases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Our\r\n\r\napproach  to  promoting and nurturing creativity  is  through\r\n\r\ninfusion  across  the  curriculum and through  project  work,\r\n\r\nteaching  methodologies  and the  assessment  system  itself.\r\n\r\nLessons  in  any  subject that arouse a lively  curiosity  in\r\n\r\nstudents  foster  creative  thinking  and  imagination.   Our\r\n\r\nScience   and  Mathematics  programmes,  for  example,   help\r\n\r\nstudents to develop this curiosity by encouraging enquiry and\r\n\r\ngetting  them  to  provide their own solutions  to  problems.\r\n\r\nActivities with open-ended investigations such as  the  Maths\r\n\r\ntrail,  which is an activity conducted outside the classroom,\r\n\r\nrequire  students to use varied strategies to solve  problems\r\n\r\nor seek alternative solutions to problems.  Teachers are also\r\n\r\nconducting   activities  to  make  science  an   experiential\r\n\r\nlearning  for  students, especially  at  the  primary  school\r\n\r\nlevel.    One  activity  in  primary  schools,  for  example,\r\n\r\ninvolves having the students learn more about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves through taking their finger prints.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nan  activity  like project work, which is now  required  from\r\n\r\nprimary  school upwards, provides opportunities for  students\r\n\r\nto  look  at events with fresh perspectives, to come up  with\r\n\r\ntheir   own   responses  to  problems  and  issues   and   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate,  explore and try out new ways of  doing  things.\r\n\r\nProject work also encourages students to break away from  the\r\n\r\ncompartmentalisation of the different subject disciplines and\r\n\r\nexplore  the inter-relationships between different  areas  of\r\n\r\nknowledge when applied to real life situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no single indicator that can give a reliable\r\n\r\nmeasure  of the success of our efforts to promote creativity.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  are  changing  the  assessment  system  in  the\r\n\r\nindividual subjects so that problem solving, inference skills\r\n\r\nand  creative  thinking  are given greater  emphasis  in  the\r\n\r\nassessments.    For  example,  in  English  Literature,   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of unseen material - material that the  students\r\n\r\nhave  not previously seen - in the assessment system develops\r\n\r\nstudents'  quality  of  thinking  and  their  application  of\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  critical reading to the  unseen  passages  of\r\n\r\nprose or poetry.  Such critical appreciation enables students\r\n\r\nto   demonstrate  their  individual  insights  and   original\r\n\r\nthinking beyond text knowledge.  In history, questions  based\r\n\r\non original sources - source-based questions, as they call it\r\n\r\n-  have  been  introduced  to assess students'  thinking  and\r\n\r\nanalytical  skills  in the interpretation and  evaluation  of\r\n\r\nissues  in  their original historical context.   And  in  the\r\n\r\nsciences, we are introducing a new way of assessing practical\r\n\r\nskills  over a period of time instead of a one-off  practical\r\n\r\nexamination, to promote a broader understanding of scientific\r\n\r\nprocess skills associated with scientific inquiry and problem-solving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project work will be required for entry to university in\r\n\r\nfuture,  and  this  is project work that  is  in  most  cases\r\n\r\ninterdisciplinary.   How our students respond  to  these  new\r\n\r\nassessment  items will give some indication of how successful\r\n\r\nwe  have been.

My understanding is that,  presently,  the\r\n\r\nteachers  require  the students to tackle the  problem  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain manner.

This is not a matter of the curriculum or  the\r\n\r\nsyllabus  as  much  as teaching methodologies  in  individual\r\n\r\nschools.   I  have  come across anecdotal examples  that  are\r\n\r\nraised where there might have been too rigid treatment  of  a\r\n\r\nparticular   problem  and  teachers  are   not   sufficiently\r\n\r\nforgiving  of different methods.  These are problems  on  the\r\n\r\nground that are to be expected.  On the whole, I do not think\r\n\r\nwe have a severe problem.

The high cost\r\n\r\nof  medical education is of equal concern to the Ministry  as\r\n\r\nit  is to Members, and indeed the public.  This is taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney  and  we want to make sure that what we are paying,  we\r\n\r\nare  getting our money's worth.  We do ask the same  question\r\n\r\nto  academics when we visit other universities and the  first\r\n\r\nretort  is  yes, it is really expensive business.   Two,  the\r\n\r\naccounting is complex.  Why?  Because your teachers are  also\r\n\r\npractitioners.  They practise, they do research.  Whatever it\r\n\r\nis,  we have to ask ourselves:  one, are we getting value for\r\n\r\nour  money?   Do  we produce good doctors?  Secondly,  is  it\r\n\r\nmoney  well-spent?  MOE subsidises NUS, as I said, to a  tune\r\n\r\nof  $64,000 a year per student.

On a social point of view, one can argue whether\r\n\r\ndespite  that,  you  could  say  that  this  does  not  cover\r\n\r\ndevelopmental cost.

Her\r\n\r\nmain  point  was, if we move on to a completely  unsubsidised\r\n\r\ntrack,  would it create a burden for the undergraduate?   The\r\n\r\nanswer must be yes.  A large proportion of US students  -  as\r\n\r\nwe  know, a lot of US students going to universities, and  at\r\n\r\nthe end of their education, they have huge loans.  We have  a\r\n\r\npeculiar system.  In fact, in Asian countries the culture  is\r\n\r\nsuch  that  the  State bears the cost, the parents  bear  the\r\n\r\ncost.

Compared  to the larger regional  and  community\r\n\r\nlibraries,  the  CCLs are not the most cost-effective.   They\r\n\r\nhelp  to bring the books closer to the children, but they  do\r\n\r\nso at a higher cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB must therefore be satisfied that there is both a\r\n\r\nsufficient level of demand and sustainable support  from  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  before deciding to build a CCL.  To be assured  of\r\n\r\nthe  support  from the community, the NLB would build  a  CCL\r\n\r\nonly  if  there  is a broad based community  organisation  to\r\n\r\nshare  both the building and the running costs.  If Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\ncan  present a case to show that there is demand for  such  a\r\n\r\nfacility,  and that he can ensure the support and  long  term\r\n\r\ncommitment  from  his community, then NLB will  consider  his\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> This time, I am happy to note that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  is willing to give support to the  application\r\n\r\nfor  CCL.

I also support the motion, but I would\r\n\r\nlike to raise two points here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, since our independence more than 30 years ago we\r\n\r\nhave  continuously improved the standard  of  living  of  our\r\n\r\npeople and improved our competitiveness in the world.  Today,\r\n\r\nI  would like to say that even with this economic downturn we\r\n\r\nshould not lose our confidence.  So, my emphasis here is that\r\n\r\nwe  must  maintain our confidence and we must  not  lose  it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, what brand has Singapore created?  To me, the  name\r\n\r\n\"Singapore\" itself is a well-renowned brand name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to commend the DPM and\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister for this very forward-looking and  balanced\r\n\r\nBudget.   Mainly, this Budget aims to restructure our economy\r\n\r\nand  to  bring to our people better lives and better days  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen  the Finance Minister introduced the tax reform, he  has\r\n\r\nalso  introduced  various measures to help Singaporeans  tide\r\n\r\nover the difficult time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we review our CPF scheme, we have to be very\r\n\r\ncareful. Many people feel that the Government's restructuring\r\n\r\nplan  is not going to be confined to those changes which have\r\n\r\nbeen  announced  only.  On May Day, DPM Lee called  upon  the\r\n\r\npeople and the workers to change their work attitudes and  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  this economic downturn more positively.   And  most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  he  said that the Government  will  review  and\r\n\r\nintroduce  reforms  to counter these challenges.   So,  these\r\n\r\nchanges  are  not  solely targeted  at  the  people  or   the\r\n\r\nworkers. I am very comforted by his statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that when we are conducting this economic\r\n\r\nreview,  we  have  to  look  at the  various  industries  and\r\n\r\nsectors,  not just the financial sector or the sectors  which\r\n\r\nare directly related to the economy.   I think that we should\r\n\r\nalso review the service industry, manufacturing industry  and\r\n\r\nother  industries  relating to the quality  of  life  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this Economic Review Committee would also\r\n\r\nconduct some sectoral and regional review.  Why do I  say  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  sectoral review?  I remember that many years  ago\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was  still  in the NTUC, we said that  the  maritime\r\n\r\nindustry  was a sunset industry.  Many people in the maritime\r\n\r\nindustry  were very pessimistic and very negative.   But  two\r\n\r\nweeks  ago when I visited the shipyards, I regained a lot  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  and I am more optimistic about our  economy  now.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  visited Keppel, I learnt that the oil rigs designed\r\n\r\nby  our  local  engineers had already attained  international\r\n\r\npatent, and they command 60% of the world's market.   We  are\r\n\r\nnow servicing some 20% of the world's ocean-going vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we know, our wafer fab industry is in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  recovery.  For example, SSMC (System on  Silicon\r\n\r\nManufacturing Company) has already started\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  new factory in Singapore and UMCI (United Microelectronics\r\n\r\nCorporation) will also start a new plant here next year.  Our\r\n\r\nCreative  Technology commands 60% of the world's  sound  card\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am citing all these examples because yesterday my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleagues mentioned about the  difficulty  of\r\n\r\ngetting  a job nowadays.  In my constituency, the reliefs  we\r\n\r\nare handing out are among the highest in Singapore. Maybe  it\r\n\r\nis  because many of our workers are staying in the south-west\r\n\r\npart  of Singapore.  We registered the retrenched workers  in\r\n\r\nour  constituency and introduced many of them to jobs in  the\r\n\r\nfactories.   I  told  the shipyards that the  Government  was\r\n\r\nproviding training programmes for those who employ workers 40\r\n\r\nyears  old  and above, and we would pay half the  salary.   I\r\n\r\ntold them that the workers I send them would be able to work,\r\n\r\npeople  who  would have no language problem. As soon  as  the\r\n\r\nshipyard  employs them, the Government will pay 50% of  their\r\n\r\nwages straight away.  The company said, \"All right\".  We sent\r\n\r\na  few  hundred workers there when the company had more  than\r\n\r\n1,000 vacancies. Yet, only 150 workers were recruited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I sent applicants to a hotel for jobs.\r\n\r\nI  telephoned the Manager and asked what was the result.   He\r\n\r\ntold me only one woman applicant accepted the job offered  to\r\n\r\nher.   What is the problem?  Are the employers prejudiced  or\r\n\r\nare  there some problems with our workers?  So here  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the workers to make adjustment to  their  own\r\n\r\nattitudes and expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Mayor in the south-west part of Singapore, I will\r\n\r\nstep up efforts to help our workers secure a job.  But I hope\r\n\r\nthat these applicants who are recommended for work would,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible, accept the job offered to them because  we\r\n\r\nhave   actually   looked   into   their   background,   their\r\n\r\nqualifications  and their skills level before  matching  them\r\n\r\nfor  the jobs.  We do not just send anyone to them.  In fact,\r\n\r\nall  these  people  were interviewed, their backgrounds  were\r\n\r\nlooked  into, and companies have also agreed that they  would\r\n\r\ntry their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest  to  accept these applicants recommended by  us  because\r\n\r\nthey  know that we had actually screened them before we  send\r\n\r\nthem over.  So I feel that these workers should just take the\r\n\r\njob  for  the  time being and when the economy has  recovered\r\n\r\nthey could perhaps look for better jobs later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, I said that we had to review the various\r\n\r\nindustries  because  we  should not have  bias  or  prejudice\r\n\r\ntowards  any  particular industry.  So long as this  industry\r\n\r\nhas  some  leading edge I think that we could still  be  very\r\n\r\ncompetitive  in the world market.  We should not just  single\r\n\r\nout  our talents in the financial sector, we should also give\r\n\r\ncredit  to  our  engineers who have created or  invented  new\r\n\r\nproducts and who have obtained international patents for  the\r\n\r\ninventions.  I think that we should give more credit to  them\r\n\r\nand   let  them  have  a  sense  of  satisfaction  for  their\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I want to raise is the informal\r\n\r\nsector.   Many  people may  not be very  interested  in  this\r\n\r\nsector  because we call them \"informal\", and hence  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  mainstream.  Hence, they cannot  fit  into  the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector or the service industry.  When we talk about\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment, normally the people involved are the\r\n\r\nelderly workers.  It is not that they do not want to look for\r\n\r\na  job  but they just have this difficulty in matching.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the telephone operators.  Nowadays, many  companies\r\n\r\nare  looking for telephone operators.  I have introduced some\r\n\r\nwomen, 40 years and above, to a company.  The company told me\r\n\r\nthat  age did not matter, so long as their voices are  decent\r\n\r\nand  presentable to the ears. But eventually  they  were  not\r\n\r\naccepted  because  their  standard of  English  is  not  good\r\n\r\nenough.   Perhaps the company could provide  them  with  some\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee should also look into the\r\n\r\nneeds of this informal sector. We should be more tolerant and\r\n\r\ngive  more allowance to all these people who are not able  to\r\n\r\nfit  into the formal sector.  In our South-West CDC, we  have\r\n\r\nstarted a course for the caring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  new-born babies.  In Australia, all these new-born babies\r\n\r\nare  being  looked after by nannies at home.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwould  also  subsidize for the employment of  these  nannies.\r\n\r\nWith our ageing population, we should also train some workers\r\n\r\nin  the 40s or 50s to look after all the senior citizens  who\r\n\r\nneed  their  care  and  concern.  In   some  industries,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in the bakery or food catering industry,  there  is\r\n\r\nalso space for development.  I am sure that we have all heard\r\n\r\nof the Bengawan Solo Cake Shop.  Bengawan Solo started off as\r\n\r\na  family  business where the owner baked cakes at  home  and\r\n\r\nsold  them  to  her friends and regular customers.  When  the\r\n\r\ncakes  became popular and well-known, she commercialised  her\r\n\r\noperation, and now Begawan Solo has become a household brand.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  HDB  should consider relaxing its  rules  to  allow\r\n\r\nhousewives  to bake cakes and pastries at home for  sale,  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  they  comply  with  the  health  and  environmental\r\n\r\nregulations. I believe that during the festive seasons, quite\r\n\r\na lot of housewives are already doing so, albeit illegally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the schools, there used be some people from the not\r\n\r\nso  well-to-do  families  setting up  stalls  in  the  school\r\n\r\ncanteens  to sell local delicacies, such as mee siam,  kuehs,\r\n\r\ntid-bits  to the school children.  Nowadays, because  of  the\r\n\r\nhygiene requirement, only the major suppliers are allowed  to\r\n\r\nsupply  to the school canteen operators, and all these \"small\r\n\r\nhawkers\"  would not be allowed to sell their goodies  in  the\r\n\r\nschool canteens.  So I feel that in this informal sector, for\r\n\r\nthose  people who are not in the mainstream industries,  some\r\n\r\nform  of  help could be provided to  help them   improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living. I think we should look into their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I want to mention is about our brand-name.\r\n\r\nWhenever  I  go overseas, I feel very proud when  the  people\r\n\r\nthere  express  signs of admiration for our country.  On  one\r\n\r\noccasion  I  went to Harbin, a remote city in the  north-east\r\n\r\npart  of  China.  At the night market, there was  an  elderly\r\n\r\ngentleman who asked me where I came from.  I told him that  I\r\n\r\ncame  from  Singapore, and he exclaimed, \"Oh Singapore!   Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew.\"  Even in a small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnight market in far-away Harbin, people know about Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  name  \"Singapore\" by itself is a brand.  It is  a  brand\r\n\r\nname.    I feel that as a small nation, the question  is  not\r\n\r\nwho  has a bigger piece of the pie.  The most important thing\r\n\r\nis we want to create a bigger pie for more people to share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the well-established Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  need not be restructured. If they have made  their\r\n\r\nname  internationally, let them retain the goodwill  and  the\r\n\r\nadvantages  that  come  with it.   If  the  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  doing well, we should not  downsize  them  or\r\n\r\ndivest  them  completely.  I think the Government  should  be\r\n\r\nmore  magnanimous  and  invite some successful  companies  to\r\n\r\nbecome  partners  of  these Government-linked  companies  and\r\n\r\nthese  smaller  Government  companies.   Of  course,  in  the\r\n\r\nsensitive     and    strategic    industries,     such     as\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, aviation, and defence-related industries,\r\n\r\nwhere the small companies cannot take the lead, then let them\r\n\r\nbe led by the GLCs.  But, we can invite more SMEs, successful\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs or local entrepreneurs to take up shares in the\r\n\r\nbig  GLCs,  or  take over the smaller sized  ones  like,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  companies  in  the  food  industry  or  electronics\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I think most SMEs have these skills.   We  should\r\n\r\nbe  more magnanimous and invite some successful companies  to\r\n\r\nmerge  or  even to take over the management of these  smaller\r\n\r\nGovernment companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how we look at it, we have to stand united.\r\n\r\nWe  should make use of the strength of the GLCs and the local\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  fight for a bigger space in the  international\r\n\r\nmarket.   My  visit to the maritime industry has  boosted  my\r\n\r\nconfidence.  In the past, for safety consideration, a lot  of\r\n\r\nworks  in  the maritime industry were  carried  out  on  land\r\n\r\nrather  than  on  board  on the vessels.  When  I  asked  the\r\n\r\nshipyards  why   people shied away from this  industry,  they\r\n\r\ntold  me that safety in this industry was a great concern  to\r\n\r\nthe  potential  workers.  I think if  we  can  enlighten  our\r\n\r\nworkers more on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naspect,  we should be able to boost their confidence in  this\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise here is that the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee  should  look  not  only  at  the\r\n\r\neconomic matters, but also on our living environment and  our\r\n\r\nquality  of  life.   Yesterday, some  MPs  talked  about  the\r\n\r\nproblem of having children and the desire for a better living\r\n\r\nenvironment.  I feel that perhaps the south-western  part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore has been neglected in our national development   We\r\n\r\nhave Punggol 21.  We have good old Katong, etc.  Jurong seems\r\n\r\nto be neglected nowadays. In the past, Jurong was a show-case\r\n\r\nto   the  developing  countries  on  how  we  developed   our\r\n\r\nindustries,  and  the  bed  of our industrialisation  in  the\r\n\r\n1960s.  It was an industrial estate which we were very  proud\r\n\r\nof. But now, it has lost its glamour.  I would be touching on\r\n\r\nRemaking  Jurong  initiative under MTI in  the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have a review on the various regions.\r\n\r\nMany  regions  have  lost  their  glamorous  characteristics.\r\n\r\nJurong  used to be a very famous place in Singapore.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  Jurong can be more beautiful than the Suzhou Industrial\r\n\r\nPark  in  China.  I hope that this Economic Review  Committee\r\n\r\nwould  also  conduct some regional review,  and  this  review\r\n\r\nwould be able to help improve our quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is on social and welfare services. The\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has provided for double tax rebates for\r\n\r\ndonations  to  charity.  I think it is a very  good  measure.\r\n\r\nBut we should also look into how we could help the charitable\r\n\r\norganisations  to look after the needy people,  for  example,\r\n\r\nthe  handicapped people.  We should change the mindset of the\r\n\r\npeople,  because  in this industry, it is  not  just  welfare\r\n\r\nwork.  In fact, in this aspect, Singapore has done well.   Dr\r\n\r\nAmy  Khor  mentioned about autistic children  yesterday.   We\r\n\r\nhave  done  a lot.  We have many experts in this  field.   We\r\n\r\nshould  look  at  it as a service industry.   We  could  even\r\n\r\nexport  this  expertise.  It could tun out to be a  lucrative\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope that the Economic Review Committee\r\n\r\nwill look not only at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe direct economic fields but also on the living environment\r\n\r\nof the people and the needs of the various sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  city  state.  Unlike other big cities, like New  York,\r\n\r\nLondon and Shanghai, we do not have a natural hinterland that\r\n\r\ncan  act as a buttress or conduit for our city.  The cost  of\r\n\r\nliving in a city can be very high compared to the more  rural\r\n\r\nareas.   But many still want to come into the city  to  live,\r\n\r\nwork and seek their riches and fortune.  And those who cannot\r\n\r\nmake  it  in the city and find it too expensive to  live  in,\r\n\r\nwill move out to other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a natural process of rejuvenation. Take New\r\n\r\nYork,  for  example.  Garments used to  be  one  of  its  key\r\n\r\nindustries  but  when  it became too  expensive  for  textile\r\n\r\ncompanies  to remain in Manhattan, they moved out  and  other\r\n\r\nindustries,  such  as financial services, took  their  place.\r\n\r\nThose  who  cannot make it have moved out and new industries,\r\n\r\nnew  players,  have moved in to continue to  make  the  place\r\n\r\nbuzzing.  The city rejuvenates itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, Singapore has been able to\r\n\r\nrestructure  its  economy.   We  have  transformed  from   an\r\n\r\nentrepot trading centre to an international business hub  and\r\n\r\ndiversified from labour intensive manufacturing to wafer  fab\r\n\r\nplants and other hi-tech industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this has resulted in some segments of our\r\n\r\npopulation  finding it difficult to make the  adjustments  to\r\n\r\nupgrade.  And, in our case, we are uniformly expensive.  Over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  we  have relentlessly upgraded our  environment,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and services to make life more comfortable for\r\n\r\nour   people.    Our  bus  companies  have  introduced   air-conditioned  buses;  road-side stalls  are  done  away  with;\r\n\r\nhawker  centres  have  been replaced by air-conditioned  food\r\n\r\ncourts;  wet  markets  replaced by  supermarkets,  like  NTUC\r\n\r\nFairprice and Cold Storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has not only led to an increase in the cost of\r\n\r\nliving  but also left behind few low-cost alternatives.   And\r\n\r\nthis  has  also led to the problems of high land  prices  and\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of doing business in Singapore that  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh spoke about yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strategy worked well in good times when people were\r\n\r\nearning  decent  incomes and enjoying  increasingly  affluent\r\n\r\nlifestyles.  But when they lose their jobs or have to  suffer\r\n\r\na  drastic pay cut, they find it very difficult to make  ends\r\n\r\nmeet  on a household budget of a few hundred dollars a month.\r\n\r\nThe  basic  costs are still there.  They still need  to  feed\r\n\r\nthemselves and their children, repay their housing loans, pay\r\n\r\nfor  their  utilities  and service and  conservancy  charges.\r\n\r\nThere are no low-cost alternatives to many of the things that\r\n\r\nwe  need  today.  There are very limited ways  to  bring  our\r\n\r\ncosts  down  to a really low level.  Even if one retreats  to\r\n\r\nSembawang, Lim Chu Kang or Pulau Ubin, one cannot lower one's\r\n\r\ncosts substantially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example of Raffles Place. Cheap hawker\r\n\r\nstalls are now a thing of the past.  Lau Pa Sat and Boat Quay\r\n\r\nhave  gone  up-market.  People who work there are  left  with\r\n\r\nlittle  choice  but  to accept the higher cost  alternatives,\r\n\r\nalthough  they  may  still enjoy the  improved  ambience  and\r\n\r\nsurroundings.   In  other  major cities,  including  big  and\r\n\r\ninfamously  expensive  ones like  Tokyo,  I  find  there  are\r\n\r\nalternatives  to  meet varying levels  of  affordability.   I\r\n\r\nremember  visiting  Tokyo some years back  on  a  shoe-string\r\n\r\nbudget   and   was  able  to  find  very  local,   relatively\r\n\r\ninexpensive  food  stalls in the alleys  just  off  the  main\r\n\r\nthoroughfares of expensive precincts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike Mr Inderjit Singh who called for a general\r\n\r\nreduction in prices and adjustment in asset values, I believe\r\n\r\nwe  have  to create an environment that allows for a  natural\r\n\r\nrejuvenation and offers alternatives for varying  needs.   We\r\n\r\nstill   have   successful  companies  that   require   modern\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, facilities and services and  are  willing  to\r\n\r\npay for them, and others who require a lower cost environment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  operate  in.  To cater to these differing  demands  would\r\n\r\nrequire a relaxation of rules, less centralised control, more\r\n\r\nprivatisation  and devolution of ownership and responsibility\r\n\r\nto private hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we have a pretty rigid model for the\r\n\r\nprogression of our young.  According to the model,  they  are\r\n\r\nto  study  hard, get good grades, go to university,  if  not,\r\n\r\nthen to polytechnic, and if not, then ITE, and it is not  the\r\n\r\nend.   After graduation, they are expected to get a good job,\r\n\r\nget  married, buy a new HDB flat from the Government and have\r\n\r\nbabies.   After some years, property prices rise,  they  sell\r\n\r\nthe flat and use the capital appreciation as down-payment for\r\n\r\na  larger  flat,  and  so on and so on.   But  what  if  this\r\n\r\nbeautiful order gets shaken and goes out of sync?  Is there a\r\n\r\nfall-back position?  Sir, we must create some flexibility  in\r\n\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times like these, when jobs are in shortage and\r\n\r\nacquiring the right skill set is a problem for some, we  have\r\n\r\nto  step  in  to help those who are caught in a bind  by  the\r\n\r\nsudden  change  in economic climate.  They  have  suffered  a\r\n\r\nmassive  cut in income and have no alternatives to  turn  to.\r\n\r\nThey  look  forward  to some help, some  breathing  space  to\r\n\r\nregain  their  strides and start life anew.   Many  of  those\r\n\r\naffected  are in their middle age, too old to start from  the\r\n\r\nbottom, too young to retire and too weighed down by financial\r\n\r\ncommitments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are therefore disappointed with the Budget which\r\n\r\nthey  see as one that focuses on the problems of the  rich  - their tax bills and car prices.  With the 2% increase in  GST\r\n\r\nand  income  tax reduction, the common grouse  is  that  this\r\n\r\nBudget  is for the higher income group.  While the change  in\r\n\r\nfiscal policy is for the good of the economy structurally and\r\n\r\nin  the  longer run, how are we meeting the short and  medium\r\n\r\nterm problems the average wage earners face?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise three specific issues about this\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Electronic Road Pricing. The sudden change in\r\n\r\ncar ownership cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaces existing vehicle owners at a disadvantage.  The change\r\n\r\nin  scheme benefits those who are buying new cars.   Existing\r\n\r\nowners  with cars that are more than five years old suffer  a\r\n\r\ndrop  in the resale value of their cars because the price  of\r\n\r\nCOE  is  expected to drop with the increase in the number  of\r\n\r\nCOEs  and the drop in new car prices.  The expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nERP  scheme  will  hit  all vehicle drivers  alike,  but  the\r\n\r\nexisting  owners would not have the benefit  of  the  upfront\r\n\r\nsavings.   An expanded ERP will also place a heavy burden  on\r\n\r\nthe small time businessmen and the salesmen who have to be on\r\n\r\nthe road a lot of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the GST increase. The 2% increase in GST is\r\n\r\nseen  as helping to balance the Budget after giving the  rich\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  their  tax savings.  While in absolute  terms  the\r\n\r\nhigher  income  group will pay more in GST  as  they  consume\r\n\r\nmore,  in  relative  terms, the indirect tax  is  regressive.\r\n\r\nThis  will widen the economic gap between the top and  bottom\r\n\r\ntiers of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High tax rates can be a disincentive for people to work\r\n\r\nhard.  But low tax rates can also give the higher end of  the\r\n\r\nlabour  supply  curve more disposable income,  and  this  may\r\n\r\nresult  in  people not wanting to work so hard.   After  all,\r\n\r\ntheir needs are met and they might rather use their time  for\r\n\r\nleisure pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax cuts are important. But I share Dr Tan Cheng Bock's\r\n\r\nconcerns   that  we  should  also  focus  on   creating   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  that encourage the rich to  invest  their  tax\r\n\r\nsavings  in  Singapore.   In the early  1980s  when  Margaret\r\n\r\nThatcher  cut  British personal tax drastically,  instead  of\r\n\r\ninvesting  in local enterprises, high income British  earners\r\n\r\nused their tax savings to buy their second home in Spain  and\r\n\r\nsouth of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, dividends. Prudent companies generally only\r\n\r\ndistribute  10% to 20% of their annual profits as  dividends.\r\n\r\nBut  they pay tax at the corporate tax rate on 100% of  their\r\n\r\nprofits.  I therefore wonder why we should want to tax  those\r\n\r\nwho receive dividends, which represent only a small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npercentage  of total profit.  Can we make some  allowance  by\r\n\r\ngranting  tax credits for certain categories of people,  like\r\n\r\nretirees  whose source of income is the dividends from  their\r\n\r\ninvestments?   The returns on the investment  will  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  retirees  to  hold on to their investments  and  not  to\r\n\r\nspeculate by trading in stocks.  This will also encourage CPF\r\n\r\naccount  holders not to put all their money  in  housing  but\r\n\r\nkeep  some  for investment in equities.  Taxing dividends  at\r\n\r\nthe  corporate tax rate may also convince more  companies  to\r\n\r\nhave their domicile outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, favourable income tax alone is not sufficient to\r\n\r\nattract  expatriates to relocate here.  Similarly,  tax  cuts\r\n\r\nare  only  one of the measures to attract local  and  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, first of all, have the conducive business\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  opportunities  for  people  to  invest  in.\r\n\r\nSecurity  and  stability are key considerations  for  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front page headlines of The Sunday Times of 28th\r\n\r\nApril  2002  stated: \"Al-Qaeda `may set up base in South-east\r\n\r\nAsia'\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to a constituency function that morning,\r\n\r\nsome residents were concerned that such headlines would cause\r\n\r\nalarm  to prospective foreign investors.  They asked  whether\r\n\r\nforeign  investors would be deterred from investing  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.  One of my grassroots leaders told me that he knew of\r\n\r\na  number  of  American MNCs who had decided to divert  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  elsewhere  and others  who  had  decided  not  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with  subsequent phases of their  planned  expansion\r\n\r\nhere because of perceived regional security issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in the course of this debate and the Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply,  we  would  have an update on how  we  are  doing  in\r\n\r\nattracting  foreign  direct  investments  and  whether  those\r\n\r\nforeign  investors  who  had committed  to  invest  here  had\r\n\r\ndeferred their investment plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans, both professional investment\r\n\r\nanalysts and ordinary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street, are disheartened that we  are  losing  out\r\n\r\nwhile  Malaysians generally feel upbeat about their  economic\r\n\r\nperformance and prospects because they had scored a number of\r\n\r\nsuccesses against us recently.  We need success stories.   We\r\n\r\nneed  more of the likes of Creative Technology and  Sim  Wong\r\n\r\nHoo.   We  need  inspiring stories to boost  the  morale  and\r\n\r\nspirit of Singaporeans that it is not all doom and gloom, and\r\n\r\nthat there are gems among us and we can do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of months ago, I was introduced to an unknown\r\n\r\nlocal  company that can be a real gem.  First of all, let  me\r\n\r\ndeclare that I have no pecuniary interest whatsoever in  this\r\n\r\ncompany.  This company, Stikfas, creates and makes toys.  And\r\n\r\nthis is \"Alpha Male\" - created, designed and manufactured  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Within one month of launching their sales on  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  that  was about four months ago, they  caught  the\r\n\r\nattention of a major US toy multinational.  Even George Lucas\r\n\r\nof  the  Star Wars series got to know about this toy and  its\r\n\r\nSingaporean  creators because it is a system or  platform  of\r\n\r\ntoys  that would see no end in its potential line-ups.   What\r\n\r\nmakes it so special and creative is the ball and cavity joint\r\n\r\nthat  allows  for  many degrees of movement  that  would  see\r\n\r\nendless  possibilities  in  terms  of  poseability.   The  US\r\n\r\nexperts  think this toy system can become a legend comparable\r\n\r\nto Lego.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This toy was created in a typical garage-type start-up - in a shophouse in Katong off Mountbatten Road. The ground\r\n\r\nfloor is used as an animal shelter.  There were four dogs and\r\n\r\nnine  cats  when  I last went there.  Take a  step  into  the\r\n\r\nshophouse  and  the  smell of dog food and  animal  pooh  was\r\n\r\nunmistakeable.  But when I ventured up the stairs, the  whole\r\n\r\nof the second floor was a different world.  Stacked from wall\r\n\r\nto  wall was a multitude of toys.  Thousands of them  of  all\r\n\r\nvarieties.  This is a four-person Singapore start-up, set  up\r\n\r\nwith the vision to create toys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the \"Alpha Male\" and its potential, the US toy\r\n\r\nmultinational and toy fanatics all over the world were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nastonished  to find a creative toy company in Singapore.   To\r\n\r\nthem,  the  toy universe comprised only of North America  and\r\n\r\nJapan.   The  American  top executives  did  not  know  where\r\n\r\nSingapore  was.  Singapore was not on their  map.   Yet,  the\r\n\r\ncreation  was so good and so enticing that they were prepared\r\n\r\nto fly half way round the world to come here to meet and work\r\n\r\nwith our local chaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans even offered to buy the Singaporean start-up. But the founders are staunch Singaporeans. Despite the\r\n\r\nlure  of  millions  of dollars to sell their  company  and  a\r\n\r\ngolden  opportunity to move to the US to work  with  the  big\r\n\r\nboys  and  their  hi-tech equipment,  these  Singaporean  toy\r\n\r\nmakers  firmly refused.  Relocation out of Singapore was  not\r\n\r\nnegotiable.  They are firmly rooted in Singapore for now.  Mr\r\n\r\nBan,  the founder, told me he would miss his laksa, char kway\r\n\r\nteow and his friends too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this US multinational has secured a licence from\r\n\r\nour  local start-up to jointly develop and market the toy and\r\n\r\nits  derivatives worldwide.  This is something quite  unheard\r\n\r\nof   -  that  a  Singapore  company  could  license  its  toy\r\n\r\ntechnology  to  a  US MNC.  I guess we will  be  hearing  and\r\n\r\nseeing  more  of  this  little guy.   But  more  importantly,\r\n\r\nwhether   through   remaking   Singapore,   whether   through\r\n\r\nrestructuring  our  economy, changes to  our  tax  system  or\r\n\r\nfinancial  incentives,  we must create  a  society  that  can\r\n\r\nproduce, support and nurture winners like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many who believe in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAdversity will drive us to seek out new frontiers.  We  still\r\n\r\nhave many gems, and there will be success stories coming from\r\n\r\namong us.  We must not lose heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\ndistinguishing  feature of this Budget is to  shift  the  tax\r\n\r\nburden from the corporate profits and the higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  people  to the ordinary citizens in  the  medium  and\r\n\r\nlower  income groups.  Originally, the principle of  taxation\r\n\r\nis   to  tax  according  to  the  company's  profit  and  the\r\n\r\nindividual's  income,  and  the  Government's  role   is   to\r\n\r\nredistribute  the wealth through taxation.  If  reduction  in\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  can  serve  to attract  foreign  investments,\r\n\r\nthereby creating more jobs for Singaporeans or bringing  them\r\n\r\nhigher income, it is well and good.  But the question is when\r\n\r\nthe  investors decide whether or not to invest in a  country,\r\n\r\nwill the sole consideration be on the tax rate alone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government says that because of a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  corporate and personal income tax  rates,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will run into deficit and therefore  we  have  to\r\n\r\nshift  the  burden to the ordinary citizens.  This is  indeed\r\n\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest beneficiary of this round of tax reduction\r\n\r\nis   the  small  group  of   high  income  earners  and   the\r\n\r\nconsequence  is  that all Singaporeans will have  to  bear  a\r\n\r\nheavier tax burden.  So is the Government looking after  this\r\n\r\nsmall  group  of  rich high earners, or the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary Singapore citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, before this announcement, the maximum rate\r\n\r\nin  personal  income  tax  has already  been  reduced  to  an\r\n\r\neffective  rate  of  22.1% after  tax  rebate.   Why  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  saying that the reduction in personal income  tax\r\n\r\nwill result in substantial loss to the Government and that it\r\n\r\nhas to raise the GST?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this Budget, it is apparent that there is no\r\n\r\nnecessity  for the Government to raise the GST in 2003.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  says  that  by  raising  the  GST  to  5%,  their\r\n\r\nestimated  revenue  loss  will  be  $1.3  billion.   But  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Restructuring  Shares (ERS)  alone  will  cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  $1.2  billion.   The  difference  is  only   $100\r\n\r\nmillion.  Will the Government run into financial deficit just\r\n\r\nbecause it collects $100 million less in tax?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also said that by reducing the\r\n\r\npersonal income tax and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporate tax to 22%, the Government will lose $1.32  billion\r\n\r\nin  revenue.  In 2004, when it is further reduced by 2%, what\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  estimated loss?  And if we  reduce  only  the\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax by 2%, and not the personal income  tax,  what\r\n\r\nwould the Government's financial situation be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government's Net Investment Income (NII) is\r\n\r\npushed up to the ceiling provided for under the Constitution,\r\n\r\nand  if  our economy has improved, coupled with the increased\r\n\r\nrevenue  from  other  indirect  taxes,  would  it  still   be\r\n\r\nnecessary to raise the GST?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Statement, the Finance Minister stated\r\n\r\nthat by reducing the ceiling of personal and corporate income\r\n\r\ntax to 20%, the Government would lose some revenue, amounting\r\n\r\nto  some 9% of its annual tax revenue.  What is the basis  on\r\n\r\nwhich the decision is made that the GST must be adjusted  now\r\n\r\nfor  the  2004 Budget year?  Please tell us, if the corporate\r\n\r\ntax is reduced to 20% in 2004, what would be the Government's\r\n\r\nrevenue loss? If the personal income tax is reduced to 20% in\r\n\r\n2004, what would be the Government's loss in revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this reduction of corporate tax and income tax\r\n\r\nto  20% is something that will happen only in the year  2004.\r\n\r\nWhy  are  we  starting to increase our GST in the year  2003?\r\n\r\nHas the Government considered other means to obtain a balance\r\n\r\nin  our  Budget or because the increase of GST  is  the  most\r\n\r\nconvenient and easiest method for the Government to  fill  up\r\n\r\nits coffers immediately?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should review certain items of the Main\r\n\r\nand Development Estimates, and explain to the people that  if\r\n\r\nGST  is  not increased, the Government would not be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  these  services,  so that the  people  will  clearly\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  it  is necessary for  the  GST  rate  to  be\r\n\r\nincreased.  For  example, this Budget decides  to  lower  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  tax and road tax.  Is it really necessary  to  lower\r\n\r\nthese  taxes, causing revenue loss and thereby warranting  an\r\n\r\nincrease in GST?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, the Government is giving double tax\r\n\r\nreliefs to donations to charity.  Philanthropists who have  a\r\n\r\nheart  to donate to charity will not withdraw their donations\r\n\r\njust  because the Government is not giving them tax  reliefs.\r\n\r\nIf  by  not giving them the reliefs, the Government can avoid\r\n\r\nraising  the  GST, then the philanthropists will surely  feel\r\n\r\nthat  their  donations  are  more  meaningful,  because  such\r\n\r\ndonations  will  benefit not only certain organisations,  but\r\n\r\nall the people of Singapore.  They will be very happy indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upgrading of HDB flats, the Government has set\r\n\r\naside  some $300 million for this upgrading programme.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  Government says that there will be a budget deficit  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  it  needs to raise the GST, does it mean  that  by\r\n\r\ncarrying  on with the upgrading programme, it will  make  the\r\n\r\nincrease   in   GST  inevitable?   Hitherto,  the   impending\r\n\r\nupgrading  projects  would cost some $5.8  billion.  Can  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  a choice as to whether they want  upgrading  or\r\n\r\nGST?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Finance Minister announced the GST increase, he\r\n\r\nalso  announced  an  offset package.  The  media  immediately\r\n\r\nfollowed  up and publicised vigorously how this package  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  people.  But the feedback I received  from  the\r\n\r\npeople is that the Government is giving you a piece of candy,\r\n\r\nand  in return it is going to cut a piece of flesh from  your\r\n\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also announced the establishment of a\r\n\r\nCommittee to Combat Profiteering. Let me tell the Government,\r\n\r\nat  the  moment, the small-time businessmen and  hawkers  are\r\n\r\nfaced   with   the   predicament  of  bad  business,   strong\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  high operating cost. They  should  consider\r\n\r\nthemselves  lucky if they can just survive.  How  would  they\r\n\r\ndare  to  raise  their prices and profiteer  in  the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances?    I think most of them would probably  absorb\r\n\r\nthe  additional cost after the GST increase, and swallow  all\r\n\r\ntheir miseries in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most ridiculous to blame the small-time\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and hawkers for raising the prices!  Is  it  not\r\n\r\nbecause the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  has raised the GST first? If you say  the  small-time  businessmen and hawkers are profiteers,  then  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment, which raises the GST, must surely be the  biggest\r\n\r\nprofiteer - the main culprit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the revenue for the financial year 2001, we can see\r\n\r\nthat  even without reducing our corporate and personal income\r\n\r\ntax  rates,  the  Government's tax revenue had  already  been\r\n\r\nreduced  by $2 billion. As for the GST, even if the tax  rate\r\n\r\nis  not increased, the Government's tax revenue could only be\r\n\r\n$550  million  less.   Apparently, at the  time  of  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn, the corporate and personal income tax would greatly\r\n\r\naffect  the  Government's revenue. On  the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's revenue from GST will not necessarily be slashed\r\n\r\nsubstantially because of the economic downturn.  GST  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  magic  wand  to  generate  financial   surplus.\r\n\r\nWhether  the economy is good or bad, you have to pay GST  for\r\n\r\nyour  food,  clothing, transportation, accommodation  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. The Government could just sit idle and enjoy the fruit\r\n\r\nof  other  people's labour, with a guaranteed stable revenue.\r\n\r\nThis  is indeed the real reason for the Government's decision\r\n\r\nto increase the GST!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to take part in the debate on the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very beginning, I had the same concern as Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang  in  thinking that the Budget was  diverting  or\r\n\r\nshifting the burden of tax from a small group of companies to\r\n\r\nthe general public.  But after further analysis and study  of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget, I am convinced that this is not the case. If  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  want the general public to bear the cost of GST  and\r\n\r\nmake  the necessary changes to our economy, then we will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  attract  foreign investors to  Singapore.  That\r\n\r\nmeans,  no  additional jobs will be created for  our  people.\r\n\r\nMany  people  will stay unemployed and have no income.   They\r\n\r\nwill have no money to spend, and hence no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGST  to pay. That being the case, 3%, 5% or 0% GST will  make\r\n\r\nno difference to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang's farfetched thinking that the higher\r\n\r\ncost  of  living is the result of GST is far too  simplistic.\r\n\r\nMany people like to say, \"Look, 30 years ago,  I paid only 30\r\n\r\ncents  for  a  plate of char kuay teow.\"  But now,  the  same\r\n\r\nplate of char kuay teow costs $3.  You may say that the price\r\n\r\nhas gone up ten-fold. But, is that the whole truth?  The fact\r\n\r\nis,  it  is not so simple.  Thirty years ago, when I  was  10\r\n\r\nyears  old,  my father's monthly income was only $100.   Now,\r\n\r\nthe average family income, if you take the median income,  is\r\n\r\nabout $3,600.  So the standard of living has gone up, so have\r\n\r\nprices of goods.  This is a general phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we restructure to face the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of globalisation and  a knowledge-based  economy,\r\n\r\nwe have to make a lot of adjustments and restructuring.  Many\r\n\r\ntimes,  we  have  to  make bold changes  in  many  areas,  in\r\n\r\ntaxation, in employment practice, CPF scheme, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, changes always bring uncertainties. Uncertainties\r\n\r\ncause  anxiety,  and  there will be resistance.  As  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  with  many limitations, we have to  be  resolute  in\r\n\r\nmaking  and accepting tough decisions and move on if we  want\r\n\r\nto  survive  and  be successful.  We need to  anticipate  and\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves  for  any possible  social  and  political\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital divide would bring about the economic divide\r\n\r\nbetween those who make it in the new economy and those who do\r\n\r\nnot. Consequently, the income gap would also be enhanced.  If\r\n\r\nthe Government is unable to effectively redistribute some  of\r\n\r\nthe wealth to cater for the needs of those who could not make\r\n\r\nit,  there  is  this  possibility that a social  divide  will\r\n\r\nappear.  Eventually, we may face political  divide  when  the\r\n\r\nsocially  disadvantaged begin to harbour the impression  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  being taken care of.  I am sure nobody  would\r\n\r\nwant to see this happening in Singapore. .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the threat of widening wealth\r\n\r\ninequality is real. I recently read\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  article in the Harvard Business Review which  explained\r\n\r\nthe  Network  Model of economies. I am no economist.   But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that this is a mathematical model proposed by Jean-Philippe  Bouchaud  and Marc Mezard from  the  University  of\r\n\r\nParis. The model can track the degree of inequality of wealth\r\n\r\ndistribution   and   shows  how  the  distribution   can   be\r\n\r\ninfluenced. Specifically, the two researchers found that  the\r\n\r\ngreater  the volume of money flowing through the economy  and\r\n\r\nthe more often it changes hands, the greater the equality  of\r\n\r\nwealth distribution. Conversely, the more volatile investment\r\n\r\nreturns are, the richer the rich tend to get.  The example of\r\n\r\nthe  United  States was quoted in the article. In the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  the  1980s and 1990s were dominated by  free  market\r\n\r\nideology and government deregulation, much of it defended  by\r\n\r\nthe  idea  that  wealth  would  trickle  down  to  the  poor.\r\n\r\nEverything was done to encourage investment activity  of  all\r\n\r\nkinds,  regardless of risks involved.  Did the wealth trickle\r\n\r\ndown?  No, wealth distribution in the United States today  is\r\n\r\nsignificantly  less  equitable than  it  was  30  years  ago.\r\n\r\nWealth  is  more  concentrated than it  is  in  the  European\r\n\r\nnations.  The  article explains this phenomenon  stating,  \"A\r\n\r\ndramatic  increase  in  investment  activity,  unmatched   by\r\n\r\nmeasures to boost the flow of funds between people, ought  to\r\n\r\nlead to an increase in wealth inequality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article also mentions the effects of income tax,\r\n\r\ncapital  gains tax and sales tax. According to  the  article,\r\n\r\nboth  income tax and capital gains tax reduce differences  in\r\n\r\nwealth   by   redistribution  and  discouraging   speculation\r\n\r\nrespectively.  On  the  other hand,  sales  tax,  even  those\r\n\r\ntargetted  at  luxury goods, might exaggerate differences  in\r\n\r\nwealth  by dampening purchasing power and encouraging  people\r\n\r\nto invest more of their money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this Budget, the proposal to give double tax\r\n\r\nreliefs   to   donations  to   charitable  organisations   is\r\n\r\ncommendable. I must declare my interest as I am working for a\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisation. I would suggest that the Government\r\n\r\nshould take a bolder step to give double tax reliefs even  to\r\n\r\nthose who donated with-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  naming opportunities. We should welcome individuals  and\r\n\r\norganisations who want buildings/rooms/facilities to be named\r\n\r\nafter them. We could publicise these donations and make  good\r\n\r\nexamples  of  all those buildings and facilities to  showcase\r\n\r\nhow  many  people  benefit from such good deeds.  This  would\r\n\r\npromote  the  value system and culture that  would  hopefully\r\n\r\nproduce more philanthropists like the late Mr Tan Kah Kee and\r\n\r\nthe late Mr Lee Kong Chian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For donations enjoying double tax relief, the Government\r\n\r\nactually bears about 40 cents of every dollar donated because\r\n\r\nof   the   tax   incentives.   However,   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  (VWOs)  also receive  substantial  amounts  of\r\n\r\ndonations  from  members of the public  who  are  not  paying\r\n\r\ntaxes.  The  Government  should consider  providing  matching\r\n\r\ngrants to VWOs on every dollar they raise from these non-tax-payers, in the spirit of double tax relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot create a more caring society just\r\n\r\ndepending  on  tax  relief  alone.   We  should  continue  to\r\n\r\ncultivate  the  public-spiritedness  and  community   bonding\r\n\r\nthrough   education  and  involvement  of  people.  Community\r\n\r\ninvolvement  programmes  (CIPs)  in  the  schools  are   good\r\n\r\nstarting   points.  However,  CIPs  should   be   made   more\r\n\r\ninteresting and motivating. Students should not  be  made  to\r\n\r\nfeel \"compelled\" into doing these good deeds. CIP initiatives\r\n\r\nshould  come  from  students  and  not  pre-arranged  by  the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we can also encourage the charitable\r\n\r\norganisations and  grassroots organisations to jointly launch\r\n\r\ncommunity  services  and  voluntary work.  For  example,  our\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  the Northwest CDC jointly run  a  domiciliary\r\n\r\nservice  that provides medical and nursing care to the  home-bound  patients. This programme has a special  feature,  that\r\n\r\nis,  we  are  able to make use of the network  of  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations to help those families which are  genuinely  in\r\n\r\nneed.   At  the  same  time,   we are able  to  recruit  more\r\n\r\nvolunteers, give them the training and allow them to go  back\r\n\r\nto their own community to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has provided certain\r\n\r\nreliefs as a means of redistribution of wealth.  Just now, Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia  Khiang  said that while giving away  the  Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares, it gives away more than $1 billion with\r\n\r\none hand and takes back the money through GST with the other.\r\n\r\nBut,  by this kind of relief to redistribute wealth to  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  in need, these families would  have the  money   to\r\n\r\nspend  on  things  they  need, and the  money  would  be  re-channelled into the economic system to stimulate the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, in order to meet the\r\n\r\nchallenges,  we  must take bold steps to propel  our  economy\r\n\r\ninto  new  heights.  However, we should always be mindful  of\r\n\r\nour fellow citizens who may fall out along the way and extend\r\n\r\na  helping  hand to them. Let us build up our social  capital\r\n\r\nwhile we accumulate the economic wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Budget tabled by Deputy Prime Minister  Lee\r\n\r\nis  a Budget that has taken cognizance of the world situation\r\n\r\nand  is in keeping with it.  The world situation is different\r\n\r\nnow,  therefore we have to restructure our economy to  create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs.  This statement seems to be simple when one hears\r\n\r\nit.   The  trouble is that the Government is forward-looking,\r\n\r\nand  the  people  look but cannot see.  Many  people  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand.   After hearing the whole Budget  Statement,  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  thing that strikes them is that the  GST  rate  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be increased.  They would also like to know whether\r\n\r\nthe  relief package would be adequate to cope with the rising\r\n\r\ncost  of  living.   The  review  on  CPF  will  affect  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  commitment.   They  are  also  afraid   that   the\r\n\r\nunscrupulous businessmen would jack up their prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, undue worries coupled with suspicions will lead\r\n\r\nto  divisiveness.   As  the Member for Hougang  alleged,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is giving you a piece of candy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  cut  out a piece of flesh from your body.   People  are\r\n\r\nshocked  to  hear  that the GST will be  increased.   So  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to give them some kind of tranquiliser to calm\r\n\r\nthem  down.   The extra 2% in GST may pain you.  The  Teochew\r\n\r\npeople would say, ba tia (meaning pain in the flesh). But the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Member  has  exaggerated  by  saying   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will cut a piece of flesh from you.  You may  feel\r\n\r\nsome pain on your flesh, but no flesh will be cut out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the world is indeed changing and\r\n\r\nchanging very fast.  But for people who are preoccupied  with\r\n\r\nearning  a  living, they have heard a lot  but  they  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand.  If a Member of Parliament like Mr Low  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand,  how  do  we  expect  the  ordinary   people   to\r\n\r\nunderstand?  They may be confused by what they have heard and\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  it.  The  world  is  changing  very  fast  and\r\n\r\nbecoming  very  sophisticated.  It is  too  complex  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  understand.   Therefore,  we  should  avail  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to explain to the Singapore people why we need to\r\n\r\nadapt to the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for people who have lost their jobs or\r\n\r\npeople  who  are likely to lose their jobs in the process  of\r\n\r\neconomic restructuring, they know that they are facing a  new\r\n\r\nworld. What worries them is that they will not be able to get\r\n\r\nan  alternative job.  For the older Singaporeans,  they  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they have become useless.  In the past, people used  to\r\n\r\nsay, \"having an old person at home is like having a piece  of\r\n\r\ntreasure\".  Now with an old person in a family seems to imply\r\n\r\nhaving  more  worries and trouble. Why?  Because  you  cannot\r\n\r\nfind a job.  When you go home, nobody bothers to greet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arduous statement made by the Government is that we\r\n\r\nmust   change  our  mindset.   This  statement  is  easy   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  but  how are we going to do  that?   How  can  we\r\n\r\nchange our mindset?  Changing one's mindset takes time and it\r\n\r\ncannot  be done in a hurry.  And it has to involve a  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople  -  individuals  have  to change,  employers  have  to\r\n\r\nchange,  Members  of Parliament have to change.   The  change\r\n\r\nwill bring a lot of impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery MP has a responsibility to explain to the people.  I am\r\n\r\npleased to see DPM Lee at the TV forum last night, explaining\r\n\r\nthe  need for economic restructuring.  What is noteworthy  is\r\n\r\nthat he even invited a taxi-driver to take part in the forum.\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee saw it fit to invite ordinary people to a TV  forum.\r\n\r\nThis  is an indication that the Government is pro-people  and\r\n\r\nis  reaching  out  to  the  people.  Other  Ministers  should\r\n\r\nemulate  this and try their best to explain the rationale  of\r\n\r\nthe Government's policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When times are good, we like to compare. We try to\r\n\r\ncompare  our  houses, our cars, our children.  But  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy   plummets,  people  become  calculative.   At   this\r\n\r\njuncture, we are surfing troubled waters in the same boat. We\r\n\r\nshould  help  each  other.    We should  be  united  to  face\r\n\r\nexternal  threats.  This is what we call the  \"big  picture\".\r\n\r\nWe  have become a nation where everyone is calculative, worry\r\n\r\nabout  petty  issues and we suspect that all businessmen  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  make profits. If a hawker reduces the  number  of\r\n\r\nfish-balls  in a bowl of noodle from four to three,  or  from\r\n\r\nfour  big  fish-balls to four small fish-balls, can  that  be\r\n\r\nsaid to be profiteering?  If there are such hawkers, the best\r\n\r\nthing  to  do is not to patronise them.  Boycott them.  There\r\n\r\nare many other stalls where we can go to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans are too straightforward. They do\r\n\r\nnot  know how to negotiate a bend.  They do not know  how  to\r\n\r\nadjust themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, our colleague talked about the high cost of\r\n\r\nliving  and escalating business cost.  When NTUC set  up  the\r\n\r\nFairprice  supermarkets, one of the objectives  is  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown  commodity prices.  Give the people more  choices.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  you  want to buy a bottle of soft drink,  go  to  a\r\n\r\nprovision shop, you pay 50 cents for it. If you go to an air-conditioned  supermarket, you pay 60 cents. If you  go  to  a\r\n\r\nconvenience  shop  at the corner of your block,  you  pay  80\r\n\r\ncents  for it. If you go to a coffeeshop, you pay $1 (with  a\r\n\r\nglass  of ice).  If you go to a coffeehouse, you pay  $3  for\r\n\r\nthe  same  bottle of drink.  But, if you go to a hotel  or  a\r\n\r\nhigh-class cafe, you pay $5 or more. You put your neck on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchopping  board!  The point is that you have  a  choice,  you\r\n\r\nhave  the freedom to choose.  You can go to a provision  shop\r\n\r\nor  go to a cafe to have your drink. And, if you really  want\r\n\r\nto  save money, then go home and drink a glass of plain water\r\n\r\n-  and  it is probably more healthy too!  The only thing  is,\r\n\r\ncan we continue to have a continuous water supply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about water supply, this is a crucial issue. We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  we  are faced with the difficulty  of  water\r\n\r\nsupply and we have suffered all kinds of humiliations.  So we\r\n\r\nshould go all the way to set up desalination plants and  work\r\n\r\non  this NEWater project. We should make sure that the nation\r\n\r\nhas  water.  The Government has been trying very hard to  get\r\n\r\nwater supply for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, a Member mentioned that when he went to a\r\n\r\nshop, he saw a few dogs and cats there.  I keep a rooster and\r\n\r\na  hen  in  my  house.   In  the morning,  the  rooster  will\r\n\r\nfaithfully cry, \"koo-kair\".  When the hen lays egg, it  would\r\n\r\ncry,  \"kok-kay, koo-kay\".  This egg will hatch into a  chick.\r\n\r\n\"Koo-kay,  koo-kay\" means nation in Teochew or  Hokkien.   My\r\n\r\nmother commented that this hen is very intelligent. She knows\r\n\r\nthat  there must first be a kok (nation) before you can  have\r\n\r\nthe  kay  (family). Sir, at this present time of  difficulty,\r\n\r\nwhat worries us most is not catching those merchants who  try\r\n\r\nto  profiteer, but how to ensure that we have a nation and  a\r\n\r\nfamily.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for allowing me to participate in this debate  on\r\n\r\nthe Budget Statement 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the adjectives that has been used to\r\n\r\ndescribe  the Budget is \"bold\". This reminds me of the  title\r\n\r\nof a popular soap opera - \"the bold and the beautiful\".  I am\r\n\r\nvery  sure that the Budget also aims to beautify the economic\r\n\r\nand social landscapes of Singapore - making it attractive for\r\n\r\nforeign  investors  to set up their operations  here  and  to\r\n\r\nensure that Singaporeans have and keep their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the main aspects of the Budget that has\r\n\r\nattracted the attention of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is  the  increase  in  the  GST.   The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  his  Budget Statement,  has  assured  that  no\r\n\r\nSingaporean will be worse off when the GST is increased.  The\r\n\r\npackage  of  goodies has been presented to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nattempts  at beautifying our economic landscape will  not  be\r\n\r\nmarred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Budget and its related cushions of\r\n\r\ngoodies  are aimed at preparing Singaporeans for a \"different\r\n\r\nworld\",  I  am not sure if Singaporeans are aware that  their\r\n\r\nworld  will be different, perhaps different from a  different\r\n\r\nperspective.  The harsh realities of the economic crisis have\r\n\r\nleft many Singaporeans gasping for breath to stay alive, like\r\n\r\nfish  out of water.  I am sure many Members of the House have\r\n\r\nmet  Singaporeans  coming  to see  them  to  appeal  for  one\r\n\r\ninstalment plan after another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon to see a family come to an MPS\r\n\r\nsession with a stack of bills that have not been paid,  often\r\n\r\nover a period of at least three months, if not more, some  up\r\n\r\nto a year.  They come to see us because they have either been\r\n\r\nthreatened with legal action or that their electricity, water\r\n\r\nsupplies  or  even  telephone lines may be disconnected.   To\r\n\r\nmany  average  Singaporeans,  going  to  court  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nfrightful  thought, although I am sure many of my  colleagues\r\n\r\nin  the legal profession will say that it is just in a  day's\r\n\r\nwork.   Worse  still,  the thought of having  their  supplies\r\n\r\ndisconnected is even more frightening to many of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Budget aims to beautify our economic\r\n\r\ncomplexion, I am afraid we have pockets of problems that will\r\n\r\ncontinue to mar our complexion if we do not pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthem.  We need immediate attention.  The problem is here  and\r\n\r\nnow.   No amount of facelift in the future will help if their\r\n\r\ncurrent problems are not addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am speaking of a growing number of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho I have come across that are trapped in the current crisis\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  continue to remain trapped unless something is done  to\r\n\r\nassist  them.  These Singaporeans are facing severe financial\r\n\r\nhardships. They are in arrears with Power Supply, SingTel and\r\n\r\nother phone companies, HDB, Town Councils.  I do not have the\r\n\r\nfigures but I am sure that the relevant agencies will  concur\r\n\r\nthat  the  numbers are increasing.  They also  owe  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  for unpaid renovation loans.   Some  also  have\r\n\r\narrears with schools for their children's school fees. It  is\r\n\r\nalso not uncommon for them to have arrears with hire purchase\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Who are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a social worker for the past 12 years.\r\n\r\nThe  above  used  to be the typical low-income  families  who\r\n\r\nreside  in  rental  flats.  But we have  put  in  place  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes to assist such families in rental flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the families that I am describing above are not\r\n\r\nrental  flat dwellers. Indeed, there are no rental  flats  in\r\n\r\nAdmiralty division where I am responsible for. Sir, they  are\r\n\r\nthe  purchase flat dwellers who are slowly developing a sense\r\n\r\nof  helplessness  as  they  attempt  to  overcome  what  they\r\n\r\nperceive perhaps as insurmountable challenges.  Many  of  the\r\n\r\nheads  of  households are victims of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nThey  have  low education and limited skills.  Their  spouses\r\n\r\nalso  have  limited education and skills.  Some have  several\r\n\r\nyoung  children,  often the reason given for  their  spouses'\r\n\r\ninability to seek employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world may indeed be different for them. It is\r\n\r\ngetting  bleaker and darker as the days go by  and  as  their\r\n\r\narrears  continue to accumulate and as they continue to  feel\r\n\r\ndrowned  by  the  mountain  of  unpaid  bills.   The   Budget\r\n\r\naddresses  the  problem  that they  will  face  if  they  are\r\n\r\naffected  by  the increase in GST and other  taxes.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  affected.  But I am not sure  if  the  Budget\r\n\r\naddresses the problems that they are facing today.  While  it\r\n\r\nis  promised that they will not be worse off, can  we  ensure\r\n\r\nthat they can be better off at the same time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget promises jobs and more jobs for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as we make our tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  attractive  for foreign investors  to  set  up  their\r\n\r\noperations here and to stay here.  But we have also been told\r\n\r\nby  some  that  these jobs will not come until three  to  six\r\n\r\nmonths  later, if not more.  In the meantime, the arrears  of\r\n\r\nthese  families  described above will  continue  to  increase\r\n\r\nalong with the interests and the threats of legal action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how have they been coping so far? Whatever they\r\n\r\nearn  from  their part-time jobs or from financial assistance\r\n\r\nare often used to pay one bill at a time.  Often they pay the\r\n\r\nTown Council this month, the Power Supply the next month, and\r\n\r\ntelephone  bill  the following month.  In the  meantime,  the\r\n\r\narrears  accumulate when they do not settle  that  particular\r\n\r\nmonth's  bill.   They  have to play this juggling  act  month\r\n\r\nafter month.  How else could they manage? Sir, the Budget may\r\n\r\nbe  bold but perhaps may not be as beautiful to the group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can be quick to point our fingers back at these\r\n\r\nfamilies.  We may say, \"They have themselves to blame.\"  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  held  responsible  for  their  own  actions,  for\r\n\r\nspending  beyond their means.  Now they have  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of their actions.  Yes, what they did may not be\r\n\r\nright.    Perhaps   they  were  merely  succumbing   to   the\r\n\r\naspirations  of urban modern living. Whatever  it  is,  their\r\n\r\nproblem  is  real and will continue to be a  problem  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic and social complexion if we do not address them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating for more handouts for these\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Indeed they need to be held responsible.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nI  think they want to be responsible.  But Sir, I think  they\r\n\r\nare  at  their wits' end.  They probably feel trapped to  the\r\n\r\ncorner, gasping for air, perhaps hyperventilating. We can try\r\n\r\nto  create  space  for  them to breathe  and  organise  their\r\n\r\nthoughts. We can stop the creditors from harassing  them  and\r\n\r\ngiving  them  space  and  peace  of  mind  to  manage   their\r\n\r\nchallenges in a more systematic manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am recommending that the Government explore a\r\n\r\nsystem  that  can  help these families negotiate  with  their\r\n\r\ncreditors the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsettlement  of their accumulated arrears. We do not  have  to\r\n\r\ngive them handouts.  We merely need to assist in making their\r\n\r\nproblems more manageable for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am proposing is the setting up of a system\r\n\r\nthat  is  akin  to the \"debt consolidation\" service  that  is\r\n\r\nbeginning  to gain prominence in the US.  This is  a  service\r\n\r\nprovided  by  a non-profit consumer counselling agency  which\r\n\r\nwill  consolidate the debts, contact the creditors and assist\r\n\r\nin  negotiating  for  a  reduced interest  rate  and  monthly\r\n\r\npayments.   The  person pays the monthly instalment  to  this\r\n\r\nagency who will then settle the payments with the creditor on\r\n\r\nhis  behalf.   The  person  is  relieved  of  the  hassle  of\r\n\r\ncreditors  breathing down his neck and having  to  deal  with\r\n\r\npotential  legal  actions.   Creditors  are  keen   on   this\r\n\r\nprogramme  as  it ensures that they will at least  get  their\r\n\r\nprincipal  sum  back rather than losing it  if  the  indebted\r\n\r\nperson files for bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar agency of this nature can be set up here to\r\n\r\nassist this group of individuals and families. The agency can\r\n\r\nnegotiate with the creditor to stop legal action against  the\r\n\r\nindebted  person.  This is critical as often times the  legal\r\n\r\ncosts  are borne by the indebted person, making them perceive\r\n\r\nthe  problem  as even more insurmountable.  In light  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  emphasis to encourage philanthropy, these  creditors\r\n\r\ncould  also  be encouraged to lower their interest  rates  to\r\n\r\nmotivate and facilitate these individuals' ability to  settle\r\n\r\nthe debts.  We can prevent more bankruptcies from being filed\r\n\r\nand we can help ensure mental health for these individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this scheme will create a sense of competence on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the  individuals as they try to  settle  their\r\n\r\nproblems  themselves.   They are merely  facilitated  by  the\r\n\r\nassistance   of  the  debt  consolidators.  Indeed   we   are\r\n\r\nempowering  them  to manage and be responsible,  albeit  some\r\n\r\nlevel  of  supporting.  It  will  eliminate  their  sense  of\r\n\r\nhelplessness,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, financial problems have been found to create\r\n\r\nstrains  on marital and familial relationships. Many families\r\n\r\nhave been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroken  due  to financial hardships. We need to  continue  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  families  through  whatever  means  we  can.\r\n\r\nStrong  families  produce strong and  productive  members  of\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we continue to promote strong families, we need\r\n\r\nto acknowledge the significant roles that our women folk have\r\n\r\nand  continue  to  play in and out of the families.   Here  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to lend my support to the call made by our  women\r\n\r\ncolleagues  yesterday  to  extend  medical  benefits  to  the\r\n\r\ndependants of our female civil servants. Sir, the men,  often\r\n\r\nknown  as  the heads of households in our society, are  never\r\n\r\nretrenchment-free or recession-proof.  Many have  lost  their\r\n\r\njobs  and  rely  on  their wives' income to  survive.   Their\r\n\r\ndependants  should  not  be  deprived  of  medical  coverage.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  extending  the  medical benefits  to  dependants  of\r\n\r\nfemale   civil  servants  reflects  a  recognition   of   the\r\n\r\nincreasing shared roles and responsibilities between men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  in  our  families.   On the  same  note,  may  I  also\r\n\r\nrecommend  that the child sick leave enjoyed by female  civil\r\n\r\nservants be then extended to male civil servants too.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  these are good ingredients for more babies to be  born,\r\n\r\napart from the natural order of things, but I shall elaborate\r\n\r\nmore on it during the debate in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above proportion assumes that the person has an\r\n\r\nincome  to make the monthly payment to the debt consolidator.\r\n\r\nThe  challenge  is for him to also ensure  that  he  has  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  skills  and  knowledge that  will  assist  him  in\r\n\r\nsecuring a job.  I am pleased to note that emphasis has  been\r\n\r\nplaced  on the development of human resources.  Sir, part  of\r\n\r\nthis  development  is  the  need to  shift  the  mindsets  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   as   mentioned   by   several   parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues - to survive in a different world, we need  to  be\r\n\r\nnimble, adaptive, determined, and most of all, resilient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the change in mindset needed is more critical for\r\n\r\nthe  Malay/Muslim community.  It has been reported  that  the\r\n\r\nMalay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers   were  hardest  hit  during  the  recent  spate   of\r\n\r\nretrenchments as many have low level skills and are not quite\r\n\r\nenough  to  re-skill themselves. For the Muslim community  to\r\n\r\nensure  that it succeeds in the new and different  world,  we\r\n\r\nmust  embrace the vision of a community of excellence charted\r\n\r\nby the new Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two meanings to the verb \"to excel\".\r\n\r\nOne,  to  excel is to be exceptionally good.  Two,  to  excel\r\n\r\noneself  is  to  do  better  than  ever  before.   The  first\r\n\r\ndefinition is abstract and not easily measurable.  The second\r\n\r\ndefinition suggest something that is more operationable.   To\r\n\r\ndo  better  than  before allows us to use a  more  measurable\r\n\r\nindicator  of what it means to excel.  Using this  definition\r\n\r\nthen  means  that to strive towards excellence is an  ongoing\r\n\r\nprocess and we excel each time we perform better than all the\r\n\r\nprevious  attempts  we  have  undertaken.   In  this   sense,\r\n\r\nexcellence  is  an  infinite point  in  that  process.   This\r\n\r\ndefinition is indeed useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to build a community of excellence, each member of\r\n\r\nthe  community must recognise that he or she plays a critical\r\n\r\nrole.   The  most  micro of the role is to do  your  best  in\r\n\r\nwhatever  you  do.  I am reminded of the motto of  my  former\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  -  \"From  each  his  best\"  and  for   the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim  community, I would want  to  add  \"and  nothing\r\n\r\nless\".   A community of excellence is one that comprises  not\r\n\r\nonly  of  individuals  but  of  families,  organisations  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses  of  excellence.  Each  of  these  levels  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  must espouse a similar set of values -  importance\r\n\r\nof    seeking   and  creating  knowledge,   hard   work   and\r\n\r\ndetermination, and commitment to do one's best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has prided itself with being number one in\r\n\r\nmany areas, the best airport, the best sea port, etc.  I urge\r\n\r\nthe  Malay/Muslim community to work together with  the  Malay\r\n\r\npolitical   leadership  and  the  Government  to   make   the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community the best one in the region and in  the\r\n\r\nworld. We should focus our energies on the education of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung to ensure a new generation of educated individuals  who\r\n\r\nwill  excel in the new world.  We need to help those who  are\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged and give their children a headstart.  Our young\r\n\r\nmust  have  an  excellent grasp of English,  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience  as  early as possible, to ensure a strong foundation\r\n\r\nfor  them  to excel.  The Budget is set to invest heavily  on\r\n\r\nsuch social and human capital.  The community must capitalise\r\n\r\non this opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that our workers can fit well into the\r\n\r\njobs  of the new economy.  We need to send a message that  it\r\n\r\nis never too late to learn.  It is never too late to succeed.\r\n\r\nIt is never too late to excel.  Indeed access and acquisition\r\n\r\nof  knowledge  are  key ingredients for success  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay/Muslim community as well as the other\r\n\r\ncommunities  have their respective roles in  contributing  to\r\n\r\nthe efforts of beautifying the economic and social complexion\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  The ingredients for a lasting face-lift  have\r\n\r\nbeen  gathered.  We need to blend these ingredients  well  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  our  complexion  remains  smooth  and  radiant,\r\n\r\nthereby  attracting potential suitors from all over.   Indeed\r\n\r\nwe  have  been bold in the measures introduced in the Budget.\r\n\r\nLet us ensure that we are also beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, do I have your permission to\r\n\r\nclarify  the  point on my speech referred to by Mr  Seng  Han\r\n\r\nThong, Member for Ang Mo Kio?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nmy  speech  I  talked  about the small-time  businessmen  and\r\n\r\nhawkers  who  are  struggling for  survival.

I\r\n\r\ndo  not know whether Mr Seng could not understand me or  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  distorting the meaning of my speech.  If you want  to\r\n\r\ncatch the culprit for price hike, I think the biggest culprit\r\n\r\nis the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like  to thank you first for  giving  me  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to take part in the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nannounced that the important change in Budget 2002 is to  cut\r\n\r\ndown on corporate tax and personal income tax so as to create\r\n\r\nmore  job  opportunities for Singapore, and for Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to prosper.  To balance the Budget, he accepted  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Review Committee's recommendation to raise the Goods\r\n\r\nand Services Tax (GST) by 2%.  At the same time, in order  to\r\n\r\ncushion the impact of GST increase there is an offset package\r\n\r\nto help the low income families to lighten their burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at a time when the economic prospects\r\n\r\nof the world are not certain, the Government has accepted the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   of   the  ERC  to  make   a   comprehensive\r\n\r\nrestructuring of our tax system to help the poor families  or\r\n\r\nlower income families to offset the effect of the increase in\r\n\r\nGST.   This  shows  that the Government  and  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are also cooperating in recreating Singapore.   So\r\n\r\nit  also  lays  emphasis  to say that  in  time  of  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulty  the  people and the Government will  continue  to\r\n\r\ncooperate and make the necessary preparations for our  future\r\n\r\ntake-off and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that this year' Budget is generally\r\n\r\nsupported  by  the people.  The people here  appreciate  that\r\n\r\nthis  is necessary.  The Government has done its best to  lay\r\n\r\ndown the foundation and measures to rebuild our economy.   In\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget,  there are  only  three  types  of  tax\r\n\r\nincreases.  First, GST to be raised from 3% to 5%,  secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  tobacco  and liquor taxes will go up, and  thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nparking  fees  would be increased.  In order  to  offset  the\r\n\r\nimpact of all these increases, there will be certain measures\r\n\r\nto  help  the  people to ensure that most families  will  not\r\n\r\nsuffer under the increase of the GST.  These packages include\r\n\r\n(1)  lowering  personal  income tax and  corporate  tax,  (2)\r\n\r\ngiving SC&CC rebate for HDB dwellers for five years, and  (3)\r\n\r\ncutting down road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax  and  vehicle  registration fees.  In addition,  parents'\r\n\r\nrelief  will be more generous.  Rebates for foreign  workers'\r\n\r\nlevy will be extended and Economic Restructuring Shares (ERS)\r\n\r\nwill be distributed to all adult citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we look through the entire Budget,\r\n\r\nwe  all feel very relieved because the 2% increase in GST has\r\n\r\nalso   been  offset  by  other  measures  and  the   Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares given to us could be used to offset  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST, if necessary.  But the people  in  general\r\n\r\nalso   fear   that  the  increase  in  GST  will    cause   a\r\n\r\nconsequential  increase  in the prices  of  goods.   This  is\r\n\r\npossible.    Soon  after  the  proposed  GST   increase   was\r\n\r\nannounced, the television station interviewed some   ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens.  A hawker who was interviewed was asked whether  he\r\n\r\nwould  sell his wares at higher prices.  He promptly  replied\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course!\"  \"By how much would you increase?\"  \"I used\r\n\r\nto  sell  a bowl of noodle for $2.50. Now it will be  $3.00\".\r\n\r\nSo  there is an increase of 50 cents.  The increase  is  20%,\r\n\r\nand not 2%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government knows the problem. A Committee under the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of  Mr Chan Soo Sen has been formed  to  combat\r\n\r\nprofiteering  to  ensure that prices will  not  be  increased\r\n\r\nwithout  a  good reason.  So if anyone is to come across  any\r\n\r\ninstance of such profiteering, he should feedback to Mr  Chan\r\n\r\nSoo  Sen or to any Member of Parliament.  Let Mr Chan be  the\r\n\r\nJustice  Bao of the new economy.  All you need to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nfill  up a simple form and send it to Mr Chan Soo Sen.  I  am\r\n\r\nvery glad to see that Mr Chiam See Tong has been invited, and\r\n\r\nhe has accepted, to  join the Committee. Perhaps, Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang should also volunteer his services to the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are preventive in nature. We hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  hawkers  and merchants would  not  increase  their\r\n\r\nprices  without  good reasons.  But we must  take  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures.    Prevention  is  better  than  cure.    So   this\r\n\r\nprevention  by  appointing  the  Committee  to  act   against\r\n\r\nprofiteering   is  far-sightedness  on  the   part   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another emphasis of the Budget is to be\r\n\r\npro-business, to lower income tax for the companies  and  the\r\n\r\nindividuals, to increase our competitiveness and  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign talents so as to create more jobs for Singaporeans. I\r\n\r\nhope that this good news will turn into good opportunity.  In\r\n\r\nthe   21st  century,  competition  is  becoming  increasingly\r\n\r\nintense.  With  the  opening up of the  China  market  better\r\n\r\nopportunities are provided for investors to go to China.   So\r\n\r\nin  attracting foreign investments to Singapore,  we  face  a\r\n\r\ngreater challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to overcome this difficulty, the Government has\r\n\r\nmade  a  lot  of  tax  restructuring to  provide  impetus  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the Singapore economy, to reshape Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nplace  which  is  more attractive to foreign investors  whose\r\n\r\ninvestment  would help to generate more jobs for our  people.\r\n\r\nThe people are now very concerned as to whether they are able\r\n\r\nto  keep  their  jobs.  About 100,000 people  are   presently\r\n\r\nunemployed,  and they are having difficulty getting   another\r\n\r\njob.  I wonder if the Economic Review Committee (ERC) is able\r\n\r\nto  come  up with some kind of  indicator as to how  many  of\r\n\r\nthese 100,000 people are being given job offers and what kind\r\n\r\nof jobs are being offered to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th May 2002, a factory placed a job vacancy\r\n\r\nadvertisement in a morning newspaper.  Within 25  minutes  of\r\n\r\nthe  opening of its gates, some 400 people turned up to apply\r\n\r\nfor  the  200 vacancies. This is the report in Lianhe Zaobao.\r\n\r\nFrom  this newspaper report, we can see that many people  are\r\n\r\nunemployed.  There were only 200 jobs, and within 25  minutes\r\n\r\nthey  attracted  more  than  400 applicants.   That  is,  two\r\n\r\napplicants  to  one job.  Those who are eventually  recruited\r\n\r\nare like having struck a lottery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few months, the various CDCs and the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower have conducted a number of job fairs  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the people look for jobs.  But the success rate is  not\r\n\r\nencouraging.  Many who attended the fairs, particularly those\r\n\r\nwho are above the age of 40, would find that the jobs offered\r\n\r\nat the fairs are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuitable  for them.  Because at the job fairs, most employers\r\n\r\nwere  looking  at younger people or people who  are  computer\r\n\r\nsavvy.  These fairs do not seem to cater to the needs of  the\r\n\r\nolder job seekers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand the situation of unemployment,\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  have  conducted a random  survey  of  about  1,200\r\n\r\ninterviewees  to  understand what kind of problems  they  are\r\n\r\nfacing,  what  kind of attempts they have made,  before  they\r\n\r\napproach  the  CDC or MOM for assistance.  The  survey  shows\r\n\r\nthat  21.5%  of  the  job  seekers went  by  the  recruitment\r\n\r\nadvertisements   in  the  newspapers,  and   some   went   to\r\n\r\nemployment agencies, while some browsed the Internet.   About\r\n\r\n13.7%  attended  job fairs.  Only 11% went to  MOM,  and  10%\r\n\r\napproached   their  friends  for  help,  and  a  very   small\r\n\r\npercentage  of 7% went to the CDCs. According to  the  survey\r\n\r\nresults,  we  feel that the CDCs and MOM can work  harder  to\r\n\r\nprovide better services to the unemployed people to help them\r\n\r\nlook for jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Budget for a changing world, I\r\n\r\nwould like to raise five points: One, the most important,  is\r\n\r\nhow can we help the 100,000 unemployed people  look for jobs.\r\n\r\nI  suggest that we have a one-stop employment agency service.\r\n\r\nWe  must  first  have a national registration  of  unemployed\r\n\r\npeople.   Through more than 100 community clubs and community\r\n\r\ncentres  of the People's Association, we could  register  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  people together with information  concerning  the\r\n\r\nkind  of job  they want or desire to have.  Through this data\r\n\r\ncentre,  we  can re-channel the information to the  CDCs  for\r\n\r\nreclassification.  For example, if a person wants to work  as\r\n\r\na  cleaner, he can go to the CDC and be matched up  with  the\r\n\r\ncleaning  contractors  on  the  list,  and  arrange  for  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  training  to be provided.  Once  the  applicant  is\r\n\r\nfamiliar with the job, I believe it will be easier for him to\r\n\r\nsecure  a  job.  Likewise, if a job seeker wants to become  a\r\n\r\ndriver,  arrangement can be made for him  to  be  trained  at\r\n\r\nComfort Taxi or SBS, or undergo some form of training through\r\n\r\nthe  relevant trade unions. In this way, he will acquire  the\r\n\r\nnecessary skills to prepare him for the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM can also seek the cooperation of all the factories,\r\n\r\ncompanies and enterprises to report to the Ministry  any  job\r\n\r\nvacancies available.   With this kind of information from the\r\n\r\nCDCs  and MOM, we will be able to provide better job-matching\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that the Government provides\r\n\r\nsome  form  of   incentives for employment.  In  helping  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  people  financially, the  Government  gives  $200\r\n\r\nrelief  a month.  For a period of three months, the total  is\r\n\r\nabout  $600.   This  kind  of financial  assistance  is  only\r\n\r\ntemporary  in  nature to help the unemployed people  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir family.  Over the long term, the Government can set  up\r\n\r\nsome  kind  of  unemployment  incentives  for  companies   or\r\n\r\nbusinesses to  employ the older workers, say, those  who  are\r\n\r\n40-50 years old.  For example, give $100 a month to every 40-year-old  worker employed for a period of six  months.   With\r\n\r\nthis kind of incentive, companies will be attracted to employ\r\n\r\nthe older workers.  This will help to reduce our unemployment\r\n\r\nrate.   It  will also help our workers to get  jobs  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their  families.  Then they will  not  face  financial\r\n\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion I would like to make is for some\r\n\r\nkind  of rental rebates to be given to the JTC and HDB shops.\r\n\r\nThis  was also the suggestion of Mr Inderjit Singh.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, they can be given about 20% rental rebates, so as  to\r\n\r\nlower  their  operating cost, and they will be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to  carry  out their business  and  tide  over  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  period.  They can even afford to lower the  prices\r\n\r\nof  their merchandises and our people will not have to go all\r\n\r\nthe way across the Causeway to do their shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is that with effect from 1st September,\r\n\r\nthe monthly parking fees in the HDB estates will be increased\r\n\r\nfrom $75 to $90, an increase of $15 per month.  The open  car\r\n\r\npark  fees  will  be  increased by $15.   I  am  afraid  that\r\n\r\nresidents affected by the SERS projects, these residents  who\r\n\r\nused  to  park their cars in the surface car park and  paying\r\n\r\n$55  per month will now have to park their cars in the multi-storey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncovered car park and will now be asked to pay $90 per  month,\r\n\r\nan  increase of 35% per month, or $420 more per year. This is\r\n\r\na  very huge increase.  I hope the Government will give  them\r\n\r\nspecial consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal income tax will be adjusted downwards over a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  three years.  Similarly, the increase in  parking\r\n\r\nfees should also be spread over three years.  Then there will\r\n\r\nbe a balanced way of treating two different groups of people.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be one good way to help our people, so that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  suddenly be faced with a huge increase in  parking\r\n\r\nfees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rebates for public utilities, there is no mention\r\n\r\non  this  issue.  I have been asked by many residents whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has forgotten about the rebates for\r\n\r\nutilities.   Over the past few years, there is some  kind  of\r\n\r\nutilities  rebates announced every year.   It  will  be  very\r\n\r\nhelpful to the poor and low-income families.  They hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will consider re-introducing the rebates  for\r\n\r\npublic utilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek\r\n\r\nclarification on Mr Low Thia Khiang's speech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand every word\r\n\r\nof Mr Low Thia Khiang in Mandarin.

So,\r\n\r\nI  hope he also understands my Mandarin.  What I said is that\r\n\r\nduring these difficult times, we should not start pointing at\r\n\r\npeople and say that he is profiteering.

I would like to take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to congratulate the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  Finance Minister for his maiden Budget Statement.  There\r\n\r\nare  several  proposals that I support.  However,  there  are\r\n\r\nalso some concerns that I would like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like several other MPs yesterday, I want to talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  impact  of  the GST on the poor  and  the  ageing\r\n\r\nSingaporean workers.  Second, I disagree with cuts in the top\r\n\r\nmarginal  personal  income  tax  as  a  means  for  promoting\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Third, the corporate tax cut is not bold enough to\r\n\r\nincrease  Singapore's competitiveness.  Fourth, as  Singapore\r\n\r\nmoves  towards  greater  indirect taxation,  the  anticipated\r\n\r\nimpact  of  future GST increases should warrant exemption  of\r\n\r\nessential  goods and services from this tax.   Last  but  not\r\n\r\nleast,  I support Prof. Chin's call on the Government to  use\r\n\r\nthe  funds  collected from the additional COEs  to  help  HDB\r\n\r\ncover its car park building cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I study the impact in detail, I become more and more\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  these Budget changes and the recommendations\r\n\r\nof the ERC are from the rich, by the rich and for the rich  - to  make  the  rich even richer.  The income gap between  the\r\n\r\ntalented and the workers is going to widen drastically.  More\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  done  to  help the poor, the unskilled  and  the\r\n\r\nuntalented  to cope with this rising wealth gap.   Otherwise,\r\n\r\nin our effort to rebuild our economy, the social cohesion and\r\n\r\nfabric  of our society will risk being threatened and crumble\r\n\r\nin the long run, leading to detrimental results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite certain that after the five years of offset\r\n\r\nmeasures, the lower income and the ageing workers will become\r\n\r\npoorer, especially for the ageing workers who had been paying\r\n\r\ntaxes  in  their  younger days.  Over the last  30  years  of\r\n\r\nnation  building, they had contributed in their own  ways  to\r\n\r\nhelp build Singapore into this developed society.  They,  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers,  are  retiring soon, or  some  of  them  have\r\n\r\nalready  retired.   But they are going to  continue  to  face\r\n\r\npaying  GST  right up to their deathbeds and even into  their\r\n\r\ncoffins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right. The Government should look into how\r\n\r\nit  can  waive the GST completely for the retirees and senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.   They have done their share of duty to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   We should recognise their contribution and  exempt\r\n\r\nthem  from  this  tax  burden in their twilight  years.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment may have recognised this problem and adjusted  the\r\n\r\npension allowance for retired civil servants.  But how  about\r\n\r\nmany  other retirees and blue collar workers from the private\r\n\r\nsector?  I believe the Government can do a lot more for  this\r\n\r\ngeneration  of nation building senior citizens not  from  the\r\n\r\ncivil service too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, coming to cuts in top-end personal income tax to\r\n\r\n20%, I do not think that this is a useful move.  The Minister\r\n\r\nhad  argued for a significant reduction as a means to attract\r\n\r\ninternational  talents to work in Singapore and  help  create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs.  Is that equation really that simple?  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink so.  I believe that talented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh-income earners will not just flock to Singapore  because\r\n\r\nof  the  lower individual tax rate.  In any way, 20%  is  not\r\n\r\nattractive enough compared to other countries like Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThey  will  consider  the total package.   Factors  like  pay\r\n\r\ncompensations, a more conducive living environment,  cultural\r\n\r\nadaptations  and other examples of cost of living,  like  car\r\n\r\nownerships, will play a bigger consideration than simple  tax\r\n\r\ncuts.  If they have to spend more of what they earn by paying\r\n\r\nmore  indirect  taxes,  like higher liquor  charges  and  car\r\n\r\ncosts,  then they will not be interested to come to Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the first place.  These talents are not stupid.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot  make  sense  for them to save on direct personal  income\r\n\r\ntaxes but pay a bomb to own a branded car or a pigeon hole in\r\n\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes are taxes, direct or indirect, it is cash outflow\r\n\r\nfrom  the  individual to the Government - be it  income  tax,\r\n\r\nGST,  ERP,  COEs  or fees, it still adds to the  Government's\r\n\r\ncoffers.   Therefore, we need more than personal  income  tax\r\n\r\ncuts  to  encourage  talents here to help spur  our  economic\r\n\r\nactivity and entrepreneurship.  If the Government is  genuine\r\n\r\nin   wanting   to  encourage  entrepreneurship  through   tax\r\n\r\nreductions, then it should consider waiving the tax liability\r\n\r\nof  start-up business persons in the initial few years  until\r\n\r\ntheir  business  is  more stable and  profitable.   A  larger\r\n\r\n\"entrepreneurship  income tax relief\" can  be  introduced  to\r\n\r\nhelp  start-up  smaller businessmen.  It will  definitely  be\r\n\r\nmore   helpful  than  the  top-end  cut  of  6%  for  already\r\n\r\nsuccessful  high income earners.  Any tax waivers or  rebates\r\n\r\ngiven to a new start-up business person will definitely  help\r\n\r\nto plough back to help their business grow more and survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many entrepreneurs just starting out can make\r\n\r\ndisposable income of more than $320,000 a year to qualify for\r\n\r\nthe  6%  cut in personal income tax?  Not many!  I personally\r\n\r\ndo  not  know of any.  Maybe the Government can give us  some\r\n\r\nexamples of which entrepreneur has achieved this.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp    more   Singaporeans   to   emulate   their   success.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, not all high income earners are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  Many in Singapore happen to be working in the\r\n\r\nGovernment service.  It is clear that they will be one of the\r\n\r\ngreatest beneficiaries of this tax cut.  They earn very  high\r\n\r\nincome with zero risk of business failure attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the private sector, I wholly support the cut in\r\n\r\nthe  corporate  income tax.  However, I feel  that  this  ERC\r\n\r\nproposal  is not bold enough.  If countries like Germany,  as\r\n\r\ncited, can reduce its corporate income tax from 40% to 25% in\r\n\r\none  year, we can do better than the miserable 4.5% cut  over\r\n\r\ntwo  years.   We  can  be a lot bolder in  cutting  corporate\r\n\r\nincome  tax  to  keep  us ahead of the competition.   When  a\r\n\r\ncompany  has  more  retained profits, it will  be  bolder  in\r\n\r\nemploying more people, thus helping to create more  jobs  and\r\n\r\nhelping  the  economy. If foreign companies  intend  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage   of  this  lower  tax  benefit  and  relocate   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  their employees will have no choice but  to  move\r\n\r\nhere  too  or they will face retrenchment back home in  their\r\n\r\ncountry.   There  is no need for us to cut the  top  marginal\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rate just to attract these companies  to\r\n\r\ncome over here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should save on cutting top marginal\r\n\r\npersonal  income  tax  for  the  rich.   By  doing  so,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will save $620 million every year.   This  saving\r\n\r\ncan  be  used  to  offset  a bigger and  bolder  cut  in  the\r\n\r\ncorporate tax rate than the 2.5% recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to talk about GST.\r\n\r\nMany  speakers  here  have talked about the  effects  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  GST  rate and  have  asked  to  delay  its\r\n\r\nimplementation.   There  is also a  suggestion  that  certain\r\n\r\nitems  be  exempted from GST.  The Government  has  said  no.\r\n\r\nLike   many  Singaporeans,  I  do  not  understand  why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is so unwilling to exempt essential staples  from\r\n\r\nGST.   If  the Minister finds it so difficult to decide  what\r\n\r\nitems to exempt from GST, be it sushi, fish or rice, then may\r\n\r\nI suggest that the Ministry of Finance send an investigative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelegation  to other developed countries with GST  exemptions\r\n\r\non  these  essential goods and services and study  how  these\r\n\r\ncountries do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these countries and some states like California in\r\n\r\nthe  USA can have a system where certain essential goods like\r\n\r\nrice,  oil,  sugar,  salt, meat, vegetables,  fish,  etc,  or\r\n\r\nservices  can be exempted from GST, I do not see what  is  so\r\n\r\ndifficult about implementing it in Singapore.  Where there is\r\n\r\na  will,  there  is  sure  to be a  way,  unless  it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to raise as much revenue  as  possible\r\n\r\nfrom GST.  If so, I have nothing to say.  If not, I will give\r\n\r\none  very  good reason why these essential goods and services\r\n\r\nshould be exempted from GST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the GST rate stands at 3%. Come January, it\r\n\r\nwill  be increased to 5%.  Five years later, maybe after  the\r\n\r\nnext general election, it may again be raised, perhaps to 7%,\r\n\r\n9% or even 12%.  I do not know how much higher it can go, but\r\n\r\nI  am very certain that every percentage increase is going to\r\n\r\naffect everyone, but more so for the lower income, the  poor,\r\n\r\nthe unemployed and the retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST is all-encompassing and raised even higher, it\r\n\r\nis  going  to  make  living in Singapore more  miserable  and\r\n\r\ncreate greater social inequality, resulting in resentment  to\r\n\r\nGovernment institutions.  Citizens need to eat and  drink  to\r\n\r\nlive  and survive.  It will become unbearable for less  well-off  citizens  just continuing to eke out an existence  here.\r\n\r\nTheir  lives  will become more miserable as  they  have  less\r\n\r\npurchasing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the trend, I am quite certain that there are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be more cuts in the personal income and  corporate\r\n\r\ntax  rates in the future.  To make up for this revenue  loss,\r\n\r\nit  is certain that the Government is going to raise GST even\r\n\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before this GST is increased to 5%, 7%, 9% or even\r\n\r\nhigher  in  future, I hope the Government can plan ahead  and\r\n\r\ninstitute  a system to exempt certain essential staple  items\r\n\r\nfrom GST.  Do not wait until there is great social discontent\r\n\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once such a system is institutionalised, any future\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST to a very high level will not cause  severe\r\n\r\nhardship  and political ramifications.  Those who  find  that\r\n\r\nthe  tax on sushi is too high can still opt to buy plain rice\r\n\r\nand fish, with the option of not going hungry just to save on\r\n\r\nGST.   The  freedom  of  choice is there  and  this  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we progress into this developed\r\n\r\nworld,  let us work together towards a kinder and more caring\r\n\r\nsociety.   Let  us  not subject our lower and  middle  income\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  our aging community to more stress,  hardships\r\n\r\nand taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my Party constituency walkabout in Jurong West two\r\n\r\nSundays  ago,  I spoke to a senior citizen who  said  to  me,\r\n\r\n\"Given a choice, I would rather return all the ERS shares and\r\n\r\nrebates to the Government if I have the option to be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  GST.  These rebates and grants are short-term  measures\r\n\r\nto  ease our pain, but GST is going to stay with me till I go\r\n\r\nto  my grave.  I would rather not have it.  I paid taxes when\r\n\r\nI  was  young  and  working.  Now I am  old,  unemployed  and\r\n\r\nwaiting  to  die,  and I still have to pay  taxes.   This  is\r\n\r\nunfair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nFinance Minister can take the words of this old man into  due\r\n\r\nconsideration and look into how retired senior  citizens  and\r\n\r\nthe lower income can be exempted from the effects of GST.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  most efficient and equitable  way  is  to\r\n\r\nidentify a list of these essential items and exclude it  from\r\n\r\ntax.   If it is so easy for NTUC Fairprice to produce a  list\r\n\r\nof  such  staple items and absorb the GST increase, I believe\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance can do a lot better than  a  blanket\r\n\r\nno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I want to talk about car usage and car\r\n\r\nparking.   If we want to allow more Singaporeans to own  cars\r\n\r\nbut  encourage them to use it less often, then we  must  have\r\n\r\nincentives to encourage them to keep it stationary,  ie,  not\r\n\r\nto  drive  it.  Increasing car parking charges is  definitely\r\n\r\nnot an incentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the car owners, whether it is money paid to HDB, URA,\r\n\r\nLTA or the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Finance, it is still money going to the Government.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider the total revenue it collects from\r\n\r\ncars  and  look  into subsidising some of  these  loss-making\r\n\r\ndepartments  within  the  Ministry that  help  to  solve  and\r\n\r\nregulate car usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot expect every department in the Ministry to be\r\n\r\nalways  profitable.   There will always be  some  departments\r\n\r\nthat  cannot.   If every department in the Ministry  must  be\r\n\r\nprofitable,  if  HDB  has to build car parks  and  make  them\r\n\r\nprofitable or at least break even while other ministries make\r\n\r\na  lot  from  COE, then it can only mean one thing,  ie,  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  will  become poorer and poorer  through  all  these\r\n\r\ntaxes.   I  hope  the Government will not insist  that  every\r\n\r\nGovernment service must be able to recover cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I do not have the fortune of Mr Seng Han Thong, who  can\r\n\r\nkeep  \"kok kay\" at home, but I do have eggs at home.

Mr Low has denied and  refused  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge the compensation package that the Government  has\r\n\r\nput in place.  He has criticised the Government's efforts  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  the economy.  He even criticised the  Government\r\n\r\nfor giving recognition to encourage philanthropy.  He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  said  that  we  should  not  reduce  the  cost  of  car\r\n\r\nownership.   I wonder whether Mr Low is therefore  suggesting\r\n\r\nthat we should restore the cost of car ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, restructuring is not without pain. There is a\r\n\r\nChinese saying, \"liang yao ku kou li yu bing, zhong yan ni er\r\n\r\nli  yu  xing\".   I  wonder whether Mr Low  prefers  morphine,\r\n\r\npainkillers, rather than cure for our economic ills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to Mr Steve Chia. Mr Chia\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned five points in his speech:  GST for the  poor,\r\n\r\ncut  in personal income tax, corporate tax cuts are not  bold\r\n\r\nenough, GST increases should warrant certain exemptions,  and\r\n\r\nthat we should continue to subsidise car parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to impact of GST on the poor, Mr Chia\r\n\r\nhas suggested that we should perhaps give special waivers for\r\n\r\nretirees,  the lower income groups and for those  who  suffer\r\n\r\nmost, those who are poorer.  But Mr Chia, again like Mr  Low,\r\n\r\nhas  forgotten that we have a compensation package.  Mr  Chia\r\n\r\nkeeps  repeating that tax is tax, it is money from the people\r\n\r\nto  the Government.  I would like to say that a package is  a\r\n\r\npackage, it is still money from the Government to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Chia also mentioned that cuts in personal\r\n\r\nincome   tax   are   not  effective  in  attracting   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.  Granted that I do agree that cuts  in  personal\r\n\r\ntax  alone  are  probably not enough to  attract  talents  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but if we do not cut personal income tax  at  the\r\n\r\nhighest  end, Sir, no matter what we do, those higher  income\r\n\r\nearners will think that Singapore is trying to cream off what\r\n\r\nthey have contributed and, therefore, it may not be enough on\r\n\r\nits own, but it is still necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Chia mentioned that our corporate tax is not\r\n\r\nbold   enough,  suggesting  that  perhaps  we  should  reduce\r\n\r\ncorporate tax even further.  Yes, probably a further cut  may\r\n\r\nbe  even  more  effective in bringing in foreign  investments\r\n\r\nbut, if we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo so, we need to then increase GST.  So I wonder again if Mr\r\n\r\nChia  is  suggesting that we should review whether we  should\r\n\r\nincrease the GST even further in order to finance the further\r\n\r\ncuts in corporate taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Can I clarify something, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, Mr Gan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Yes, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that\r\n\r\nit  is not necessary to cut personal income tax.  This saving\r\n\r\ncould be used to cut corporate tax further, which would  give\r\n\r\nus  an equal balance.  So I am not saying that we should  cut\r\n\r\nmore  of the corporate income tax and then increase the  GST.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member will have to hear me more clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do hear Mr Chia\r\n\r\nclearly, but I just said earlier that cutting personal income\r\n\r\ntax  is  a  must,  if we are to attract foreign  talents  and\r\n\r\nforeign high income earners and entrepreneurs to come to  our\r\n\r\ncountry   and   to   retain  them  here.   Even   our   local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs will benefit from this.  Given this  point,  my\r\n\r\nnext  point will therefore be valid, that if we have  to  cut\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax and we still want to cut  corporate  tax\r\n\r\nfurther,  then  there is no other choice but to  raise  taxes\r\n\r\nfrom elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point that Mr Chia mentioned is that GST\r\n\r\nincreases  in  future  should  maybe  warrant  some  kind  of\r\n\r\nexemption.   That  perhaps is an item for  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance to consider, but my personal view is that there is  a\r\n\r\nvery  high  cost of policing exempt items.  Coming with  this\r\n\r\nhigh cost would mean more resources would have to be put  in.\r\n\r\nIt  would  mean, again, more taxes to be collected.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, giving exempt items would mean the collection  of\r\n\r\nGST  overall must come down and, therefore, again, it implies\r\n\r\nhigher GST rates.  So again I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot sure whether Mr Chia is suggesting higher GST rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it would be far better for us to come\r\n\r\nout  with  a  package to target at those in need rather  than\r\n\r\ngeneral  exempt items, because if we exempt sushi,  the  poor\r\n\r\neat  sushi; the rich also would eat sushi.  Similarly, if  we\r\n\r\nexempt rice, the poor eat rice; so do the rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Chia said that we should continue to\r\n\r\nsubsidise car parks.  This is not an issue, whether we buy  a\r\n\r\ncar  to keep and not to drive it.  Mr Chia is entitled to buy\r\n\r\na  car  and keep it and not drive it, although we will wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  he  would  bother to buy a car.  But, nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\nissue on car parks is a matter of cost recovery.  If we  have\r\n\r\ntravelled to other parts of the world, we would realise  that\r\n\r\nSingapore,  comparatively speaking, has one of  the  cheapest\r\n\r\ncar  park charges in the world.  And most of the cosmopolitan\r\n\r\ncities  have very expensive car parks, and it is  often  that\r\n\r\nyou  find  that it is a lot cheaper to take a taxi, take  the\r\n\r\nunderground or take a bus, or most likely, just walk to where\r\n\r\nyou want to go.  Therefore, for this car park issue, it is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of cost recovery, rather than compensation for  those\r\n\r\nwho  want  to buy cars and keep them at home without  driving\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spent so much time addressing the issues of\r\n\r\nour  Opposition Members, I have very little time left for  my\r\n\r\nown speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I did not forget the offset package but I\r\n\r\nwould  like to state that the offset package is not  forever.\r\n\r\nIt  is a smokescreen that makes you feel good but eventually,\r\n\r\nyou  have to pay GST, but without the offset package.  I  did\r\n\r\nnot forget that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan talked about my objection to philanthropy and car\r\n\r\nownership.   I  did  not.  I have given this  and  others  as\r\n\r\nexamples  to  ask  whether or not we  should  consider  other\r\n\r\noptions  rather  than just raising GST as an  easy  way  out.\r\n\r\nRaising GST would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffect  the majority of the people, especially the lower  and\r\n\r\nmiddle-lower income.  When a Government decides to increase a\r\n\r\ntax,  which is so broad-based, affecting everybody, including\r\n\r\nthe  business at this point in time, should we not  ask:   is\r\n\r\nthere any other option, or do we just accept whatever it is?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that Mr\r\n\r\nLow  does not support philanthropy.  What I said was  he  was\r\n\r\nsuggesting that we should not give tax rebates for those  who\r\n\r\nhave  donated,  for those philanthropists.  Sir,  may  I  now\r\n\r\ncontinue with my speech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economy has undergone tremendous fundamental\r\n\r\nand structural changes over the last few years.  The external\r\n\r\nenvironment has definitely changed.  Our market has  changed,\r\n\r\nour  competitors have changed and we too must change in order\r\n\r\nto survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this year's Budget is in response to\r\n\r\nthose changes to keep Singapore competitive.  These measures,\r\n\r\nthe  tax  cuts, are much welcomed by our business  community.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  there is undoubtedly  a  price  to  pay.   To\r\n\r\nbalance the budget, the GST rate has to be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget does provide for a comprehensive compensation\r\n\r\npackage  to cushion the impact of the GST hike.  However,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  without  pain.  I agree.  I have no doubt  that  our\r\n\r\npeople  are fully aware of the challenges that we are  facing\r\n\r\ntoday  and I am confident that they are all prepared to  make\r\n\r\nshort-term  sacrifices  to achieve  long-term  stability  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.   But  it is crucial for us to  ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nefforts  to restructure our economy succeed so that  we  keep\r\n\r\nfaith with our people, and so that their sacrifices will  not\r\n\r\nbe in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to succeed in restructuring and\r\n\r\nrepositioning  our economy, I would like to  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in addition to the change in the tax  regime,  to\r\n\r\nconsider   three  aspects  -  the  Government   itself,   the\r\n\r\nbusinesses and the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government. True, taxation is only one of\r\n\r\nthe many components of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost.  Reduction in corporate and individual  taxes\r\n\r\nis  helpful, but tax cuts alone are not sufficient to  ensure\r\n\r\nSingapore's overall competitiveness.  It is important for the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   be   conscious  of  the  overall   business\r\n\r\nenvironment and take steps to further reduce operating  costs\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you my experience. My company,\r\n\r\nNatsteel,  is  in  a highly competitive industry.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nwonder  that we are still alive today.  We have to constantly\r\n\r\nbattle  cheaper  imports  from low cost  overseas  suppliers.\r\n\r\nMargins  erode as competition intensifies.  The only way  for\r\n\r\nus  to  stay  afloat is to make sure that we are always  more\r\n\r\ncost-effective  and provide better quality and  service  than\r\n\r\nour competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, review and restructuring happen every day in my\r\n\r\ncompany.  It is a way of life where I work.  In the same way,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  must not let up its efforts on  streamlining\r\n\r\nits bureaucracy and to oil its machinery, so as to provide an\r\n\r\never  more  cost-effective business environment.  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister for Transport announced yesterday  that  a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $18 million would be put aside to upgrade our ports.\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, our port must continue to upgrade its facilities\r\n\r\nand  improve  its  operational efficiency to  stay  ahead  of\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, our banking sector must be reformed to\r\n\r\nprovide   world-class  services.   So  too  our  bureaucratic\r\n\r\nprocesses   must   be  streamlined  to  facilitate   business\r\n\r\ntransactions.  Our regulatory systems and our  laws  must  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  regularly  to  ensure  greater  flexibility   while\r\n\r\npreserving  the  integrity of the system.   Sir,  this  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous   process  and  will  become   increasingly   more\r\n\r\nimportant as the world becomes increasingly more competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee seeks to reposition our\r\n\r\neconomy for the new era, but we must not stop here.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the  Government  to  consider  setting  up  a\r\n\r\npermanent high level\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInter-Ministerial Committee with the objective of ensuring  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive business environment.  This Committee  will  then\r\n\r\nhelp  to  coordinate among the various Ministries and provide\r\n\r\ninputs  and  feedback  on the implications  of  the  policies\r\n\r\nimplemented  by  the  various  Ministries  on  the   business\r\n\r\nenvironment,  as  well as recommend measures to  continuously\r\n\r\nimprove our competitiveness.  In this way, we can ensure that\r\n\r\nthe efforts to strengthen our economy's fundamentals will  be\r\n\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the business community. The tax cuts and various\r\n\r\nincentives  mentioned in the Budget will,  undoubtedly,  give\r\n\r\nour   businesses  a  much  needed  boost  and  attract   more\r\n\r\ninvestments  here.  However, we will need  to  supplement  it\r\n\r\nwith  more refined tools, such as the pioneer incentives,  to\r\n\r\nattract the right types of businesses here and not just those\r\n\r\nthat  are  primarily  motivated by  the  low  tax  regime  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The incentives for the financial industry and the\r\n\r\nshipping industry are moves in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local businesses, on the other hand, must not just\r\n\r\nsit  back and enjoy the ride of lower tax regime because they\r\n\r\nmust  know  that  their seats do not have safety  belts  and,\r\n\r\ninstead, they are fitted with ejection buttons.  If  they  do\r\n\r\nnothing,  it  will  not be very long before competitors  will\r\n\r\ncatch  up  and  they will be promptly ejected.  Instead,  our\r\n\r\nbusiness  community must take this opportunity  for  them  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  their  business.  They must  not  lose  time  in\r\n\r\nupgrading  themselves  and in seeking new  opportunities.   I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  urge  the  Government  to  consider  taking\r\n\r\nproactive  initiatives  to help local companies  upgrade  and\r\n\r\nventure abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about China. I would not go into the\r\n\r\ndetails  of China.  A lot has been said already.  But  China,\r\n\r\nundoubtedly, is a challenge as well as an opportunity.  It is\r\n\r\nimportant for us to look at China, but it is not easy  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  China.   Venturing  overseas,  especially  into\r\n\r\nplaces like China, has inherent risks and difficulties.  Many\r\n\r\nof  us  do not have the resources nor the know-how to venture\r\n\r\nabroad.  It is also difficult and at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimes,  costly to recruit or persuade senior managers  to  go\r\n\r\noverseas  and  work  there.   These  are  perhaps  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  play a significant role.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   could   consider   providing   incentives    for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans working overseas, either to the individual or to\r\n\r\nthe  employer  to  help  reduce the  high  cost  of  overseas\r\n\r\npostings, and encourage our companies to venture abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the people. Sir, we must prepare our people for\r\n\r\nthe  challenges  ahead.  As economic restructuring  picks  up\r\n\r\nmomentum,  changes are going to take place at a  much  faster\r\n\r\npace.  Certain sectors of activities in the economy will find\r\n\r\nthemselves becoming obsolete very quickly. They will need  to\r\n\r\ninnovate  and  change to stay relevant.   Employees  who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  keep  up with the pace of change will  soon  find\r\n\r\nthemselves being phased out.  It is, therefore, critical that\r\n\r\nwe  step  up our training and retraining programmes  to  help\r\n\r\nthese workers adapt to the new economy.  More importantly, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  inculcate  in them the spirit  of  flexibility  and\r\n\r\nadaptability.  They need to change their mindsets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a saying, \"give the man a fish and you feed\r\n\r\nhim  for  a meal; teach him how to fish and you feed him  for\r\n\r\nlife\".   This is a very well-known saying, but unfortunately,\r\n\r\nI think it might not be true today.  In this fast paced world\r\n\r\ntoday, very soon, I am afraid, you will find that there is no\r\n\r\nmore  fish in the water and, therefore, teaching him to  fish\r\n\r\nis  still  not  enough.  We have to teach him basic  survival\r\n\r\nskills.   If  there is no fish, he must learn  to  hunt.   If\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  animals left, he might have  to  go  back  to\r\n\r\nfarming.   Just  like  the mice in the  book  \"Who  moved  my\r\n\r\ncheese?\",  he  needs  to look for new cheese  all  the  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we need to look at our education system, not  just\r\n\r\nto  impart  knowledge  and  skills,  but  also  the  survival\r\n\r\ninstinct that is so crucial in the world today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people must also have realistic expectations. Many\r\n\r\nof  us  are used to the fast economic growth in the  80s  and\r\n\r\n90s.    Many  of  us  are  used  to  see  significant  annual\r\n\r\nincrements and promotions and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the tight labour market in the past, employers used  all\r\n\r\nkinds of ways and means to retain staff.  This may not be the\r\n\r\ncase in future and we need to get used to the new environment\r\n\r\nand  be  realistic  in our expectations.   We  need  to  make\r\n\r\nserious efforts to reform the seniority-based wage system  to\r\n\r\none  that  is  based on productivity and contributions.   And\r\n\r\nperhaps, we could start with the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we must still recognise that there\r\n\r\nwould  be  invariably people who are unable to cope with  the\r\n\r\nchanges, or those who might need a bit more time to adapt  to\r\n\r\nchanges.   We have to put in place an adequate social  safety\r\n\r\nnet  to help these people.  We must ensure our cost of living\r\n\r\nremains affordable in general.  Healthcare and education,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, are of the greatest concern.  For this reason,  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  the  Government will  be  absorbing  the  GST\r\n\r\nincreases in both these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also set up this Committee to Combat\r\n\r\nProfiteering chaired by Mr Chan Soo Sen.  I think  there  may\r\n\r\nbe  a need for an agency to monitor the general trend of cost\r\n\r\nof  living,  to provide feedback and make recommendations  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government from time to time.  Perhaps, the role  of  Mr\r\n\r\nChan's  Committee  can be expanded for this  purpose,  rather\r\n\r\nthan just looking at the GST impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is important for us to give Singaporeans a\r\n\r\nvision,  a  dream that they can strive for, a realistic  goal\r\n\r\nthat  we  can hope to achieve.  This common vision and  dream\r\n\r\nwill serve as a platform to unite all Singaporeans as we sail\r\n\r\nthrough the restructuring process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, Sir, the task ahead of us is a\r\n\r\nchallenging one.  The recession last year might have  been  a\r\n\r\ncrisis,  but  I  think  it  might have  been  a  blessing  in\r\n\r\ndisguise.   It  reminded all of us that  we  are  vulnerable,\r\n\r\ndespite  our past successes.  Our competitors are  no  longer\r\n\r\nthe  store  next  door; our competitors  are  no  longer  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries.  We are competing against  China  and\r\n\r\nthe whole world.  We need to quickly reposition our economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non a stronger footing to meet these challenges.  Sir, we have\r\n\r\nthe  mandate of the people to lead them out of the  recession\r\n\r\nand  to provide them with better prospects and opportunities.\r\n\r\nThey  have  trusted us.  They are willing to make  short-term\r\n\r\nsacrifices.   We must keep faith with the people and  deliver\r\n\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial policies outlined by Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nLee  is  the  first  step  towards  restoring  and  enhancing\r\n\r\nSingapore's  competitiveness.   To  eventually   succeed   in\r\n\r\nrepositioning our economy and fulfill the task  entrusted  to\r\n\r\nus  by  our  people we need a strong tripartite collaboration\r\n\r\namong  the Government, the business community and the people.\r\n\r\nWhile   the   Government  provides  a  conducive  competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment,  the business community must take  the  lead  in\r\n\r\nspearheading  our economic expansion and our people  must  be\r\n\r\nnimble  and  be prepared to be flexible and adaptable.   This\r\n\r\nway,  Sir,  we will be able to stay ahead of our competitors,\r\n\r\nattain economic excellence and realise our Singapore dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.18 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of\r\n\r\nthe advantages of speaking on the second day of a debate like\r\n\r\nthis  is  that you get the chance to go home after the  first\r\n\r\nday to make changes to the text so as to avoid repetition.  I\r\n\r\nknow it is hard for you to believe this, but I found that the\r\n\r\ndeletions I had to make were all the nice things I wanted  to\r\n\r\nsay  about the Government and the Budget.  So I am left  with\r\n\r\nthe parts which are, well, not so nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the jury is still out as to whether there will be\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery this year.  The signals  from  the  United\r\n\r\nStates for the first quarter are mixed and it is still  early\r\n\r\ndays  as  to whether our economy would turn around.   MTI  is\r\n\r\noptimistic, revising its prediction of economic growth for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore from between 1% and 3% to between 2% and  4%.   But\r\n\r\nthen  MTI has been wrong before, predicting growth when there\r\n\r\nwas recession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has always maintained that at 3%, our GST\r\n\r\nrate is one of the lowest in the world and we lag behind  the\r\n\r\nGST rates of other countries.  Sir, this is one race where  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  we are in a hurry to be number  one.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore a bitter pill for Singaporeans to swallow when they\r\n\r\nheard that the Goods and Services Tax would be increased from\r\n\r\n3%  to  5%, coming as it was just two weeks after the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister had assured the House that the GST would  only\r\n\r\nbe raised when the economy is on a firmer footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in another perspective, it is just not two\r\n\r\nlittle  percentage  points more that we  are  talking  about.\r\n\r\nWhat  it  means is that for every $100 that you spend,  where\r\n\r\nyou  now pay $3 in GST, you will in future be paying $5,  and\r\n\r\nthat is a 66% increase in your tax bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government argues that it needs to lower income\r\n\r\ntaxes  in order that we can attract investments and business.\r\n\r\nThe  DPM  has lamented that companies and foreigners are  not\r\n\r\ncoming to Singapore because the first thing they want to know\r\n\r\nis what is your tax rate.  Is it not too high?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much one has to pay in taxes in a country is a\r\n\r\nconsideration, but that is not the starting point.  I do  not\r\n\r\nintend  to  dwell on why people find Singapore  unattractive,\r\n\r\nbut  as Mr Inderjit Singh has said yesterday, there is a slew\r\n\r\nof  other  indirect taxes and levies that one has to  pay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Therefore, while we can appreciate the  lowering\r\n\r\nof income taxes, it has been pointed out that that is not the\r\n\r\nraison d'etre for going into business.  If that was so,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  including myself, would  not  have  gone  into\r\n\r\nbusiness when the corporate tax was 40% for a long time.   We\r\n\r\nwould  not  have become the nation of shopkeepers,  merchants\r\n\r\nand manufacturers that we are today.  People go into business\r\n\r\nbecause there is business to be done and profits to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe made.  Likewise too with foreigners who come here, or with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who venture abroad.  They go to where  there  is\r\n\r\nbusiness to be done and where there is money to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do businessmen queue up to go to China even though\r\n\r\nChina  has high taxes?  Because goods can be produced cheaply\r\n\r\nthere  and because there is a potential market of 1.2 billion\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, tax havens would be places of bustling\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  economic activity but you do not  find  people\r\n\r\nmaking  a beeline to the likes of Brunei, the Cayman Islands,\r\n\r\nthe British Virgin Islands or Liechtenstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while everyone is happy with lower taxes does it\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean Government ends up collecting less  if  the\r\n\r\ntax  rates  are  lowered?   I  will  now  ask  the  Clerk  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  two  tables  to  Members.   [Copies   of   Tables\r\n\r\ndistributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two tables here, but let us take a look\r\n\r\nfirst at Table No 1.  Column 1 in Table 1 shows the amount of\r\n\r\ncorporate  and income taxes collected from FY93  -  the  year\r\n\r\nbefore we introduced GST, when the corporate tax rate and the\r\n\r\ntop  personal income tax rate were 27% and 30%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAnd  it shows through the years when we progressively reduced\r\n\r\nthe rates to 24.5% and 26%, respectively.  Column 2 shows the\r\n\r\nincome tax as a percentage of all taxes, which includes  your\r\n\r\nestate  duties, property taxes, stamp duties,  lotteries  and\r\n\r\nbetting  duties,  and the GST collected by  IRAS.   Column  3\r\n\r\nshows the amount collected from GST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the then Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu introduced\r\n\r\nthe concept of GST in his House in his Budget Speech in 1993,\r\n\r\nhe told us that GST collection per year would be $921 million\r\n\r\nper  annum.   The total revenue loss to the Government  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the reduction in income taxes, property  rebates,\r\n\r\nmore   public  assistance,  more  subsidy  for   health   and\r\n\r\neducation,  S&C  offsets,  plus  the  transitional  measures,\r\n\r\n(which were the rebates for S&C, rental rebates and grants to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  CCCs, and these would only be for five years)  would  be\r\n\r\n$1.1  billion.   This would mean a loss  of  revenue  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of $183 million per year, for at least the first 5\r\n\r\nyears, after which he said the position would then be revenue\r\n\r\nneutral.  Well, it all sounded very well-packaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us take a look at Column 1 again. It shows\r\n\r\nthat  over  the  years since income tax rates  were  reduced,\r\n\r\nincome  tax collection actually grew from $7.31 billion  that\r\n\r\nyear, the year before we lowered the rates, to $12.35 billion\r\n\r\nin  FY2000.   I  must say that there are some missing  spaces\r\n\r\nbecause  these are the years 2001 and 2002-end.  We have  not\r\n\r\ngot the Annual Report of the IRAS yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at Column 2. As a percentage, income\r\n\r\ntax  has  always  contributed to around  50-plus  to  60-plus\r\n\r\npercent of all taxes collected by Government.  By FY2000,  it\r\n\r\nalready  contributed to 65.6%, more or less the same  portion\r\n\r\nas in 1993, in spite of the reduction in corporate and income\r\n\r\ntax rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column 3 shows the revenue that has been collected from\r\n\r\nGST.   In  the  first year that GST was implemented,  ie,  in\r\n\r\n1994, Government collected $1.52 billion, much more than  the\r\n\r\n$921  million  that was estimated.  There  was  certainly  no\r\n\r\nshortfall  of  the  $183 million that Dr Hu had  anticipated.\r\n\r\nGST  collection has increased steadily over the years, except\r\n\r\nfor two years, 1998 and 2002, when recession resulted in less\r\n\r\nconsumption  spending.  But every year,  GST  collection  far\r\n\r\nexceeded what Government gave away.  By FY2000 it had already\r\n\r\nexceeded  the  $2  billion mark, double  the  amount  it  had\r\n\r\noriginally  anticipated  it would collect.   And  this  year,\r\n\r\nGovernment expects to take in another $2 billion in GST.  All\r\n\r\nthis is based on the present GST rate of 3%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So income tax rates were reduced, GST was implemented,\r\n\r\nthere  were  a  lot  of giveaways, but the position  was  not\r\n\r\nrevenue neutral.  Far from it, the Government collected  more\r\n\r\nincome taxes and more GST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any more GST will just increase the burden on the\r\n\r\npeople,  especially  the poor.  The Government  may  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  me  but GST is regressive.  That is why the  underlying\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  the  income tax collection  system  is  called\r\n\r\n\"progressive\".  It means the more you earn the more  you  pay\r\n\r\nin  taxes.   The  rich who have made the  most  from  all  of\r\n\r\nsociety  pay more to Government so that money can be used  to\r\n\r\nhelp  those  who  are less well off.  How do  you  justify  a\r\n\r\nsystem  that now says the rich, with their big fat  salaries,\r\n\r\npay  less, and they are probably the ones who do not feel the\r\n\r\npinch,  and the other 70%, who could not afford to do so  all\r\n\r\nalong,  have  to start coughing up?  Sure, you can  give  the\r\n\r\ngoodies, or the offsets, but I want to ask:  why do you  want\r\n\r\nto  break  a man's legs and then give him crutches to  wobble\r\n\r\non?   Is not that adding to the crutch mentality that we were\r\n\r\ntrying so hard to avoid in Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conclusion after seeing all these figures is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has realised what a goldmine the GST  is.   It  is\r\n\r\nlike  the  COE.  When it was first introduced, no  one  could\r\n\r\nforesee  that  the COE would be a billion-dollar money-raking\r\n\r\nmachine  for  the Government.  I am prepared to predict  that\r\n\r\nwithin  a  few  years, GST collections  will  exceed  the  $3\r\n\r\nbillion  mark, and it would not be at the expense  of  income\r\n\r\ntax  collections  because the economic pie will  expand.   So\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are  told that GST must be raised to  make  up  for\r\n\r\nlosses  in  the collection of income taxes, I must  ask  what\r\n\r\nlosses is the Government talking about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also puts forth the argument that GST\r\n\r\nmust  go  up so that we do not run into a structural deficit.\r\n\r\nI would be the first to query in this House if the Government\r\n\r\nwere  to try and run a less than prudent Budget.  But let  us\r\n\r\nlook at the Government's budgetary record from 1994.  Let  us\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  second  Table.  Column 1 shows  the  estimated\r\n\r\nsurplus or deficit each year when the Budget is presented  to\r\n\r\nParliament.   Column 2 shows the revised figure  towards  the\r\n\r\nend of each\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial year.  But it is not the final figure as  all  data\r\n\r\nwould  not  have been fully compiled by then.   So  Column  3\r\n\r\nshows  the  actual figure which is available only  two  years\r\n\r\nafter the end of the financial year for which it is reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record of the Government in this respect is good.\r\n\r\nIt has never incurred a deficit in any year, except possibly,\r\n\r\nit is going to have one in 2001.  In 1998, when we had the $2\r\n\r\nbillion off-Budget measures to fight the recession, that  was\r\n\r\nwhen the then Finance Minister estimated that we would run up\r\n\r\na  deficit  of $800 million, the Government ended up  with  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  $930  million.  That is  $1.7  billion  off  its\r\n\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in 1999, when Government estimated a deficit of $5\r\n\r\nbillion, it walked away with a cool $4.9 billion at  the  end\r\n\r\nof that year.  That is $10 billion off the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we had two off-Budget packages, $2.2 billion in\r\n\r\nJuly  and $11.3 billion in October.  We were told that  these\r\n\r\ntwo packages would result in budget deficits of $4 billion in\r\n\r\nFY2001 and $1 billion in FY2002.  But we see from the revised\r\n\r\nfigures for FY2001 our deficit is estimated at $1.43 billion,\r\n\r\nfar below the high $4 billion anticipated deficit.  And as  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier, the actual figure will not be known  till\r\n\r\nanother  year's time.  So maybe there is some  hope  that  it\r\n\r\nmight be a plus, but it is still, at this point of time,  off\r\n\r\nthe mark by $2.57 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 2002, the estimated deficit of $1 billion that\r\n\r\nhad  been  forecast when the off-Budget package was announced\r\n\r\nis  now turning out to be a surplus of $900 million.  That is\r\n\r\nbefore the new giveaways are computed inside, but it is still\r\n\r\n$1.9 billion off the mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more than happy if our forecast deficits are\r\n\r\nreduced,  better  still, if they turn  into  surpluses.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should therefore not be waving the red  flag  all\r\n\r\nthe  time,  otherwise it will end up like the boy  who  cried\r\n\r\nwolf, and nobody is going to believe you after a while.   The\r\n\r\nfiscal record of the Government is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  envy of many other governments.  Between 1997 and  2001,\r\n\r\nbased on what we know - as of now - the Government netted  in\r\n\r\n$15 billion.  It is not a bad record, in fact, it is great, I\r\n\r\nwill  say, considering that we lowered income taxes and  gave\r\n\r\naway  so  many  goodies.  It is a feather in the Government's\r\n\r\ncap  but,  Sir,  it does not need to pluck any more  feathers\r\n\r\nfrom the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, revenue is just one part of the\r\n\r\nequation.   I  agree with the Deputy Prime Minister  when  he\r\n\r\nsays  that  Government  departments have  to  spend  only  on\r\n\r\nessentials and eschew frills and extravagance.  I  wish  that\r\n\r\nthat  message  had been sent earlier.  It seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nevery  Ministry and many statutory boards today want to  have\r\n\r\ntheir own headquarters or corporate building.  But if you see\r\n\r\nmany of them, you wonder if they are looking more like 5-star\r\n\r\nhotels.    Singaporeans  refer  to  the  Seven   Wonders   of\r\n\r\nSingapore:  MOE,  JTC, IRAS, the new Supreme  Court,  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs sitting on a choice district 10 land, the twin towers\r\n\r\nof  Home Affairs in Thomson and the upcoming HDB headquarters\r\n\r\nin  Toa  Payoh.   It  seems  that twin  towers  are  becoming\r\n\r\nfashionable  in Singapore.  In fact, I cannot understand  why\r\n\r\nHDB,  which is downsizing as the building programme is  being\r\n\r\ncut  back  drastically, cannot stay where it is.  It  has  to\r\n\r\nbuild  twin  towers.  I remember not too long  ago  too  that\r\n\r\nGovernment offices had that spartan look.  Of course, we  now\r\n\r\ncan afford to look better.  But if you see the furnishing and\r\n\r\nfittings in many of these buildings, I think there must be  a\r\n\r\ncompetition  amongst them to outdo one another to  see  which\r\n\r\none can look better than the Four Seasons Hotel.  Needless to\r\n\r\nadd,  posh buildings mean large sums of money every year just\r\n\r\nto upkeep them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must, of course, give credit to MITA. MITA has\r\n\r\nseen it fit to take over an old police station, refurbish  it\r\n\r\n-  I have not been inside, so I cannot say what it looks like\r\n\r\ninside - but I understand that the people there might not  be\r\n\r\ntoo  comfortable, considering the fact that they are  working\r\n\r\nin former jail cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many departments also publish their own newsletters,\r\n\r\nwhich  contain news which are quite outdated, or  PR  flyers.\r\n\r\nVery often I am inundated with glossy brochures and colourful\r\n\r\ncharts  like  this one [indicating].  It is a  data  sheet  - Statistics of Singapore.  I think I am expected to hang  this\r\n\r\nup  somewhere.   But  all these do cost a  lot  of  money  to\r\n\r\nproduce and print, and I really question the purpose of  many\r\n\r\nof  these things which are sent out.  I wonder again how many\r\n\r\nof   these  items  that  are  circulated  actually  go   into\r\n\r\nwastepaper baskets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take again the recent renaming of statutory boards under\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Some people may feel  it\r\n\r\nis  hip  to change the Standards, Productivity and Innovation\r\n\r\nBoard  to  Spring Singapore, the Trade Development  Board  to\r\n\r\nInternational Enterprise or IE, and the National Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Board  to  Agency  for  Science,  Technology  and\r\n\r\nResearch or A*STAR, but at least the old names, to me,  meant\r\n\r\nwhat each of these organisations stood for.  Can you see  how\r\n\r\nforeigners,  or  for that matter even Singaporeans,  have  to\r\n\r\nscratch  their  heads  to look for something  called  the  IE\r\n\r\n(International  Enterprise)  when  they  just  want  to  make\r\n\r\ninquiries  about  trade?   Spring  Singapore  sounds  like  a\r\n\r\nnightclub.   And  if  a lot of money has been  paid  to  some\r\n\r\nconsultant  to  dream  up A*STAR, let me  say  that  it  also\r\n\r\nreminds  me  of a certain singer from Taiwan who  writes  her\r\n\r\nname  in the same way with the (*) sign after the letter \"A\".\r\n\r\nSo much for creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Two\r\n\r\nrecessions  in less than five years have still not  sent  the\r\n\r\nsignal  that  there  are many issues that  are  fundamentally\r\n\r\nwrong in Singapore.  Like others before me, I am prepared  to\r\n\r\nwait for the Economic Review Committee to present its report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to say something and, that is, it is not\r\n\r\nenough  to  bring out off-Budget measures every time  we  run\r\n\r\ninto  difficulties.  Off-Budget measures are ad hoc, they  do\r\n\r\nnot  provide  the  kind of certainty  that  we  all  want  as\r\n\r\nsolutions to our problems.  The only bold thing I find  about\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget is the unshamed hurry  to  increase  tax\r\n\r\nrevenue   under   the   guise  of  preparing   for   changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances  at a time when Singaporeans  are  reeling  and\r\n\r\nrecoiling   from   the   effects  of  the   recession,   when\r\n\r\nunemployment is now hovering around a six-digit  figure,  and\r\n\r\nwhen new entrants into the job market cannot even smell a job\r\n\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more than half the MPs who have spoken so far have\r\n\r\nexpressed  their reservations about the increase in  GST.   I\r\n\r\nwant to beseech the Government that this is a genuine concern\r\n\r\nthat  strikes  at  the  heartstrings of almost  every  single\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  And I know it might be futile to say this,  but\r\n\r\nI hope the Government would rethink this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlike  many of the hon. Members in this Chamber who have risen\r\n\r\nand  spoken  on the Budget Statement delivered by the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Finance, I would like  to\r\n\r\njoin in the debate and will try not to belabour on everything\r\n\r\nbut tread on issues that are of immediate concern.  I hope to\r\n\r\ngive  my perspectives and views on the matter and at the same\r\n\r\ntime give feedback on views I got from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.38 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I recall correctly, more than six months ago, we\r\n\r\nmade  some  commitments.  Six months ago, we  had  asked  the\r\n\r\npeople to trust us.  Six months ago, we had assured them that\r\n\r\nwe  would take care of them.  The concerns then and now  have\r\n\r\nnot  changed much.  We all know that our citizens are worried\r\n\r\nfor  their livelihood, the future of their children  and  the\r\n\r\nfuture of Singapore.  The people knew then and understood the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that  lie  ahead.   By  giving   the   PAP   an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  victory,  they  have  put  the  trust  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  whom  they know is a no-nonsense,  realistic  and\r\n\r\npragmatic   Government  who  can  deliver  and   has   always\r\n\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are more than six months later. I believe we\r\n\r\nhave  arrived  at  the juncture where  we  are  expected   to\r\n\r\ndeliver  something.  In moving forward to revive the economy;\r\n\r\nthus  creating  more jobs and businesses, we  must  not  lose\r\n\r\ntrack  of  the  very reason we are doing all  this,  ie,  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Let  us  give  them back the  self-confidence,  the\r\n\r\nmorale  and  the  self-esteem.   It  is  our  duty  in   this\r\n\r\nParliament  to  ask whether this Budget can  do  the  job  of\r\n\r\ncreating jobs and businesses.  Let us face it, Sir, no single\r\n\r\nBudget can satisfy all the sectors of the economy.  With  the\r\n\r\npresent    scenario   of   stiff   competition   and    rapid\r\n\r\nglobalisation, we have to put our priorities right, that  is,\r\n\r\nto   implement   measures   to   ensure   Singapore   remains\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback that I have received, people are quite\r\n\r\ncomfortable with the proposed tax reforms and some, like what\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit Singh had suggested, are even asking  for  more.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the expected hike in the GST, parking charges  and\r\n\r\nERP  are  of  concern.  Let us not deny also that the  offset\r\n\r\nmeasures  are quite balanced.  On the other hand, the  people\r\n\r\nare  aware  that these offset measures are not permanent  but\r\n\r\nthe  GST, HDB parking charges and ERP are here to stay.  Sir,\r\n\r\ntheir argument is simple.  They say that the Government gives\r\n\r\nthem some in the right\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npocket  and takes them out from the left pocket.   And  worse\r\n\r\nstill,  the  Government takes out more than what  they  give!\r\n\r\nThis is the feeling and it is quite prevalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing is of another concern. Many are asking: why now?\r\n\r\nCan  it be done later when the positive signs are clearer and\r\n\r\nthe economy is growing?  The experts from the ERC and MOF may\r\n\r\nprescribe  the  bitter pills and expect  people  to  swallow.\r\n\r\nMajority  may do it but some may react differently.  Already,\r\n\r\nwe are hearing more who consider migrating and hope to find a\r\n\r\nless  stressful  place  in the sun for themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nfamily.   These are generally those who are talented,  mobile\r\n\r\nand  can  afford to uproot and move.  Can we, as  a  country,\r\n\r\nafford  these losses?  As it is, we are struggling to attract\r\n\r\ntalents to our country.  Similarly, are we taking care of the\r\n\r\nunderdogs  and  the underprivileged of our  society  to  face\r\n\r\nthese  challenges?  Some argue that the GST is going  to  put\r\n\r\nthem  in deeper trouble than before.  How then, Sir,  can  we\r\n\r\nallay their worries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, time and again, has encouraged the\r\n\r\npeople to be brave, enterprising and to take risk so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  have more successful local companies and this, in  turn,\r\n\r\ncould be the other wing of growth for our country.  I am  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  repeat some of the salient points  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nother Members but I would like to stress that more should  be\r\n\r\ndone  to help the SMEs to grow.  One suggestion that I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  put forward is that the bankruptcy laws  should  be\r\n\r\nfurther reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell a story of someone I know whose\r\n\r\nfather was a successful businessman.  When he was in his mid-forties, in the prime of his life, his business went bust and\r\n\r\nhe  was declared a bankrupt.  As I understood, there are many\r\n\r\nrestrictions and rulings being applied to a bankrupt; to  put\r\n\r\nit  simply, his freedom was limited.  He wanted to revive his\r\n\r\nbusiness  and explore new areas and had tried many  times  to\r\n\r\nget discharged but failed.  Now, 15 years later, he is in his\r\n\r\nsixties,  a  broken  man  who has  practically  given  up  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  retired with many regrets and pains  of  those\r\n\r\nlost years.  By the way, he was only discharged last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with every success story that we\r\n\r\nhear  and  read  about in the media, there are hundreds,  and\r\n\r\npossibly  thousands,  that  failed.   But  these  people  are\r\n\r\nresilient and they will come back and will try again.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot  advocating  for  handouts but we must  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nenvironment and support that will not deter but spur them  to\r\n\r\ntry again and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to urge the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance to revisit the financing schemes for SMEs and  start-ups  and consider setting up a special bank that would  cater\r\n\r\nfor their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very glad that the Ministry of Education is\r\n\r\ngetting  more  funds this year.  We know the importance  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  puts  in education  by  the  sheer  size  of\r\n\r\nresources  that have been poured into education.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  not  to  invest in our people.  As we move  into  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy, we need to have more \"knowledge  workers\"\r\n\r\nthat are multi-disciplined and can handle multi-tasks at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time.   The education system should prepare the  future\r\n\r\ngenerations  for  the  rapid  changes  and  produce   nimble,\r\n\r\ncreative and innovative minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are very concerned about their children's\r\n\r\nfuture.  Thus, education is of utmost importance to them.  We\r\n\r\ncan  be comforted by the fact that we have a Government  that\r\n\r\nemphasises on quality and standards for our education.   Many\r\n\r\npeople  around  the  world and locally recognise  Singapore's\r\n\r\nquality in its education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe, Sir, we can still fine-tune it to make it\r\n\r\neven  better.  I would like to reiterate the call that I made\r\n\r\nin  my maiden speech, that is, we should have a more holistic\r\n\r\napproach  towards education.  Academic excellence should  not\r\n\r\nbe  the only thrust of education.  A child should be nurtured\r\n\r\non  values  such  as  national education,  community  spirit,\r\n\r\nsocial services, voluntarism and sports.  This will nurture a\r\n\r\nwell-rounded   individual   with   strong   community   ties.\r\n\r\nUltimately, our education system should aim to develop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are able to put Singapore and community  before\r\n\r\nself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  bringing the early  childhood  education\r\n\r\ninto the formal education system.  Put it directly under  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  MOE.  This portion of our education  system  has\r\n\r\nmostly  been  left  out  to the community  organisations  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  We know that the Ministry of Education  has\r\n\r\nsome  initiatives  and  programmes in  this  area.   Is  this\r\n\r\nenough?  Can we do more in this area?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly believe we can and we should do more in the\r\n\r\narea  of  pre-school education.  As the pressure for economic\r\n\r\nexcellence  continues, we will see more dual  income  earning\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Parents  need support to cope with  this  growing\r\n\r\ntrend and phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many developed countries that have\r\n\r\nincorporated  the  pre-school education  into  their  primary\r\n\r\neducation.   More  recently, when PM  Goh  visited  Europe  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  delegation  had  visited  countries  that  have\r\n\r\nespoused this method.  As we progress and more of our  female\r\n\r\ncitizens  go  out  to join the workforce,  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nencounter  more demands for better and structured  pre-school\r\n\r\nsystem existing under the mainstream education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should consider a system that takes in children from\r\n\r\nthree  to  five  years  old  in  the  ecole  maternelle   and\r\n\r\nkindergarten.  We could make these pre-schools as part of the\r\n\r\nprimary  schools.   The  compulsory education  law  that  was\r\n\r\npassed  in  Parliament is a clear indication of  Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to educating our future generation.  This  augurs\r\n\r\nwell for us.  Let us take this a step further and incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  foundation years into the mainstream education  provided\r\n\r\nby MOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education can ensure the quality and\r\n\r\nstandards   of   the  early  childhood  education   and   the\r\n\r\nkindergartens.  This is to ensure that a strong foundation is\r\n\r\nin  place when they continue to primary education.  I believe\r\n\r\nthe more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsenior  Members  of this Chamber would probably  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecall  that  in 1979, the pre-primary system was implemented\r\n\r\nin  some  schools.  The purpose was for bilingual  education,\r\n\r\nie,  to give students more or equal exposure to both Mandarin\r\n\r\nand  English.  It was a worthwhile exercise and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nthen  had the motivation, the vision and boldness to  see  it\r\n\r\nimplemented.    But   sad  to  say,  subsequently,   it   was\r\n\r\ndiscontinued in 1989.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has an\r\n\r\nimpeccable record locally and internationally and  I  see  no\r\n\r\nreason why they cannot take up this challenge and develop  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  early  childhood education  system  and  programme\r\n\r\nsuited for our needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to touch on education focus for the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Sir, the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs has\r\n\r\nrecently  presented the vision of a progressive  and  dynamic\r\n\r\nMalay  community.   In  the  present  economic  climate,  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  is  faced  with more daunting  challenges  and  it\r\n\r\nshould strive to do better.  It has made significant progress\r\n\r\nin  the  area of education over the past 10 years.  We should\r\n\r\nkeep  up  the  pace  and  explore  new  areas  and  try  non-traditional  fields of education.  In this  aspect,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  encourage the community to continue to emulate  the\r\n\r\nculture of academic excellence into the Malay community.   We\r\n\r\nmust  aim  to achieve high standards in education and  attain\r\n\r\nworld-class recognition in whatever we do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, Sir, is a great social leveller. Through\r\n\r\neducation and training, the community will be able  to  stand\r\n\r\ntall,  participate and be part of the mainstream.  We  should\r\n\r\nimbibe lifelong learning and make it our second nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our workers are constantly grappling with rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  and  the need to acquire new skills  and  knowledge.\r\n\r\nMany  are struggling and some are resisting the change.   How\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir, can we assist them to manage the change?  I  have\r\n\r\nagain repeated this.  I would like to commend the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower, NTUC and CDCs for their effort.  But I believe more\r\n\r\ncan be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  to  make these changes less painful and more meaningful\r\n\r\nfor our workers.  The burden of change should not fall on the\r\n\r\nemployees  but employers should also ensure that the  workers\r\n\r\nare  regularly upgraded and retrained even during good times.\r\n\r\nEmployers  should  consciously  make  provisions  for   their\r\n\r\nemployees to upgrade and pick up new skills.  Measures should\r\n\r\nbe put in place to ensure that employers play their role as a\r\n\r\nresponsible corporate citizen vis-a-vis their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the requests for assistance, the numbers given by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Manpower  on  the  success  rate  of  job\r\n\r\nmatching,  I just have this lingering pessimism that  we  are\r\n\r\njust not good at this service.  Are we then not giving people\r\n\r\nthe  false hope by offering them assistance that resulted  in\r\n\r\nnear  total  failure?   5%  to 10% success  rate?   Is  there\r\n\r\nanything  more  that  can be done to improve  this?   Are  we\r\n\r\nexploring all the possible avenues and alternatives?  I  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  the  Committee of Supply for  answers  to  these\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  recession we are going through is the result of existing\r\n\r\nfactors as well as some long-term trends.  The primary short-term   factor  is  the  collapse  in  external   demand   for\r\n\r\nelectronics  which is starting to recover.  We are  beginning\r\n\r\nto  see  signs of the turnaround in our manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nIn  the  long term, manufacturers continue to relocate  their\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  low  cost  countries  leading  to  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.  It is clear that the era where  we  depend  on\r\n\r\nexport-oriented  MNCs to provide large  scale  employment  is\r\n\r\ncoming  to an end.  Thus, the Government has stated  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  encourage  the  formation  of  more  small  and  local\r\n\r\ncompanies in the next phase of our development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask what are the pressing problems\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are  facing  today.  In  simple  terms,  existing\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are  facing  declining  profit  or  chalking   up\r\n\r\nmounting  losses.   New  start-ups are  being  clobbered  and\r\n\r\nstrangled.  In this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvironment, our people are looking forward to the Government\r\n\r\nto   provide   leadership  in  restructuring   the   business\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  address these issues: how to  make  existing\r\n\r\ncompanies  more profitable and how to create the  environment\r\n\r\nfor new start-ups to prosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, this Budget aims to position Singapore for\r\n\r\na different world through cuts in company and personal income\r\n\r\ntax.   This is based on the assumption that, doing  so,  will\r\n\r\nattract  more company formation, greater personal strife  and\r\n\r\nthereby  creating  more  jobs in future.   In  adopting  this\r\n\r\nstrategy, the Government has accepted the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Review Committee.  Sir, if these changes indeed\r\n\r\nwere  to succeed in attracting more companies and talents  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, the impact would still be felt only in the mid  or\r\n\r\nlong term.  There is not much in this Budget in the immediate\r\n\r\nterm that will give the economy a fillip in.  Nonetheless, it\r\n\r\nis  heartening that the Government has gone through a lengthy\r\n\r\nconsultation process, tapping the views and opinions of  many\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and  lay persons.  It is a reflection  of  the\r\n\r\nwillingness  of the Government to listen and to  further  the\r\n\r\npre-policy consultation process.  However, as a strategy, the\r\n\r\nBudget lacks the comprehensiveness of a total response as  it\r\n\r\naddresses only part of the issues facing Singapore.  It  uses\r\n\r\nold  tools,  that is, tax changes to address  problems  in  a\r\n\r\nchanging world.  Thus, the Government has left untouched many\r\n\r\nopportunities for truly remaking Singapore.  Like  the  other\r\n\r\nMPs  speaking before me, perhaps these are being left in  the\r\n\r\nnext  phase  after  the  Remaking  Singapore  Committee   has\r\n\r\ncompleted   its   work.   I  too  look   forward   to   their\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being tax measures, the company tax and the\r\n\r\npersonal income tax cuts, while effective in certain aspects,\r\n\r\nhave  their limitations.  Let me give some examples.   As  we\r\n\r\nall  know, the profit of a company equals revenue minus cost.\r\n\r\nAnd  of  course, what is really important to the business  is\r\n\r\nprofit  after tax.  There are only two ways one  can  have  a\r\n\r\nhigher after tax profit if we cannot increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe revenue, being in a stagnation or recession, and that is,\r\n\r\nto cut cost or reduce tax rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I would like to give a\r\n\r\ncomparison of the effectiveness of tax cut and cost reduction\r\n\r\nin  increasing  after  tax profit.  To  yield  an  after  tax\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  $1,000 for a company, the Government could  have\r\n\r\ncut  cost by $1,324.50  based on the 24.5% company tax.   And\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  it would apply to all companies, large or  small,\r\n\r\nprofitable  or not.  On the other hand, when we  cut  company\r\n\r\ntax  from 24.5% to 22%, the Government forgoes 2.5 cents  per\r\n\r\ndollar  of profit.  To yield an equivalent benefit of  $1,000\r\n\r\nto   the  company,  that  company  would  have  already  been\r\n\r\nprofitable  and must be making $40,000 profit in  that  year.\r\n\r\nFor  a  company that makes $1 million profit, of  course  the\r\n\r\nsaving of $25,000 is significant.  On the other hand,  for  a\r\n\r\ncompany  that  is only making $10,000 profit this  year,  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  is only $250.  For a company that is breaking  even,\r\n\r\nor  is not making any money at all, the tax cut has no impact\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.   Thus,  the company tax reduction  is  good  for\r\n\r\nlarge and profitable companies, such as MNCs and GLCs, but is\r\n\r\nof  little  help  for  struggling  SMEs.   Hence,  for  SMEs,\r\n\r\nreducing  cost  is  of greater benefit than reducing  company\r\n\r\ntax.   Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the  CEOs\r\n\r\nand   businessmen  who  participated  in  the  Feedback  Unit\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions commented that they are  not  too  worried\r\n\r\nabout  paying  tax at all so long as they are  making  money.\r\n\r\nMany  participants lamented that this Budget does not address\r\n\r\nthe  root  cause  of  the  high cost  of  doing  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are these main cost contributors? We know\r\n\r\nthey   are  wage  costs,  land  costs  and  other  Government\r\n\r\nadministrative fees and levies.  Wage costs have been  pushed\r\n\r\nup  over the years by the tight labour market in Singapore as\r\n\r\nwell  as  by  the  Government's policy  regarding  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  pay.  Land cost permeates through the infrastructure\r\n\r\nto contribute to higher cost all round.  For instance, higher\r\n\r\nland cost resulted in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher  rental.  And I also recall that the asset enhancement\r\n\r\npolicy  pursued  by this Government about 10 years  ago  also\r\n\r\nhelps  in playing its part in increasing land cost.   Neither\r\n\r\nwage cost nor land cost could be unwound that quickly without\r\n\r\ncausing major dislocation in our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that leaves the Government administrative fees as\r\n\r\nthe   remaining  major  cost  contributors.   And  it  is   a\r\n\r\ndisappointment to many that the Minister did  not  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to further cut these costs.  On the contrary, the\r\n\r\nMinister  decided to increase parking fees  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  control vehicle usage.  This begs the  question\r\n\r\nwhether this Government administrative fees have been cut  to\r\n\r\nthe bone.  Perhaps, the Government is waiting to evaluate the\r\n\r\nimpact  of the slew of cost-cutting measures introduced  last\r\n\r\nyear before taking any further steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his speech, the Minister spent some time on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's position on GLCs.  The gist of his  comments  is\r\n\r\nthat the Government will divest those GLCs that are no longer\r\n\r\nof  strategic  importance to the  nation.   Sir,  GLC  is  an\r\n\r\nemotive  topic  in  most of the dialogue  sessions  that  are\r\n\r\norganised  by the Feedback Unit.  For many of these sessions,\r\n\r\nthe  issue always come up.  And needless to say, most of  the\r\n\r\ncomments are unfavourable ones.  Basically, the contention is\r\n\r\nthat  GLCs  crowd  out the SMEs.  Like an ecological  system,\r\n\r\nevery niche in the system is occupied by a species.  And when\r\n\r\nan exotic species without a natural predator is introduced to\r\n\r\nthe  eco-system,  they would displace the  existing  species.\r\n\r\nOnce  established,  no new species could  emerge  unless  the\r\n\r\nexisting  species become extinct or the environment undergoes\r\n\r\ndramatic changes creating new niches in the process.   So  it\r\n\r\nis the case with our economic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, to encourage greater entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nand risk-taking, we need to review the fundamental reason for\r\n\r\nthe existence of GLCs.  Merely divesting GLCs by itself might\r\n\r\nnot  address the issue.  The fact is that the Government  has\r\n\r\nmade  use  of  the  GLCs  as part of its  talent  development\r\n\r\nprogramme for the civil service.  Senior officials have  been\r\n\r\ntransferred\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregularly  to  these  GLCs to make way for  younger  officers\r\n\r\nmoving through the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Sir, I believe that it will be very difficult to\r\n\r\nget  the  whole system to accept the need to revamp the  GLCs\r\n\r\nfor  an inconclusive objective of promoting entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  more pragmatic solution is how  to  level  the\r\n\r\nplaying  field  and  to leave niches in  the  eco-system  for\r\n\r\nbudding young enterprises.  A favourite example quoted in the\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions I talked about is that of  PWD  Consultant\r\n\r\nwith its 5-year moratorium.  You will say that as a result of\r\n\r\nits monopoly of Government projects at a time when Government\r\n\r\nprojects are the only ones available, this company has  grown\r\n\r\nsubstantially, so much so that it has to subcontract out  its\r\n\r\njobs  while  the  independent firms  competing  with  it  are\r\n\r\nstarved of projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to GST. Once the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  cut  company  and  personal  income  taxes,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST  becomes inevitable.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\nannounced   a   relief   package,  including   the   Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares for lower income families to offset  the\r\n\r\nincreased  burden  of  the tax.  I would  like,  firstly,  to\r\n\r\ncomment on the philosophy of the ERS and then touch on  three\r\n\r\nelements of the GST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, it is not the first time the Government\r\n\r\nis  handing  out  cash  disbursements using  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nshares.   Last year, the Government issued the New  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares.   Now the Economic Restructuring Shares.  It  is  all\r\n\r\nabout a mindset change.  As a Government and as a people,  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided  that it is the right thing to do  distributing\r\n\r\npublic  funds to alleviate economic burdens as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nGovernment restructuring policies.  The ER shares will be  in\r\n\r\nplace  for  five  years, long enough to become  part  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  psyche.   I  think it would be  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nchange  our people's expectations in the future in this  area\r\n\r\nwhen we encounter economic recessions then.  At that time, we\r\n\r\nwould be handing out more ER shares.  In this respect,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned about creating a dependency mentality in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  people.  When we look back 20 years from now, it is very\r\n\r\nlikely  that this Budget will be remembered as the  one  that\r\n\r\nchanged   our  social  compact  for  a  different  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhether it is good or bad, only time could tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to specific comments on the GST. When\r\n\r\nthe  GST was first introduced in 1993, it was presented as  a\r\n\r\ntax  reform  aiming  to be revenue neutral.   The  Government\r\n\r\nreviewed all the existing taxes then to ensure that  GST  did\r\n\r\nnot increase the tax burden.  Two examples come to mind.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  is the tax on petrol.  The Government changed the  tax\r\n\r\nregime  so  that the total tax collected per litre of  petrol\r\n\r\nremained  the same.  The second is cess.  It remained  at  4%\r\n\r\nafter  GST, with 1% going to the Singapore Tourist Board  and\r\n\r\n3%  earmarked for GST.  This time round, there is no  mention\r\n\r\nof  the words \"tax reform\", even though the tax reduction and\r\n\r\nthe additional GST collections nearly balance each other out.\r\n\r\nHence, we could conclude that there is no attempt to mitigate\r\n\r\nthe  increase  like  before.  Thus, it would  be  logical  to\r\n\r\nexpect to pay more for petrol, cess and everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, it seems that the GST relief, such as the\r\n\r\nER  shares,  will be distributed based on HDB housing  types,\r\n\r\njust like before.  The feedback received by the Feedback Unit\r\n\r\nis  that  a  fair  number  of Singaporeans  found  that  this\r\n\r\nclassification is not entirely equitable.  For example,  some\r\n\r\nhouseholds living in 5-room flats have dependent aged parents\r\n\r\nliving  in those households.  Had the parents been living  by\r\n\r\nthemselves, they would have qualified for more payoffs.   So,\r\n\r\nby  living  together, these Singaporeans feel that  they  are\r\n\r\nbeing  penalised.  Some have suggested that it would be  more\r\n\r\nequitable to use household income together with the household\r\n\r\nsize as a measure to determine the disbursement.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would consider these suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to what the other MPs have said, the general\r\n\r\nsentiment  amongst our population is that with  lower  income\r\n\r\ntax  and  higher GST, the rich get richer and  the  poor  get\r\n\r\npoorer.  Well, with the GST relief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npackage,  it is not as simple as that, at least for the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years.   It is clear that for the higher income  group,\r\n\r\nthey  would enjoy some tax savings as the reduction of income\r\n\r\ntax  is  far greater than the increase in GST.  We know  that\r\n\r\nthe  lower income groups are covered by the GST package  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  would  not be worse off.  So who  are  worse  off\r\n\r\nunder  this regime?  Some groups must be, because  they  must\r\n\r\nbear  the  increase  in  GST over the reduction  of  personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax  so  that the Government could  have  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, Sir, the concern expressed by many MPs\r\n\r\nregarding   the  lower  income  group  might  be  overstated.\r\n\r\nPerhaps those groups that truly feel the burden of GST in the\r\n\r\nnext  five years should be identified, and this group feeling\r\n\r\nthe  squeeze could be the middle income group.  I do not have\r\n\r\nthe  data  to  determine what is this  middle  income  group.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister would be kind enough to  identify  the\r\n\r\nincome bracket where the net GST increase is greater than the\r\n\r\nreduction  in  personal income tax.  This  group  will  truly\r\n\r\nexperience  an  increase  in  tax  burden.   This  group   of\r\n\r\ntaxpayers will feel it sooner or later, so we might  as  well\r\n\r\nbe as transparent as possible in identifying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the tax changes in this Budget could\r\n\r\nonly be part of a strategy to remake Singapore.  Judging from\r\n\r\nthe  ongoing  work of the Remaking Singapore  Committee,  one\r\n\r\nwould  expect  more is yet to come.  We look forward  to  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations    that    will   bring    about    long-term\r\n\r\ntransformation for a better Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to begin with a businessman who flies  in\r\n\r\nfrom  Hong Kong to Singapore for his company's board meeting,\r\n\r\nhopefully  on  Singapore Airlines.  His plane  gets  a  slot,\r\n\r\ntouches  down  as  scheduled, and he  enjoys  air-conditioned\r\n\r\ncomfort  right  from the aerobridge.  He  has  no  hand-carry\r\n\r\nbaggage,  so  he whizzes through immigration and  customs  at\r\n\r\nChangi International Airport Terminal 2, and breezes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the  CBD  in a limousine, all in a record  time  of  35\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may ask: is this good enough? Perhaps, not\r\n\r\nquite  enough  from our perspective, if we  are  thinking  of\r\n\r\nbeing  excellent, being number one.  Since  traffic  flow  is\r\n\r\nhard  to  control, we focus on reducing the time required  to\r\n\r\nclear him at Changi Airport.  We study the challenge and then\r\n\r\ndecide that in order for the time to be reduced by, say, five\r\n\r\nminutes,  the  plane must always be served by  an  aerobridge\r\n\r\nwhenever  it  arrives.  To ensure this, we must  have  enough\r\n\r\naerobridges  and  other airport terminal services.   We  then\r\n\r\naggregate  all  such demands and conclude  that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease  capacity because in the words of the Civil Aviation\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore, \"our philosophy is providing capacity\r\n\r\nahead of time\".  Sir, what about the passenger's perspective?\r\n\r\nHe may not even notice the five minutes' improvement or, even\r\n\r\nif  he  did, it may not matter to him at all.  After all,  in\r\n\r\nthe other major cities, he takes a good 60 minutes at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of course oversimplifying the situation here\r\n\r\nand  may  have  even been unfair to the very well-run  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.  I do understand that we are building Terminal 3  at\r\n\r\na cost of $1.54 billion to handle the new generation of large\r\n\r\naircraft.  But my point here is: how do we guard against  the\r\n\r\ndanger of over investing in infrastructure and in hardware?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country, foresight and forward planning have served\r\n\r\nus  very,  very well, and I am not for one moment  suggesting\r\n\r\nthat we live our lives right on the edge.  But, Sir, there is\r\n\r\na  fine line between allowing some bursting at the seams,  to\r\n\r\ninduce productivity improvements, and over-providing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I understand, the new Terminal 3 can handle\r\n\r\nanother 20 million passengers while Terminal 1 and Terminal 2\r\n\r\ncurrently handle an aggregate of 28.6 million passengers.  It\r\n\r\ncould  therefore  take a while before we  fill  up.   In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, there will be gross under-utilisation.  That is not\r\n\r\nall.   There  is  a real massive cost to be depreciated,  and\r\n\r\nthis will find its way into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economics  of landing charges, ground and other  related\r\n\r\nservices, thereby affecting our cost competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the expenditure relating to the\r\n\r\nschools  development  programme  and  to  the  buildings  for\r\n\r\nMinistries, their agencies and statutory boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our schools are generally already of a very high\r\n\r\nstandard,  and  I  wonder how we can guard against  the  over\r\n\r\nbuilding of features and facilities.  Every school strives to\r\n\r\nhave  the  full  works, but is the expense really  justified,\r\n\r\nrelative  to  the benefits and utilisation?  Until  recently,\r\n\r\nbecause schools have fought so hard for such features, raised\r\n\r\nfunds  for  them, they have guarded them very jealously,  and\r\n\r\nsharing  with, say, the community is rare, if at  all.   Many\r\n\r\nforeign  visitors to our schools have nothing but praise  for\r\n\r\nthe  modern and extremely high-tech facilities that we  have.\r\n\r\nBut  they  themselves have produced excellent  students  from\r\n\r\ntheir  own older premises.  So when will it be sufficient  or\r\n\r\ndo  we  always  have to be top-notch in hardware?   Excellent\r\n\r\nhardware can sometimes be value-destroying.  We seem to focus\r\n\r\nmore  on the hardware than software.  How about spending more\r\n\r\nfor,  say, administrative support or teacher counselling than\r\n\r\non a theatrette?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to another illustration, that of\r\n\r\nGovernment buildings, which my honourable colleague,  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nSoo Khoon, has so eloquently spoken on a while ago.  It would\r\n\r\nappear that it is not only local businessmen who love to have\r\n\r\ntheir  own  piece of real estate and their very own building.\r\n\r\nOver  the past decade, virtually every Ministry and statutory\r\n\r\nboard  has  constructed its own building, and some  on  prime\r\n\r\nland, no less.  It is not quite clear to the public why  this\r\n\r\nis  necessary.   Ownership of buildings and land,  accounting\r\n\r\nissues  aside,  is very capital-intensive, and  can  distract\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies from pursuing their  primary  objectives\r\n\r\nand roles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue goes really beyond the size of the\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure to one of balancing the Budget.  Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans accept that in order to have jobs,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  need  to have a conducive business environment  and  that\r\n\r\nreducing  corporate and income taxes was  a  necessary  step.\r\n\r\nThey  also  accept  that this could mean a revenue  shortfall\r\n\r\nunless economic activity and, therefore tax collections  pick\r\n\r\nup  and  compensate for the rate reduction, such as  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen  previously.  As many of my honourable  colleagues\r\n\r\nhave  raised  in  this  debate,  the  attendant  question  is\r\n\r\ntherefore one of the quality of the Budget estimates  or  the\r\n\r\npossibility   of   reducing  Government   expenditure,   both\r\n\r\noperating and development, against having to raise  the  GST.\r\n\r\nI  shall not belabour the point as many of my colleagues have\r\n\r\nalready  spoken on the concerns over the increase in the  GST\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the public can be convinced that Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is well justified and that raising GST  revenues\r\n\r\nwas  inevitable, then the transition will be  acceptable  and\r\n\r\nthe offset package appreciated in its entirety.  If, however,\r\n\r\nthe  public  sees  what  it  considers  to  be  excesses   in\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  building  or in  Government  expenditure  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  then the GST increase will be resisted.   I  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  like  the  Minister  to  explain  the  underlying\r\n\r\nprinciples  for undertaking massive infrastructural  projects\r\n\r\nand the accountability thereafter.  I would also like to urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to, firstly, review anew and scrutinise all real\r\n\r\nestate  propositions  by  Ministries  and  statutory  boards;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  urge  all Ministries to be especially  mindful  of\r\n\r\nsuch  expenditure; and, thirdly, to educate the public  fully\r\n\r\non the merits of such infrastructural projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding the need to explain the balancing\r\n\r\nof  the fiscal Budget, I agree with the underlying intent  of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  which, I believe, will help put Singapore  on  a\r\n\r\nfirmer path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon is a good friend of mine.

The point we should consider is  not  how\r\n\r\nmuch surpluses we generate but whether at the end of the  day\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  lives have improved.  And this  is  what  this\r\n\r\nBudget and the GRC work are all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to commend the Deputy Prime Minister on a\r\n\r\nvery  good  Budget  in Singapore in what is very  challenging\r\n\r\ntimes.   The  restructuring of our fiscal system to  make  us\r\n\r\nnationally  more  competitive is critical  to  our  long-term\r\n\r\neconomic   survival,   as  we  face   new   challenges   from\r\n\r\nglobalisation and from newly developing countries like China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to propose four points for the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider and, if he thinks fit, take  them  into\r\n\r\naccount in the final Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the market size in Singapore is limited. To\r\n\r\nsurvive  globalisation, companies must expand regionally  and\r\n\r\ninternationally.    In   fact,  the   Government   has   been\r\n\r\nencouraging  them  to do so.  However, when  these  companies\r\n\r\nmake  losses  in  their overseas investments,  they  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to offset these losses from their taxable profits  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  To be fair to these companies that heed the  call\r\n\r\nby our Government, the group tax offset for loss making local\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  should  also  apply to  overseas  subsidiaries.\r\n\r\nThis  will provide additional incentive for our companies  to\r\n\r\nrisk their dream abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent abuses, certain limits could be\r\n\r\nplaced.   Perhaps a registration system could be  implemented\r\n\r\nand administered by a Government agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to touch on is on the single\r\n\r\ntier  system for company taxation.  The reduction of  company\r\n\r\ntaxes  to  22%,  with an eventual target  of  20%,  has  been\r\n\r\ncoupled with a single tier system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  company  taxation.  This will result in  the  individual\r\n\r\ninvestor paying more taxes on the dividends he receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirees who have saved their money in the form of\r\n\r\nshare investments pay little or no tax.  It is this group  of\r\n\r\npeople who are the hardest hit by this measure and they are a\r\n\r\ngroup of people who can ill afford the additional burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the economy matures, growth rates of companies\r\n\r\nwill be slow, and a greater proportion of their profits would\r\n\r\nbe  returned  to  the investor as dividends.   An  investment\r\n\r\nstrategy  based  on yield now becomes increasingly  plausible\r\n\r\ncompared to a growth strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the professional fund managers and corporate\r\n\r\ninvestors, there are many individuals who invest long term to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  a retirement fund.  The Special Retirement  Scheme\r\n\r\n(SRS)  has  recently  been introduced by  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nencourage this group of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividend payout and the taxation it attracts affects\r\n\r\nthe  motivation  of these long-term individual  shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe Government should not put them at a disadvantage compared\r\n\r\nto the pre-Budget situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment holding companies which make losses at the\r\n\r\ncompany level also suffer from the single tier proposal.  Due\r\n\r\nto  their nature, investment holding companies' only  revenue\r\n\r\nsource  is from the dividends paid by their subsidiaries  and\r\n\r\nassociate companies.  Since no tax credit can be claimed from\r\n\r\nthe  subsidiary's dividend, they cannot offset their  running\r\n\r\ncost against their subsidiary's income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the DPM to reconsider the move to a single tier\r\n\r\nscheme  for company taxation.  The old scheme of franked  tax\r\n\r\ncredits  for  dividend paid has served us well and  could  be\r\n\r\nretained or dividends can be paid untaxed, ie, companies need\r\n\r\nnot  pay tax on the portion of profits paid out as dividends.\r\n\r\nIn  the  latter  scheme, individual taxpayers must  then  pay\r\n\r\ntaxes on the dividend earned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are in the age of computers, there should not\r\n\r\nbe  much  difficulty  in administering  either  scheme.   All\r\n\r\nlisted companies are already reporting to the tax authorities\r\n\r\nthe  list  of  shareholders and their  dividend  distribution\r\n\r\namounts via CDP computers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I want to touch on is on taxation of\r\n\r\nbank  interest.   Interest paid on  deposits  is  a  form  of\r\n\r\ncompensation for the opportunity cost of using the money  and\r\n\r\ninflation.   Many  individuals in Singapore,  especially  the\r\n\r\nmore  risk averse, save their money in savings, deposits  and\r\n\r\nfixed  deposit  accounts.   Like the  long-term  investors  I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, they are saving for their retirement.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment ought to encourage this activity by not taxing the\r\n\r\nfruits of such savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the Government to bring forward the plan to\r\n\r\nwaive  taxation on interest as recommended by  the  ERC  sub-committee.   I  am  speaking especially for  the  man-in-the-street, who should not be penalised for saving his money in a\r\n\r\ndeposit account by having his interest taxed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I want to make is on CPF review. It\r\n\r\nhas  been  noted  by Mr Lim Boon Heng that our  older,  lower\r\n\r\nincome  workers  would  face increasing  uncertainty  as  our\r\n\r\neconomy transforms. The world is entering into a new economic\r\n\r\nera and the impending restructuring of our economy cannot  be\r\n\r\navoided.   However,  we must remember our  workers  from  the\r\n\r\nprevious  generation who have made Singapore the success  she\r\n\r\nis today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already done much for the lower-income group, through the various rebates, asset enhancement\r\n\r\nschemes  and  the  New Singapore Shares, etc.   It  helps  to\r\n\r\nnarrow the disparity between our high income earners and  the\r\n\r\nless  fortunate.  Mr Lim also mentioned, and  I  agree,  that\r\n\r\nworkers  over 40 would find it difficult to find a  new  job.\r\n\r\nThis  could be either because their skill set is now less  in\r\n\r\ndemand  due  to  economic  and industrial  restructuring,  or\r\n\r\nbecause employers simply prefer to employ younger workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  floated  the  idea of lowering  the  CPF  for  these\r\n\r\nworkers,  ie, those over 40 to make them more competitive  in\r\n\r\nthe job market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree that lowering the\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF contribution for older workers would  enhance\r\n\r\nthe employment opportunities of these workers.  However, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think that we should lower the total monthly CPF savings\r\n\r\nof  these workers.  Lowering the CPF rates is not without its\r\n\r\nassociated  problems.   Firstly, it  effectively  lowers  the\r\n\r\nworker's actual income although his take-home pay may  remain\r\n\r\nthe  same.  This may lead to a second problem of having  less\r\n\r\nor  insufficient  funds  for  his retirement  and  healthcare\r\n\r\nneeds.   Workers  with existing housing loan  commitment  may\r\n\r\nalso be adversely affected by a lower CPF saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose an alternative. My alternative\r\n\r\nis for the Government to subsidise or pay for part of the CPF\r\n\r\nfor  older  workers below certain income levels to help  them\r\n\r\nremain  employed.  This is a better way to help  lower-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, compared to our previous schemes of CPF top-up.\r\n\r\nIt  not  only provides sufficient incentive for employers  to\r\n\r\nconsider  hiring older workers, it also sends a clear  signal\r\n\r\nto  them  that  older workers ought to be  considered  on  an\r\n\r\nequal, if not favourable footing because of their experience,\r\n\r\nwhen  deciding  on suitable persons for job vacancies.   Most\r\n\r\nimportantly, this is a meaningful and effective programme  to\r\n\r\nensure   our  social  stability  and  cohesion  as  we   face\r\n\r\nglobalisation  head  on  and the spectre  of  greater  income\r\n\r\ndisparity.  I am sure the ERC can work out the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope DPM could respond to these suggestions. On\r\n\r\nthat note, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This\r\n\r\nyear's Budget has shifted Singapore further into the path  of\r\n\r\nindirect  taxes.   This is a very important  and  wise  move.\r\n\r\nOver  time, it should bring a lot of good, especially in  our\r\n\r\neffort to be a more competitive business hub as well as to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretain  and attract talent and to generate investment and  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more  jobs for our citizens, in the hope  that  these\r\n\r\njobs would be better and bring higher wages for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nDirectly and indirectly, the reduced tax rates that had  been\r\n\r\nannounced  would result in a saving of $900  million  to  our\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  in  our  country.  I hope  over  the  years,  such\r\n\r\nsavings  would be put to good use, especially in the form  of\r\n\r\nmore investments by companies and individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new GST rate of 5% as announced is still among the\r\n\r\nlowest in the world although we agree that it could have some\r\n\r\nimpact on the prices of goods.  However, I believe the effect\r\n\r\nwill  not be too difficult for us to cope with.  We need  not\r\n\r\nbe  overly concerned about the effects on Singaporeans. I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  rebates announced should take  care  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who need help.  It is very important for us to look at\r\n\r\nthe  issues that we are facing now and these issues  are  not\r\n\r\nwhether  the  GST  should be at 3% or 5%.  But  to  encourage\r\n\r\ninvestments  and increase job opportunities,  and  should  we\r\n\r\nfail  in  this  area,  we would be facing  a  bigger  problem\r\n\r\nbecause  without  jobs, without income  that  is  stable  and\r\n\r\npermanent, even if we do not impose a GST, Singaporeans would\r\n\r\nbe facing a big problem to survive, so the actual issue is to\r\n\r\nincrease job opportunities for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  assess the impact for us to help workers and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  general from the income that they receive.  Firstly,  how\r\n\r\ncan  we  help them to increase their savings and investments.\r\n\r\nUsually  a  person with income, his money would be  spent  on\r\n\r\nthree  areas:  first, expenses; second, savings  and  perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  on  investments.  Every individual should make his  own\r\n\r\ndecision  as to how and how much they should spend,  save  or\r\n\r\ninvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to suggest that our tax\r\n\r\nsystem  be  structured to encourage more people to work  hard\r\n\r\nand  save  and also to invest some of their earnings  and  we\r\n\r\nshould make this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvantageous  and  profitable  for  our  workers.   This   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  because  generally many  people  feel  that  their\r\n\r\npurchasing value will be levelled out by inflation,  ie,  the\r\n\r\npurchasing  value of cash would be eroded over time.   So  in\r\n\r\nthis  way  we  should give them a strong enough incentive  to\r\n\r\nfeel that saving and investing is a wise move.  Otherwise, it\r\n\r\nis  possible that many would end up with the idea that it  is\r\n\r\nbetter to spend all now and worry about all else later.  This\r\n\r\nis  not  a good situation for Singaporeans.  As all forms  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure would involve GST, I wonder whether a person will\r\n\r\nget more benefit if he works hard to increase his savings and\r\n\r\ninvestments.   At  present, I think,  based  on  our  present\r\n\r\ntaxation  system,  the answer is \"Yes\"  and  \"No\".   I  would\r\n\r\nexplain why.  One example is that should a person save  every\r\n\r\nsource  of his income in a bank, the money escapes  the  GST,\r\n\r\nbut the saver would have to pay a bank charge.  The bank will\r\n\r\npay an interest on the savings.  However, at present, we find\r\n\r\nthat  the  interest given by the banks in the form  of  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposits or ordinary savings is still taxable.  The amount of\r\n\r\ntax  would  depend on the individual's tax bracket.   If  the\r\n\r\nperson  belongs to a tax bracket of higher than  the  5%  GST\r\n\r\nrate,  the  interest earned would be taxed at a higher  rate.\r\n\r\nThe  question is whether our taxation system is strong enough\r\n\r\nto  attract Singaporeans to save.  For the present,  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  the interest paid by the banks is very low.  It is  not\r\n\r\nattractive.  Secondly, for a person who pays tax at the  rate\r\n\r\nof  10%,  I think the effect on his savings will not be  much\r\n\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, should he spend the interest from his\r\n\r\nsavings  in the future, it will still be subject to GST.   So\r\n\r\nwill the Minister consider enabling all forms of earnings  to\r\n\r\nbe  exempted from tax because finally if the money  is  spent\r\n\r\nlater, it would still include a portion for the GST?  I think\r\n\r\nthe same should be considered for personal investments.  Like\r\n\r\nall   investments,  there  are  risks  involved.    Not   all\r\n\r\ninvestments can bring in profit and since the Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  encouraged the people to invest in shares, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  whether  GST  should be  charged  for  the  services\r\n\r\nprovided to purchase shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not extending this argument to\r\n\r\nother  forms of investments but only for investment of shares\r\n\r\nin  listed  companies in Singapore because  for  most  people\r\n\r\ninvestment  in shares of well-run companies may be  the  best\r\n\r\nway  for them in using some of their savings for investments.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  process, I think, is still a learning process  for\r\n\r\nmost  Singaporeans.   I also feel that  finally,  when  their\r\n\r\ninvestments are profitable, and Singaporeans who keep some of\r\n\r\ntheir  earnings can still contribute by way of GST when  they\r\n\r\nspend the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to refer to the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Minister for Finance when he said  that  the\r\n\r\nBudget  this  year  is  for  a world  that  has  changed  and\r\n\r\nconsidering  that the world has changed and  it  has  brought\r\n\r\nuncertainties,  we as a nation will have  to  take  steps  to\r\n\r\nadjust  to  it.   I am sure that his words are relevant,  not\r\n\r\nonly  for the Budget but also for all Singaporeans.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  make a fundamental shift in the way we see and do  things\r\n\r\nso that together, we could help in the remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor  workers in particular, there is a need for us to respond\r\n\r\nto  the challenge to upgrade our skills, adjust ourselves and\r\n\r\nwe  should do this seriously so that we can continue to  make\r\n\r\nourselves  relevant  with the changing job  profiles  in  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace.    Our  investors  should  also  stabilise   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen their position.  Looking at the region, we  should\r\n\r\nall  work  hard and grow the Asian economy that is developing\r\n\r\nand will continue to develop in the years to come.  I am sure\r\n\r\nif  all  of  us  play our role, we can change  the  world  at\r\n\r\npresent now into a world where we can all be comfortable  and\r\n\r\nimprove our lives as individuals and as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nfeeling of gloom and doom by many Singaporeans following  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Address by our President at the Opening of Parliament\r\n\r\nis  to  some extent mitigated by the assurance of growth  and\r\n\r\nemployment that our Deputy Prime Minister gave on the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement which I rise in support of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is constructed on the basis that we would\r\n\r\nrestructure  the economy of Singapore in order  that  we  may\r\n\r\nstay  competitive  and in the process  help  to  bring  about\r\n\r\nsustainable  growth  and  employment  in  the  longer   term.\r\n\r\nTowards  this end, we have what many would consider to  be  a\r\n\r\npro-business   Budget  that  sets  about   introducing   many\r\n\r\nincentives  to induce businesses and even talents  here;  the\r\n\r\nkey  instrument  in  this statement being  the  reduction  of\r\n\r\ncorporate  and  personal income taxes.  To  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is  sustainable in the long run, the Budget  had  to\r\n\r\nbalance and we achieve this by raising indirect taxes in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  five  percentage points for the GST  amongst  other\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In marginally shifting the centre of gravity from direct\r\n\r\nto  indirect taxation, we are once again faced with the  age-old  issue  of taxation and distributive justice in  society.\r\n\r\nAt  the risk of over-simplifying matters, the question is: do\r\n\r\nwe  or should we continue to tax the rich highly, so that the\r\n\r\nbenefits  can be enjoyed more by the poor, or do we make  the\r\n\r\npoor  pay  more indirectly, since many do not pay  taxes,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can encourage the rich to remain or even come to  us\r\n\r\nto help us grow the economy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of the increase of the GST rate\r\n\r\nfrom 3% to 5%, there has been an understandable concern among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans about coping with the rising cost of living.  As\r\n\r\nit  is,  even before the announcement of the increase in  the\r\n\r\nGST, there have been constant complaints and grumbling on the\r\n\r\nground  about  the rising cost of living in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nannouncement of the increase therefore could not have, in the\r\n\r\nminds  of many, come at a worse time, when many Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  the middle aged and unemployed Singaporeans,  are\r\n\r\nin  a predicament because of the recessionary climate of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these concerns, a comprehensive relief and\r\n\r\noffset  package was announced at the same time.  The  package\r\n\r\nof GST offsets and reliefs are intended to help those who are\r\n\r\nin the lower income bands, and the announcements provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  comfort  and cheer to many Singaporeans.   The  reliefs\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding, there are however some issues  and  concerns\r\n\r\nthat  have  since  surfaced.  Sir, if  I  may,  I  will  just\r\n\r\nelaborate on some of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, GST offsets and relief packages together with\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring  shares  are  temporary,  while   the\r\n\r\nincreases in GST are permanent.  Our Government has given the\r\n\r\nassurance that the present round of assistance should  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  those in the lower income group would not be worse  off\r\n\r\nthan  before  the  increase.  While this is  reassuring,  the\r\n\r\npeople  would  like to know whether the Government  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  continue  giving similar assistance  after  the\r\n\r\ninitial five-year period is over and there are no signs of  a\r\n\r\nlong term recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this relates to the earlier point and\r\n\r\nechoes the sentiments of many of my colleagues in this House,\r\n\r\nthe  Government had previously given utility rebates to lower\r\n\r\nincome households to help defray the likely increases in  the\r\n\r\ncost of living when the GST was first introduced.  Why cannot\r\n\r\nthe  Government now introduce a similar rebate since for many\r\n\r\nof  the  lower  income  households,  utilities  constitute  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial part of the household expenditure?  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  utilities  are a precious resource  in  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\ngiving  utilities rebates may send the wrong signals  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  on consumption habits.  While I can understand  where\r\n\r\nthe  concern is coming from, I wonder whether this  suspicion\r\n\r\nor concern was borne out the last time when such rebates were\r\n\r\ngiven.   In  other words, did the Government  look  into  the\r\n\r\nconsumption pattern when such rebates were given?  My view is\r\n\r\nthat  rebates of this nature provide relief and I doubt  very\r\n\r\nmuch  if  the  majority  of households would  consciously  or\r\n\r\nunconsciously  increase spending on utilities simply  because\r\n\r\nof  the rebates.  On the other hand, for the majority of  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  households, such rebates  and  relief  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be a welcome assistance indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government has also given the assurance\r\n\r\nthat  increases in the GST would result in business operators\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage by profiteering.  In this  regard,  we  are\r\n\r\ntold that a Committee has been set up under the leadership of\r\n\r\nmy  honourable  colleague to deal with such  problems.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are some reservations to this approach.  To begin with,\r\n\r\nthe  Committee lacks teeth in the sense that it has no  power\r\n\r\nto  bring  those guilty of profiteering to court  and  charge\r\n\r\nthem  with such excesses.  All that the Committee can do  for\r\n\r\nnow  is  to work with the merchants to persuade them  not  to\r\n\r\ntake  advantage.  This approach is what others would consider\r\n\r\nas  moral suasion.  In the worst-case scenario, the Committee\r\n\r\nmay  just  shame the profiteers publicly through  the  media.\r\n\r\nWhile  this  may  work  in the case of blatant  and  outright\r\n\r\nshameless  overpricing, it would be difficult to  monitor  in\r\n\r\nsituations  where price increases have been  incremental  and\r\n\r\nprogressive  over a period of time.  How will  the  Committee\r\n\r\ndeal with such a situation?  It may be better perhaps if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could consider providing enabling legislation  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  Committee  the ability to  deal  with  profiteers\r\n\r\nduring this period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, many Singaporeans do not understand why it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the Government, on the one hand, to  give  out\r\n\r\nSingapore  Shares  and, on the other  hand,  take  back  such\r\n\r\nhandouts  through  increases in  the  GST.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially those whose annual  property  value\r\n\r\nexceeds  $10,000 who feel that they do not need  such  shares\r\n\r\nand  it  may  be  better if such resources are channelled  to\r\n\r\nthose Singaporeans who are in need of assistance during  this\r\n\r\nperiod.  This can take the form of a gradual increase in  GST\r\n\r\nor  that a fund can be set up to be given to the really  poor\r\n\r\nthrough  the  grassroots organisations like the CCCs  or  the\r\n\r\nCDCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the concerns over the GST, there are many\r\n\r\nwho  feel  that  more should be done for the SMEs  and  these\r\n\r\nsentiments  have  been reflected early in  this  House.   The\r\n\r\nreduction in income tax and the provision of group relief may\r\n\r\ngive businesses much encouragement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  incentive.   However, there is  some  disappointment  as\r\n\r\nnothing  was  specifically targeted at the  SMEs.   To  begin\r\n\r\nwith,  there are many SMEs who are not GST registered.   Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  know  that the operating principle of GST is to pass  tax\r\n\r\ndown  the value chain so that the goods and services  do  not\r\n\r\ntechnically  end  up  having  a compounded  payment  of  GST.\r\n\r\nHowever,  with  the increases in GST and in  the  climate  of\r\n\r\nextreme competition, the manufacturer or the service provider\r\n\r\nmay well absorb increases in GST.  If the party concerned  is\r\n\r\nprofitable, the reduction in income tax payment could well be\r\n\r\noffset, or used to offset the absorption.  On the other hand,\r\n\r\nif  the  business of the manufacturer or the service provider\r\n\r\nis poor, the increases in GST may well add to his woes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we accept and recognise that SMEs play a pivotal\r\n\r\nrole   in   reshaping  our  economy.   SMEs  are  essentially\r\n\r\nhomegrown  industries and are largely owned by  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nWhile  we  would in the longer term have to rely on the  GLCs\r\n\r\nwith their resources to provide the charge in creating world-class companies, that charge alone would not be sufficient if\r\n\r\nit  were not supported by the SMEs.  Indeed, many of the SMEs\r\n\r\nhave the potential to become world leaders in their own field\r\n\r\nif  only  they  were properly funded and supported.   And  it\r\n\r\nwould  not be asking too much of the Government at this  time\r\n\r\nto  constantly  remember them when looking  at  the  slew  of\r\n\r\nincentives  to improve the business environment here;  and  I\r\n\r\nwould say that we should constantly be looking at finding out\r\n\r\nwho  the  promising SMEs are that we can nurture into  world-class companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans have asked whether by going along\r\n\r\nwith the increase in the GST, there is any assurance that the\r\n\r\neconomy will turn around.  I started my speech by saying that\r\n\r\nthis  Budget serves to mitigate the climate of doom and gloom\r\n\r\nthat  has brought about a climate of pessimism all round.   I\r\n\r\nmust  reiterate  that I am confident that it will.   However,\r\n\r\nmuch has to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the earlier debate on the Presidential Address,\r\n\r\nI had advocated a central\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntenet  that we should continue to use our reserves to explore\r\n\r\nacquisitions in world class companies or companies with world\r\n\r\nclass potential and then leverage on these companies to  help\r\n\r\nbring  our people up to speed on the demands of international\r\n\r\nbusiness.  With a successful external economy, we could  then\r\n\r\nafford to have a little slack or inefficiency in our domestic\r\n\r\neconomy in order to keep our people employed.  We are a  very\r\n\r\nsmall  economy  and  for us to compete effectively,  we  must\r\n\r\nlearn to think of the world as our hunting ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, while there is some measure of hollowing out, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think that there will be a complete hollowing out of our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industries.   It  has  often  been  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is a country that runs like a well-oiled machinery.\r\n\r\nEverything  here  works.   And  this  will  surely   be   our\r\n\r\nadvantage.  I have often said that while Singapore  may  lack\r\n\r\nthe  critical mass to produce world-class talents,  but  when\r\n\r\nyou  take  everything in its totality, Singapore can  present\r\n\r\nquite a formidable challenge even to China.  Yes, we may  not\r\n\r\nhave  the most brilliant surgeon compared to China.  However,\r\n\r\nI  know that if a Singapore surgeon operates on me, the blood\r\n\r\nthat  the  hospital here supplies me is safe,  the  operating\r\n\r\ntheatre  is  clinical and I will not get secondary infections\r\n\r\nin  the  process.  I also know that the intensive  care  unit\r\n\r\nwill be well run and their staff will be competent.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  it is not the surgeon's skill alone that will  ensure\r\n\r\nmy  survival,  but  rather the entire system  that  works  to\r\n\r\nsupport  him.   I am sure that many foreigners see  this  and\r\n\r\nshare the confidence that we have in our system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, while China is powering ahead with its economic\r\n\r\nboom,  there  are  on-going reports of its systemic  weakness\r\n\r\nthat  may  well  in  the long run hinder  its  growth.   Much\r\n\r\nconcern  has been raised about the weakness of its  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, the state-owned enterprises, and the extent  of\r\n\r\ncorruption within the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to continue to find new niches that enable\r\n\r\nus  to  take  our  place in the world economy.   Our  present\r\n\r\nstrategy is right.  While industries may continue to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhollow  out, there will be other industries that will replace\r\n\r\nit.  New activities such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, wafer\r\n\r\nfabs and high-end electronic manufacturing should continue to\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to  move  here.  There  will  be  some  pains\r\n\r\ninitially  in  the  process as we move higher  up  the  value\r\n\r\nchain; however, this is a necessary step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is unfortunate that our service sector has been\r\n\r\ndealt a major blow with the departure of two large customers,\r\n\r\nwe  should not lose heart, as we firmly believe that with new\r\n\r\npricing and other strategies, we will be able to compete even\r\n\r\nmore  effectively.   Indeed, the recent liberalisation  moves\r\n\r\nhave  sparked off growth in several service industries.  Many\r\n\r\nsegments of financial services, telecommunications and  media\r\n\r\nhave  picked up as a result.  I am certain that the new moves\r\n\r\nto reduce income taxes will continue to make us attractive to\r\n\r\nforeign investment capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, will we survive in the\r\n\r\nmiddle  term?   I am under no illusion that we will  have  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  surviving  for the next  five  years.   In  fact,\r\n\r\ngenerating  annual growth rates of between 2% and  3%  should\r\n\r\nnot  be a problem for us.  For the longer term, I believe  we\r\n\r\nshould have a new social compact with our people; we need  to\r\n\r\nget everyone to pull the gravy train in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for  giving me this opportunity to  join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance's\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement, he painted the scenario  of  a  harsh  and\r\n\r\nturbulent world that Singapore is in now.  I would not  dwell\r\n\r\non  the fiscal measures of the Budget but would like to  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to review its impact on the human and  social\r\n\r\ncapital.   I  would address three concerns of the Budget  and\r\n\r\nhighlight one observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are in the 40s, we are the baby boomers of\r\n\r\nthe 50s.  This is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsignificant  age mentioned in the recent debate  on  the  CPF\r\n\r\nrates.  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight to\r\n\r\nthe Economic Review Sub-committee, tasked to make a review of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  rates, to take into consideration that at this  age\r\n\r\ngroup of 40, we have the old and the young with us [you  lao,\r\n\r\nyou  shao].  Our expenses are the heaviest at this age group.\r\n\r\nMost  of  us  were married in our late 20s, and at  40s,  our\r\n\r\nchildren are only either in the teens or in the tertiary  age\r\n\r\ngroup, and we still need to support our active parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern. With the description of the turbulent\r\n\r\ntimes,  harsh  volatile  economy,  fierce  competition,  fast\r\n\r\nchanges and disruption, not only the working adults, but  the\r\n\r\nwhole  family, are subject to this stress and strain in  this\r\n\r\nkind  of  environment.  While the Government is steering  and\r\n\r\nurging  the  people to prepare and adapt to change,  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget I would like to urge the Ministries to be bold in  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  support services to our people  at  the  local\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1990s, we have seen many Ministries becoming\r\n\r\nvery   specialised  in  the  provision  of  various   support\r\n\r\nfacilities at the local community, together with the  various\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare  organisations.  We have  social  services\r\n\r\nprovided  by  the CDCs and various VWOs, through  the  Family\r\n\r\nService  Centres (FSCs), the Senior Activity  Centres  (SACs)\r\n\r\nand  now,  I  understand, that there are  the  Neighbourhood-linked  Centres.   I  just  realise the  existence  of  these\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood-linked Centres when I wanted to set up a Senior\r\n\r\nActivity  Centre.  Very confusing indeed!   This  is  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  happened at the local community level.  When one family\r\n\r\nis  in  need  of  help,  whether it  is  a  child  who  needs\r\n\r\ncounselling  or  getting home-based  services  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nhandicapped  or the sick regularly for medical  services,  or\r\n\r\nseeking for financial assistance and advice, the family  must\r\n\r\nknow which \"C\", or centre, to go for assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am urging the Government to consider and allocate\r\n\r\nadditional  resources  for  an  integrated  centre  for   the\r\n\r\nprovision of social and community services to our families at\r\n\r\nthe local community.  There is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed for a one-stop service centre for families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern. Many of my colleagues have spoken on\r\n\r\nthis  issue  of unemployment and job-matching services.   The\r\n\r\nrate of successful job-matching is dismally low for the above-40s,  as  highlighted by Dr Lee yesterday.  It  is  half  the\r\n\r\nsuccess rate of that of the younger unemployed, which  is  at\r\n\r\n8%.   I  urge a budget be allocated not just for simple  job-matching  services but bold and innovative measures for  job-matching  agencies,  such  as NTUC,  MOM,  CDCs,  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncollaborative  joint  effort  with  employers'  associations,\r\n\r\nunions  and career development and training professionals  to\r\n\r\nhelp  chart  the  career  path for  targeted  groups  of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed.   This is to enable them to acquire the  required\r\n\r\nskill sets that will make them employable.  This is similarly\r\n\r\ndone  by  most forward-looking companies for their employees,\r\n\r\nso  as  to  make  them more efficient and able  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemands of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the meet-the-people sessions and house-to-house\r\n\r\nvisits, we could identify two main unemployed groups of above\r\n\r\n40s  -  the  professionals and executives as one  group,  and\r\n\r\nwomen  who are formerly working in the factories as the other\r\n\r\ngroup.   The  GST  package would not be able  to  help  these\r\n\r\ngroups  if they cannot find alternative employment.   With  a\r\n\r\nclear  and  identified career charted out and a  planned  and\r\n\r\nidentified programme for training for these distinct  groups,\r\n\r\neffective changes and results can then be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge for more focus on the success rate of the\r\n\r\nmatching  services rather than the front-end  application  of\r\n\r\njob-matching services by our various Government agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue. Ms Indranee has spoken of the\r\n\r\nencouragement of procreation.  The rate of 1.4 is  below  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  rate,  the lowest in history,  and  knowing  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  and impact this has on our economy  in  time  to\r\n\r\ncome, I would like to encourage and convince the third group,\r\n\r\nthat is, married couples who have the first child and decided\r\n\r\nto stop at one or two,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  have  more children.  I would like to share  my  personal\r\n\r\nexperience.  I was very concerned of two things at that  time\r\n\r\n-  commitment and expenses.  However, I was wrong.  I  really\r\n\r\nenjoyed  motherhood  with  this  third  child  that  I  have.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  have  less time with him, his  two  other  elder\r\n\r\nsiblings keep him occupied and entertained and actively  help\r\n\r\nme  to  bring up their little brother.  He is a most cheerful\r\n\r\nboy,  always smiling, and is most alert as he would disappear\r\n\r\nwhen  his elder siblings have a situation with me.  The power\r\n\r\nof  play  and  learn  among  the siblings  cannot  be  under-estimated within a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to re-broach the\r\n\r\nissue  of  encouraging more children through sibling support,\r\n\r\nas  the joy and benefits of the older children who gain  from\r\n\r\nthe experience are much more beneficial and long lasting.  As\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  Budget debate, I would like also  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  urge  for  more direct  incentives  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren,  to help families with young children  and  working\r\n\r\nmothers,  ie,  increase the amount for the second  and  third\r\n\r\nchildcare  subsidies  and  adding the before-and-after-school\r\n\r\ncare subsidy.  I too would like to support Mdm Halimah's call\r\n\r\nfor  review  of  medical benefits for the children  of  women\r\n\r\ncivil servants.  This would definitely help in the course  of\r\n\r\nbringing up the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end, I would like again to urge the Government\r\n\r\nagencies and Ministries to think out-of-the-box to review and\r\n\r\nrealign the resources to provide closer and direct assistance\r\n\r\nsupport  services to our families at the local  community  in\r\n\r\nthis period of change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I would like to propose the following measures\r\n\r\nfor the Finance Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring Shares for all Singaporeans</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many adult Singaporeans welcome the issue of the\r\n\r\nEconomic Restructuring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShares.  But some queried why the shares are issued to  adult\r\n\r\nSingaporeans only.  Babies, children and teenagers  are  also\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  GST increase.  In fact,  some  babies  are\r\n\r\nbigger  consumers  than  the  elderly.   In  line  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  push to encourage families who  can  afford  to\r\n\r\nhave more children, we should recognise and reward those with\r\n\r\ntwo or more children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, lower income families under the Small\r\n\r\nFamilies  Improvement  Scheme should  also  be  rewarded  for\r\n\r\nkeeping  their families small so that more resources  can  be\r\n\r\nchannelled to their children.  Thus, I would urge the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider issuing Economic Restructuring  shares\r\n\r\nfor  children  and teenagers.  In this way, all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  understand  that  the  economic  restructuring  process\r\n\r\ninvolves everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pre-school programme subsidy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the 7.4% increase in budget for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education.  The expenditure is mainly attributed\r\n\r\nto   general  education,  university,  polytechnic,  and  ITE\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  But there is no support for pre-school education\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The Government has always considered  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  as the private sector's responsibility,  and  thus\r\n\r\nhas not provided much guidance and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in recent years, feedback from many primary\r\n\r\nschools   has   highlighted  that  the   different   teaching\r\n\r\napproaches and standards of private pre-school operators have\r\n\r\nproduced  pupils  with  differing standards  of  reading  and\r\n\r\nwriting  skills.  This has posed difficulty and affected  the\r\n\r\npace of teaching in primary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of pre-school education in preparing\r\n\r\nour  children  for  primary  school  education  must  not  be\r\n\r\noverlooked.   While  the  Government  provides  subsidy   for\r\n\r\nchildcare and formal education, there is no subsidy for  pre-school programmes.  As education has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways  been a priority for our Government, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister to consider providing pre-school fee subsidy\r\n\r\nto  pre-school  pupils.   Presently,  pre-school  pupils  pay\r\n\r\nbetween  $25 and $800 per month for their school fees.   This\r\n\r\nposes  much  financial burden, especially for the middle  and\r\n\r\nlower-income families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nproviding  subsidy  on  a  per capita  basis  for  pre-school\r\n\r\noperators.   This will facilitate the recruitment  of  better\r\n\r\nquality  pre-school teachers and the acquisition of essential\r\n\r\nresources  to  improve the standard of pre-school  education.\r\n\r\nThe Education Ministry can also play a leading role to ensure\r\n\r\nquality in pre-school education.  By working closely with pre-school operators, we will be able to provide good quality and\r\n\r\naffordable pre-school programmes for our children.  This will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  strong  foundation for children entering  primary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of GST has changed the taxation\r\n\r\nphilosophy  of  Singapore.  It is a  broad-based  consumption\r\n\r\ntax, which provides the necessary revenue for the Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should review and gradually remove other taxes,\r\n\r\nespecially real estate and asset ownership taxes.  The  asset\r\n\r\nenhancement  push  by  the  Government  has  encouraged  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be home owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property tax is part of ownership cost, especially for\r\n\r\nowner-occupied properties.  In order to continue to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  own  their homes,  I  propose  that  owner-occupied  properties  be exempted from  property  tax.   Many\r\n\r\nassociations  and non-profit organisations have  also  voiced\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns on the property tax of their premises.   Many\r\n\r\nfelt  that  the Government should show philanthropy  and  not\r\n\r\nimpose  property  tax on these non-profit and community-based\r\n\r\norganisations.  I would urge the Finance Minister to  promote\r\n\r\nphilanthropy by taking the lead in removing the property  tax\r\n\r\nfor all associations and non-profit organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Season car parking charges</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in car parking charges has raised concerns,\r\n\r\nespecially among car owners in HDB estates.  Many  felt  that\r\n\r\nseason  car parking fee is part of car ownership cost,  which\r\n\r\nHDB  car owners must pay monthly.  It is not related  to  car\r\n\r\nusage  per  se  and  thus should be differentiated  from  the\r\n\r\nURA/HDB  hourly  parking charges.  Many HDB  car  owners  are\r\n\r\ndelivery drivers or work in sales-related jobs.  The increase\r\n\r\nin  season car parking charges will pose additional burden or\r\n\r\nincrease the business cost of their companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, HDB pays town councils $4.80 per car\r\n\r\npark lot per month to maintain the car park, while collecting\r\n\r\na  monthly  season parking fee of $75 and daily  car  parking\r\n\r\ncharges for a lot.  Car parks are relatively maintenance free\r\n\r\nif  properly  constructed.  To avoid  the  situation  of  HDB\r\n\r\nhaving a deficit, HDB should build no-frills multi-storey car\r\n\r\nparks   so  as  to  reduce  the  cost  of  construction   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance.   This  will  indirectly  help  to  reduce   car\r\n\r\nownership cost in the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employment assistance scheme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite efforts by the Ministry of Manpower and the\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development   Councils,   many   retrenched   and\r\n\r\nunemployed  Singaporeans  are  still  unable  to  find  jobs.\r\n\r\nSkills,  age  and  attitude of these job  seekers  have  been\r\n\r\nidentified  as the main hurdles for them to be employed.   We\r\n\r\nneed to provide more employment assistance to help these hard-to-employ Singaporeans back to work.  One effective  approach\r\n\r\nto  upgrade workers' skills and change their mindsets  is  to\r\n\r\npromote  employer-led  initiatives under  which  the  workers\r\n\r\nlearn  key skills in their workplace.  But we must be focused\r\n\r\nand strategic in identifying future industries for this group\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans.   For example, the service  industry  is  a\r\n\r\npotential  and  attractive sector to provide  employment  and\r\n\r\nskills upgrading for these Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose a two-pronged approach to\r\n\r\nhelp these hard-to-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemploy Singaporeans to join the service industry.  First,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  attract more tourists to Singapore so as to  create\r\n\r\nmore  job  opportunities.  We must adopt  more  creative  and\r\n\r\ninnovative  strategies to expand our  tourism  industry.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  carve out new niches and have new tourism  features\r\n\r\nthat would attract repeat visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government can, in the meantime, be the\r\n\r\nsurrogate  employer  for on-the-job training  and  employment\r\n\r\nschemes   initiated   by  employers.    Many   hard-to-employ\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do not have money to enrol in training  courses\r\n\r\nand  are  not  convinced that they will get employment  after\r\n\r\nattending  these  courses.  As a result, the  present  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  traineeship schemes achieve limited  success.\r\n\r\nWe  must provide more support for employment-related training\r\n\r\nschemes where workers learn skills while in employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>HDB lift upgrading programme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $325 million has been allocated for the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  HDB precincts.  But only $43 million  will  be\r\n\r\nused  for lift upgrading.  The upgrading of lifts to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  easy  access at every floor is crucial in  view  of  our\r\n\r\nageing  population.   Besides the elderly,  the  handicapped,\r\n\r\ndisabled,  injured,  sick, bedridden and pregnant  women  are\r\n\r\nalso affected.  Many HDB flats that were built in the 80s  do\r\n\r\nnot have lifts stopping at every floor level.  If HDB were to\r\n\r\nadopt the present pace of lift upgrading, these residents may\r\n\r\nhave to wait many years before realising the benefits.  Thus,\r\n\r\nI  would  urge the Government to expedite the lift  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.08 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank all the\r\n\r\nMPs  who  have  spoken and the many who  have  supported  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's financial policy for this financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tax changes are a vital part of our economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring efforts to secure economic growth and to create\r\n\r\nnew  jobs  for Singaporeans.  I stated the rationale  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget   speech.   To  create  jobs,  we  need   to   attract\r\n\r\ninvestments  and talent to Singapore.  To attract investments\r\n\r\nand  talent,  we must bring down our taxes and, particularly,\r\n\r\nwe have to bring down our direct taxes - the corporate income\r\n\r\ntax and the personal income tax.  That is the only way we can\r\n\r\nbe  competitive in attracting companies and talent here.  But\r\n\r\nif  we  bring down our direct taxes, we are going to  have  a\r\n\r\nshortfall in revenue and to make up the shortfall in revenue,\r\n\r\nwe  have to raise the GST.  This is not a quick fix for  this\r\n\r\nyear,  or for next year, but it is a strategic shift for  the\r\n\r\nmedium and long term for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the growth this year is turning out\r\n\r\nwell.   But  that  is not the measure of  our  success.   Our\r\n\r\nmeasure  is that the economy continues to grow 4-6% per  year\r\n\r\nfor   the   next   decade,  and  to  deliver  prosperity   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much difference will this shift in taxes make? It\r\n\r\nis  hard to quantify.  But it is quite clear that if you look\r\n\r\nback  over  the last 17 years since 1985, had we not  made  a\r\n\r\nstrategic shift from corporate and personal taxes at  40%  in\r\n\r\n1985,  progressively down to 33% after the recession in 1985,\r\n\r\nthen  down  to 28% when we introduced the GST, then gradually\r\n\r\ndown  to  around 25% today, we would not have  had  the  high\r\n\r\ngrowth which we enjoyed, nearly 10% per year after 1997,  and\r\n\r\neven  in the last five years, nearly 5% per year.  If we  had\r\n\r\nstayed where we were, 40% in 1985, you can say you are  happy\r\n\r\nto  pay tax, and maybe Mr Tan Soo Khoon will be happy to  pay\r\n\r\ntax truly, but I do not know how many others would be, and we\r\n\r\nwould not be sitting pretty today.  So, in the same way as we\r\n\r\ngo  forward,  we have to bring our direct tax  rates  further\r\n\r\ndown, and we have to bring our GST up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs, Mr Ong Kian Min and also Mr Low Thia Khiang,\r\n\r\nhave described this as a tax change which will only benefit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  rich.  One of them put it colourfully, although not very\r\n\r\noriginally, by the rich, for the rich, of the rich.  But,  in\r\n\r\nfact, this is a tax change to benefit the whole economy.  The\r\n\r\nway   to  help  Singaporeans,  and  especially  lower  income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  is not to tax the better off  Singaporeans  as\r\n\r\nheavily as possible.  If that were the way to prosperity  and\r\n\r\nnirvana, it would be quite simple.  I just push the tax rates\r\n\r\nup,  40%,  50%,  60%, collect, redistribute.   Happiness  all\r\n\r\nround.    But  if  you  try  to  do  that,  the  high  income\r\n\r\nindividuals  and  certainly  the profitable  companies  would\r\n\r\nleave  Singapore together.  We would lose the jobs that  they\r\n\r\ncreated  as  well  as the taxes which they  would  have  been\r\n\r\npaying.  As Mr Matthias Yao put it picturesquely, you can rob\r\n\r\nthe  Sheriff of Nottingham, but the Sheriff has gone  off  to\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  and  he  is on his way to Shanghai.   When  that\r\n\r\nhappens, all Singaporeans would be the worse off for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income Singaporeans do not pay personal income tax.\r\n\r\nSo they will not benefit directly from the cuts in the income\r\n\r\ntax,  but  they  will benefit.  They will  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nincreased   growth,   they  will   benefit   from   the   job\r\n\r\nopportunities that the tax cuts will foster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon says that GST is regressive. Yes, it\r\n\r\nis.   But  we have to look at the whole tax system  which  is\r\n\r\nvery  progressive, and the whole tax system includes personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax, corporate income tax, property tax, which  is  a\r\n\r\nwealth tax, and includes taxes on cars, which is a very heavy\r\n\r\nwealth tax even after these changes, and it includes the GST.\r\n\r\nAfter we have done these restructuring, after we have brought\r\n\r\nthe  corporate and personal taxes down to 20% and pushed  the\r\n\r\nGST up to the horrendous figure of 5%, we will still only  be\r\n\r\ncollecting  $4  billion in GST, compared to  $12  billion  of\r\n\r\nrevenues from corporate and personal income taxes.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  direct  taxes will still account for three  times  as\r\n\r\nmuch   revenue  as  our  GST,  and  two  thirds  of   working\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do not pay personal income tax.  So if  we  take\r\n\r\nthe tax system as a whole even after this change, it will  be\r\n\r\na  very  progressive tax system, not just looking  at  it  in\r\n\r\nitself, but looking at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  compared  to  other tax systems in other countries.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in Britain, you pay tax almost from the first  pound\r\n\r\nyou  earn,  20  cents  per  pound, or  thereabouts.   But  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we say the first $20,000 is yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us not get carried away by rhetoric added in the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  the night.  If we account not just  for  the  tax\r\n\r\nsystem  but  also  for the expenditure, the spending  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, then you will see that, in fact, we have an  even\r\n\r\nmore  progressive system than that.  Because the Government's\r\n\r\nsocial  spending is very heavily focused on the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups,  our  housing  subsidies, our HDB  flats,  subsidised\r\n\r\nrents,  free  education, almost free or very  cheap  tertiary\r\n\r\neducation, subsidised basic medical care.  If you  take  this\r\n\r\nwhole  package  together, in fact, for the vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  the amount which you receive in benefits  very\r\n\r\nfar  outweigh the amount which you pay in tax, and  adjusting\r\n\r\nthe GST is just a small correction to this overall balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did a calculation once that, for a household around\r\n\r\nthe  median,  $50,000  annual income, 4-room  HDB  flat,  tax\r\n\r\nburden  overall,  all things considered, would  be  $7,500  a\r\n\r\nyear; benefits in kind, $18,600 a year, more than double.  So\r\n\r\nI think we can stand up honourably and proudly and say we are\r\n\r\ndoing the right thing for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have asked me in this debate: will it work? Mr\r\n\r\nYeo  Guat Kwang raised this, Dr Chong Weng Chiew raised this,\r\n\r\nand Mr Low Thia Khiang asked this too.  Will it work?  If you\r\n\r\ncut  CIT, PIT, if you raise the GST, will business come?   We\r\n\r\ncannot  be  sure.  As many MPs have pointed  out,  there  are\r\n\r\nother factors at work, there is a pull of China, there  is  a\r\n\r\nconcern over the region, there is the smallness of our market\r\n\r\nand  the  image  of Southeast Asia as being not  an  exciting\r\n\r\nplace  to be.  In fact, there is no image because it  is  off\r\n\r\nthe  radar  screen  for many investors.  But  all  the  more,\r\n\r\nbecause of these negative factors, we must get our tax  rates\r\n\r\nright  and register that if you do come to Singapore and  you\r\n\r\ndo make money, then it is worth your while to be here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct taxes are the primary fiscal tool that the\r\n\r\nGovernment can use to attract investments and talent.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  everything, but it makes a difference.  Once we read the\r\n\r\nBudget  speech,  EDB,  always fast off  the  mark,  went  and\r\n\r\nknocked on doors in America to try and get new business,  and\r\n\r\nthey have reported that American companies have fed back that\r\n\r\nthey  have taken note of our Budget package.  They have noted\r\n\r\nthat we have made the right fiscal moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Economist Intelligence Unit rankings have\r\n\r\nplaced  us  first in Asia, ahead of Hong Kong, and mainly  in\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  our planned tax cuts and  our  avoidance  of\r\n\r\nbudget  deficits.  And, recently, over the weekend, I  had  a\r\n\r\nvisitor from America who runs a think-tank.  He spent  a  few\r\n\r\nweeks   in   the   region,  including   Singapore,   and   he\r\n\r\ncongratulated  me  on our Budget.  He said,  \"You  are  doing\r\n\r\nabsolutely  the right thing, bringing down the direct  taxes,\r\n\r\nshifting over to consumption tax, encouraging enterprise  and\r\n\r\ninvestments.\"   If  he  thinks that, and  if  his  think-tank\r\n\r\nreflects those views, I think other Americans will also  know\r\n\r\nand it will make a difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not do this, of course, then the chances of our\r\n\r\nmaintaining  4%-6%  growth  in  the  medium  term   will   be\r\n\r\nconsiderably dimmed.  Granted that we have to do this, is the\r\n\r\ntiming  right?  Mr Iswaran and Mr Inderjit Singh  and  others\r\n\r\nhave  questioned the necessity of raising GST in  2003.   Why\r\n\r\nnot put it off?  After all, we have an offset package, so  it\r\n\r\nis  not going to raise much revenue next year, so why not  do\r\n\r\nit  later  on,  five years from now?  I think  we  are  at  a\r\n\r\nturning  point.  Let us take all the measures we have  to  do\r\n\r\nand  do them now, take our medicine and, if we can have a bit\r\n\r\nof  sugar to go with it, let us have the sugar to go with it,\r\n\r\nbut the medicine is in place.  You say push it off - maybe  I\r\n\r\ndo  not have a deficit, can push it off; maybe the deficit is\r\n\r\nnot  permanent, push it off; maybe it is not a big  permanent\r\n\r\ndeficit,  push it off further; maybe I can afford a permanent\r\n\r\ndeficit because I have reserves.  Eventually, we will be in a\r\n\r\nchronic position, unable to salvage our situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason we are sitting pretty today is because we\r\n\r\nhave  not allowed this procrastination to happen and  allowed\r\n\r\nourselves  to drift into a weak fiscal position.  And  if  we\r\n\r\nput  it  off  until  we  are really in difficulty,  and  then\r\n\r\nimplement a goods and services tax, will we be able to do  it\r\n\r\nas  now,  with  a  comprehensive package to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\neverybody can accept it and ease it in so that in five years'\r\n\r\ntime,  after  the package is over, the tax is in  place,  the\r\n\r\neconomy  has grown and everybody is all right?  If  I  do  it\r\n\r\nfive  years  from now, will Mr Low or even Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nstand  up and tell me, \"Well, now we are in straitened times,\r\n\r\nlet  us  proceed, we will take it cold turkey,  no  need  for\r\n\r\noffset  package.\"  I cannot see that.  So I think  we  better\r\n\r\ntake  it  now.   We have an offset package that  looks  after\r\n\r\nnearly  every Singaporean.  Let us get over this  hurdle  and\r\n\r\nthen a new vista will open, and we have new possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs, of course, have asked whether we need to raise\r\n\r\nGST at all - Mr Low Thia Khiang, followed by Mr Tan Soo Khoon\r\n\r\nand  a few others.  I would say that raising GST to 5% is the\r\n\r\nanchor  move  in  this tax restructuring  strategy.   We  are\r\n\r\nbringing down our direct taxes, we are bringing up GST.   The\r\n\r\nkey  parameter, the key shift, is to move the GST from 3%  to\r\n\r\n5%.   We  fix that, then we will adjust the other parameters,\r\n\r\ndepending on what we can afford and how the economy turns out\r\n\r\nand what the external circumstances are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have calculated that if we go from 3% to 5% with the\r\n\r\nGST,  we  can  afford to bring down direct taxes  to  20%  by\r\n\r\nFY2004  and, at the same time, we can afford to fund all  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes we need.  It is going to cost us about $1  billion\r\n\r\nin  revenue lost but, if we do our sums carefully and we  are\r\n\r\ncareful  with  our expenditures, I think we can afford  that.\r\n\r\nIf  it turns out that things are better than we expected  and\r\n\r\nwe collect more revenue than we estimate, I would say that is\r\n\r\na  happy problem.  But the solution to that problem is not to\r\n\r\nreduce the GST.  I say keep it at 5%.  If I have surpluses, I\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshare  the surpluses.  If the economy does well, I  can  have\r\n\r\nNew Singapore Shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, if my revenues are strong but it is a\r\n\r\ncompetitive   environment  which   has   become   even   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive, I have the flexibility to bring my direct  taxes\r\n\r\ndown further, below 20%, to 19% or 18%, depending on what  we\r\n\r\nneed  and how soon we need to move.  But it gives us options,\r\n\r\ncards,  which  we can play in a game where we do  not  really\r\n\r\nknow  what  the rules are and every card we have,  we  better\r\n\r\nkeep in our pocket and save for a difficult moment.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot yet a difficult moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in GST, we expect, will raise $1.3 billion\r\n\r\nextra  of  tax revenue per year.  This is assuming growth  is\r\n\r\nabout  4%.   If  growth  is more, then  there  will  be  more\r\n\r\nrevenue.  If we forgo this increase in GST, that means we are\r\n\r\ngiving up $1.3 billion of revenue a year.  In other words, we\r\n\r\nwill have to reduce Government development expenditure by 15%\r\n\r\nin  order to balance the Budget.  And $1.3 billion is roughly\r\n\r\nequal  to  one  year  of  HDB upgrading  and  public  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidies.   It  is  not  a  small  sum.   We  will  save  on\r\n\r\nbuildings, we will save on renaming, we will make  sure  that\r\n\r\nall our little expenditures are well justified and, where MPs\r\n\r\nhave questions, whether it is A*STAR, SPRING Singapore or the\r\n\r\nfurnishings in some buildings, raise them in the Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply  and argue about them.  The Ministers will defend  and\r\n\r\njustify what they have done.  And I fully sympathise with the\r\n\r\nsentiment that we should be very careful when we spend public\r\n\r\nfunds.   Whether  it  is $1, $100 or $100  million,  that  is\r\n\r\nGovernment money.  Do not spend it unless you absolutely have\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when we built this Parliament House, we had a\r\n\r\nspecial  committee to make sure that it did not  end  up  too\r\n\r\nplush,  and  Mr Tan Soo Khoon will know.  He was Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe committee.  If you go around and you find the furnishings\r\n\r\nsomewhat  spartan, you will know it is the good work  of  the\r\n\r\nformer  Speaker.  And that is what we should do with all  our\r\n\r\nbuildings.   But  even if I turn all our  buildings  back  to\r\n\r\nCentral Supplies Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurniture and put MPs on Government issued benches,  it  will\r\n\r\nnot come to $1.3 billion.  So we have to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised several basic points about the\r\n\r\npackage.   First, he questioned whether the 1994  package  of\r\n\r\nGST, plus direct tax reductions, was in fact revenue-neutral.\r\n\r\nHe  showed us a table, he raised some questions but, if I may\r\n\r\nrefer Members to the table, I think it does not show that the\r\n\r\npackage  was  not  revenue-neutral.  What we  said,  when  we\r\n\r\nintroduced GST in 1994, was that for the first five years  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  revenue-negative, because there are offsets,  there\r\n\r\nare expenditures to ease it in.  After five years, we hope to\r\n\r\nbe  revenue-neutral.  If we look at his Table  2,  column  3,\r\n\r\nActual Surplus, we started off with an actual surplus of $8.5\r\n\r\nbillion  in  1994,  it  went down  in  1995  to  $6  billion,\r\n\r\nthereafter it fluctuated: $2 billion, $5 billion, $1 billion,\r\n\r\n$5  billion and $4 billion.  So it shows that the surplus has\r\n\r\ngone  down.   Our  expenditure has  varied  some  too.   But,\r\n\r\noverall, it does not show that our surplus has gone up.   So,\r\n\r\non  this  basis,  there is no reason to believe  it  was  not\r\n\r\nrevenue-neutral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 shows that the revenue from GST was more than we\r\n\r\nexpected.  Yes, that is true.  It is true because the economy\r\n\r\ngrew  more than we expected.  We did not plan for 10%  growth\r\n\r\nper  year.  We were lucky we enjoyed it.  We did not plan for\r\n\r\n5%  in  the  middle of the crisis, but we  enjoyed  it.   So,\r\n\r\nrevenue  from GST was higher than we expected.  But so,  too,\r\n\r\nthe  discounts on the personal and the corporate income taxes\r\n\r\nwere higher than expected.  Because revenues were buoyant, so\r\n\r\nthe percentage discount was correspondingly bigger.  There is\r\n\r\nno  column for the discount there because it was not  in  the\r\n\r\nIRAS  annual report.  But if you had computed them, you would\r\n\r\nhave  seen that they too would have grown and, overall,  they\r\n\r\nwould,  more  or  less, have broken even.   So,  the  figures\r\n\r\nsounded  good, the table looked interesting, but I think  the\r\n\r\nconclusion was mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: going forward, will we be lucky to have\r\n\r\na table looking like this again?  Since 1994, we have enjoyed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  growth.   Therefore, revenue was buoyant.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nexpenditures  could  be  capped - the population  was  young,\r\n\r\nsocial  spending  was  not  high,  we  did  not  worry  about\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment,  many  pressing  demands   on   our\r\n\r\nexchequer.  The question is: do we believe that we are  at  a\r\n\r\nturning  point,  that  the  world  has  changed,  that  going\r\n\r\nforward, what was will not again be?  If we believe that  the\r\n\r\nworld  has changed, then can we really not increase  the  GST\r\n\r\nand  raise the extra $1.3 billion?  On the other hand, if  we\r\n\r\nbelieve,  as Mr Tan says, the economic pie will expand,  then\r\n\r\nwe  have no problem.  If he is right and I am wrong, then the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be in a happy position of sharing  out  the\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  If he is wrong and, unfortunately, we are  right,\r\n\r\nthis  is a turning point and we did not take the bend and  we\r\n\r\nwent  off  the  road, then our problems will  be  very,  very\r\n\r\nserious.  So, if we want to ponder the alternatives, even  if\r\n\r\nwe are not sure, I think we make this fundamental move now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong wants the Government to promise not to\r\n\r\nincrease the GST for five years.  In 1994, we promised  this.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  introduced  the GST, we said  3%,  five  years,  no\r\n\r\nchange.   This  time, I can honestly say that a GST  increase\r\n\r\nwithin the next five years is not in my plans, and not in the\r\n\r\nGovernment's plans.  But I cannot promise this because,  this\r\n\r\ntime,  it  is a different situation from 1994.  In  1994,  we\r\n\r\nwere  going  swimmingly, the region looked good, we  did  not\r\n\r\nexpect  10% but we expected steady growth, we calculated  our\r\n\r\nsums, we felt safe for five years.  Now you can have the most\r\n\r\nmassive  super computer, you cannot predict what is going  to\r\n\r\nhappen in the next five years.  Will there be a war in  Iraq?\r\n\r\nWhat  will  happen on the West Bank between the Israelis  and\r\n\r\nthe  Palestinians?   What will happen with  Laskar  Jihad  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia?  If you could tell me that all those would  be  no\r\n\r\nproblem,  I  could give you a promise.  You  cannot,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot promise, but it is not our plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have calculated our offset package based on 5% GST\r\n\r\nand  a  certain amount of ERS and other items, and  we  think\r\n\r\nthat it will offset more than five years.  So, that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   basis  on  which  we  are  calculating.   But,  if  the\r\n\r\nkaleidoscope turns, that is a new ball game, and it  is  only\r\n\r\nfair that we warn everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the GST to 5% will be sufficient for us to cut\r\n\r\nour  corporate and personal income taxes to 20% and  we  will\r\n\r\nnot  need  to raise the GST again just to move the  corporate\r\n\r\nand  personal  income taxes down to 20%.  We have  calculated\r\n\r\nthat it is enough.  We are prepared to take the loss, and  we\r\n\r\nwill be able just to keep our noses above water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the GST increase raise prices and cut consumption?\r\n\r\nSeveral  MPs,  such as Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Iswaran,  have\r\n\r\nraised  this question.  I would say that if we did not offset\r\n\r\nthe  GST  increase, we would have a problem.  It happened  in\r\n\r\nJapan.   They  went  from 3% to 5% at an inopportune  moment,\r\n\r\npeople  held  back  on  spending, the  economy  went  into  a\r\n\r\ntailspin.   But  we have an offset package  which  more  than\r\n\r\noffsets  the  GST for five years and, in fact, it  is  front-loaded.  So, we are giving the ERS over three years to offset\r\n\r\nspending for five years.  The offset package will restore the\r\n\r\nhouseholds' purchasing power and may even cause some  of  the\r\n\r\nhouseholds  to bring forward their spending because,  on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  2003,  if  you  have the  offset  package,  you  can\r\n\r\nwithdraw $300 and spend it.  I would not recommend it because\r\n\r\nthen you would not get the bonus shares but, if you want  to,\r\n\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the GST raise prices? Some, but I do not think it\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  big impact.  As Mr Low Thia Khiang pointed  out,\r\n\r\nhawkers  are  not doing that well and will  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nincrease  prices that much.  I think he understands what  the\r\n\r\nreal market balance is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduced the GST in 1994, there was a little\r\n\r\nbit  of  a  blip  in inflation but it was hardly  noticeable.\r\n\r\nInflation  was about 2%, it went up to 3% for one year,  came\r\n\r\nback down to around 2% and stayed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  for a long time.  This time, we are expecting zero  or\r\n\r\nnegative inflation in 2002, and the GST increase is only  2%,\r\n\r\ncompared to 3% in 1994.  So, the impact should be less and it\r\n\r\nshould  not trigger inflation.  But, if it does, or if  there\r\n\r\nare  some shops, hawkers or unscrupulous profiteers who  want\r\n\r\nto   take   advantage  of  this,  we  have  a  committee   on\r\n\r\nprofiteering  who should name them, shame them and  highlight\r\n\r\nalternatives  where people can go to.  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen  is\r\n\r\nchairing  this committee.  I am happy to learn  that  he  has\r\n\r\ninvited  Mr  Chiam  See Tong who has agreed  to  sit  on  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.   Mr Steve Chia has also agreed to  serve  on  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.  So, it is all entirely aboveboard.  We will  show\r\n\r\nyou  the  statistics.  We sample, we go  and  measure  prices\r\n\r\nacross the board, and you will see the statistics.  If it  is\r\n\r\nup,  it  is up.  If it is not up, I hope you will be able  to\r\n\r\nvouch for it that this is what the real situation was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on GST, there are many misperceptions. Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Horn  Kee pointed out some of them and Mr Hawazi  too,\r\n\r\nand  encourage  us to do more to dispel misconceptions  about\r\n\r\nthe  GST,  and especially the misconception that GST involves\r\n\r\ntax  on  tax, and because it is on many stages of production,\r\n\r\nalthough  you  say it is 5%, at the end of the day,  the  GST\r\n\r\nadds up to more than 5%.  I have prepared a chart (Cols. 1089-92)  which  tries to explain this. I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nClerk  to  distribute this to Members and I  would  take  you\r\n\r\nthrough it briefly.  [Chart distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020514/20020514-HA-0741089.gif\">Chart - How the GST works: an illustration of how 5% GST is collected from sale of a TV set (Cols. 1089-1090)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020514/20020514-HA-0741091.gif\">Table - How the GST works: an illustration of how 5% GST is collected from sale of a TV set (Cols. 1091-1092)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just look at the left side of the chart. There\r\n\r\nare  two  examples.   On the left, there are  two  scenarios:\r\n\r\none,  where  the retailer is GST-registered;  one  where  the\r\n\r\nretailer  is  not  registered.  Let us, just for  simplicity,\r\n\r\nlook  at  scenario  A.  You are buying a television  set,  it\r\n\r\ncosts  $300, without GST.  You pay the retailer $300, GST  of\r\n\r\n$15,  so it is $315.  The retailer paid the manufacturer $200\r\n\r\nfor  the  set.  His mark-up was $100.  The manufacturer  paid\r\n\r\nthe parts supplier $100 for the set.  The manufacturer's mark-up was $100.  Now, how much GST was paid?  The parts supplier\r\n\r\npaid $5 of GST to IRAS, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis price was $100, he paid $5.  The manufacturer paid $10 of\r\n\r\nGST  to  IRAS because his price was $200, 5% of $200 is  $10.\r\n\r\nBut  because the manufacturer paid the supplier $100 plus $5,\r\n\r\nso  he  claimed from IRAS a refund of $5, so the manufacturer\r\n\r\npaid  $5.   The retailer pays $15 of GST, which he  collected\r\n\r\nfrom  a consumer, to IRAS.  But the retailer had already paid\r\n\r\n$10  of  the GST to the manufacturer, so he gets a refund  of\r\n\r\n$10  from IRAS.  So the total amount of GST collected by IRAS\r\n\r\non the television set, from the start of the process, when it\r\n\r\nwas  components all the way to the end when it was  delivered\r\n\r\nto  the consumer is $5 plus $5 plus $5, it is $15.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, there is no tax on tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the retailer was not GST-registered, he has a\r\n\r\nsmall  shop, then we look at the right-hand side of the page.\r\n\r\nIn  that case, he does not collect GST, but he has to pay $10\r\n\r\nof  GST  to  the manufacturer.  And having paid  $10  to  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturer, he marks up his product, and sells it for $310.\r\n\r\nHe  did  not  have to deal with IRAS.  The consumer  got  the\r\n\r\ntelevision for $310, instead of $315, and the SME still  gets\r\n\r\nthe  same mark-up as before.  In other words, whether the SME\r\n\r\nis  registered or not, you only pay GST once on the  product.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  if  the  SME is not registered,  he  is  at  an\r\n\r\nadvantage, compared to the registered company.  And when  the\r\n\r\ntax went up from 3% to 5%, his advantage grew bigger, because\r\n\r\nnow  he  can  sell  for $5 less.  Previously,  it  was  a  $3\r\n\r\ndifference.  This explains why it is not a tax on tax.  It is\r\n\r\nfair, it is efficient, it taxes just once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address another basic issue which Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nraised:   why is this Government obsessed with surpluses  and\r\n\r\nreserves?  I am not sure that I would say we are obsessed but\r\n\r\nI  think we are highly preoccupied with it.  We have a reason\r\n\r\nto be highly preoccupied because, unlike other countries they\r\n\r\ncan  always fall back on timber, oil, gas.  Somebody said oil\r\n\r\nwells but, alas, it was only a slip of the tongue.  The  only\r\n\r\nresources  we have are our people and our financial reserves.\r\n\r\nThat  is  all. The stability of our Singapore dollar  and  of\r\n\r\nyour savings and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyour  CPF  money depends on our maintaining healthy financial\r\n\r\nreserves and fiscal surpluses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong financial position instills investor\r\n\r\nconfidence,  it  instills confidence in  the  Government,  it\r\n\r\ninstills  confidence  in  the  Singapore  economy,  it  gives\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  confidence in their country.  That  is  why  we\r\n\r\nmust maintain the reserves, gradually build them up, and  not\r\n\r\nlightly draw upon them.  But we never say never.  There  will\r\n\r\nbe occasions when we need to tap on the reserves in extremis.\r\n\r\nIt  could  be  an  emergency.  It could be  a  dire  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.  It could be a security emergency, and you have to\r\n\r\nexpand Government's spending and you cannot raise taxes,  and\r\n\r\nyou have to draw on the reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never know how long the bad times will last and you\r\n\r\nshould be slow to squeeze the trigger because once you  spend\r\n\r\nthem, it will take you very long to build them back up again.\r\n\r\nWith the reserves, we have the flexibility and the capability\r\n\r\nto respond to the needs of Singaporeans in difficult times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an off-Budget package last year. We said $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion.   Nobody blinked an eyelid in Singapore.   No  other\r\n\r\ngovernment  can make an offset package of 7%  of  GDP,  $11.3\r\n\r\nbillion,  and  you do not need to worry where the  money  has\r\n\r\ncome from.  We could do it last year because we had reserves,\r\n\r\nand  even then, only because we had been lucky.  Since  1997,\r\n\r\ndespite  the economic difficulties, we were able to build  up\r\n\r\nsurpluses  and we had something put aside which we could  use\r\n\r\nwhen we needed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not have that, we would not be able to have\r\n\r\nthat flexibility to help Singaporeans.  In any case, I really\r\n\r\nought  to point out that Mr Chiam got his sums wrong  on  the\r\n\r\nFY2002  Budget surplus, because we are not expecting a  small\r\n\r\nsurplus,  as he has said. After we have made the tax  changes\r\n\r\nand  made  the  offset  package, we  are  expecting  a  small\r\n\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me deal with the offset package. Mr Iswaran\r\n\r\nand Mdm Ho Geok\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoo  said  that one's housing type was not a good  criterion\r\n\r\nfor  distributing the ERS.  I agree.  It is not ideal. We had\r\n\r\nconsidered  the  alternative, which is to  use  income.   But\r\n\r\nincome  also is not ideal and raises other problems.  Let  me\r\n\r\njust go through them briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, if you had no earned income, it does not\r\n\r\nmean  you  are poor.  Your husband may be looking after  you,\r\n\r\nyour wife may be looking after you, you might be living in  a\r\n\r\nbig  house,  you may have wealth.  So, to go  on  a  person's\r\n\r\nincome is not quite a reliable measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we have to use the household income. You cannot\r\n\r\nlook  at the income of the person, but you have to look on  a\r\n\r\nhousehold basis, which means that I have to check who are all\r\n\r\nthe  members  of the household, how much do they individually\r\n\r\nearn,  tally  it all up, add it together, all of which  means\r\n\r\nusing IRAS numbers, and then informing the household that, \"I\r\n\r\nhave  added up all your incomes and it adds up to this amount\r\n\r\nof  money, and this is what you are entitled to\".  I think it\r\n\r\nwould   be  very  complex  and  rather  intrusive  and   many\r\n\r\nhouseholds would prefer us not to add their incomes  together\r\n\r\nand tell us how much it adds up to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered that, we decided it is easier for us\r\n\r\nto go back to housing, but we will not make fine distinctions\r\n\r\nbetween  5-room, 4-room and 3-room in our main  component  of\r\n\r\nour  offset  package, which is the ERS.  Let us  give  nearly\r\n\r\neverybody  $1,200.  But at the top, if you are  living  in  a\r\n\r\nfairly  large  private property, which is  what  the  $10,000\r\n\r\nannual  value  means, then we will give  you  $600  worth  of\r\n\r\nshares, instead of $1,200 worth of shares.  It is a rough and\r\n\r\nready measure, but it is approximate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we even give $600, some people asked, maybe they\r\n\r\ndo  not deserve.  Well, because I cannot be sure that if  you\r\n\r\nare living in a condominium that you have a high income.   As\r\n\r\nmany MPs have pointed out, you may be living in a condominium\r\n\r\nand you may be a retiree and you may need the money.  So,  as\r\n\r\na rough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  ready  measure, we said, \"$1,200, and at the  top,  $600\r\n\r\nworth\", not perfect but reasonable and practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fall-back solution, in case anybody says, \"It is not\r\n\r\nfair  to  me\" is that if any household is not fairly  treated\r\n\r\nbecause  of  your  circumstances - for  example,  you  are  a\r\n\r\nretiree  living in a terrace house - then you should approach\r\n\r\nyour CCC.  Your CCC will study your case and help you through\r\n\r\nthe CCC assistance scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if you are a low-income Government civil\r\n\r\nservant,  retired, then we are going to revise the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAllowance.  We have not decided how much yet, but if you just\r\n\r\ndo some rough sum, even if it is $10-$20 worth of a revision,\r\n\r\nthat  is  worth a lot, in terms of extra GST payable, because\r\n\r\nthat is $10-$20 per month.  Therefore, we can promise that if\r\n\r\nyou  are the lower-income, lower half of the population,  the\r\n\r\noffset  package will look after you for at least five  years.\r\n\r\nIf  you feel that it has not, see your CCC and they will sort\r\n\r\nit  out.   I  can  say  this  with some  confidence  because,\r\n\r\nactually, the people who are the lowest income should have no\r\n\r\nproblem.  Once we have ERS, it should be sorted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just do one more sum. Let us say you are earning\r\n\r\n$2,000  a month.  2% extra of GST means $40 extra of GST  per\r\n\r\nmonth.   For  a year, it is $480 extra of GST per year;  five\r\n\r\nyears, $2,400 of extra GST.  Husband and wife, ERS is $2,400.\r\n\r\nEven  not counting any service and conservancy rebates,  even\r\n\r\nnot  counting any rental rebates or any Singapore  Allowance,\r\n\r\nthe  ERS alone will cover the entire GST increase for you for\r\n\r\nfive years, if your household income is less than $2,000, and\r\n\r\nthere  are  two  adults in the household.  So the  low-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will already be all right, just  based  on  the\r\n\r\nERS.  The people who might not be all right are the ones  who\r\n\r\nare not quite such low-income, but earning between $2,000 and\r\n\r\n$3,600  and  they  may fall between if  they  are  living  in\r\n\r\nprivate  property, in which case, come to the  CCC,  we  will\r\n\r\nhelp you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are earning more than $3,600 - just now, Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai Yuen said who is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe group who suffer - he will look in vain, because even  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  earning more than $3,600, even if you  are  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle-income  group, the package has been  constructed  such\r\n\r\nthat for nearly everybody, you also have at least five years'\r\n\r\nworth  of  offsets.  If you add in the savings on  your  road\r\n\r\ntax,  in  fact,  it will be more than five  years'  worth  of\r\n\r\noffsets if you own a car.  Of course, if you smoke and drink,\r\n\r\nthat is a different arithmetic, but I advise you not to smoke\r\n\r\nand to drink less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect is that we have looked after nearly\r\n\r\neverybody.  We  have not done utilities rebates  deliberately\r\n\r\nbecause, instead of giving household utilities rebates, which\r\n\r\nmeans they have to spend it on utilities, we have given  them\r\n\r\nEconomic  Restructuring Shares.  It is cash.   It  is  better\r\n\r\nthan cash because it earns good interest.  If you want to use\r\n\r\nthis  to pay your utilities bill, that is fine.  If you  want\r\n\r\nto save this, that is fine.  If you want to use this for some\r\n\r\nother  urgent  requirement,  your  children's  school  needs,\r\n\r\nuniforms,  your  parents' hospitalisation expenses,  that  is\r\n\r\nfine too.  So what we have given actually is something better\r\n\r\nthan an utilities rebate.  And the total amount we have given\r\n\r\nyou,  I  think, is eminently reasonable for a long transition\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Irene Ng asked why we did not give a higher\r\n\r\nweighting  for the poor.  Our answer is that this package  is\r\n\r\nmeant  to offset the net increases in the taxes, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  GST.  It is not meant as a wealth-sharing exercise.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  meant to address income inequality.  We  have  other\r\n\r\nschemes  to  do that.  At the right moment, under  the  right\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we  will do - whether  it  is  New  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares, whether it is HDB upgrading programmes, whether it is\r\n\r\nlift  upgrading.  We have other schemes to help lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups,  specifically.  But this one is specifically designed\r\n\r\nto  offset the GST package and to make sure that everybody is\r\n\r\ncovered during the transition period.  Even then, because  of\r\n\r\nthe  rental  and service and conservancy rebates,  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups, in terms of the number of years of additional\r\n\r\ntax offset, are somewhat better off than the middle and upper\r\n\r\nincome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroups.   If  you look at the table which I distributed  with\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  Statement, for the rental flats  you  have  8-10\r\n\r\nyears'  worth of offset, whereas for the lower middle income,\r\n\r\nyou   are  talking  about  6-8  years  depending  on   family\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  So I think that we have been fair, given  the\r\n\r\nobjective of the exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very popular subject for many MPs has been small and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises.  The complaint has been that this Budget\r\n\r\nhas done nothing for the SMEs and they have not benefited  at\r\n\r\nall.   In fact, they do benefit, because the decrease in  the\r\n\r\ncorporate income tax also benefits SMEs.  Furthermore, we had\r\n\r\na  big  package last year with a significant component  which\r\n\r\nwas focused on SMEs, the offset package in October, which was\r\n\r\nreally a mini-Budget.  Members may have forgotten because  it\r\n\r\nwas  six  months ago, and some were not here.  So I ought  to\r\n\r\nremind you that there were rental rebates, which went  up  to\r\n\r\n30%  of rentals.  There was lower foreign worker levy,  which\r\n\r\nwill  be reviewed at the end of the year.  There was property\r\n\r\ntax rebate, $8,000 worth of property tax, the result of which\r\n\r\nis that many HDB shop-owners pay no property tax at all.  And\r\n\r\nthere was a 2-tier corporate tax system, which was introduced\r\n\r\nin  the  last  Budget, the effect of which is to  reduce  the\r\n\r\ncorporate tax payable by small and medium enterprises by half\r\n\r\nor  even three-quarters.  So while this Budget does not  have\r\n\r\nadditional specific items, significant steps have been taken,\r\n\r\nwhich are still in effect, helping the SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should distinguish between two categories of\r\n\r\nSMEs,  which  may get confused together.  One,  the  existing\r\n\r\nSMEs  in  the  retail sector, which are hurting  for  various\r\n\r\nreasons.  And, two, the newer SMEs in the technology line who\r\n\r\nare looking for venture capital, angels, risk money, who want\r\n\r\nenterprise, a suitable environment and so on.  Their problems\r\n\r\nare  different.   The  existing SME  retail  sector  faces  a\r\n\r\nstructural  problem,  because there is an  excess  supply  of\r\n\r\nshops  and  not enough business.  It is a legacy of  history.\r\n\r\nIn older housing estates, MPs know we have often one shop per\r\n\r\n70 flats, because we built the shops in order to resettle the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.  Now, the population has thinned, aged or  moved\r\n\r\nout  and there is no business.  Whereas in the newer estates,\r\n\r\nyou  are talking about one shop for 120 flats.  So it is more\r\n\r\nflats   per  shop  and  easier  to  do  business.   So   some\r\n\r\nrationalisation  is unavoidable and HDB has schemes  to  help\r\n\r\nshop tenants who want to exit their business to exit and they\r\n\r\nget  some ex gratia payment, and then we can restructure  and\r\n\r\nredevelop  the neighbourhood centres and do something  better\r\n\r\nof it.  We have done a few and if they are successful we will\r\n\r\ndo some more.  We cannot solve this problem overnight, but  I\r\n\r\nhope,  over  time,  we  will  be  able  to  improve  business\r\n\r\nconditions for the SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new SMEs, the start-ups, they are different. They\r\n\r\nare facing difficulties securing funding, especially the tech\r\n\r\nstart-ups,  and they want the Government to step forward  and\r\n\r\nproduce the money.  Well, the Government is not good at being\r\n\r\nventure capitalist.  We are not good businessmen, as  we  are\r\n\r\nregularly  reminded  in Parliament, and therefore  we  should\r\n\r\nreally stay out of it.  There is truth in the criticism.   We\r\n\r\nare  not  good  businessmen.  We have to  let  companies  run\r\n\r\ncommercially and where we have to put our money in,  I  think\r\n\r\nwe should be very careful not to be left with lemons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, at best, kick start the process on a small\r\n\r\nscale.  EDB has a venture capital outfit.  Temasek also has a\r\n\r\nsmall  venture capital outfit.  They want to expand,  I  say,\r\n\r\n\"Be careful.  You do not have the skills.\"  Seed the process,\r\n\r\nyes.   Kick  start  it.   But as soon as  possible,  let  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector take over.  Let them do it.  They know,  they\r\n\r\ncan judge.  It is not just a matter of thumping up the money.\r\n\r\nIt  is also a matter of knowing whom to back, which are  good\r\n\r\nrisks, who will be promising, how to guide the project as  it\r\n\r\ngrows  along the way so that it does not go wrong and you  go\r\n\r\nbust.   These are all very specialised skills.  You need  the\r\n\r\ntouch, you need the experience.  The Government is not in it.\r\n\r\nBut  even  if  you  had  venture capital  in  Singapore,  not\r\n\r\neverybody will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  funding.  In Silicon Valley, only one project out of  20\r\n\r\ngets  funding.  That is why the projects which do get funding\r\n\r\nare   promising,  because  there  is  ruthless   competition,\r\n\r\nsurvival of the fittest.  Only the best get funding, and even\r\n\r\nthen after being funded, many of them fail.  So if we try  to\r\n\r\nshort-circuit this Darwinian process and say I will give more\r\n\r\ngenerously,  let us hope a hundred flowers will  bloom.   Are\r\n\r\nyou  sure?   You may have thrown your money away and  planted\r\n\r\nweeds.   So you have to be very careful talking about venture\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to be very careful in favouring small and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprises for Government contracts.  It sounds good,\r\n\r\nit  is  very popular, but it can result in inefficiency.   If\r\n\r\nyou  want to cut back on Government spending, this is not the\r\n\r\nway to do it.  Tender, best bidder, best qualified to provide\r\n\r\nthe service, most efficient, best quality, wins contract,  he\r\n\r\nsupplies  the  Government.  Countries  which  have  tried  to\r\n\r\nfavour SMEs have found that it leads to great inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe  Japanese  have  tried,  the Germans  have  tried,  other\r\n\r\ncountries have tried.  It is better to have schemes  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  get  started, help them improve their productivity\r\n\r\nand  capability, and then they have to compete and hold their\r\n\r\nown.   And  if  they cannot hold their own,  if  they  cannot\r\n\r\ncompete,  then the market has to sort it out.  We  hope  that\r\n\r\nmany will succeed, but we cannot expect none of them to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the future of our economy does not just depend on\r\n\r\nthe SMEs.  We will rationalise the traditional SMEs.  We will\r\n\r\npromote new SMEs to start, but we also need new growth areas.\r\n\r\nWe  also need MNCs.  We also need major companies, to  create\r\n\r\nnew jobs to replace jobs which are being lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs are part of the solution, not part of the\r\n\r\nproblem.   Many  MPs have asked whether the  GLCs  have  been\r\n\r\nstifling  entrepreneurship, crowding out local  players.   Dr\r\n\r\nAmy  Khor  asked this.  Mr Inderjit Singh says, why  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment simply divest GLCs.  I would if it were so simple.\r\n\r\nIt  is not the mission of Temasek or of the GLCs to crowd out\r\n\r\nsmall and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises.   We  gain  nothing.   Our  job,  as   I\r\n\r\nexplained,  is to have companies which are strategic  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy, or which have regional potential to grow and  become\r\n\r\ninternational players.  Other companies not relevant, Temasek\r\n\r\nwill progressively divest when the conditions are right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the borders, some overlap is inevitable, and it is\r\n\r\nespecially troublesome with statutory board companies in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  being completely privatised but not quite  there\r\n\r\nyet.   Members mentioned PWD Consultants.  There are a couple\r\n\r\nof others which are in the process of being privatised, where\r\n\r\nmoratoriums were given, and there is some feeling  that  this\r\n\r\nis  not  quite at an arm's length relationship yet.  But  our\r\n\r\npolicy  is  that we should maintain a strictly  arm's  length\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  such  companies  and  their  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.  In fact, we should cut the umbilical cord as soon as\r\n\r\npossible and separate them, either divest them off completely\r\n\r\nor  they  should go and be put under Temasek  or  under  some\r\n\r\nother  Government agency.  So it is not directly held by  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  and  there  is no  incentive  for  transfer\r\n\r\npricing  or  some  non-transparent arrangements,  which  will\r\n\r\ncause  problems  and inefficiencies and difficulties  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not post senior civil servants to the GLCs. Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai Yuen says we do it for talent development.  I think\r\n\r\nhe  was  being  polite.  We do not do it.  Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nalso  said  we  have senior civil servants posted  there  for\r\n\r\ncareer  rotations.  We do not do that.  The GLCs  have  their\r\n\r\nown  staff.   They recruit their own.  They  recruit  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   They find the best they can get and if  the  people\r\n\r\nare  not  good  enough,  they  have  to  go.   They  are  run\r\n\r\ncommercially by their managements.  They are not run  by  the\r\n\r\ncivil servants.  The civil servants have enough to do without\r\n\r\ngoing into other business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh cited vigorously problems of GLCs\r\n\r\nstifling   entrepreneurship,  crowding  out  local  companies\r\n\r\nthrough   unfair  practices,  or  dominating  and   predatory\r\n\r\npractices,  compelling foreign companies to work  with  GLCs.\r\n\r\nIt sounded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawful  but,  unfortunately, he did not give any  particulars.\r\n\r\nSo  I would encourage him, if he has any specific information\r\n\r\nof actual cases, to let me have the evidence.  I will expunge\r\n\r\nhis  name  and  pass  the  evidence  along,  investigate   it\r\n\r\npersonally and put it right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be quite honest and adult about this.\r\n\r\nCompetition  is  a fact of life.  Even if we  privatised  the\r\n\r\nGLCs and the Government washed its hands altogether and found\r\n\r\na  good private owner to own and manage it, they would  still\r\n\r\nbe  formidable  competitors  to  the  SMEs.   They  are  well\r\n\r\norganised.   They  are  bigger.   They  have  the  depth   of\r\n\r\nmanagement expertise and they are able to deliver  a  service\r\n\r\nor  a  good and get the job done.  So whoever owns the  GLCs,\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  are  still going to face severe competition.   The\r\n\r\nbroader question for us, as a Government, is not whether  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  win  or  the SMEs win.  The question is: are  the  GLCs\r\n\r\ncompeting  fairly?   Is the result that  the  most  efficient\r\n\r\ncompany  succeeds  and  delivers the  best  service  for  the\r\n\r\neconomy   and   the   best  value-added   and   the   highest\r\n\r\nproductivity?   Or is the GLC winning because there  is  some\r\n\r\ninside   track,   some   unfair  advantage,   some   improper\r\n\r\ninformation which they are taking advantage of and  therefore\r\n\r\nclobbering the SMEs and the private companies?  If there  is,\r\n\r\nthey  are harming the economy and we must put a stop  to  it.\r\n\r\nIf  there  is  not, and they are competing fairly,  I  say  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of robust competition is unavoidable.  But  it\r\n\r\nis  not  their job to go and look for small business.   Their\r\n\r\nmission is what we have defined for Temasek and Temasek  will\r\n\r\nhave a charter which will be published soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, CPF. Mr Inderjit Singh argued for lower\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates in the longer term.  It was  one  of  his\r\n\r\nwish-list items.  Mr Othman Haron voiced concern that workers\r\n\r\nmight face difficulties with their housing commitments if CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  were lowered.  I agree  with  Mr  Othman\r\n\r\nHaron.    I  also  agree  with  Mr  Matthias  Yao  that   the\r\n\r\nfundamental objectives of the CPF should not be diluted.   He\r\n\r\nput it in a very neat and succinct form yesterday and I would\r\n\r\nlike to quote him in toto because this is something which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbears  repeating and which I think Singaporeans  need  to  be\r\n\r\nreassured of.  We are not going to muck around with the  CPF.\r\n\r\nCPF,  as  Matthias  said,  is  for  retirement,  housing  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   Everything  else should  be  secondary  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  use CPF as a macro-economic tool  to  alter  the\r\n\r\nmoney  supply  or  disposable  income.   Workers  should   be\r\n\r\nreceptive to changes that might be necessary if they are  not\r\n\r\nto  be priced out of a job.  So it may be necessary for us to\r\n\r\nadjust the CPF scheme but any changes made will be phased  in\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  we  will give as much time  as  possible  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  adjust.  And I may add  what  I  have  said\r\n\r\nbefore,  that  we  promise to restore it  to  40%,  and  that\r\n\r\nstands.  It may take us some time, but we will do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to address a few points briefly. On\r\n\r\nmedical benefits, Members made their sentiments unambiguously\r\n\r\nknown,  many  lady MPs and a few men too.  I  should  explain\r\n\r\nthat  under the new Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient  (MSO)\r\n\r\nscheme,  in  fact,  we  have essentially  equalised,  because\r\n\r\nwhether you are a male or a female officer, what you  get  is\r\n\r\none  extra  percent on your CPF in Medisave.  You  have  $350\r\n\r\nworth  of  outpatient  allowance,  which  you  can  use   for\r\n\r\nyourself.  At the end of the year, if you do not use  it,  it\r\n\r\ngoes  into  your  Medisave.  The men can  use  it  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren, the women, cannot.  But at the end of the  year  it\r\n\r\ngoes  to  the women anyway.  So essentially, it is the  same.\r\n\r\nFor the older schemes, we have not changed it yet.  There  is\r\n\r\nstill  a distinction.  I am sure we will discuss that in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On HDB parking charges, this point will be dealt with\r\n\r\namply,  I  am quite confident, when the Committee  of  Supply\r\n\r\ndiscusses Mr Mah Bow Tan's budget for MND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On older workers, this is a separate problem, not\r\n\r\naddressed  by our tax restructuring package.  The problem  is\r\n\r\nnot  funding.  It is not availability of training programmes.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  matching of workers with vacancies.  We  have  the\r\n\r\nPeople-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme.  It has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrained about 2,000 unemployed workers and executives.   Some\r\n\r\nworkers  are still not taking advantage of it.   But  let  us\r\n\r\npursue  these  programmes.  Let us try and get them  to  work\r\n\r\nbefore introducing or thinking about more permanent measures,\r\n\r\nlike subsidies and rebates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Amy Khor and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take care of Singaporeans who are struggling to\r\n\r\ncope  with  economic restructuring.  Yes, I fully agree  that\r\n\r\nthis is indeed the basis for the generous offset package  for\r\n\r\nthe  GST,  and we have given special attention to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat the lower-income group will not be worse off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed all the major points\r\n\r\nraised.  I have not fulfilled all the wish lists, but perhaps\r\n\r\nit  is just as well.  Because, for example, Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nasked for a 30% reduction in the price of all properties.   I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest to him to consider this very carefully because\r\n\r\nit  means  that all his residents, who are also my residents,\r\n\r\nwill  suffer  a 30% reduction in their property  values,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  not likely to be considered.  And if we  halve  the\r\n\r\npetrol  tax  and  ERP  charges,  foreign  workers'  levy  and\r\n\r\nproperty  tax, what he has not told you is that  Santa  Claus\r\n\r\ncomes and the bill arrives the next day, and the Government's\r\n\r\nbill  to do all this may be a much higher GST than 5%,  maybe\r\n\r\n6%,  maybe 7%, maybe 10%.  So before you sign on, better find\r\n\r\nout what the deal is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a complete response to the challenges which\r\n\r\nface us, as Dr Amy Khor and others have pointed out.  Dr  Amy\r\n\r\nKhor  said it is just one piece of a jigsaw puzzle.   She  is\r\n\r\nright.   The ERC's recommendations are yet to come.   We  are\r\n\r\nworking  on  it.  There are sectoral policies  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nfinancial  services, manufacturing, other  services  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  SMEs, to deal with helping the older workers cope.   We\r\n\r\nhave  a  human resources package working on it.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the CPF and wage issues.  It will take time to work\r\n\r\nthese  out and implement them.  But the first step is  fiscal\r\n\r\nreform, and this we have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitive pressures are increasing, but we can\r\n\r\nrise up to the challenge,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  I  think we have strong reasons to believe that we  will\r\n\r\nsucceed.   Our  political and social  stability,  our  market\r\n\r\naccess   to   major  economies,  our  pro-market   Government\r\n\r\npolicies, our ability to adapt to changes quickly - these are\r\n\r\ntraditional  strengths - we have repeatedly cited  them,  but\r\n\r\nthey  remain  valid and they will help to see us through  the\r\n\r\nnext period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still competitive. We are acting now, not\r\n\r\nbecause  we  already have a problem, but because we  see  the\r\n\r\nproblem ahead.  World-class companies still find Singapore  a\r\n\r\ngood  place  for  investments.  We have  had  a  big  project\r\n\r\nbetween  AMD  and UMC to build a 15th wafer fab  plant  -  $7\r\n\r\nbillion.   We  are attracting regional HQs from Dupont,  IBM,\r\n\r\nToyota.   We  are  building capabilities in  emerging  growth\r\n\r\nareas,  supporting R&D, investing in higher education, trying\r\n\r\nto  anticipate the next wave, but not just on one front.   We\r\n\r\nare  doing  the right things - getting growth and investments\r\n\r\nand  making  the tax changes to put our economy  on  a  sound\r\n\r\nfooting, to enjoy economic growth beyond the short term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Mrs Yu-Foo that we must take heart,\r\n\r\nand  we  must  not  be discouraged.  There is  reason  to  be\r\n\r\nconfident.  With the economic restructuring package, we  have\r\n\r\nmade  the  first step, and we can look forward to facing  the\r\n\r\nfuture with hope and confidence.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek clarifications from the Finance Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, first clarification. The\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has said that to put off the  GST  increase\r\n\r\nnow  will result in a chronic situation.  Can he clarify what\r\n\r\ndoes he mean by chronic situation?  I wish to remind him that\r\n\r\nGST  is  not the only way the Government collects taxes.   We\r\n\r\nare  not talking about reducing corporate and personal income\r\n\r\ntaxes to zero.  There is still something to collect.  On  top\r\n\r\nof that, we have property tax, customs and excise tax, import\r\n\r\nduties,  motor  vehicle taxes and betting taxes.   The  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollection is even more than the GST in fiscal year 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, second clarification. The Finance Minister also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the increase in GST in this Budget  will  provide\r\n\r\noptions  to  the  Government.  I wonder  whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's financial policy to always budget for a surplus.\r\n\r\nIf  my estimate is right, I think the Government will end  up\r\n\r\nwith  quite a huge surplus in 2005.  My question is,  are  we\r\n\r\nover-taxing?   Is the Government over-taxing the  people  for\r\n\r\nwhat is needed by the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third clarification, Sir. The Finance Minister also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the world has changed, and we are  at  a  turning\r\n\r\npoint.   The turning point, to me, seems that now Robin  Hood\r\n\r\ncannot  rob the sheriff of Nottingham.  So he robs  from  the\r\n\r\n\"Roberts\"  on  the street.  I do not quite  understand.   The\r\n\r\nturning point, it seems to me, is that, from now, we have  to\r\n\r\naccept  that  the  rich will get richer, and  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  even have to do more to woo them and to persuade  them\r\n\r\nto stay here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Finance Minister to explain why the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  that and how these rich people  affect  our\r\n\r\neconomic growth in one way or another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been\r\n\r\na very long debate.  So I will try and keep my answers short.\r\n\r\nWhat  do  I  mean by a \"chronic\" deficit.  I mean a situation\r\n\r\nwhere you find yourself running a deficit.  You hope it  goes\r\n\r\naway the next year.  It does not go away.  The next year,  it\r\n\r\nstill  does  not go away and you are unable to fix  it.   The\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries, most of them, are in a chronic  deficit.\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  now has a deficit which they fear is  structural.\r\n\r\nThey are hoping it is not, but it has not gone away.  We have\r\n\r\nnot reached that situation.  In my judgment, if we reduce the\r\n\r\ndirect and personal taxes and do not offset the GST, we  will\r\n\r\nrisk a chronic deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member thinks that we are in a happy position, and\r\n\r\nwe will have an enormous surplus in 2005.  I do not know what\r\n\r\nare the bases for his econometric\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprojections.  I hope he is right.  If he will share them with\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance, maybe we will update our model.  But\r\n\r\nour  model does not show any such enormous surplus.  It shows\r\n\r\npressure on the Government budget, because we are needing  to\r\n\r\nspend  more  for  healthcare, for education, maybe  even  for\r\n\r\nhousing;  certainly investments in transport, trains.   These\r\n\r\nhave  to be funded.  We can either not build them or  we  can\r\n\r\nmake these adjustments and fund them within our means, and we\r\n\r\nhave chosen to do the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a turning point. The rich are getting richer.\r\n\r\nThat is happening the world over.  Some of the richest people\r\n\r\nin  Asia are in communist China.  In fact, the rich ones  are\r\n\r\nnow  being invited to join the Communist Party.  Because that\r\n\r\nis  the  way the economy is moving.  Where are there no  rich\r\n\r\npeople?  Well, in North Korea, there are very few.  In  Cuba,\r\n\r\nthere  are  also very few.  In North Vietnam, there  are  not\r\n\r\nmany, but in South Vietnam there are quite a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber.  So, that is the way the world is going.  How  do  we\r\n\r\nassure  a  good  life for the not-so-rich  Singaporeans?   By\r\n\r\nmaking  conditions in Singapore conducive so that  successful\r\n\r\npeople will come here, start business here, do business, live\r\n\r\nhere, and provide employment and grow our economy, and enable\r\n\r\nmany  other  Singaporeans also to enjoy the new  economy  and\r\n\r\nlive  in this new environment.  That is the turning point  we\r\n\r\nare at today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for the financial year 1st April,  2002  to  31st\r\n\r\nMarch, 2003.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Ten Minutes past Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020514/20020514-HA-0741085.htm\">Committee of Supply - Estimates of Expenditure for the Financial Year 1st April 2002 to 31st March 2003 (Cols. 1085-1088)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020514/20020514-HA-0741089.gif\">Chart - How the GST works: an illustration of how 5% GST is collected from sale of a TV set (Cols. 1089-1090)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020514/20020514-HA-0741091.gif\">Table - How the GST works: an illustration of how 5% GST is collected from sale of a TV set (Cols. 1091-1092)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
