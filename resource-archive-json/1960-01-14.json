At the present  time,\r\n\r\nthefts  of motor vehicles, including motorcycles\r\n\r\nand  of  bicycles are quite common in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlthough action has been taken by the Police  to\r\n\r\nendeavour  to reduce the number of such  thefts,\r\n\r\nand  in  spite  of the number of arrests,  these\r\n\r\nthefts  remain at a high level. It is considered\r\n\r\nthat the present penalties are inadequate to act\r\n\r\nas   a   deterrent  in  these  rather   abnormal\r\n\r\nconditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House, therefore,\r\n\r\nseeks to enhance the punishment for the theft of\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles which include motorcycles, and of\r\n\r\nbicycles or parts thereof, to a maximum of seven\r\n\r\nyears' imprisonment. It also prescribes that the\r\n\r\nminimum  sentence  for  the  theft  of  a  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle or motor vehicle part shall be one year,\r\n\r\nand  for the theft of a bicycle or bicycle  part\r\n\r\nshall  be  three  months' imprisonment.  In  all\r\n\r\ncases, provision is made for the imposition of a\r\n\r\nfine as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (1) of the Bill enhances the penalty\r\n\r\nfor  those who are found guilty of receiving  or\r\n\r\nretaining  motor  vehicles,  bicycles  or  parts\r\n\r\nthereof, which are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproved  to be stolen property, and prescribes  a\r\n\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment of five years  with\r\n\r\na  minimum  term of six months and provides  for\r\n\r\nthe imposition of a fine as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, clause 4 (2) of the Bill imposes\r\n\r\nthe  same penalty on those who are found  guilty\r\n\r\nof   voluntarily  assisting  in  concealing   or\r\n\r\ndisposing of motor vehicles or bicycles or parts\r\n\r\nthereof, which are proved to be stolen property.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this section are necessary  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  not  only  the  thieves  shall  be\r\n\r\nadequately  punished  when  detected,  but  also\r\n\r\nthose  who  encourage such thefts  by  providing\r\n\r\nfacilities for the disposal of stolen property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill empowers the District\r\n\r\nCourt  to  impose the full enhanced  punishments\r\n\r\nfor offences committed under this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of interest to note that similar\r\n\r\nlegislation was enacted in 1946 when  thefts  of\r\n\r\nvehicles, bicycles and spare parts thereof  were\r\n\r\nexceedingly   prevalent   in   Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nlegislation  had  a  salutary  effect,  but  was\r\n\r\nallowed  to  lapse  in 1948 when  the  situation\r\n\r\nbecame more normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is to be in force for one\r\n\r\nyear  in  the  first instance, but provision  is\r\n\r\nmade for its extension from time to time by  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara. Such  extension  would\r\n\r\ndepend  on  whether circumstances prevailing  at\r\n\r\nthe time warrant it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, this Bill does not seek to create a new\r\n\r\noffence in the sense that it will give the\r\n\r\nPolice something, new in respect of which they\r\n\r\ncould charge an offending person. There are\r\n\r\nsufficient provisions, Mr Speaker, Sir, in, our\r\n\r\npenal system whereby people who will contravene\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Bill can be brought to\r\n\r\nbook. There is the Penal Code offence of theft,\r\n\r\nreceiving stolen property, and of assisting in\r\n\r\nthe concealing or disposing of stolen property\r\n\r\nwhich meets the offences set out in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this Bill proposes to do, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is to increase the punishment in the hope\r\n\r\nthat that increased punishment would reduce the\r\n\r\ncrimes.  There is a statement on page  3  which\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Bill will not involve the Government in\r\n\r\nany extra financial expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>Might  I suggest to the Minister who is  moving\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  that  if  his Government  does  not\r\n\r\npropose to incur extra financial expenditure in\r\n\r\nenforcing this Bill, when it becomes law,  this\r\n\r\nlaw  will  remain redundant and quite  useless.\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  with respect again say  that  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty is not that our laws do not  provide\r\n\r\nthe  remedies - they do - but that the  Police  are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to arrest the thieves, however  much\r\n\r\nthe  punishment might be: for 10 years, for 15\r\n\r\nyears,  or  it  might be a sentence  for  life.\r\n\r\nBefore  the  sentences  can  be  imposed,   the\r\n\r\nthieves  have to be caught! That is  where  our\r\n\r\nsystem is about to break down. The Police think\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  punishments are increased,  they\r\n\r\nhave  half  solved  the  crime.  In  1947,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it was necessary to bring  in  a\r\n\r\nspecial   law   to  deal  with  this   peculiar\r\n\r\nsituation  then. In that year, Sir,  you  might\r\n\r\nremember  there  was a very great  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntransport,  and it was a common occurrence  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  lose  their bicycles  or  motorcars\r\n\r\nevery day. As far as I know, this is not a very\r\n\r\nprevalent  occurrence at the moment.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwhat the police are trying to do is to cut down\r\n\r\non  the number of vehicles on the roads as much\r\n\r\nas possible. To suggest that it is necessary to\r\n\r\nbring  in  this  Bill  because  the  theft   of\r\n\r\nvehicles  is so prevalent, is not a proposition\r\n\r\nwhich  I  can  accept. I would suggest  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  enforce the law  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nincreased punishments that will stop the  theft\r\n\r\nof  vehicles, but the catching of  the  thieves\r\n\r\nthat is going to stop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a situation where\r\n\r\nthere is evidence that there is an increase  in\r\n\r\noffences   such  as  the  theft  of   bicycles,\r\n\r\nmotorcars   and   parts  belonging   to   these\r\n\r\nvehicles,  and  also the offence  of  dishonest\r\n\r\nretention  and purchase of such articles  which\r\n\r\nare the subject of thefts, the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  will  appreciate  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Government to take determined\r\n\r\naction to suppress this sort of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he will look at sub-clause (2) of clause 1\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill, he will see that it is proposed\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Ordinance shall continue in operation\r\n\r\nfor  a  period  of one year from  the  date  of\r\n\r\ncommencement:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>subject to extensions from time to time as  the\r\n\r\nYang   di-Pertuan  Negara  may  think  fit   by\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette. Clearly this  Bill\r\n\r\nis designed to meet an emergency situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  has also failed to  look  at  the\r\n\r\npenal provisions of this Bill. He will see that\r\n\r\nthe punishment for theft of a motor vehicle has\r\n\r\nbeen increased from three years to seven years,\r\n\r\nand also that a minimum penalty is prescribed-a\r\n\r\npenalty  of not less than one year in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the  theft  of  motor vehicles,  a  minimum\r\n\r\npenalty of not less than six months in the case\r\n\r\nof  dishonest retention of a motor vehicle, and\r\n\r\na minimum penalty of not less than three months\r\n\r\nin the case of the theft of a bicycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is not the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  that the Government has  found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have  such  powers.   You   will\r\n\r\nremember that not so long ago, the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development came to  this  House  and\r\n\r\nasked for special powers to deal with the  case\r\n\r\nof   attap  houses  which  had  been  appearing\r\n\r\neverywhere  in our City. I am told  that  there\r\n\r\nwere  venturesome people who even attempted  to\r\n\r\nbuild  homes on the public roads of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  something  had to be done  to  stop  that.\r\n\r\nPrevious  Governments had tried  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthat situation-nothing happened. They continued\r\n\r\nto  build these homes. The moment we sought and\r\n\r\nobtained  those  powers in this  Assembly,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that situation  has  completely\r\n\r\nstopped. It is because we have got the, powers\r\n\r\nto  deal  with that situation. If we allow  the\r\n\r\nsituation to drift, then one day the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park will come here and say, \"Does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  know that the  situations  get\r\n\r\nting from bad to worse? What is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment doing about it? I have also  lost  my\r\n\r\nmotorcar!

It  is  only\r\n\r\ntoo  common that when the Police arrest a person\r\n\r\nwho  has committed the theft of a motorcar or  a\r\n\r\nbicycle, he is always allowed bail and  after  a\r\n\r\nlapse of several months, he is only fined $25 or\r\n\r\n$50  in  the end. That, I am sure, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  will not have any deterrent effect on  the\r\n\r\nperson who has committed such an offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, criminals could depend on pin-\r\n\r\ntables and juke-boxes for their income, but with\r\n\r\nthe  closure of this form of activity, more  and\r\n\r\nmore  of  them have resorted to thefts of  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  or bicycles, and it is necessary  that\r\n\r\nenhanced  punishment  be  introduced  and   also\r\n\r\nprovision for a minimum sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an alteration:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 5, to leave out \"1959\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"1960\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment read the Third\r\n\r\ntime and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECOND-HAND DEALERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is already aware of the steps which\r\n\r\nthe  Government proposes to take to enhance  the\r\n\r\npenalties  for  theft  of  motor  vehicles   and\r\n\r\nbicycles  and  the  spare  parts  thereof.

The opportunity  has  also  been\r\n\r\ntaken  in the Bill to tidy up a number of anomalies\r\n\r\nin  the  old Ordinance, which would make it neater,\r\n\r\nmore  effective and more consistent in the  working\r\n\r\nof  a  number of its provisions. There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nsuspicious or sinister in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill redefines \"society\", and the\r\n\r\nprincipal effect of this change of definition is to\r\n\r\nrequire Freemason Lodges and political associations\r\n\r\nto  register, since there are no good  grounds  for\r\n\r\nexcluding   them  from  the  general   requirements\r\n\r\nimposed  on  societies. Leaving the Masonic  Lodges\r\n\r\noutside  the provisions of this Ordinance would  be\r\n\r\nan  anomaly. The Government has no ulterior  motive\r\n\r\nin  requiring  political associations to  register,\r\n\r\nsince  the  Government already  has  the  power  to\r\n\r\nrequire  a  political association  to  register  by\r\n\r\ndeclining  to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  it to be a political association. In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  it  is  of  interest  to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBranch  of the Malayan Chinese Association,  the\r\n\r\nPartai Rakyat, the Pan Malayan Islamic Party and\r\n\r\nthe  Katong  Residents' Association are  already\r\n\r\nregistered societies, whilst the Party I  belong\r\n\r\nto, the People's Action Party, has been exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  registration since its foundation. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  Singapore Labour  Front,  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.,   the  Liberal-Socialist  Party,   the\r\n\r\nMalayan Indian Congress, the Workers' Party, the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Party,  the  Malay  Union,  and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  People's Alliance have been  declared\r\n\r\nto   be  political  associations.  By  requiring\r\n\r\npolitical parties to register, the Government is\r\n\r\nonly aiming at uniformity, and is doing what  is\r\n\r\nalready in force in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause also removes the distinction,\r\n\r\nunnecessary  in  the  view  of  the  Government,\r\n\r\nbetween  \"registered\"  and \"exempted\"  societies\r\n\r\nand  all  will now have to be registered.  There\r\n\r\nis,  in  fact, very little practical  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  registered and exempted societies.  The\r\n\r\nRegistrar  already  has  the  power  under   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  order  any  exempted  society  to\r\n\r\nfurnish him with such information as he sees fit\r\n\r\nto require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice for the Registrar to\r\n\r\ndecline  to  register a society  if  he  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  the  society's  rules   provide\r\n\r\nproperly  for  the running and  control  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety.  Clause  3 of the Bill makes  statutory\r\n\r\nprovision  for this practice and also  makes  it\r\n\r\nthe  positive  duty of the Registrar  to  refuse\r\n\r\nregistration to a society which appears  to  him\r\n\r\nto  be  likely to be used for unlawful purposes,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  gaming or for any purposes prejudicial\r\n\r\nto  or  incompatible with the peace, welfare  or\r\n\r\ngood order in Singapore, or that the application\r\n\r\nfor   registration  does  not  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Ordinance,  or  that  it  is\r\n\r\ncontrary to the national or public interest that\r\n\r\nit  should be registered. Refusal to register on\r\n\r\ngrounds   of   unlawful   purposes   or    those\r\n\r\nprejudicial to peace, welfare and good order  is\r\n\r\nalready  provided for in the Ordinance.  Refusal\r\n\r\non  grounds of being contrary to the national or\r\n\r\npublic interest covers cases in which, although\r\n\r\nthere are good grounds \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor refusal, it might  be undesirable (for instance, to protect sources of information) to have to show that the society in\r\n\r\nquestion  is likely to be used specifically  for\r\n\r\nunlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to\r\n\r\nthe  peace, welfare and good order in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThen  again  in the process of nation  building,\r\n\r\nthe development of a Malayan consciousness and a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture,  the  formation  of  societies\r\n\r\nwhich  cater  for purely sectional interests  or\r\n\r\nwhich  have  a  narrow communal  bias  would  be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged  as being contrary to  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill  be  moving an amendment of  which  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  notice,  to  allow  for  appeal  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister against the Registrar's decision.  Sir,\r\n\r\nas  you  know, in most Ordinances where licences\r\n\r\nor  permits are issued by the licensing  officer\r\n\r\nor   licensing   authority,  there   is   always\r\n\r\nprovision  for  appeal to the  Minister  by  any\r\n\r\nperson  aggrieved by a decision of the licensing\r\n\r\nauthority.  However, due to an  oversight,  when\r\n\r\nsection  4 of the present Ordinance was  deleted\r\n\r\nand redrafted in clause 3, the present provision\r\n\r\nfor  appeal was inadvertently left out. This  is\r\n\r\nthe only reason for its omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 is a transitional provision to allow\r\n\r\nexisting    societies    now    exempted    from\r\n\r\nregistration a year's time in which to apply for\r\n\r\nregistration,  and such societies  will  not  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  be  unlawful  societies  until  such\r\n\r\nperiod has elapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill makes it unlawful for\r\n\r\nsocieties organised outside Malaya to  carry  on\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore unless registered  under\r\n\r\nthe  Societies Ordinance. This same  clause  and\r\n\r\nclause  11  make  unlawful  any  society   which\r\n\r\nchanges its address without permission or  which\r\n\r\nhas one or more of the same office-bearers, or a\r\n\r\nsimilar   name  or  membership,  as  a   society\r\n\r\npreviously dissolved. These provisions are aimed\r\n\r\nprimarily  at fly-by-night gambling clubs,  many\r\n\r\nof  which  have  been known from  experience  to\r\n\r\nadopt  these tactics either to evade dissolution\r\n\r\nor   nullify  the  effects  of  dissolution   as\r\n\r\nunlawful societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 10 enhance the maximum\r\n\r\npenalties  for offences connected with  unlawful\r\n\r\nsocieties,  and clause 9 provides that  evidence\r\n\r\nof repute shall be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmissible to prove the existence of  a  society\r\n\r\nor  that a person is a member of a society.  The\r\n\r\nincreased  penalties  should  act  as   a   more\r\n\r\neffective   deterrent  to   would-be   offenders\r\n\r\nagainst  the  provisions of this Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nthe  admissibility of evidence of  repute  would\r\n\r\nhelp   in   proving  the  existence  of  illegal\r\n\r\nsocieties. The organisers of such societies  are\r\n\r\nusually secretive about their activities and  it\r\n\r\nis therefore difficult to obtain direct evidence\r\n\r\nof the existence of such societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, secret societies have\r\n\r\ndeteriorated  from the old Triad societies  into\r\n\r\nmercenary  gangs  of criminal hoodlums  and  the\r\n\r\nSocieties Ordinance has not been of much help to\r\n\r\nthe  Police  and the Criminal Courts in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  them. The only provision in the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  materially assists the Police and  Courts\r\n\r\nto  deal with the criminal members of the secret\r\n\r\nsocieties  is that which permits the  Registrar,\r\n\r\nin certain circumstances, to order a man to have\r\n\r\nhis  fingerprints  recorded and  his  photograph\r\n\r\ntaken. And the wording of this part of the Bill,\r\n\r\nhaving  been drafted to assist the Registrar  to\r\n\r\nobtain  information  about the  Triad  societies\r\n\r\nrather than to provide for the identification of\r\n\r\nmembers of an organised criminal underworld,  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  for  Singapore's  present  need.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  now needed is that the Police and  the\r\n\r\nCourts  should be assisted in criminal cases  by\r\n\r\nthe  availability, as evidence that  an  accused\r\n\r\nperson  is  a member of an unlawful society,  of\r\n\r\nthe   opinion   of   an  independent   authority\r\n\r\ninquiring    specially   into   the   existence,\r\n\r\nmembership  or  operations of secret  societies.\r\n\r\nClause  12  of  the Bill now before  the  House\r\n\r\ntherefore amends section 22 (4) of the Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  make  it clear  that  any  person\r\n\r\nordered  to have his fingerprints and photograph\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Registrar of Societies is, in  his\r\n\r\nopinion,  either  a  member  of,  or  intimately\r\n\r\nconnected with, an unlawful society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these then are the aims and objects of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. As can be seen, it is not  aimed  at\r\n\r\nany  legitimate,  respectable  or  lawful  body,\r\n\r\nparty  or  association, but against  undesirable\r\n\r\nand  shady  societies and as  such  will,  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident, receive the support of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said, this Ordinance is hoary with age  and\r\n\r\nit  is  time  certain  of  its  provisions  were\r\n\r\nbrought  out into the open and aired; but  while\r\n\r\ndoing it, one has also to consider the effect of\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  upon the  social  life  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore as they have been accustomed\r\n\r\nto live it over the last 100 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the Societies Ordinance is\r\n\r\nthis. Firstly, it defines any association of ten\r\n\r\nor  more  persons to be a society, and  then  it\r\n\r\ngoes   on   specifically   to   exempt   certain\r\n\r\ncategories  of  persons or  companies  from  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the Ordinance. And then  it  says\r\n\r\nthat such other societies as are not registrable\r\n\r\nunder  the provisions of the Ordinance shall  be\r\n\r\ndivided  into two categories, namely, registered\r\n\r\nsocieties  and exempted societies. So that  then\r\n\r\nwe   have   three  categories:  one,  the   non-\r\n\r\nregistrable   society;   two,   the   registered\r\n\r\nsociety; and, three, the exempted society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the non-registrable societies,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the majority of  persons  or\r\n\r\ncompanies   exempted  are  either   persons   or\r\n\r\ncompanies  who  are  already  registered   under\r\n\r\nexisting Ordinances; the two sub-sections  which\r\n\r\ndo  not come within that category of persons  or\r\n\r\ncompanies   are  Freemasons  and  the  political\r\n\r\nassociations.  In respect of the Freemasons  and\r\n\r\nthe  political associations, this Bill seeks  to\r\n\r\nmake them come within its scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to exempted societies, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is also proposed to make  them\r\n\r\nall registered societies and to give them a year\r\n\r\nwithin which to register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a number of\r\n\r\nsocieties particularly interested in sport,  and\r\n\r\nmost  of  them are exempted under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Societies Ordinance. The proposal  that\r\n\r\nall  societies should be registered  and  should\r\n\r\nhave  a registered address and can only meet  at\r\n\r\ntheir registered address would have very serious\r\n\r\nrepercussions  on  the  sport  of  the  country,\r\n\r\nbecause  most of the societies would then  cease\r\n\r\nto exist and all those who are now interested in\r\n\r\nhockey  and football particularly will  find  it\r\n\r\nvery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult to carry on their sporting activities.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this should be encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nnew  provisions  with regard  to  registrability\r\n\r\nhave  been introduced into the Bill, mainly  the\r\n\r\npoint  whether it is in the national  or  public\r\n\r\ninterest.  I do not wish to speak very  much  on\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  at  this  stage, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause I have given notice that I will  move  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of amendments. My own view is that  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  sufficiently important, and will  have\r\n\r\nsufficient repercussions on the society such  as\r\n\r\nwe are accustomed to in Singapore, that it needs\r\n\r\nvery  careful and serious consideration. At  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time, it is hoped that a motion will\r\n\r\nbe made to refer this Bill to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nand  that the Minister will find it possible  to\r\n\r\naccede to that request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I wish\r\n\r\nto  assure  Members of this House  that  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  has been given to the  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained in the proposed amending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first preface my\r\n\r\nremarks  by drawing attention to this  one  very\r\n\r\nimportant fact? That it is one thing to put  the\r\n\r\nlaw  in  order,  but  it  is  another  thing  to\r\n\r\nimplement  and  administer its provisions  in  a\r\n\r\nworkmanlike and practical manner. There  is  one\r\n\r\ncogent  point which the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nhas  brought  out, namely, the difficulty  which\r\n\r\nthe  sporting  and athletic clubs will  find  in\r\n\r\nexecuting   their  business  at  the  registered\r\n\r\naddress.  But  I  think he  overlooks  this  one\r\n\r\nimportant  provision: that illegality  does  not\r\n\r\nflow  simply  from the departure of  the  strict\r\n\r\nwording  of  the Ordinance. Illegality  and  the\r\n\r\npunishment of illegality by the State only comes\r\n\r\nabout  in  cases where the State  and,  in  this\r\n\r\ncase,  the  State Advocate-General,  who  is  an\r\n\r\nindependent   officer   in   respect   of    all\r\n\r\nprosecutions,  is satisfied that there  was,  in\r\n\r\nfact, a criminal act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, at present, 1,007 exempted\r\n\r\nsocieties of which the People's Action Party  is\r\n\r\none.

But  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Members opposite, particularly  those\r\n\r\nwho  were  responsible for the last  Government,\r\n\r\nwould appreciate that cultural associations  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  even  sporting associations  are  not\r\n\r\noften  what they profess to be. It is one  thing\r\n\r\nto  say  that one has formed an association  for\r\n\r\nthe  advancement of the playing of the flute  or\r\n\r\nthe banging of the brass gong; but it is another\r\n\r\nthing  to want to boost members to rehearse  and\r\n\r\npractise  these  arts. It is invidious  for  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Societies to have to pick  out  any\r\n\r\nparticular association for special scrutiny, and\r\n\r\nto  require  that  association to  furnish  more\r\n\r\ndetailed  particulars to ensure that,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe   association  is  observing  the  aims  and\r\n\r\nobjects  with  which it has been formed  and  is\r\n\r\ncomplying with the rules and regulations of  its\r\n\r\nconstitution.  If  we  are  to  go  through  the\r\n\r\nrigmarole of scrutinising all the 1,007 exempted\r\n\r\nsocieties,  and if we are to do it as thoroughly\r\n\r\nas  it  is  required under the law  and  can  be\r\n\r\nenforced  by  the  law, then  very  shortly  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs will have to ask for a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  vote  in order  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  clerks - receiving clerks  and  filing\r\n\r\nclerks - votes for cabinets, card index system and\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non.  But  if  we approach this in  a  relatively\r\n\r\npractical  way  and  put them  all  through  the\r\n\r\nordinary  mill, then only those  which  we  have\r\n\r\nreasons  to believe are not complying  with  the\r\n\r\nlawful  objects with which they have been formed\r\n\r\nare  more  easily  brought  under  scrutiny  and\r\n\r\nbrought to book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has listed three\r\n\r\ncategories - those registrable under various other\r\n\r\nOrdinances  like the Companies Ordinance;  those\r\n\r\nthat  will be registered or exempted; and  those\r\n\r\nnot   registrable  at  all.  As  for  the  first\r\n\r\ncategory,   I  would  like  to  anticipate   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law in saying that he is\r\n\r\npreparing  legislation to bring  the  benevolent\r\n\r\nassociations,  which form a very fruitful  field\r\n\r\nfor  all  kinds  of minor social swindles - mutual\r\n\r\naid associations, medical aid associations - under\r\n\r\nGovernment control. They will shortly come under\r\n\r\nvery  special  legislation which will  stop  the\r\n\r\nracketeering   that   takes   place   in   them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  quite a number of societies  now  on\r\n\r\nthe  exempted list will be moved into that  list\r\n\r\nwhere special registration is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained the distinction between\r\n\r\nexempted  and registered societies, and  why  we\r\n\r\nhave   felt   that,  in  view  of  the   changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances  in  which we have  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthem, it is more practical to deal with them all\r\n\r\non  one basis, as registered societies. There is\r\n\r\nleft  only  this  very small and selected  group\r\n\r\ncalled Freemasons and political societies  which\r\n\r\nare   completely  outside  the  orbit   of   the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance. We  know  of  no  coherent\r\n\r\nreason  why  the  Freemasons  should  have  been\r\n\r\nsingled  out for special treatment,  other  than\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that perhaps those who legislated  in\r\n\r\nthose  days belonged to the Freemasons. We  also\r\n\r\nsee no reason why political societies should  be\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  by having them classified - as  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs has just indicated  to\r\n\r\nthe  House - into  three groups: those  registered\r\n\r\nlike   the  Katong  Rural  Dwellers  Association\r\n\r\n(surely,  the Registrar considers  them  a  very dangerous  group  of  people),  those  that  are\r\n\r\nexempted,  like  the  P.A.P. against  whom  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  could from time to time  elicit  more\r\n\r\ninformation, and those taken out of the pale  of\r\n\r\nthe Registrar, like the S.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unless the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark can make out a compelling case and bring to\r\n\r\nour   attention  considerations  which  we   had\r\n\r\noverlooked in the preparation of this Bill,  we:\r\n\r\nintend   to  go  through  with  it  today.   If,\r\n\r\nsubsequently,  in  administering  it  there  are\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  lacunae in the law, then  we  are\r\n\r\nquite prepared to reopen for consideration those\r\n\r\nprovisions   which  have  been   found   to   be\r\n\r\ninadequate.  But let us not forget this.  First,\r\n\r\nwe  have to put the law into coherent and proper\r\n\r\nform.  Then  we  have  to remove  discriminatory\r\n\r\npractices under the law. But above all, it is in\r\n\r\nthe  administration  of that  law  that  finally\r\n\r\ndecides whether we will have a free and flexible\r\n\r\nsociety where freedom of association is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe hallmarks of a free and tolerant society, or\r\n\r\nwhether   we   will   have  a  dictatorial   and\r\n\r\nintolerant system. I think Members in this House\r\n\r\nwill  agree with me that in the present  context\r\n\r\nof  events  there  is  a  need  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nassociations   are  formed   only   for   lawful\r\n\r\npurposes,  or  if  they are not  beneficial,  at\r\n\r\nleast  ensure  that they are not detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe  State. The ingenuity of man being  what  it\r\n\r\nis, it is not unknown for societies to have been\r\n\r\nformed  with  the most laudable  of  objectives,\r\n\r\nwhilst,   in  practice,  they  are  blinds   for\r\n\r\ndisreputable and sometimes positively  dangerous\r\n\r\nconspiracies. I would like to add  that  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  are  in no danger of being  classified\r\n\r\nunder  the  category of persons taking  part  in\r\n\r\ndangerous  conspiracies,  because  we   do   not\r\n\r\nattribute them with sufficient capacity to carry\r\n\r\nout  their  evil intent. But I can  assure  them\r\n\r\nthat  before they are classified in the category\r\n\r\nof  being  detrimental to  the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nState,   there  will  have  to  be   much   more\r\n\r\nbuffoonery and stupidities than what  they  have\r\n\r\nenacted  in the last seven months. In  fact,  if\r\n\r\nfrom time to time they disintegrate - they started\r\n\r\nwith  five members, now they have got four - there\r\n\r\nis no need for special legislation to look after\r\n\r\nthem.  We leave them alone and, by processes  of\r\n\r\nnature, they disintegrate by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  welcome  the  assurance given  by  the  Home\r\n\r\nMinister  that  there is nothing  suspicious  or\r\n\r\nsinister in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocieties (Amendment) Bill. We also welcome  the\r\n\r\nstatement  that  the  Bill is  aimed  at  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties, gangsters and gambling groups  trying\r\n\r\nto   take   protection  under  innocent  looking\r\n\r\nsocieties.  Unfortunately, Sir,  this  Bill  has\r\n\r\naroused  a  great  deal of  public  comment  and\r\n\r\napprehension. In some political quarters, not in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  there  have  been  expressions  of\r\n\r\nopinion  to  the  effect that a Bill  like  this\r\n\r\nwould  lead to the killing of democracy and  the\r\n\r\nextermination  of  a political Opposition.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Hon. Prime Minister did imply, however, that\r\n\r\nthe   moment   the  Opposition   should   become\r\n\r\ndangerous,  then he would reconsider  the  whole\r\n\r\nposition. I hope that is only a joke. We believe\r\n\r\nhowever,  Sir, that in a democracy, the pendulum\r\n\r\nmust  be  allowed to swing now one way, now  the\r\n\r\nother. The pendulum must never be static and the\r\n\r\npendulum  can only be static if we have  a  one-party Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It will probably stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Because of that, Sir, and\r\n\r\nbecause  the powers given by this amending  Bill\r\n\r\nare  so  vast there may come a situation  where,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the  honest  intentions  stated,\r\n\r\nthose  powers  can  be wrongly used.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nbecause  of that, there is this apprehension  in\r\n\r\nthe  public  mind.  For  that  reason,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  this Bill is even more  important\r\n\r\nand  more  controversial  than  the  Pawnbrokers\r\n\r\n(Amendment)   Bill.  To  reassure  the   public,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  this  Bill should  go  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Of course, Sir, the Government  side\r\n\r\nhas  the power to bulldoze it through today. But\r\n\r\nwe  hope,  as  in  the case of  the  Pawnbrokers\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill and the Muslims (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill, that they will agree to refer this Bill to\r\n\r\na Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the abolition of exempted\r\n\r\nsocieties, the plea is made that this is done to\r\n\r\ntidy up things and to avoid discrimination. Sir,\r\n\r\nyou will remember that in the case of levying of\r\n\r\nincome  tax,  there  are  different  categories,\r\n\r\nbecause   it  is  practical  to  have  different\r\n\r\ncategories.  We have those persons  who  pay  no\r\n\r\nincome  tax at all. We have those who pay  lower\r\n\r\nrates  and those who pay higher rates.  Then  we\r\n\r\nhave those who are ex-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nempted from payment of income tax. So we see  no\r\n\r\nreason  why  there should not be this  different\r\n\r\nclassification of societies for the  sake  of  a\r\n\r\nmore practical administration. For instance,  if\r\n\r\nwe  say  that, in the interests of equality  and\r\n\r\nnon-discrimination,  visitors  in  the   gallery\r\n\r\nshould  all sit here or they should all come  in\r\n\r\nby the same entrance, it might be more difficult\r\n\r\nfor  the  attendants  to  distinguish  one  from\r\n\r\nanother.  But  we  allow  these  things  to   be\r\n\r\ndifferent because, from practical experience, we\r\n\r\nfind that they are expedient and useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under some of the amendments, it will be\r\n\r\nvery  difficult and discouraging for people with\r\n\r\ngood  intentions to want to organise  societies.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them  will  get frightened.  Supposing\r\n\r\nbefore the societies are registered, it is known\r\n\r\nthat  these people have made a statement in  the\r\n\r\nPress  that  they are forming a  society,  could\r\n\r\nthey  not be regarded under this Bill as  having\r\n\r\nconducted  themselves illegally and be  regarded\r\n\r\nas  members  of  an unlawful society?  Supposing\r\n\r\npioneers  in education were to come to Singapore\r\n\r\nintending to start a school, and that project is\r\n\r\npublicised,  if  their headquarters  were  in  a\r\n\r\nforeign country, then under this Bill they would\r\n\r\nbe  regarded as members of an unlawful  society.\r\n\r\nIf  this were so, then the cause of education in\r\n\r\nSingapore would have been held back by decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the early pioneers of the different\r\n\r\nchurches  first came here to explore the  ground\r\n\r\nto  see  if they could get support. It was  only\r\n\r\nwhen  they had got support that they established\r\n\r\ntheir  schools and their missions  here.  Now  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   Home  Minister  will  clarify   the\r\n\r\nsituation   so   that  it   will   not   prevent\r\n\r\nphilanthropic and charitable people  from  being\r\n\r\nable  to  come  here  from abroad  to  establish\r\n\r\ncharitable and educational institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, under the provisions here, if by\r\n\r\nmistake  or through some oversight, the honorary\r\n\r\nsecretary  of  a society forgets to  inform  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar   that  the  society  has  moved   its\r\n\r\npremises,  there will be trouble,  because  that\r\n\r\nsociety  will then be an unlawful society.  When\r\n\r\nit  comes to political societies, Sir, naturally\r\n\r\nthere is the fear that the moment the Opposition\r\n\r\nthreatens to disturb the balance of power, as it\r\n\r\nwere, then, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical  reasons,  the Government  may  decide\r\n\r\nthat a certain political party should not be  in\r\n\r\nexistence. We do not believe, however, that they\r\n\r\nwill  do  it  to those of us who are  here.  But\r\n\r\nthere are those outside who feel that that might\r\n\r\nbe  done  to  them. The public  therefore,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbeing fair minded, have expressed their fear. So\r\n\r\nif  there  is  a Select Committee  appointed  to\r\n\r\nconsider  this Bill, then it could  receive  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  those who have such fears and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat there will be safeguards in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, it could also be interpreted that\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  provisions of this Bill  will  go\r\n\r\nagainst  certain Articles in the United  Nations\r\n\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 13 says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Everyone has the right to freedom of movement\r\n\r\nand residence within the borders of each state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions here, the Registrar has\r\n\r\nthe  right not to allow a society to change  its\r\n\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Article 18 says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,\r\n\r\nconscience  and  religion.  The  right  includes\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  change his religion of  belief  and\r\n\r\nfreedom either alone or in community with others\r\n\r\nand   in  public  or  private  to  manifest  his\r\n\r\nreligion   or  belief  in  teaching,   practice,\r\n\r\nworship and observance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And Article 20 reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful\r\n\r\nassembly and association.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as people are not disloyal to this\r\n\r\ncountry  or  engaged  in  criminal  pursuits,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they should be encouraged  to  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves into societies that would benefit the\r\n\r\nSingapore  community. But too many  restrictions\r\n\r\nand   the   threat  of  severe  penalties   will\r\n\r\ndiscourage   good   citizens   from   organising\r\n\r\nthemselves. I do suggest, therefore,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nin  addition to saying that they do not have any\r\n\r\nsinister  or  evil intentions, but to  show  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  they do not have such  intentions,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  consider it  right  to  have  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee appointed to consider the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI would like to say that, on the whole, I am not\r\n\r\nof  the  opinion that this Societies (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  is not of benefit to the people. But,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, as has been suggested by other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition when recommending that\r\n\r\nthis   Bill  should  be  referred  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee for the purpose of receiving  opinions\r\n\r\nand view-points, I know what the public feel.  I\r\n\r\nmyself  do not like societies which are communal\r\n\r\nin  outlook, as in fact they are more  dangerous\r\n\r\nthan those which have a provincial outlook.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  there may be associations or political\r\n\r\nparties which have already been registered, as I\r\n\r\nhave  heard  just  now, based on  religion;  and\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  organisations  which  have  been\r\n\r\nregistered, organisations which, in my  opinion,\r\n\r\nare  provincial  in outlook and which  are  more\r\n\r\ndangerous  than associations which are religious\r\n\r\nin outlook. So, Mr Speaker, we can say it would\r\n\r\nbe  wise  if the suggestion already put  forward\r\n\r\ncould  be accepted by the Government, that  this\r\n\r\nBill be referred to a Select Committee. Although\r\n\r\nthe  final  decision rests with the  Government,\r\n\r\nwe,  on  our part, do not hesitate to  recommend\r\n\r\nreference of the Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been emphasised just now by the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we  know  that  although   U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nparticularly has been exempted from registration\r\n\r\nas  it  has  been  declared a  political  party,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, in accordance with the new  rules,\r\n\r\nwe  must apply for registration within a  period\r\n\r\nof  one  year. Whether U.M.N.O. will be accepted\r\n\r\nas  a  political party or otherwise, it will  be\r\n\r\nleft  to  the  persons  concerned.  However,   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  our  request will be agreed  to.  As  a\r\n\r\npolitical   body,  we  have  no   intention   of\r\n\r\nupsetting  the  peace  or the  progress  of  the\r\n\r\nState.  We  feel  confident  that  we  can,   in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the present Government,  work\r\n\r\ntowards   resolving   many   major   issues   of\r\n\r\nadministration or of the constitution, or of any\r\n\r\nother  relevant  matters which we  may  come  up\r\n\r\nagainst  in  the future. Therefore, it  is  only\r\n\r\nwise  that opportunities must be given for views\r\n\r\nto  be  aired, and to investigate and  ascertain\r\n\r\nwhich  are really the parties appearing under  a\r\n\r\ncloak,  so  that we should not accuse at  random\r\n\r\nany  organisations which have been running their\r\n\r\nactivities not in accordance with the law. In  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic    institution,    we    must    give\r\n\r\nopportunities to these associations  to  put  up\r\n\r\ntheir views and reports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Select  Committee.  If  the  Government\r\n\r\nagrees with our viewpoints, then I trust that at\r\n\r\na  later  date  we will be informed  not  merely\r\n\r\nabout the abolition of secret societies but also\r\n\r\nabout   many   matters  which  I  have   already\r\n\r\nmentioned just now - matters concerning  the  true\r\n\r\nidentities  of political parties, or  any  other\r\n\r\nassociations,  as  to whether  certain  cultural\r\n\r\nassociations are truly so, or whether  they  are\r\n\r\nin  fact  practising  undesirable  culture  from\r\n\r\nwithin.  Such political associations or  parties\r\n\r\nwe  must  abolish, in accordance  with  the  law\r\n\r\nwhich  we think is fit for our society. So,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I would like to stress that, on my part\r\n\r\nand  as  a  representative of U.M.N.O., U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nhas  been  declared  a political  party  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Government. We are  not  unwilling  to\r\n\r\nconduct  any  activities which will  be  to  ~he\r\n\r\nbenefit, peace and good order of the State,  but\r\n\r\nlet  opportunities  be given  not  only  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in this House but also to the  public\r\n\r\nof  Singapore who would like to take part in the\r\n\r\ndemocratic practice of promulgating the  law  in\r\n\r\nthe true sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir\r\n\r\nwe  do  not object to this Bill at all. In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  are at one with the Government in wanting to\r\n\r\nbring  all  manner of societies and associations\r\n\r\nwithin  the  scope of a comprehensive  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The present Ordinance, as  has  been\r\n\r\nstated by the Minister for Home Affairs,  is  an\r\n\r\nold  piece  of legislation. It was brought  into\r\n\r\nforce,  if I remember rightly, to control mainly\r\n\r\nTriad  societies,  but certain  exemptions  were\r\n\r\ngiven  and certain classes of associations  were\r\n\r\ntaken   out   of  the  scope  of  the  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The Prime Minister has said  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not feel that it is necessary that the Bill\r\n\r\nshould  be  referred to a Select Committee,  but\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Opposition could  advance  cogent\r\n\r\nreasons,  he  would be prepared to consider  and\r\n\r\nmight  agree  to  refer the  Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proposed legislation is of so\r\n\r\nimportant  a character that all points  of  view\r\n\r\nmust be considered. While I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid say earlier, and I say it again, that it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable  that  all kinds of  associations  and\r\n\r\nsocieties   should  be  brought  under   limited\r\n\r\ncontrol,  so  long as the freedom of association\r\n\r\nis  not  jeopardised, one must not overlook  the\r\n\r\nfact  that this proposed legislation intends  to\r\n\r\nbring  in  all  the categories  of  associations\r\n\r\nwhich have so far enjoyed exemption, as well  as\r\n\r\nthose  societies  which do not  come  under  the\r\n\r\noperation  of this Ordinance. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that  such  societies  should   feel\r\n\r\nconsiderably concerned that their activities are\r\n\r\nnow  going to be curtailed. As a result  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment, they are going through  the\r\n\r\nBill with a view to informing the Government  if\r\n\r\nthere  are certain points that require deep  and\r\n\r\nserious consideration. There is one which  comes\r\n\r\nto my mind on the question of political parties.\r\n\r\nSir,  under  clause  4, exempted  societies  are\r\n\r\ngiven   one  year's  time  in  which   to   make\r\n\r\napplication for registration under this proposed\r\n\r\namendment.   But  in  the  case   of   political\r\n\r\nassociations  which have been  declared  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor-in-Council  as political  associations,\r\n\r\nno   time  has  been  given  for  them  to  make\r\n\r\napplication for registration. So with the coming\r\n\r\ninto force of, this Bill, such political parties\r\n\r\nwill  be non-existent unless they apply and  get\r\n\r\nregistered on the same day. I do not think  that\r\n\r\ncan be done so quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the question of meeting\r\n\r\nplaces   of   registered   societies.   As   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  knows  very well, political  parties\r\n\r\ngenerally  hold  meetings  not  only  in   their\r\n\r\nregistered  premises but in almost every  little\r\n\r\nspot in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Even in bank vaults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Does it mean that if such\r\n\r\nmeetings  are  held in places other  than  their\r\n\r\nregistered    premises,   such    a    political\r\n\r\nassociation  will  become art unlawful  society?\r\n\r\nThere are various other points which I need  not\r\n\r\ngo into in detail here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening quite attentively to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and I did agree with him when  he  said\r\n\r\nthat   it   is  important  that  all  kinds   of\r\n\r\nassociations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be brought under one control. I  was  with\r\n\r\nhim  up  to  that point, and as he  was  going  to\r\n\r\nresume   his   seat,  I  thought  of  getting   up\r\n\r\nstraightway  and  supporting  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nsaying  that  it was a good thing  and  should  be\r\n\r\ndone.  But on second thoughts he felt that it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary to run down the Opposition - that is  most\r\n\r\ntypical of the Prime Minister - that we are a spent\r\n\r\nforce,  we are this, we are that. Sir, we are  not\r\n\r\nworried what the Government thinks of us. We  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the public thinks of us [Laughter],  and  we\r\n\r\nalso  know what the public thinks of them. We  can\r\n\r\ntravel  quite freely and go into coffee shops  and\r\n\r\ninto markets with the masses. Sir, we do not claim\r\n\r\nthat  we are the people's representatives;  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  say that we are the people's government,  and\r\n\r\nyet we dare go among the people without bodyguards\r\n\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although\r\n\r\nthe  Members of the Opposition have not  presented\r\n\r\ntheir  case for committing this Bill to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCornmittee with compelling reasons other than that\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member for Cairnhill  about  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  time  for  political  societies  to\r\n\r\nregister, however, in order to satisfy the Members\r\n\r\nof   the  Opposition,  I  have  no  objection   to\r\n\r\ncommitting this Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.
