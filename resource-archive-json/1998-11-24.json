-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the Environment\r\n\r\nhow  Singapore  ranks  in the emissions of  carbon  dioxide  per\r\n\r\ncapita,  in  comparison to other countries and what efforts  are\r\n\r\nbeing made to reduce the emissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek  bin  Saniff) (for the Minister for the Environment):   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, Singapore ranked 24th in the world in terms of per\r\n\r\ncapita  carbon dioxide emission in 1995, based on  a  comparison\r\n\r\nbetween our carbon dioxide emission figures and data compiled by\r\n\r\na  US-based  agency.   Our  per capita emission  is  lower  than\r\n\r\ncountries such as the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, Denmark,  the\r\n\r\nUK as well as Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, power generation accounts for half of the\r\n\r\ncarbon  dioxide emission, and industries and road transportation\r\n\r\naccount for much of the remaining 50%.  A wide range of measures\r\n\r\ntaken  over  the  years has helped to keep down  carbon  dioxide\r\n\r\nemissions from these sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In power generation, new technology and greater efficiency\r\n\r\nin  generation  have meant more electricity being produced  from\r\n\r\nthe  same  unit  of fossil fuel.  As the use of natural  gas  in\r\n\r\nplace  of fuel oil can reduce carbon dioxide emission by  up  to\r\n\r\n25%,  we  are  planning  to  use  more  natural  gas  for  power\r\n\r\ngeneration in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much effort has also gone into improving energy use\r\n\r\nefficiency.   The Public Works Department has laid  down  energy\r\n\r\nconservation standards aimed at promoting energy-saving building\r\n\r\ndesigns.    The   Public   Utilities  Board   conducts   regular\r\n\r\neducational   programmes   and  training   courses   on   energy\r\n\r\nconservation.   It  also  conducts energy  audits  to  help  the\r\n\r\nindustrial and commercial sectors identify oppor-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntunities for energy efficiency improvements.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry, together with the Ministry of Finance, has introduced\r\n\r\na tax incentive scheme to encourage the corporate sector to\r\n\r\nreplace energy-inefficient equipment and to invest in energy-efficient technologies.  Thus far, nine companies have benefited\r\n\r\nfrom this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land transport sector, our vehicle ownership policy,\r\n\r\nin  combination with our very energy-efficient public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem, has moderated fuel consumption by motor vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, given that our\r\n\r\nGovernment's figures show a relatively lower emission per capita\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore, will our Government take steps to release  these\r\n\r\nfigures  widely  and  the efforts we are making,  especially  to\r\n\r\nrebut those who believe Singapore emits a much higher figure?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, the Ministry has been\r\n\r\nliaising  with  the  national  agency,  which  publishes  carbon\r\n\r\ndioxide emission figures, to point out the inaccuracies  in  the\r\n\r\nfigures for Singapore.  We have likewise given the facts to  our\r\n\r\nlocal  media.  I am quite sure the Member was referring to World\r\n\r\nWide Fund (WWF) for Nature where they put down ours as about  35\r\n\r\ntonnes  per capita, whereas ours is only 8.2, almost as good  as\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand.   So  we have corrected that  part  by  using  the\r\n\r\nstandard  accepted, ie, IPCC measurement.  And IPCC  measurement\r\n\r\nis a measurement recognised and accepted by all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister of State, if\r\n\r\nSingapore  is supportive of the Climate Change Convention,  what\r\n\r\nis  our position as regards adopting voluntary limits as a  more\r\n\r\nadvanced developed country?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, Singapore supports the UN\r\n\r\nFramework  Convention on Climate Change.   The  Kyoto  Protocol,\r\n\r\nunder the Convention, called for the industrialised countries to\r\n\r\nlimit their emission.  This does not include the industrialising\r\n\r\ncountry.

Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong)</b>\r\n\r\n<b>(for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, voting has been\r\n\r\nmade  compulsory  at  the  elections of  the  Singapore  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil  members under the Medical Registration Act 1997.   This\r\n\r\nis  because the Council, being the governing body of the medical\r\n\r\npractitioners,   must  represent  the  medical   profession   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In the past, when voting was voluntary,  only  about\r\n\r\n10%  to 15% of the eligible doctors voted.  Such a small turnout\r\n\r\ncannot   represent  the  entire  electorate  among  the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been made clear to all the doctors that those who\r\n\r\nare  not able to vote with a valid reason need only to write  in\r\n\r\nand  inform the Council.  The penalty for those who do not  vote\r\n\r\nand  who are unable to provide a valid reason is a fine of $500.\r\n\r\nI  believe doctors are responsible professionals and we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  resort to imposing the penalty.  In fact,  during  the\r\n\r\nrecent  election  conducted from 28th October  to  1st  November\r\n\r\n1998, more than 90% of the doctors voted.

But\r\n\r\nwe must also recognise that public transport vehicles do compete\r\n\r\nfor road space and contribute to traffic congestion.  As ERP  is\r\n\r\na  traffic management tool, it is not appropriate to exempt them\r\n\r\nor  reduce  the ERP rates for taxis relative to other  vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the buses are also paying the ERP charges depending on\r\n\r\nthe  size of the bus.  It has a pcu (passenger car unit) of two,\r\n\r\nso  the bus is actually paying two times the charges compared to\r\n\r\nprivate cars.  But of course, we are phasing in over four years.\r\n\r\nAnd  bus is a more efficient transport.

Taxis provide a  point-to-point\r\n\r\npersonalised  form  of  transport service  with  comfort  levels\r\n\r\ncomparable  to  that of cars and occupy the same road  space  as\r\n\r\ncars.

However, this arrangement was\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  Taxis  were  poorly  maintained.   There   were\r\n\r\nmalpractices  and abuses. And some owners of taxi licences  were\r\n\r\nnot  driving  but  hiring out their taxis to others  and  simply\r\n\r\ncollecting  rental.  Worse, syndicates emerged  to  control  and\r\n\r\nexploit taxi drivers.  The result was unreliable and unsafe taxi\r\n\r\nservices.  Commuters suffered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade taxi services, we have since 1975 issued new\r\n\r\ntaxi  licences only to bona fide taxi companies or organisations\r\n\r\nwhich  have  the resources and expertise to manage the  pool  of\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  fleet of taxis. As a result of this policy,  today\r\n\r\nthe  three  taxi companies, namely, Comfort, CityCab  and  TIBS,\r\n\r\noperate  a  combined fleet of 15,900 taxis.  Commuters  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nwide   range  of  services,  including  Premiere  Taxi  Service,\r\n\r\nMercedes  Cabs, London Cabs, Airport Direct and even Cab-Pooling\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new policy, anyone can obtain a taxi driver\r\n\r\nvocational licence from LTA and rent a taxi from one of the taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies.

One is that  those\r\n\r\nto whom licences were issued, individuals, ie, to operate taxis,\r\n\r\nhire them out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can you proceed with your\r\n\r\nquestion?  It is not necessary to repeat the answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is that not what the companies are doing?\r\n\r\nThey are hiring the taxis to the drivers.  Yes.  Are the drivers\r\n\r\nnot  paying  a hiring charge to the companies?  So what  is  the\r\n\r\ndifference?  The second is, the Minister says the Ministry found\r\n\r\nout  a  syndicate  was controlling and exploiting  the  drivers.\r\n\r\nWould you rather have the companies exploit the drivers?  May  I\r\n\r\nask:  is  one  of  the  reasons for  not  granting  licences  to\r\n\r\nindividuals to try and  stop taxi drivers from expressing  their\r\n\r\nopinion about the Government because I have been told more  than\r\n\r\nonce  that  one  of  the  NTUC rules is that  they  should  stop\r\n\r\ncriticising the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first\r\n\r\nquestion  is  about  comparison between the syndicates  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  listed companies.  There is no comparison.  How can  you\r\n\r\ncompare them?  The syndicates were out there to make profit  and\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  care about the welfare of the  drivers  and  the\r\n\r\nservices that the commuters would get.  It is precisely  because\r\n\r\nof  the  experience that we have seen in the past that  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  away  with  individual  licence  as  it  will  result   in\r\n\r\nmalpractices.   But the companies are different.  The  companies\r\n\r\ntoday provide investments.  For instance, they have spent a  lot\r\n\r\nof money on the satellite system to enable radio booking and the\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers actually receive the booking fee.\r\n\r\nLet  me just give the Member an illustration of how taxi-drivers\r\n\r\nare  being looked after by the companies.  I take Comfort as  an\r\n\r\nexample.   Today,  Comfort has about 18,000  drivers,  including\r\n\r\nrelief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrivers, and the average income of these drivers is\r\n\r\nabout $1,800 per month.  That means $32 million per month, and\r\n\r\nover a year it is $380 million.  Do you know how much the\r\n\r\ncompany earns for its shareholders?  $20 million over a year.\r\n\r\nThat is about 7% of what the taxi-drivers are getting, not to\r\n\r\nmention all the services that they put in place to benefit the\r\n\r\ncommuters and also the drivers, so that they can earn an easier\r\n\r\nliving.  Can a syndicate do such things?  Obviously, it is out\r\n\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second question about taxi-drivers, they are responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Of course, we have heard some of them, from  personal\r\n\r\nexperience, commenting on Government policies, but this is  part\r\n\r\nand parcel of their right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Sir, is there any plan\r\n\r\nby the Ministry to have more frequent dialogue sessions with the\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers  so that they could air their views  and  criticise\r\n\r\nthe policies of LTA?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Indeed, Sir.

If  we\r\n\r\nissue  licences to individuals, as I mentioned, you open up  all\r\n\r\nthese possible abuses.  We have done that in the past and  I  am\r\n\r\ntelling  the  Member that if we do that, we are  going  back  to\r\n\r\nthose old days, and that is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Ministry accept that a taxi-driver who is allowed to own his own taxi and to use it as he\r\n\r\nlikes  is running a road business of his own?  He owns the  taxi\r\n\r\nat  the end.  So what is wrong with that?  Why is the Government\r\n\r\nso  keen to kill all individual businesses that everyone  should\r\n\r\ngo  into a company?  Secondly, about these sessions that I  have\r\n\r\nheard,  are  taxi-drivers allowed to attend public meetings  and\r\n\r\nvoice their grievances not only about their conditions but about\r\n\r\nthe conditions that exist in Singapore for everyone?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  is  repeating the question about why  we  would  not\r\n\r\nallow  individual taxi-drivers to own their licence and  operate\r\n\r\ntheir  business.  As I said, if you were to compare the scenario\r\n\r\nthat  he  proposed  with  what is present  today,  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncomparison  because we have seen that once you allow individuals\r\n\r\nto  do  that, there would be people who say, \"You cannot  afford\r\n\r\nthe taxi, right?  Because you need to pay upfront all the costs,\r\n\r\nI  will finance you\".  Or, in fact, anybody could say, \"Look,  I\r\n\r\nwill  become the boss and take the taxi licence, and I will rent\r\n\r\nit to the taxi-drivers.\"  The whole problem will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nre-emerge.  Now, it is different, as we make sure\r\n\r\nthat only the bona fide companies with a track record or with\r\n\r\nability to run a good taxi service will be given the taxi\r\n\r\nlicence.  That is the difference.\r\n\r\nOn  his  second question, the taxi company would have to  manage\r\n\r\nits  pool of taxi-drivers according to the company's policy.

For example, Comfort spent $30 million for a satellite\r\n\r\nsystem  to enable phone booking.  They actually give the booking\r\n\r\nfee  to the taxi-drivers.  In other words, if you call a Comfort\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver, and you have to pay a booking fee, Comfort lets the\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver  keep a large part of  the booking fee to  encourage\r\n\r\nhim  to  take phone booking.

It  was  as  recent  as\r\n\r\nMay/June last year that we as a nation were collectively  seized\r\n\r\nwith  the competitive challenge posed by neighbouring and  other\r\n\r\neconomies.  Indeed, it was such considerations that led  to  the\r\n\r\nformation of the CSC.  Today, those thoughts seem rather  remote\r\n\r\nas  we  and  our neighbours grapple with the consequences  of  a\r\n\r\nprofound economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC report is a timely reminder that the fundamentals\r\n\r\nhave  not  changed.   As  the Minister has  mentioned,  regional\r\n\r\neconomies will emerge from the current economic crisis stronger,\r\n\r\nleaner   and  more  cost-effective.   Their  labour,  land   and\r\n\r\ncurrencies  will be cheaper.  As the Committee has observed,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  just  cost, but also our capability that will  underpin\r\n\r\nSingapore's   long   term   competitiveness   within   such   an\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key recommendation of the CSC is to reduce\r\n\r\ntotal wages by 15%.  Although a painful recommendation, I fully\r\n\r\nendorse this recommendation.  It is an essential step in\r\n\r\nrestoring Singapore's cost competitiveness.  This need is\r\n\r\nevident especially when we realise that even after this across-the-board reduction of costs, we will not fully offset the\r\n\r\nrelative strengthening of the Singapore dollar against regional\r\n\r\ncurrencies over the last 18 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a signal to the international business community\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  different.  It is a tribute to  the  strength  of\r\n\r\ntripartism  and  labour-management relations in  Singapore  that\r\n\r\nthis issue has been discussed extensively in recent months in  a\r\n\r\nsystematic,  cool and rational manner.  The CSC's recommendation\r\n\r\nand  the reasoned response of organised labour in Singapore must\r\n\r\nsurely  have distinguished and differentiated Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\neyes of global investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Singaporeans accept the need for wage\r\n\r\nreduction.  However, they feel that it should be done  equitably\r\n\r\nand  in  tandem with the introduction of measures  to  ease  the\r\n\r\nimpact.    For  instance,  the  wage  reduction  will   have   a\r\n\r\nsignificant impact on the ability of many to service their  home\r\n\r\nmortgages.  More than 100,000 Singaporeans use their entire  CPF\r\n\r\nfor  this  purpose  and  many  others  use  most  of  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsimilarly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowners are hopeful that Government will institute\r\n\r\nadequate measures to ease their burden.  One means would  be  to\r\n\r\nallow  them  to use contributions to the Special Account  for  a\r\n\r\nlimited  period to service their housing loan.  Another  measure\r\n\r\ncould  be the establishment of a bridging loan facility to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  in  both  public and  private  housing,  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by the CPF cut to tide over this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a view that the wage reduction should be\r\n\r\nprogressive.  The 15% figure should be taken as an average  with\r\n\r\nhigh income earners taking a proportionately higher wage cut and\r\n\r\na lower burden imposed on the rank and file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, many Singaporeans are looking to\r\n\r\nour political leaders to set the tone by taking a deeper cut\r\n\r\nthan that recommended by the CSC.  They readily concede that it\r\n\r\nis not necessarily an economically  rational response since the\r\n\r\nresultant cost saving will be insignificant in the overall\r\n\r\nscheme of things.  They also recognise that Ministers have\r\n\r\nalready forgone wage increases due to them this year.  However,\r\n\r\nit is an important emotional issue.  Knowing that our leaders\r\n\r\nare showing the way might make it a little easier to swallow the\r\n\r\nbitter pill in these hard times.  I would, therefore, urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider a deeper cut in wages for the political\r\n\r\nleadership (including MPs) and the higher echelons of the public\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, I wish to stress that wages in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should not only be flexible downwards but also,  when\r\n\r\nthe  time  is right, upwards.  This applies equally to  workers,\r\n\r\nsenior  civil  servants and Ministers.  When times  are  better,\r\n\r\nemployers  should  reinstate the wage cuts imposed  on  workers.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when the economic condition improves, the  wage  cuts\r\n\r\ntaken  by  our  Ministers and senior civil  servants  should  be\r\n\r\nreadily  restored without question, both within this  House  and\r\n\r\nwithout.  Just as we seek today a departure from the formula  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  pay of Ministers and senior civil  servants,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  equally  prepared to do so when the  time  comes  to\r\n\r\nrestore the cuts that they take voluntarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important recommendation of the CSC pertains to the need\r\n\r\nto  review the tax treatment of ESOPs  - Employee Stock Options.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose of ESOPs is to align employee's interests with that\r\n\r\nof  the  company.  As the company grows and its value increases,\r\n\r\nso  too will the value of its shares and the stock options  held\r\n\r\nby  its  employees.   Indeed, the longer  employees  hold  their\r\n\r\nESOPs,  or  their shares after the exercise of the options,  the\r\n\r\nbetter   for  the  company.   It  also  has  the  advantage   of\r\n\r\ndiminishing the incentive to job hop.  Indeed, Sir, this is  not\r\n\r\nan  uncommon  practice in places such as Silicon  Valley,  where\r\n\r\nfrom the receptionist to the CEO hold stock options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the current practice of taxing ESOPs at the\r\n\r\npoint of exercise as \"earned income\", rather than waiting for\r\n\r\nthe point at which the underlying shares are sold, creates a\r\n\r\nperverse incentive - the employee will probably sell his shares\r\n\r\nas soon as the option is exercised in order to realise his gains\r\n\r\nand pay his tax liability.  As we move into a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, intellectual resources, ie, our people, will become an\r\n\r\neven more important asset to companies.  In that context, ESOPs\r\n\r\nwill become an essential component of remuneration which today\r\n\r\ncomprises mainly the basic salary, flexible components and\r\n\r\nbonuses.  I would urge the Government to review the tax\r\n\r\ntreatment of ESOPs to make it more compatible with the knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy envisioned by the CSC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, a point from a social perspective. The\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the CSC make compelling business and economic\r\n\r\nsense.   Many  big  words like \"competitiveness\",  \"talent\"  and\r\n\r\n\"capability\"  have  been used.  But these  recommendations  will\r\n\r\nhave a profound impact on the lives of average Singaporeans, and\r\n\r\nalso  on  the work of CDCs and VWOs that serve the disadvantaged\r\n\r\nwithin our community.  We must address these social consequences\r\n\r\nespecially   because  social  cohesion  is  a  key   competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage for Singapore.  Families will find it difficult to pay\r\n\r\nthe bill for childcare, before-and-after-school-care, and maids.\r\n\r\nYet,  two  incomes have become an even more important  issue  in\r\n\r\nthis  economic climate.  I would urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nextending  further  assistance in this  regard  through  grants,\r\n\r\nrebates  and extending the reduction of the foreign worker  levy\r\n\r\nto  domestic maids, either as part of this exercise  or  in  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming FY99/2000 Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDCs and VWOs have also been hit by a double whammy. Their\r\n\r\nsources  of  funds, corporate and individual, are slowly  drying\r\n\r\nup.   Meanwhile, the demand for their services remains unchanged\r\n\r\nor  even rising in some instances.  This is especially the  case\r\n\r\nfor  those serving the economically disadvantaged.  I would urge\r\n\r\nthe   Government  to  consider  extending  additional  financial\r\n\r\nassistance to VWOs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDCs as a short term measure.  One formula could be\r\n\r\nto increase the matching grant from Government, although this\r\n\r\nmay not go far enough where even the basic seed money is hard to\r\n\r\ncome by in the first instance.  An alternative could be for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to set aside a fixed sum explicitly for this purpose.\r\n\r\nVWOs can then apply for additional grants and these can be\r\n\r\nassessed on the merits of each case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I conclude by thanking the Minister and his team for a\r\n\r\nvery comprehensive Report and I think this will now be tested in\r\n\r\nthe implementation and its speed of execution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Committee  on Singapore's Competitiveness  (CSC)  was\r\n\r\nestablished in May 1997, its original terms of reference  was to\r\n\r\nmap  out  a plan to enhance the competitiveness of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  intensifying competition  from  the  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  as well as the developed countries over the  next  10\r\n\r\nyears.   However, in July 1997,  the regional economy  began  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate.  Short-term measures to restore our competitiveness\r\n\r\nbecame  most  urgently  required.  As a  result,  when  the  CSC\r\n\r\npresented its  Report,  a major portion was devoted to solutions\r\n\r\nto  resolve the imminent economic crisis, such as the  reduction\r\n\r\nof  wage cost by 15%, reduction in foreign worker levy, lowering\r\n\r\nof  JTC/HDB  rentals,  electricity  tariffs,  telecommunications\r\n\r\ncost, port charges and vehicle taxes, etc.  Property tax rebates\r\n\r\nand  stamp  duty  exemption  are to  be  continued.   All  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  very timely and worthy of our support.   But  the\r\n\r\nReport  seems  to  overlook  the two following  areas:  (1)  the\r\n\r\npredicament  of shopowners and stallholders in the HDB  estates,\r\n\r\nand (2) the competitiveness of our retail industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first issue. The Report recommends a\r\n\r\n15%  reduction  in the total wage cost.  To big  companies  with\r\n\r\nmany employees, this is  an alleviation of their burden that may\r\n\r\nhelp to  restore their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  But to the retail shops and small-time stallholders who employ just a very few employees, many of\r\n\r\nwhom are their own family members, these cuts in employers' CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution and bonuses will not significantly reduce their\r\n\r\noperational cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business is bad for these shop-owners and stallholders\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  economic downturn, and they cannot  make  ends\r\n\r\nmeet.  Then, when these wage-cut measures are fully implemented,\r\n\r\nthe spending power of the general public will also shrink.  This\r\n\r\nwill  affect their business even more.  On the other hand,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to pay for their overheads and service their loans.   With\r\n\r\nless  income, they will find it difficult even to survive.   Not\r\n\r\ntoo  long ago, a stallholder who could not service his loan  was\r\n\r\nslapped with hefty interests by the finance company, and he  was\r\n\r\neven  taken  to  court.  This is a glaring example.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nhelping  these shop-owners and stall-holders by reviewing  their\r\n\r\ncost  to  tide  over these difficult times at the moment  is  of\r\n\r\nutmost  importance.  These small-time neighbourhood traders  are\r\n\r\nmostly  operating  in  the  HDB  estates.   Many  of  them  were\r\n\r\nencouraged  by  the Government's \"Shop For Everyone\"  scheme  to\r\n\r\npurchase their existing shops and stalls.  The majority of  them\r\n\r\ntook   loans  from banks or finance companies to  finance  their\r\n\r\npurchases  of  these  shops or stalls.   Now,  because  of  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness,  they are having problems with their cash-flows.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  keep  up with the instalment payments or  service  their\r\n\r\nloans.    As   an  adviser  to  the  Federation  of   Merchants'\r\n\r\nAssociation,  I  would appeal to the Government  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nbanks  and finance companies to reschedule the instalment  plans\r\n\r\nby  extending their repayment periods. This will help to lighten\r\n\r\nthe  burden of these people.  The Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nshould  also consider lowering the rentals so as to  help  these\r\n\r\npeople to tide over their difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is how to restore the competitiveness of\r\n\r\nour  retail  industry.   The retail industry  has  been  in  the\r\n\r\ndoldrums  for  quite a long time. With further deterioration  of\r\n\r\nthe regional economy, the retail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry has a very grim future.  Thailand and\r\n\r\nMalaysia have devalued their currencies by huge margins.  So to\r\n\r\nthe tourists, it is better and cheaper to shop there.  In\r\n\r\ncomparison, Singapore's retail industry is finding it more and\r\n\r\nmore difficult to attract tourists to come and shop here.  This\r\n\r\nwill affect our tourism industry directly.  Since tourism is one\r\n\r\nof the main pillars of the service industry, which is one of the\r\n\r\nmain items of concern in the CSC Report, how to help our retail\r\n\r\nindustry and tourist industry reduce their business cost is\r\n\r\ntherefore another important issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many departmental stores and supermarkets which employ large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of people, a cut of 15% of CPF and wage costs  together\r\n\r\nwill  effectively cut down their operational costs.  But to  the\r\n\r\nsmall shopkeepers in the shopping complexes, the effect will not\r\n\r\nbe  very significant. Another recommendation of the CSC is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should continue to grant the 55%  property  tax\r\n\r\nrebates.  With  its  implementation,  only  owners  of  shopping\r\n\r\ncentres  and complexes will benefit.  Some of them may  pass  on\r\n\r\nthe  savings to their tenants by reducing the rentals.  But, the\r\n\r\nvast  majority  of  property owners do not lower  their  rentals\r\n\r\nbecause  they  themselves  are also facing  financial  problems.\r\n\r\nAnother  way to further help the owners of shopping centres   is\r\n\r\nto  adjust  downwards  the net annual value  of  the  commercial\r\n\r\nproperties.   In  recent  years,  because  of   bad  times,  the\r\n\r\npressure to lower the shop rental is always there.  But  because\r\n\r\nthe net annual value has not been lowered,  they continue to pay\r\n\r\nvery  high  property tax.  So it is very difficult for  them  to\r\n\r\nlower  their  rental.  I hope that the authority concerned  will\r\n\r\nreview the net annual value of all the commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nproperties  soon.  If the property owners can have their  burden\r\n\r\nalleviated,  they will be in a position to lower  their  rental,\r\n\r\nand  the  tenants  will  also enjoy the benefit  of  some  cost-cutting.   In this way, they will be able to sell their goods or\r\n\r\nprovide  their  services at cheaper prices,  and  hence  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a great many of\r\n\r\nthose who have spoken, particularly coming from the Government\r\n\r\nranks, the PAP MPs, have all expressed immediately their support\r\n\r\nand enthusiasm for the Report of the Committee.  The two\r\n\r\nOpposition Members who spoke yesterday were less enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nI must say that, speaking for myself and for the Party, we do\r\n\r\nnot share the enthusiasm that has been shown for the Report of\r\n\r\nthe Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find this Report disappointing and discriminatory. Why do we\r\n\r\nsay disappointing?  There are several factors which prompt us to\r\n\r\nsay  that the Report is totally disappointing. One is the timing\r\n\r\nof  this  Report.   As the Report mentions, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  appear  to  have  announced his intention  to  appoint  a\r\n\r\ncommittee way back in November 1996.  Then it took him about six\r\n\r\nmonths  to  convene a Committee on Competitiveness in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  was in May 1997.  And we have a Report from this Committee\r\n\r\n17 months later - I understand the Deputy Prime Minister will be\r\n\r\nannouncing the measures the Government will implement -  but  we\r\n\r\nhave  yet  to hear what measures the Government will accept  and\r\n\r\nimplement.   I should have thought, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  these\r\n\r\nmeasures would have been announced before this debate,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Members in this House could then pronounce their  views  on\r\n\r\nthe  measures taken by the Government.  That is what  I  thought\r\n\r\nwas going to happen.  But clearly that was not the intention.\r\n\r\nAs  the Party's Member for Hougang said in his speech yesterday,\r\n\r\nthis  recession was foreseen.  I was talking to a bank  official\r\n\r\nsome days ago and he said  that the danger signals were seen  as\r\n\r\nearly  as  1996.   He  said it was quite evident  to  them  that\r\n\r\nSingapore was going into a recession.  And yet no measures  were\r\n\r\ntaken then to avert the crisis.  The Government prides itself  - and we have heard this so many times - that it does not wait for\r\n\r\nany crisis or problem to arise, it nips it in the bud.  But,  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular case, it does not appear to have shown the same\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  as  it has - of course, when it comes  to  political\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of prompt action was mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nHougang, as I said, yesterday and we heard from a PAP Member - or was it a Nominated Member - who did not seem to answer our\r\n\r\npoint at all.  He talked about chickens and the eggs.  Again, as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hougang pointed out, we had conflicting\r\n\r\nstatements from the Ministers about the crisis.  I remember,\r\n\r\nwhen I was proposing a number of measures, as far back as\r\n\r\nFebruary or the beginning of this year, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nand the others were saying that Singapore had not been badly\r\n\r\naffected and we would take the necessary measures when the\r\n\r\ncrisis hit us.  That is unlike, as I said, what the Government\r\n\r\nhas done when it came to taking mainly political action.  And,\r\n\r\nagain, it was in February of this year on my motion for the\r\n\r\nMinisters to give up 25% of their salaries to show their\r\n\r\nidentification with the people, when I said there were already\r\n\r\nindications that pay cuts were taking place.  The Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, in his reply, which was quoted by the Member for\r\n\r\nHougang, said that Singapore was still competitive.  There was\r\n\r\nno problem about Singapore's competitiveness.  And yet eight\r\n\r\nmonths later, we are told that Singapore is not competitive and\r\n\r\nwe have got to take the measures.  So were Ministers really not\r\n\r\naware of what was happening in Singapore?  Have they lost touch\r\n\r\nwith the conditions prevailing in Singapore?  Or were they just\r\n\r\nbeaming with their own over-confidence?  We heard the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister say in that speech how wonderful the Ministers\r\n\r\nhad managed Singapore's economy and their efforts had been\r\n\r\nlauded by people outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our first point of dissatisfaction is the timing and the\r\n\r\ndelay that has occurred in announcing the measures that would be\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as has been mentioned outside this House, the measures\r\n\r\nand  the  Report itself are not bold enough.  There  is  nothing\r\n\r\ninnovative.  There is nothing radical about any of the  measure.\r\n\r\nAnd  may I say that it is more or less a repetition of what  the\r\n\r\nCommittee in 1985\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor 1986 submitted, perhaps dressed up a bit more to\r\n\r\nmeet the present situation.  I wonder why that is so.  One\r\n\r\nsenses, reading the Report, that there was a concern in the\r\n\r\nCommittee not to tread on government toes and try to be as\r\n\r\nplacatory as possible to the Government in making their\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  Is that because we had two Cabinet Ministers\r\n\r\nsitting on top of the Members of the Committee listening to the\r\n\r\ndeliberations and commenting on anything they had to say?  Not\r\n\r\nonly did we have two Cabinet Ministers, we had another Minister.\r\n\r\nCould the Committee not have been left entirely to the private\r\n\r\nsector, people who we say are experts in the field, instead of\r\n\r\nhaving a political control over it?  This, again, is one of the\r\n\r\nfacts of life in Singapore, as has been mentioned, that\r\n\r\neverything in Singapore has to have a political master\r\n\r\noverseeing whatever is being done, even when it comes to playing\r\n\r\nfootball.  Is it not time that we trusted the private sector to\r\n\r\ndo its own work without overseeing how they do it and what\r\n\r\nrecommendations they will put up?  So that is another point of\r\n\r\nour dissatisfaction - that it is not bold enough, nothing\r\n\r\ninnovative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an assumption that our fundamentals are strong. This,\r\n\r\nof  course,  is  what  the  Ministers have  been  saying  -  our\r\n\r\nfundamentals  are strong, so there is nothing for us  to  worry.\r\n\r\nBut are they?  Is there any attempt made to question whether  we\r\n\r\nhave  got the correct fundamentals for our economy?  The  Report\r\n\r\nsuggests that perhaps we do not have the fundamentals, but  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  go  far enough to point out what exactly is strong  and\r\n\r\nwhat should be done about it.  Mr Chiam referred to paragraph 29\r\n\r\nof  the  Report, the Executive Summary, and I do not propose  to\r\n\r\nread  it.  But the Committee stresses the need for Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  an open cosmopolitan society and for the need for a critical\r\n\r\nmass  of  Singaporeans who are risk-taking entrepreneurs.   They\r\n\r\nsay  about  the  need for Singapore to be an  open  cosmopolitan\r\n\r\nsociety.  This is what we in the Workers' Party have been saying\r\n\r\nfor  many years that Singapore needs to be an open society.   It\r\n\r\nis good for business.  It is good for the economy of the country\r\n\r\nand it is good for our people.  But are we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan open society?  The Committee does not appear to\r\n\r\nanswer that question.  They should have, and they should have\r\n\r\nsuggested what was wrong with the society at the moment today.\r\n\r\nDo we have a critical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you want Singaporeans to be critical,\r\n\r\nit must follow quite clearly that you have got to encourage them\r\n\r\nto  ask  questions.  They should be encouraged to  enquire  into\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening in Singapore and get the  answers  to  those\r\n\r\nquestions.  That is not happening in Singapore simply because we\r\n\r\nare  not an open society.  We take the attitude that the affairs\r\n\r\nof  the  country  do not concern the people.   It  is  only  the\r\n\r\nconcern of the Government and we should just trust them and they\r\n\r\nwould  deliver  the goods.  Some goods they have delivered.   So\r\n\r\nclearly, we do not have an open society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they talk about human intellectual capital being the\r\n\r\nkey  to  competitiveness.   It is in  page  81  of  the  Report,\r\n\r\nparagraph   3.a.,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.   They  say   that   human\r\n\r\nintellectual  capital  is  the key  competitive  edge  and  they\r\n\r\npropose reviewing the education curriculum, examination and  the\r\n\r\nschool  ranking systems to help foster creative thinking and  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit among the young.  They continue with this\r\n\r\nquestion of the education in Singapore in page 86 of the Report,\r\n\r\nparagraph  11,  where  they say \"The content  of  the  education\r\n\r\ncurriculum should help to prepare the young for the workplace of\r\n\r\nthe 21st century.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in the Workers' Party, - and I have to repeat this because I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  to  the  Ministers that  they  should  read  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party's manifesto - have been urging a complete  review\r\n\r\nof  the education system in Singapore today.  This was way  back\r\n\r\nin  1988.  I am glad to see that the Committee thinks that there\r\n\r\nshould be a review.  And further on, they talk about the content\r\n\r\nbeing  reviewed and not teaching our children to be  parrot-like\r\n\r\nand regurgitate what they have been told.  We have to start,  if\r\n\r\nyou really mean to be economically progressive, with our young\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople who are going to take over and the spirit of\r\n\r\nenquiry must be started there.  Do we have it?  The answer is\r\n\r\nclearly no.  The Committee has admitted that it should not be\r\n\r\nregurgitating what they have just been told.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the university level, do we encourage and\r\n\r\nactively urge an inquiring spirit among the university students?\r\n\r\nOr  do  we  sit on them and confine their learning to  just  the\r\n\r\nsubjects  for  which they have come to university to  get  their\r\n\r\ndegree?   So we do not have those fundamentals.  There  is  also\r\n\r\nthe  cost of education.  I see that in page 91, paragraph 35.b.,\r\n\r\nin  commenting  on  the need for foreign talent,  the  Committee\r\n\r\nrecommends  that  the Government reduce the cost  of  children's\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore by ensuring an adequate supply  of  land\r\n\r\nfor  international schools.  Here, of course, they  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout the children of the foreigners working in Singapore.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  about reducing the costs for our own children,   something\r\n\r\nwhich  we,  in the Workers' Party, have been urging?   It  is  a\r\n\r\nburden for families who are not earning enough to provide proper\r\n\r\neducation.   It  is  a  burden for  them  to  provide  a  proper\r\n\r\neducation  that their children need and the schools,  which  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  and  the  content  are  not  doing.   So  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider this?  I will, at the end of my speech,  put\r\n\r\nforward the Workers' Party's proposals and I will have something\r\n\r\nto say then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of dissatisfaction is that there is really no\r\n\r\nevaluation  of what went wrong in Singapore.  We of course  know\r\n\r\nthat  it was precipitated and perhaps aggravated by the regional\r\n\r\ncrisis.   But was there nothing wrong with the way that we  were\r\n\r\nconducting  or  managing our economy?  There was no  attempt  to\r\n\r\nexamine  in  this Committee's Report the role of  the  GLCs  and\r\n\r\ntheir  management.  We know that over the last  few  years,  the\r\n\r\nGLCs have lost a lot of money that belongs to us, the taxpayers.\r\n\r\nAnd,   yet,   there   has   been  no   proper   examination   on\r\n\r\naccountability.  The GLCs have not been made accountable to this\r\n\r\nHouse on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecisions that they have taken and why they have\r\n\r\nlost monies.  And we are talking about public monies, not their\r\n\r\nown monies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So should we not rethink about the role of GLCs? And I have\r\n\r\nalso  heard  that the GLCs, because of the fact  that  they  are\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked,  enjoy  an  unfair  advantage.    Should   we\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  that?  Are we providing an even  field  for  the\r\n\r\nconduct of businesses in Singapore?  Or are we giving an  unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage  to  the Government companies?  But, more importantly,\r\n\r\nwhat  is needed in Singapore more than anything else is openness\r\n\r\nand  accountability and we are not getting that from  the  GLCs.\r\n\r\nIf  you go to the Registry of Companies to seek information, you\r\n\r\nare told, \"Well, this is not public.  You cannot look at it.  If\r\n\r\nyou  tell  us what good reasons you have we can perhaps consider\r\n\r\nit.\"   The  activities of the GLCs in their  various  businesses\r\n\r\nshould be made public as much as possible and not kept a secret.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is nothing about the Government policies that might\r\n\r\nhave  contributed to the recession.  Why is no attempt  made  to\r\n\r\nexamine  whether the Government in its policies may have perhaps\r\n\r\ncontributed to the recession?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this recession was foreseen\r\n\r\nway back in 1996 by people outside.  The Government not only did\r\n\r\nnot take any attempt to correct anything that was wrong, but  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that  they were more interested  in  winning  the\r\n\r\nelections that were going to come on over the next one  year  or\r\n\r\nafter  that.   So,  we heard a lot about the  asset  enhancement\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  the Government.  That was their bonanza  for  the\r\n\r\nvoters  to vote in the PAP Members into Parliament so  that  the\r\n\r\nPAP  would continue in power.  And along with that, as  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  programme,  there was the liberalisation for  purchases  of\r\n\r\nproperties, particularly, HDB.  What was the result of all that?\r\n\r\nIt  boosted  prices,  making land cost becoming  more  and  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for the companies and those who are doing  businesses\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It boosted the rentals.  Yet no attempt was made\r\n\r\nin this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport to point to that and, as I said, is it\r\n\r\nbecause we had Ministers sitting on the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was glad to see, Mr Speaker, Sir, that after the Report\r\n\r\nwas   released,  the  manufacturing  sub-committee  in  a  press\r\n\r\nconference  was a little bolder.  This sub-committee  said  that\r\n\r\nthey  would like to see the Government contribute more than  30%\r\n\r\nof  the package and they would like to see the Government use up\r\n\r\nthe  surpluses  from the statutory boards to help  overcome  the\r\n\r\nrecession.   Maybe without the Ministers sitting next  to  them,\r\n\r\nthey were bold enough to come up with those statements.\r\n\r\nFinally,  another  disappointing aspect of the  Report  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  is not enough data, not enough information given in  this\r\n\r\nReport  on  how  they  have  arrived at  their  conclusions  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   Mr Speaker, Sir, in an  attempt  to  try  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  recommendations and to make some  suggestions\r\n\r\nhere,  I  wrote to the Ministry of Finance and the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower to ask for certain information.  Did I get it?   Not  a\r\n\r\nword, I have not heard from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the open society that we are proclaiming ourselves to\r\n\r\nbe?   But  what I am saying is that this Report does not contain\r\n\r\nthe information and data on which they base their conclusions in\r\n\r\nmaking   recommendations,  particularly  on   the   cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures.  There is the suggestion that there should be some cut\r\n\r\nin  the  utilities  rates,  electricity and  telecommunications.\r\n\r\nThey  have not tried to answer the question or have they  sought\r\n\r\nan  answer to the question why in spite of fuel prices  falling,\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs have not gone down.  At one time, the reason\r\n\r\ngiven was that the Singapore dollar was weak and that offset the\r\n\r\nfalling  prices.   But now, as I understand  it,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar has strengthened against the US dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  motion standing in the name of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to touch on the point on what this\r\n\r\nCSC Report is all about.  Put in a very simple language, imagine\r\n\r\ntwo  persons walking in a jungle and all of a sudden, they heard\r\n\r\nthat  the tiger is coming up on them.  One of them bent down  to\r\n\r\ntighten  his  shoelace.  The other person says,  \"What  are  you\r\n\r\ntrying to do?\"  He says, \"Obvious.  I am getting ready to  run.\"\r\n\r\nThis  other person says, \"You must be crazy.  You think you  can\r\n\r\noutrun  the tiger?\"  The guy says, \"No, I do not think so.   But\r\n\r\nall I need to do is to outrun you.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the point here is that we live in a world\r\n\r\nof  jungle.  Competition is everywhere and in this jungle, there\r\n\r\nare  many  tigers  -  the  tiger  of  recession,  the  tiger  of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  and  the  tiger  of  retrenchment,  and  so   on.\r\n\r\nBasically, what the CSC Report is all about is to get  Singapore\r\n\r\nrunning faster than our competitors so that we do not have to be\r\n\r\nbeaten  up  by these tigers around us.  But it is  not  easy  to\r\n\r\nstart  running because it is painful and stressful.  Some  would\r\n\r\nsay,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why run?  I do not see any tiger, I do not see\r\n\r\nunemployment in Singapore.\"  Then some will say, \"Before we\r\n\r\nstart running, we need to start fighting among ourselves first.\r\n\r\nLet us go for political reform so that we will all  loosen up\r\n\r\nand could run even faster.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that all these suggestions are not\r\n\r\nconstructive.  Some would even ask, \"Before we start running, we\r\n\r\nshould ask ourselves how come we end up in the jungle.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe Government is wrong because they should not have led us into\r\n\r\nthe  jungle.\"  Worse still, they say, \"This Government, how come\r\n\r\nthey did not have the foresight to tell us in advance that there\r\n\r\nare tigers in the jungle.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put it this way. This is the worst crisis that this\r\n\r\nworld  has  seen  in  the  last 50 years.   The  world  economic\r\n\r\nexperts,  up  to  today, no one dares to  say  that  they  could\r\n\r\nforesee  the arrival of this recession.  When the NCMP mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  a private banker told him in 1996 that he saw exactly what\r\n\r\nwas  coming, I was shocked.  Perhaps the banker should  come  to\r\n\r\nthe  open to explain to the world how did he in 1996 foresee the\r\n\r\nregional  crisis was coming and that Singapore was  heading  for\r\n\r\nrecession  in  1998.  Because that could win him a Nobel  Prize.\r\n\r\nSome  would say that, \"If we have to run, why not you run  first\r\n\r\nbecause  I am not convinced that we have to run.\"  For  example,\r\n\r\nif the Ministers do not take a pay cut, how can you expect us to\r\n\r\ntake  a pay cut?  Again, we forget that the Ministers have  been\r\n\r\nleading by example all these years.  We forget that in 1997 when\r\n\r\nall  of us were enjoying pay increase, the Ministers took a  pay\r\n\r\ncut of 2.5%.  We forget that in the first half of 1998, when the\r\n\r\nsituation  was still all right, when we were talking about  wage\r\n\r\nrestraint, when workers were getting 2% to 4% of wage  increase,\r\n\r\nthe Ministers took the lead for a wage freeze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, none of us in the labour movement has stood up to urge the\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders to take pay cut first because  we  have  full\r\n\r\nfaith  and trust in this Government.  We know that the Ministers\r\n\r\nwould take the lead in taking a bigger pay cut, not because  the\r\n\r\nopposition MPs have asked for it nor the labour movement has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressed for it but because our leaders know what to\r\n\r\ndo.  They always believe in doing the right things and we know\r\n\r\nthey will never disappoint us.  Therefore, there is no need for\r\n\r\nanyone of us to come up to claim credit should the Ministers\r\n\r\ndecide to take a deeper pay cut because the recognition should\r\n\r\nbe given to the Ministers for their leadership by example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point that Ministers have not been doing their job\r\n\r\nin looking ahead into the future, as a result, we have to take a\r\n\r\nwage  cut today.  The message seems to imply that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  not been doing the job well.  Speaking as a member  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement,  we  do not think so.  Just  think  about  it.\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy is one of the most open in the world.  About\r\n\r\n70%  of  our demand here is externally driven.  By right,  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  like this, the Singapore economy should be worst hit  than\r\n\r\nmany  other economies because we are so externally driven.   And\r\n\r\nyet   look  at  what  has  happened   in  Hong  Kong   -5%   GDP\r\n\r\n(contraction),  Malaysia, -5%; Korea, -6%;  Thailand,  -8%;  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, -13%.  What about Singapore?  This year, we are still\r\n\r\ntalking  about 0.5% to 1% growth.  The reason why  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nable  to  be in such a good position today relative to  all  the\r\n\r\nother economies is because our  Government has been able to look\r\n\r\nahead  and  make  sure good governance and public  policies  are\r\n\r\nalways in place.  As  a result, our workers today do not have to\r\n\r\nsuffer the kind of pain that many of our fellow workers in other\r\n\r\ncountries and economies are suffering today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as far as the labour movement is concerned, we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that there is nothing fundamentally wrong in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing fundamentally wrong with our workers, companies\r\n\r\nor the Government.  Let us accept that we want to run because we\r\n\r\nwant to run faster than all other competitors so that we will be\r\n\r\nable to return to full employment in the nearest future and  all\r\n\r\nour  workers  who are able and willing to work can  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy good employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I want to emphasise the point that the\r\n\r\nCSC Report is not just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout cost-cutting.  In the last few weeks, if you\r\n\r\nhad listened to radio talkshows, it is not surprising that quite\r\n\r\na number of the callers who called up the radio talkshows\r\n\r\nreferred to the CSC as the \"Cost Committee\".  In fact, CSC is\r\n\r\nbeing referred by many people as a \"Cost Committee\".  It is not.\r\n\r\nThe CSC is not a Cost Committee.  It is a Committee on\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness.  The key word is \"competitiveness\".  The CSC is\r\n\r\nnot about making Singapore cheaper all the time.  It is about\r\n\r\nmaking Singapore better all the time.  Mr Jeyaretnam said that\r\n\r\nthis Report is not bold enough.  He says that we need to have\r\n\r\nmore social reforms.  Yesterday, Mr Chiam See Tong said that we\r\n\r\nshould have political reform.  The CSC is not about political or\r\n\r\nsocial reform, but about economic reform.  Here we are talking\r\n\r\nabout moving towards a knowledge economy.  For anybody who knows\r\n\r\nsomething about economic development, he will recognise the\r\n\r\nboldness contained in this Report.  In fact, many countries are\r\n\r\namazed that Singapore is able to look 5 to 10 years ahead even\r\n\r\nat a time of economic downturn and aim to come up stronger and\r\n\r\nmore competitive.  In that regard, as Singaporeans, we can all\r\n\r\nbe proud of this bold vision in the CSC report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that CSC is a bold report on economic reform, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to highlight that we must be aware that we must  not\r\n\r\npursue  economic  competitiveness as an end in  itself.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that as we pursue economic competitiveness, we do  not\r\n\r\nachieve  it at the expense of social cohesion.  If I may  relate\r\n\r\nanother  story.   A  group of people come together  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhousing  estate and the leader told them, \"Let us make this  the\r\n\r\nbest  housing estate we have ever built.  Give it our very  best\r\n\r\nand make it an estate we can all be proud of.\"  The workers were\r\n\r\nexcited  and everyone started to work.  But along  the  way,   a\r\n\r\nsmall group of people in the team decided that things were going\r\n\r\ntoo  nicely and they should have some excitement.  So they  went\r\n\r\naround talking to the workers.  They asked, \"Why do you work  so\r\n\r\nhard?  We can build this to be the best housing estate.  At  the\r\n\r\nend of the day, it will fetch higher prices and the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho move in would enjoy a beautiful home.  But what\r\n\r\nwill happen to us?  We will just move on to build another\r\n\r\nhousing estate.\"  Over time, the workers lost heart.  The\r\n\r\ncarpenter started to take it easy on the carpentry work.  The\r\n\r\none who laid the tiles took it easy and as a result, workmanship\r\n\r\nbecame very shoddy.  By the time the housing estate was\r\n\r\ncompleted, the workers packed up and were ready to move on to\r\n\r\nthe next housing estate project.  The leader came with a bunch\r\n\r\nof keys in  his hands.  He asked the workers to line up and he\r\n\r\ngave each and everyone a key.  The workers asked, \"Boss, what is\r\n\r\nthis all about?\"  The leader said, \"Remember, when we first\r\n\r\nstarted this project, I urged you to give your very best to\r\n\r\nbuild the best housing estate that we have ever built.  Why?\r\n\r\nBecause this is going to be our home and everyone of you would\r\n\r\nbe given a unit for free.\"  It came as a shock to the workers.\r\n\r\nHow they wished they had put in their very best in building this\r\n\r\nhousing estate.  Now, they have to live with whatever mistakes\r\n\r\nor lousy workmanship that they have put in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the point here. We are talking about\r\n\r\nbuilding  Singapore  as our home.  When we talk  about  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and social cohesion, we must always remember that we\r\n\r\nare  not  building this home for anybody else.  We are  building\r\n\r\nthis home for ourselves and our children.  Therefore, it is with\r\n\r\ngreat disappointment, speaking as a Member of this House, to see\r\n\r\nsome  Members here adopting a partisan approach in debating this\r\n\r\nmotion.   This CSC Report is not a PAP report.  It is  a  report\r\n\r\nformulated by Singaporeans and friends of  Singapore.  There are\r\n\r\nmany  foreigners  who are not Singaporeans but  they  share  the\r\n\r\ncommitment  and  contributed  their  ideas  and  efforts.   Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  as  friends of Singapore, they want  to  see  Singapore\r\n\r\nwell.  Many people work together very hard to come out with this\r\n\r\nReport.  And to see a Member coming to this House to talk  about\r\n\r\nPAP  Government versus Workers' Party and so on, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nwith great sadness that I have to hear what he has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singaporeans, let us be aware that it is\r\n\r\nimportant for us to work together to sustain our economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  But equally, if not more important, is that as\r\n\r\nwe implement the recommendations of this Report, let us not\r\n\r\nweaken social cohesion.  Therefore, as a Labour MP, I call on\r\n\r\nthe employers to stop calling for more cuts, because a 15% cut\r\n\r\nin business costs is already a significant achievement that\r\n\r\nSingapore can achieve.  Ask a businessman, in all the other\r\n\r\ncountries, are they able to secure the support of Government of\r\n\r\nthe labour movement to go for a 15% cut?  Are they able to\r\n\r\nsecure the to lower business costs by 15%?  So be thankful for\r\n\r\nwhat we are able to achieve as a nation.  Let us move on.  As\r\n\r\nemployers, do not ask whether 15% cut is enough, but rather ask\r\n\r\nyourself what more can we do so that we can be more productive,\r\n\r\nwe can be more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is today, there is already some sign of social tension\r\n\r\nbetween the local workers and the foreign workers, between young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and older Singaporeans.  There is even  talk  that\r\n\r\nmaybe  we should defer the extension of retirement age, so  that\r\n\r\nthe  older Singaporeans can retire next year, instead of working\r\n\r\nbeyond 60 so that their jobs can be taken by young Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThere is also talk about stopping foreign workers from coming so\r\n\r\nthat the retrenched Singaporean workers can fill these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we allow these issues to be taken out of context, we are\r\n\r\ngoing to end up worse off all round, because two years from now,\r\n\r\nthree  years  from now, yes, we may be able to regain  our  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, but in terms of social cohesion,  we  may  have\r\n\r\ncreated the social tension that will take a long time for us  to\r\n\r\nmend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue now must be to recognise that we are in a much\r\n\r\nbetter position than anybody else, but we do not wait for things\r\n\r\nto   turn  worse  before  we  take  action.   There  are  enough\r\n\r\nopportunities for everyone.  What is more important  at  a  time\r\n\r\nlike  this  is  for us to work together, be consistent,  send  a\r\n\r\nclear  message  to all Singaporeans that there  is  no  painless\r\n\r\nsolution  today.  The severity of the crisis is that it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible now to look for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npainless solutions.  So employers, give up the idea\r\n\r\nof a painless solution.  No way can we cut wages by 30%, CPF by\r\n\r\n25%.  No way.   Just accept it and let us put our minds together\r\n\r\nand move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, our workers, do not pretend that life can go on as\r\n\r\nusual.   As we move towards a knowledge economy, we must upgrade\r\n\r\nour  skills.   Likewise from the angle of the national  economy,\r\n\r\nall  Government  agencies  have to  speed  up  their  effort  to\r\n\r\nreposition  the economy.  Basically, we are down to these  three\r\n\r\npoints:  skill  redevelopment  for  the  workers,  business  re-engineering  for the business enterprises and re-positioning  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  towards a knowledge economy.  If we can  do  that,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think  all of us can work together to create  a  better\r\n\r\nfuture,  one that all Singaporeans can be proud of in  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport   the   Report   of   the   Committee   on   Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness.   The  strategies  and  policies  proposed  are\r\n\r\ntimely  and  much  needed  as  we  can  now  capitalise  on  our\r\n\r\nstrengths, review our weaknesses so as to ride out the  economic\r\n\r\nstorm  and  emerge  leaner, stronger and  better  positioned  to\r\n\r\nengage the global economy on a higher platform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been argued that the proposed reductions in our\r\n\r\ncosts  may  not go far enough to offset the impact  of  currency\r\n\r\nrealignments  that  have  taken place since  the  onset  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.  Between June 1997 and November this year,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Dollar has depreciated by about 15%.   This  compares\r\n\r\nwith  a devaluation of 72% of the Indonesian Rupiah, 36% of  the\r\n\r\nThai Baht and 35% of the Malaysian Ringgit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthwhile to note that Singapore does not need to close\r\n\r\nthis  currency  gap completely to remain competitive.   We  have\r\n\r\nsuperior  qualitative advantages and strengths that far outweigh\r\n\r\nthe absolute cost differences with our competitors.  Indeed,  we\r\n\r\nhave just been ranked No. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness City in Asia by Fortune magazine, above\r\n\r\nTaiwan and Hong Kong and have received consistent top ranking by\r\n\r\nPERC (Political Economic Risk Consultancy).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in this mammoth exercise to review our competitiveness,\r\n\r\nwe should not only focus on the quantitative aspects.  We should\r\n\r\nalso   take   steps  to  remind  ourselves  and  reinforce   the\r\n\r\nqualitative    aspects    that   contribute    to    Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  These aspects include the benefits of a stable\r\n\r\npolitical   environment,  non-corrupt  government,  a   positive\r\n\r\nbusiness climate, excellent infrastructure, highly educated  and\r\n\r\nskilled  workforce, conducive industrial relations,  racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious harmony and social cohesion.   This year, we have been\r\n\r\nconfronted  with the images of rioting, mass rapes,  destruction\r\n\r\nof  property,  with  a disturbing racially  motivated  slant  to\r\n\r\nviolence amongst our neighbours.  Sunday's religious clashes  in\r\n\r\nJakarta serve as a grim reminder.  These are some of the results\r\n\r\nof  endemic  corruption  which have accentuated  inequality  and\r\n\r\npoverty,  and precipitated the social and political  instability\r\n\r\nthat is plaguing many countries now.  The results are a loss  of\r\n\r\nlife and the destruction to property, elimination of decades  of\r\n\r\neconomic growth and wealth creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it therefore necessary that in this exercise, we should\r\n\r\nremind  ourselves  of  the  need for political  stability,  non-corrupt  government,  racial and religious  harmony  and  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.   We cannot afford to be complacent.  Indeed,  a  pre-requisite to our economic achievements in the future must be the\r\n\r\nneed  to  strengthen these institutions  institutions  that  are\r\n\r\nfundamental to these intangible qualities in our effort to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  more competitive and attractive to investors.   These\r\n\r\ninclude, amongst others, our transparent and efficient legal and\r\n\r\npolitical  system, a pro-business environment led by  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  like  the  EDB,  and  our meritocracy,  compared  with\r\n\r\ncorruption, cronyism and nepotism which characterise some of our\r\n\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and evolution of intermediate civil\r\n\r\ninstitutions like the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and\r\n\r\nmore public forum such as the Singapore 21 Committee and other\r\n\r\nfeedback mechanisms would also serve to forge unity, nationhood\r\n\r\nand consensus.  This process of consensus and consultation must\r\n\r\ncontinue to be a fundamental part of our strategy and policy for\r\n\r\nthe next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unique to our success is the close cooperation between our\r\n\r\nunions,  the employers and the Government which is a  remarkable\r\n\r\ncompetitive strength and advantage.  In the next millennium,  we\r\n\r\nmust  strive  to further strengthen this tripartite relationship\r\n\r\nwhich  has  presented Singapore as a stable,  pragmatic  country\r\n\r\nwith   an  efficient  workforce  to  attract  global  MNCs   and\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on some of the qualitative\r\n\r\ncompetitive  aspects  of our workforce.   We  have  mainly  been\r\n\r\nlooking  at  costs and skills, which I consider to  be  hardware\r\n\r\nitems.    Critical to a competitive workforce are  the  software\r\n\r\nitems  as well.  We should take the opportunity in this downturn\r\n\r\nto  address the work attitude of Singaporeans which is  critical\r\n\r\nfor us to succeed in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time that we considered reducing our dependence on\r\n\r\nforeign labour, as in reality not all Singaporeans will be  able\r\n\r\nto  climb  the skill ladder.  Some foreign workers, particularly\r\n\r\nunskilled ones, contribute to numerous social problems.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore   in   our  interest  to  encourage  more   and   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to undertake jobs that are shunned by the  majority\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans, as being \"low-class\" jobs.  Jobs  like  maids,\r\n\r\nconservancy cleaners, construction workers, etc.  We must change\r\n\r\nthe  work attitude of Singaporeans to take on these jobs  as  we\r\n\r\nhave to cater to those workers in the 40-60 age group who simply\r\n\r\ncannot be upgraded as they have less than basic education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other aspects in our workforce which can be improved.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have to be nurtured to be more tolerant of  failure\r\n\r\nand be less risk averse.  The ability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto accept failure and take risks is critical in\r\n\r\nforming our attitudes in society towards the perception of jobs\r\n\r\nand towards alternative careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should shift from a more materialistic evaluation of\r\n\r\nwork  to a standard where the pursuit of unconventional careers,\r\n\r\nnew  business,  or  even what is perceived to  be  a  less  than\r\n\r\ndesirable job choice, becomes acceptable and even commendable in\r\n\r\nour  society.  We should focus not just only on earning  a  good\r\n\r\nincome  but  on  the right job match and an improvement  in  the\r\n\r\noverall  quality of life.  The Singaporean worker has to  change\r\n\r\nhis attitude from being a  functionary in the system for a fixed\r\n\r\nsalary, to one that genuinely takes an interest and pride in the\r\n\r\nwork he produces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has an important bearing on labour productivity and will\r\n\r\nenable  the  Singapore worker to gain a significant  competitive\r\n\r\nedge,  which wage cuts and skills upgrading alone cannot address\r\n\r\ncompletely.   We need to emphasise this qualitative aspect  that\r\n\r\nis  fundamental to our competitiveness as well.  And it  is  for\r\n\r\nthis reason that I strongly support the call for employees to be\r\n\r\ntreated as stakeholders of companies and for the employee  share\r\n\r\noption  scheme to be liberalised to encourage more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto be shareholders of the companies in which they work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to caution that in our haste to cut costs, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  also consider adequate compensating factors to  offset\r\n\r\nthe  corresponding declines in disposable income.   This  is  to\r\n\r\navoid  a  self-fulfilling deepening of the economic downturn  as\r\n\r\nconsumption shrinks, affecting our domestic economic  activities\r\n\r\nand asset values, as families adjust to wage cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perils of deflation are quite evident in the Japanese\r\n\r\neconomy, for instance, where the government has had to embark on\r\n\r\nradical   steps  to  stimulate  consumption  after  a  prolonged\r\n\r\nstagnation,  as  even  negative real interest  rates  failed  to\r\n\r\ngenerate demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Government, as we implement the cost\r\n\r\ncutting exercise, to consider and implement corresponding\r\n\r\nmeasures that may prevent a severe recession that would result\r\n\r\nif consumption falls.  We should have adequate additional,\r\n\r\neither on-budget or off-budget, measures to boost confidence and\r\n\r\nto avoid by default a deflationary spiral in asset values and\r\n\r\ndomestic business activities, as Singaporeans in the next few\r\n\r\nmonths tighten their belts whether out of sheer need or\r\n\r\nkiasuness.  The savings that the Government has from a reduction\r\n\r\nin the wage bill for the public sector should be passed on to\r\n\r\ngenerate economic activities and to boost domestic demand.  As\r\n\r\nour workers accept the bold step of wage cuts, the Government\r\n\r\ncould equally be bold in cutting costs to the individuals as\r\n\r\nwell, such as lower transportation costs, lower petrol taxes,\r\n\r\nhigher income tax rebates, amongst others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in line with the call by the Feedback Unit, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  that private sector companies, corporations  and\r\n\r\nemployers pass whatever savings they have arising from wage cuts\r\n\r\nto consumers by way of lower prices of their goods and services.\r\n\r\nHere,   I   would  like  to  commend  the  big  local  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in taking the lead by rescheduling mortgage  loans\r\n\r\nand  lowering interest costs and the NTUC Fairprice by  lowering\r\n\r\nprices  of  essential food items.  More corporate bodies  should\r\n\r\nfollow  the example.  This is necessary so that the real  impact\r\n\r\nof  wage cuts can be mitigated, and we can move down to  a  more\r\n\r\ncost competitive economic structure without necessitating a real\r\n\r\ndecline  in  disposable  income and threatening  a  deflationary\r\n\r\nspiral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Report has given us directions to remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  or to be more competitive in the next  millennium.\r\n\r\nBut  we  must not be complacent.  It does not mean that it  will\r\n\r\nget  us  out  of the current recession immediately.   There  are\r\n\r\nstill  too  many variables outside our control.   Prospects  for\r\n\r\nnext year remain uncertain.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould like to paint an extremely gloomy but still\r\n\r\nprobable scenario, and that is the devaluation of the Chinese\r\n\r\nrenminbi coupled by failures to revive the Japanese economy and\r\n\r\na recession in Latin America and its consequential impact on\r\n\r\nEurope and the United States.  The Chinese economy is undergoing\r\n\r\nsevere stresses since the onset of the economic crisis.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe Chinese have undershot their growth target of 8% for the\r\n\r\nfirst nine months of this year, and even the 7.2% GDP growth\r\n\r\nfigure is estimated to be an overstatement of the real economy\r\n\r\nwhich is plagued by weak financial institutions and huge excess\r\n\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial crisis that is now destabilising Japan and\r\n\r\nLatin  America may knock on the doors of Europe and  the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  plunge  the  world  economy into  a  severe  recession,\r\n\r\nprecipitated by a devaluation of the Chinese renminbi next year.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, Sir, it would appear that the direct cost cuts\r\n\r\nrecommended  by the CSC may not be enough to offset the  adverse\r\n\r\neffects  of  another  round  of  currency  devaluations  by  our\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  Overnight, the proposed 15% cost cuts may be  lost\r\n\r\nin  the  midst  of  such a scenario, further dragging  down  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   If  such a scenario occurs, we may  have  to  further\r\n\r\nreview and cut our costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not mean to be unduly pessimistic or gloomy. The\r\n\r\nscenario I have just painted appears a likely one, as recent  as\r\n\r\ntwo to three months ago.  But events that have occurred recently\r\n\r\nhave changed the scenario a bit and the outlook today looks less\r\n\r\npessimistic.  It is still not optimistic.  But we should not  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent.   We should continue to prepare for  the  worst  and\r\n\r\nhope for the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, not every country can have the foresight and\r\n\r\nthe  cohesiveness  to be able to implement a comprehensive  cost\r\n\r\ncutting  programme  that  involves $10  billion  in  savings  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses  with  the majority of 70% coming  from  wage-related\r\n\r\ncosts.   I  am  proud that we are going forward  in  biting  the\r\n\r\nbullet   upfront,  so  as  to  secure  our  long  term  economic\r\n\r\ninterests.  Singaporeans have shown that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey have the unity and the pragmatism in banding\r\n\r\ntogether in the past to ride out storms in the global economy.\r\n\r\nI have confidence that Singaporeans will have this unity and the\r\n\r\npragmatism today to overcome this storm.  We have to continue to\r\n\r\nreinforce our qualitative competitive strengths and distinguish\r\n\r\nourselves with our honesty, integrity, stability, unity and\r\n\r\nresolve, whilst upgrading our efficiency and managing costs.  I\r\n\r\nam confident that with this ambitious plan at hand, we can\r\n\r\nemerge leaner, stronger and more cohesive as a workforce, as a\r\n\r\npeople and as a nation to face the challenges in the next\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at\r\n\r\nfirst  glance,  the CSC Report in the form of  a  press  release\r\n\r\nappears  to repeat what has been reported in the mass  media  in\r\n\r\nthe  past few months.  One tends to be disappointed and believes\r\n\r\nthat  nothing substantial was forthcoming to save a recessionary\r\n\r\neconomy  and  the  jobs.  However, I must confess,  after  going\r\n\r\nthrough  186 pages of the Report, I was quite impressed  by  the\r\n\r\nwork  of the Committee.  The CSC Report is comprehensive,  bold,\r\n\r\nin-depth and professionally written.  It has addressed  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  key  issues  concerning  our economy  at  present  and  how\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness can be enhanced in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its completeness leaves me with only a few areas to\r\n\r\ncriticise, particularly many of the requests made by myself  and\r\n\r\nnumerous  Members  of this House have already appeared  in  this\r\n\r\nReport.   To  name a few, many Members have asked  for  cuts  in\r\n\r\nwages,   rents,  petrol  tax,  promotion  of  venture   capital,\r\n\r\ninvestment in human capital, more training for workers, etc.  In\r\n\r\ngeneral,  I find it hard to fault the contents, except  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CSC Report should have been split into two\r\n\r\nparts.   Part  I  on cost cutting could have been completed  and\r\n\r\nannounced earlier.  I concur with several hon. Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that the cost cutting should have been part of  the  off-Budget measures implemented in June this year.   Like a morphine\r\n\r\njab for a patient in great pain, earlier cost cutting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould have helped the affected companies gain their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness earlier and confidence in our economy would have\r\n\r\nbeen regained earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not here to cry over spilled\r\n\r\nmilk.  What is more important is for the employers, workers  and\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  recognise that our Government has  the  political\r\n\r\nwill  to  exert its leadership and has once again performed  the\r\n\r\nimpossible  to rally its people around them to make the  economy\r\n\r\ncompetitive  again.  In other countries, the 15%  CPF  wage  cut\r\n\r\nwould  have led to massive strikes and protests.  Our Government\r\n\r\nhas  put  forward a very convincing reason why cost  cutting  is\r\n\r\nvery  necessary for our economy to chug along, to save jobs  and\r\n\r\nto  prosper  in the future.  However, what is not clear  in  the\r\n\r\nReport  is, and I share the same sentiments with many who  spoke\r\n\r\nbefore  me,  how  much  of  the $10  billion  is  borne  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Mr Leong Horn Kee has mentioned earlier  that  with\r\n\r\nthe 10% cut in CPF and 5% cut in wages, that would amount to  $7\r\n\r\nbillion.   It  is expected that the money supply to the  economy\r\n\r\nwould  dwindle  substantially.  Though the  banks  may  help  in\r\n\r\nincreasing the money supply through extending more credit to the\r\n\r\nhome buyers, the net effect can still be contractionary.  Hence,\r\n\r\nI  wonder  if  the Government's economists have worked  out  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  amount  to  cut from the  non-wage  parts  such  as\r\n\r\nutilities rate, JTC/HDB rentals, etc. to offset the reduction in\r\n\r\nconsumption power and avoid a further slump in domestic demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not sufficient, the Government should introduce\r\n\r\nmore  expansionary policies to avoid a deflation.  The September\r\n\r\nfigures   already  showed  large  drops  in  retail   and   food\r\n\r\nconsumption.   This shows that the consumers could have  started\r\n\r\nslowing  down  their consumption before the wage  and  CPF  cut.\r\n\r\nThis must have contributed to part of our negative growth in the\r\n\r\nlast quarter.  If there is no immediate positive stimulus in the\r\n\r\npipeline, the market perception is still that in the short  term\r\n\r\nbusinesses  may  not  pick up much.  I urge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nstimulate the economy more, even though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome may have leakages and the effect of\r\n\r\nstimulation cannot be 100%, but as Members have pointed out\r\n\r\nearlier, the Government has plenty of reserves which I was made\r\n\r\nto understand are getting good return.  My guess is that we\r\n\r\nshould have an additional $3-$5 billion a year from the return\r\n\r\non investment of reserves, if we can convince ourselves that for\r\n\r\none or two years, our return on reserves can be lower, or even\r\n\r\nzero.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Any investment, be it\r\n\r\nprivate, mutual fund, hedge fund, can have some bad years.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that we can use some of the profits on the investment to\r\n\r\nstimulate the economy and keep the principal untouched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me go back to the non-wage cuts. The cuts in\r\n\r\nthese  areas will not make the Government the only loser because\r\n\r\nthe  cuts  in CPF and bonus of the civil servants plus the  much\r\n\r\nreduced  tender prices of Government projects will have resulted\r\n\r\nin  a  lot of savings for the Government in the first place.   I\r\n\r\nhereby  urge  the  Government to be more aggressive  in  cutting\r\n\r\nutilities  rates,  MRT  rates, rentals,  etc.   After  all,  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding  rates of return from Singapore Power,  MRTC,  JTC\r\n\r\nand  HDB factories depend very much on how much the fixed assets\r\n\r\nwere  valued.  Just to give an example.  Singapore  Power  could\r\n\r\nhave  inherited  high land cost because its  incorporation  took\r\n\r\nplace  at  the  height  of  the  property  boom.   Like  private\r\n\r\ncompaneis that have to make provision for losses due to  a  drop\r\n\r\nin  land  values,  entities such as Singapore  Power  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to write down its land value so that even after it  cuts\r\n\r\nits  utilities  rates,  the return on investment  would  not  be\r\n\r\nsubstantially  affected.   This  is  a  logical  step  for   our\r\n\r\nutilities company to benchmark against those in the region whose\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  has been enhanced by the drop in  currency  and\r\n\r\nland values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, to the employers, the 15% cut in\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost  as suggested by the CSC come as a great  relief.\r\n\r\nBefore  this,  many were wondering how their firms will  survive\r\n\r\nwith our high cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructure.  This matter has been brought up in this\r\n\r\nChamber by many Members of this House throughout the year.  Many\r\n\r\nfirms depend on domestic demand, which is one-third of our total\r\n\r\ndemand.  Many of those who export also depend to some extent on\r\n\r\ndomestic demand as a base business.  If the CSC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations result in a reduction in domestic demand or\r\n\r\ndiminishing capabilities of the local firms, I can say that the\r\n\r\nnet result may not be desirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC, after convincing the workers to be prepared for\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  and  wage  cut,  has called on employers  to  increase\r\n\r\nrevenue.  But, with the economies in the region in a slump, this\r\n\r\nis  not  an easy task for most employers.  At this juncture,  we\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps re-examine our Government procurement system  to\r\n\r\nsee whether the local companies are given fair opportunities  to\r\n\r\nconduct  business.  Particularly, in the area  of  construction,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  one of the few areas that Government can  pump-prime,\r\n\r\nthe  rules  do not necessarily create a level playing field  for\r\n\r\nthe local and foreign firms to participate.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhereby declare my interest in a construction company.  To draw a\r\n\r\npictorial  description of our tender system,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ndescribe our Government procurement system as a convex,  tinted,\r\n\r\none-way  mirror.  A local firm standing in front of  the  mirror\r\n\r\nwill  find itself smaller, darker than the real one.  A  foreign\r\n\r\nfirm  standing behind can see through the system  to  gauge  the\r\n\r\nsize   of  our  companies  and  take  full  advantage  of   such\r\n\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for years, foreign firms, particularly in\r\n\r\nconstruction,  have  been dumping their  products  and  services\r\n\r\nhere.   They have been practising marginal pricing, transferring\r\n\r\ncosts  to  generate revenue to stimulate their own  economy  and\r\n\r\nreducing their fixed overheads.  The local firms are just like a\r\n\r\nlightweight   boxer  challenging  a  heavyweight  boxer.    They\r\n\r\nprobably  do  not  appear  as  solid  and  impressive   as   the\r\n\r\nheavyweight.  But if the job requires only a lightweighter,  why\r\n\r\nmust  we  choose  a heavyweighter?  Or, can we  hire  a  foreign\r\n\r\ntrainer,  I  emphasise foreign, under our  wing  and  build  our\r\n\r\nfighters into a world-class heavyweight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been many examples where our tender\r\n\r\nsystem itself excludes our own firms.  Some of the conditions\r\n\r\nask for track records which could not be found previously in our\r\n\r\nrepublic.  In the world of construction, many countries try hard\r\n\r\nto use their procurement power to build their own capability.\r\n\r\nBut it did not seem so here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not advocating protectionism. I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the competition should be fair.  Dumping  should\r\n\r\nbe strongly discouraged.  Otherwise, the local firms will always\r\n\r\nface  an  uphill  battle  to  acquire  knowledge  and  to  build\r\n\r\ncapability.   Without the projects, the local firms cannot  have\r\n\r\nthe  chance to hire foreign talents to build up their  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  experience  base.  This is similar to building  a  national\r\n\r\nsoccer  team.  If we import every player, including the  captain\r\n\r\nfrom overseas, we do not really have a national team.  This team\r\n\r\ncan  easily  go away and we end up with no players at  all.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  in economic terms, our economy has hollowed  out.\r\n\r\nBut  if we have foreign talent to be part of our team, to be our\r\n\r\nsparring partners, then our players will eventually emerge to be\r\n\r\nas good as any foreign player.  I think CSC should find a way to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the playing field is level for everyone,  and  our\r\n\r\nsupporters will cheer for our home team.  The present  situation\r\n\r\nwhereby our own crowd cheers the foreign teams and boo the local\r\n\r\nteam does not have the right spirit to build our competitiveness\r\n\r\nto  become world class companies.  I have so far cited  examples\r\n\r\nin  construction which I know very intimately, but  the  general\r\n\r\npublic sentiment is that the same applies to other sectors.  How\r\n\r\nare  we  going  to build world class companies  if  we  have  no\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  our own people?  May I quote  a  famous  Chinese\r\n\r\nproverb       from       the       \"Tactics       of        War:\r\n\r\n(Sun  Zi  Ping  Fa)  -  Yi  ren  bu  yong,  yong  ren  bu  yi  [\r\n\r\n].   It  means that we should not suspect the person we wish  to\r\n\r\nengage and we do not engage those we suspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to the next recommendation on the building of\r\n\r\nworld  class companies.  It is a natural and good thing to  have\r\n\r\nGLCs  to  kick  start the development of world class  companies.\r\n\r\nThis is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npartly because the Government knows the GLCs'\r\n\r\ncapability and has trust in them.  But such trust should not be\r\n\r\nextended in such a way that the GLC grows in an indiscriminate\r\n\r\nmanner and becomes a monster.  In the world of business, people\r\n\r\ntalk about core competence to excel.  The GLCs should stick to\r\n\r\ntheir core business and try not to encroach on areas which the\r\n\r\nlocal companies can do equally well.  The financial clout of\r\n\r\nGLCs should be exploited to do those businesses such as\r\n\r\nlaunching satellites, telecommunications, airlines, large-scale\r\n\r\nengineering, etc, but not businesses such as restaurants, golf\r\n\r\ncourses and real estate.  Temasek Holdings, as the overall\r\n\r\nguardian, should examine and evaluate the business plan of GLCs\r\n\r\ncarefully to ensure that they will not pose unfair competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage over local firms.  Let us be mindful that it is the\r\n\r\nworld trend to stay away from being too diversified.  There are\r\n\r\nmany case studies on this.  IT&T, the Korean chaebols, are vivid\r\n\r\nexamples of what we should avoid in building our world class\r\n\r\ncompanies.  On the other hand, Nokia, Ericsson are the good\r\n\r\npositive examples cited by CSC on how they succeed by finding a\r\n\r\nniche market in technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my conversation with friends, colleagues and foreigners,\r\n\r\none  question that often pops out is the accountability  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of GLCs.  Will they be subject to the same  level  of\r\n\r\nscrutiny  by  the public and the investors as any  other  public\r\n\r\ncompany?   I  think  if  GLCs  are  to  grow  into  world  class\r\n\r\ncompanies,  the  management must be  held  accountable  for  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of the company.  If they are good, they  should  be\r\n\r\nhandsomely rewarded.  If not, appropriate accountability  should\r\n\r\nensue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of building GLCs into world class\r\n\r\ncompanies,  as recommended by the Report, is that it  gives  the\r\n\r\nreader  the impression that GLCs are the only likely candidates.\r\n\r\nI beg to argue that GLCs should stick to their core business and\r\n\r\nlet  other SMEs be nurtured and built into world class companies\r\n\r\nin  areas  that GLCs have no obvious competence.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee that GLCs would succeed.  By\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nletting some SMEs to grow is a logical way to\r\n\r\ndiversify our economy to have more breadth and depth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report touches on the introduction of more incentives\r\n\r\nsuch  as  employees'  stock  option  plan,  tax  reduction   for\r\n\r\nforeigners  who  work in Singapore, etc.  Yes,  I  support  this\r\n\r\nmarket  oriented approach in management.  After all, one of  the\r\n\r\nkey measures of success is the amount of money one makes.  ESOP,\r\n\r\nthe employees' stock option plan, makes a lot of sense.  But, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg the Government to look beyond  implementing\r\n\r\njust  those  few suggested measures.  Singapore has always  been\r\n\r\nquoted  as  a \"fine\" country.  And that is to say, we have  used\r\n\r\nmore  sticks  than carrots.  In the earlier development  of  our\r\n\r\nnation,  perhaps it took more sticks than carrots to  accelerate\r\n\r\nthe  climbing of the value-added ladder.  Some of the sticks are\r\n\r\nincreased  rents; increased wages; and imposition of quotas  and\r\n\r\nlevies.  But the world is quite different now, especially in the\r\n\r\naftermath of Asia's economic crisis.  The carrot method, such as\r\n\r\nESOP, will perhaps work better.  So far, similar policies,  such\r\n\r\nas  levy  differential, construction quality score, PSB's  grant\r\n\r\nfor  R&D,  have  worked out very well.  They have achieved  good\r\n\r\nresults.   Hence,  I urge the Government to deploy  more  carrot\r\n\r\nmethods  to stimulate the growth of the economy.  And I  believe\r\n\r\nsuch incentive methods will let the Government get back more, in\r\n\r\nthe  form of taxes and other benefits, than what they give  away\r\n\r\nas incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area where the CSC Report is not clear is that as\r\n\r\nthe  business  facilitator,  how would  Government  act  as  the\r\n\r\nregulator and promoter at the same time?  There is bound  to  be\r\n\r\nsome conflict of interest.  The CSC Report mentioned the receipt\r\n\r\nof  feedback that the approval process remained opaque and hence\r\n\r\nsuggested  greater  transparency and accountability  within  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  Yes, this is very good.  But, quite often,  the\r\n\r\nsystem  itself does not work out this way.  I want  to  give  an\r\n\r\nexample, again, in the construction industry.  When a project is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelayed due to changes in design or client's\r\n\r\nrequirement, the supervising officer may impose liquidated\r\n\r\ndamages on the contractor to establish a bargaining power to\r\n\r\nnegotiate for waiver of claim from the contractor.  Clearly,\r\n\r\nthis is a conflict of interest.  The very person who causes the\r\n\r\ndelay is given the discretionary power to mete out the penalty.\r\n\r\nSo in order not to jeopardise his career, the tendency will be\r\n\r\nto take the easy way out.  Outside the construction industry, I\r\n\r\nbelieve, similar examples exist.  I hence suggest that in\r\n\r\naddition to the CSC's recommendations in the chapter on\r\n\r\nGovernment as business facilitator, closer attention should be\r\n\r\npaid to modify and improve the civil service structure so that\r\n\r\ntheir efficiency will be in line with the private sector and no\r\n\r\nwastages and losses will be passed on to the private sector\r\n\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now quote another example about conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nThe Government and the construction industry have been trying to\r\n\r\npromote  the  upgrading  of  skills and  engagement  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.   So  the  levy differential policy was  perceived  and\r\n\r\nimplemented.   However, in the early stages  of  implementation,\r\n\r\nthe  industry  has fed to the Government that the policy,  which\r\n\r\nhas  stark results in promoting skills upgrading, also has  side\r\n\r\neffects, such as giving a particular country, such as China,  an\r\n\r\nunfair  advantage on the cost.  Most of the skilled workers  who\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  low levy of $100 today come from China.  But it  is  a\r\n\r\nknown  fact  that Chinese workers are very difficult to  control\r\n\r\nand  only Chinese companies can control them through their  home\r\n\r\nconnections.  Therefore, the policy actually opens the door wide\r\n\r\nopen  to the Chinese construction firms who now outbid everybody\r\n\r\nbecause  of the low levies.  In other words, the policy  creates\r\n\r\nan  uneven playing field.  If the policy is not remedied through\r\n\r\nthe  diversification  of  sources of workers,  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  will hollow out.  There will be no other  but  Chinese\r\n\r\nconstruction companies.  Then, how will local firms compete  and\r\n\r\ngenerate revenue to keep the workers, engineers, architects  and\r\n\r\nforemen employed?  How are we going to build capability?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to sum up, the CSC Report\r\n\r\nprovides a great vision.  It is, in fact, a dream for most\r\n\r\nnations.  But can we get there in 10 years?  You need a lot of\r\n\r\nchange in mindset, politically and socially, to change from the\r\n\r\ncurrent status to that vision in 10 years.  Many of our people,\r\n\r\nour industries, our entrepreneurs, our civil servants are\r\n\r\nperhaps not ready for the goals envisaged by the CSC whose\r\n\r\nmembers constitute the most successful, forward-looking, dynamic\r\n\r\nindividuals.  The job now for the Government is to convert the\r\n\r\nwonderful ideas of CSC into reality.  This is not an easy task.\r\n\r\nBut if our Government is able to persuade our people to take pay\r\n\r\ncuts, I do not see why it cannot realise the vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Nearly  all  of  them  have\r\n\r\nconcluded that Singapore with its good governance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsound fundamentals and preparedness to take quick\r\n\r\nand decisive measures will be able to weather the storm and\r\n\r\nplace herself in the best position to surge forward when the\r\n\r\nregion recovers.  I suggest that the MP for Hougang and the\r\n\r\nNCMP, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, read this report.  Maybe then, they\r\n\r\nwould not be taking cheap shots so freely at the Government and\r\n\r\nthe Ministers for being not good enough to handle the recent\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  What is comforting to know is that Singapore\r\n\r\ncan indeed be considered the oasis of the region.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthe fact remains that we have felt the full impact of the\r\n\r\ncurrent crisis and that we have to take appropriate action to\r\n\r\ndeal with the difficult times in front of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, the two tasks of addressing the present\r\n\r\neconomic   crisis   and  the  question  of  competitiveness   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the future Singapore, I feel that they  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  up separately.  The task of addressing the  current\r\n\r\ncrisis should have been taken up earlier.  Because, as early  as\r\n\r\nthe  1998 Budget was presented, it was obvious that the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  would  deteriorate very rapidly.  And if  we  had  taken\r\n\r\nthese  recommended measures earlier, it would bring much  relief\r\n\r\nto  many  companies and businesses and perhaps even  lessen  the\r\n\r\nnumber of workers being retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the recommendations by the CSC Report\r\n\r\non   the  reduction  of  business  costs,  if  followed,   would\r\n\r\ndefinitely  be  effective, although the extent of the  reduction\r\n\r\ncannot be fully ascertained as items such as reduction or rebate\r\n\r\non  Government taxes or charges have not been fully  determined.\r\n\r\nMany  Members have expressed that the Government should be  more\r\n\r\ngenerous  in this area, especially in the reduction  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworker  levy.   They  should be more  drastic  than  that  being\r\n\r\nrecommended and it should also be extended to foreign maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that, in considering reducing PUB,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  and transportation charges,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and statutory boards should discard this notion that\r\n\r\nthey have to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevenue positive, especially some of these\r\n\r\nstatutory boards should not be bogged down by the fact that they\r\n\r\nhave been or are in the process of being privatised and\r\n\r\ntherefore they have to be profit-orientated.   It is crucial to\r\n\r\nchange the mindset for at least this critical period and take a\r\n\r\nmore long-term outlook.  Many Members in this House fear that\r\n\r\nthe reduction in business costs will invariably bring hardship\r\n\r\nto the employees, especially to the blue collar workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important for the Government to take\r\n\r\nappropriate action to ensure that the cost of living should be\r\n\r\nreduced simultaneously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of utmost importance because it will help to cushion\r\n\r\nthe  reduction of wages and CPF.  While the CSC recommended such\r\n\r\ncosts  to  be  reduced by 15%, in the private sector especially,\r\n\r\nthis  may not be possible.  For in good times, the wage increase\r\n\r\nin   the  private  sector  normally  goes  beyond  that  of  NWC\r\n\r\nrecommendation  and  during  this  difficult  time,  in  certain\r\n\r\nsectors,  wages might have to go well below the NWC  recommended\r\n\r\nlevel  in  order  to  avoid more severe  retrenchments.   And  a\r\n\r\nreduction  in the cost of living is the only way to  lessen  the\r\n\r\npain  created  by the loss of income in the average  Singaporean\r\n\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider other charges like the town\r\n\r\ncouncil's conservancy charges, transportation charges, and  even\r\n\r\neducation  charges like school fees should be reduced.   By  the\r\n\r\nlogic  that all wages and other charges are reduced, these costs\r\n\r\nwould  definitely  be lower and it should be passed  on  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   However,  even  if we can achieve  the  objective  of\r\r\n\r\ncutting  business cost and lowering the cost of living, we  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to address the sharp economic slowdown completely.\r\n\r\nOur  economy must be given a boost.  I know that tampering  with\r\n\r\nour national reserves is a very sensitive issue.  Personally,  I\r\n\r\nam  most  reluctant to suggest touching our reserves  under  any\r\n\r\nnormal  circumstances.  Having said that, in  a  situation  like\r\n\r\nnow, it would be necessary for the Government to look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto ways to make available a certain amount of our\r\n\r\nreserves to stimulate the economy.  If one believes that one of\r\n\r\nthe reasons for accumulating a healthy reserve is to prepare for\r\n\r\na rainy day, now is the time that we need the umbrella very\r\n\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it would be prudent for the Government to have a well-established plan to apportion some of our reserves in order to\r\n\r\nundertake  projects that can stimulate our economy  provided  of\r\n\r\ncourse  that  we should have plans to replace such  reserves  or\r\n\r\nhave the confidence to add on to it when our economy is on track\r\n\r\nagain.   This I have no doubt that we are able to do so, because\r\n\r\nfrom our track record, the Government and people have year after\r\n\r\nyear been able to achieve a surplus to add to our reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the long-term strategy, the Committee\r\n\r\nhas rightly identified the manufacturing and services sector  as\r\n\r\nthe  twin  engines  of  growth in the future,  and  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant   to   build   world-class  companies   as   well   as\r\n\r\nstrengthening  our  base for small and medium  enterprises.   It\r\n\r\nfurther  identified that the Government should continue to  play\r\n\r\nan  active  role  in  supporting and  facilitating  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Singapore's success is its ability to attract MNCs\r\n\r\nto  set up businesses in Singapore.  This not only brings in the\r\n\r\neconomic  benefit  but,  more importantly,  it  helps  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  to benefit from the latest technological  advancement\r\n\r\nand  be the forerunner of our own R&D development in the region.\r\n\r\nAs we are a small economy, most of our enterprises are small and\r\n\r\nmedium  in size and the GLCs have always provided the leadership\r\n\r\nin   establishing  the  model  for  world-class  companies,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  SIA,  Singapore Technologies, Sembcorp and  PSA,  etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to realise the objectives of strengthening our\r\n\r\nown  local  enterprises and at the same time  build  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies,  GLCs and local SMEs should work in  tandem  and  not\r\n\r\nagainst each other.  Therefore, the GLCs should stay focused  by\r\n\r\nsticking to their core business as much as possible and maximise\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrength in having vast resources both in finance\r\n\r\nand talent.  If diversification is required, one should confine\r\n\r\nto areas which can provide synergy to the core business.  They\r\n\r\nshould not be distracted by short-term gains and diversify into\r\n\r\nunrelated small businesses in competition with our local\r\n\r\ncompanies.  They have a different role to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from some of the local businessmen that they are\r\n\r\npuzzled  as  to  why some GLCs started to do business  which  is\r\n\r\ntotally unrelated to their core business and begin to compete in\r\n\r\nthe  very  limited market with the local businessmen.   Although\r\n\r\ntime  and  again,  they  have assured that  the  GLCs  would  do\r\n\r\nbusiness on a level playing field, they think it is a case where\r\n\r\nthe  playing  field may be level, but the distance  between  the\r\n\r\ngoal  posts  may vary because these GLCs have their own  network\r\n\r\nand  connections, and therefore render the competition a  little\r\n\r\nbit skewed.  It may be a perception.  It is important that if we\r\n\r\nhave  to  strengthen our base of the SMEs, we have to give  them\r\n\r\nspace  and opportunity.  We must assure them that they have  the\r\n\r\nfull  support of the Government.  I believe that the SMEs,  GLCs\r\n\r\nand MNCs can work together with each other and benefit from each\r\n\r\nother's strengths and weaknesses, just as we need to nurture the\r\n\r\ntalented and experienced CEOs like Walt Disney's, Michael Eisner\r\n\r\nto  help  run multi-million dollar corporations.  We  also  need\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  like Bill Gates who can build a  business  empire\r\n\r\nout  of  nothing.   While the corporate  CEOs  and  the  private\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs are very much different in their approach and ways\r\n\r\nof   conducting  business,  their  contributions  are  of  equal\r\n\r\nimportance and one cannot totally displace the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Committee has identified all the steps we have\r\n\r\nto  take  in order to achieve the objective of making  Singapore\r\n\r\none  of the most competitive and vibrant business centres in the\r\n\r\nworld,  it  is  important that a detailed plan be drawn  up  for\r\n\r\nimplementation.   We  can  make  a  vision  statement  and   set\r\n\r\nobjectives,  but  if we cannot stay focused  and  have  definite\r\n\r\nplans and programmes for the realisation of this vision, and all\r\n\r\nparticipating parties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not follow certain parameters set out in the\r\n\r\nReport, it will remain as an academic study and not an effective\r\n\r\nand dynamic document to get us into the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to participate in this debate on  the\r\n\r\nmotion proposed by the Minister for Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last year's Budget debate in July, many Members have made\r\n\r\nnumerous  calls in this House to address issues related  to  the\r\n\r\ncost  of doing business in Singapore.  In the light of the  then\r\n\r\ndeteriorating  economic  backdrop,  Members  have   echoed   the\r\n\r\nexpectations  and the hopes of the business community  that  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  competitiveness be addressed in the  Budget  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  to  offer some relief to the high  costs  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  in Singapore.  Regrettably, the Budget fell  short  of\r\n\r\naddressing this main concern of preservation and enhancement  of\r\n\r\nour   competitiveness  vis-a-vis  our  neighbours.   While   the\r\n\r\nGovernment announced a $2 billion package in off-budget measures\r\n\r\nin  June to control costs, many businesses also felt that  there\r\n\r\nis  hardly any positive impact on them.  The perception  remains\r\n\r\nthat  the  effort to closely monitor the powers of the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity,  especially of the small and medium-sized businesses,\r\n\r\nis  lacking and that the Government continues to rely on not  so\r\n\r\ncurrent statistics to steer the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we debate the motion on endorsing the CSC Report over\r\n\r\nthese  two  days, I believe the Government realises the  extreme\r\n\r\nanxiousness  of our business community and the man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nabout  the current state of affairs and their expectation of  an\r\n\r\nintegrated and an action-oriented Government approach in swiftly\r\n\r\ndealing with the issue of our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debate began yesterday, much has already been\r\n\r\nsaid  and many suggestions made by fellow MPs in terms  of  what\r\n\r\nmore  could  be done over and above the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCSC.  Allow me to offer some of my own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think the Government should not hesitate\r\n\r\nto adopt a radical paradigm shift in fundamental assumptions\r\n\r\nupon which many policies today are predicated.  I believe many\r\n\r\nof these policies have been formulated based upon a mix of\r\n\r\nGovernment controls and free market forces.  It is time that\r\n\r\nsome of the past premises employed to formulate existing\r\n\r\npolicies be critically reviewed in the context of their\r\n\r\nrelevance to the current economic conditions.  Much has changed\r\n\r\nin recent months, let alone years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On concerns of the business community, while the SMEs are\r\n\r\ngenerally   quite   happy  with  the  cost  reduction   measures\r\n\r\nrecommended, there is still concern that the Government's  share\r\n\r\nof  $2.5 billion or so is disproportionate to the amount  to  be\r\n\r\nshouldered  by the business community and the working  populace.\r\n\r\nThere  is room for the Government to more clearly explain  this.\r\n\r\nIt   is  understandable  that  wages  are  manifold  more   than\r\n\r\nGovernment's  charges, but there is a strong  feeling  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  and  need  to  do  more  in  absorbing   more\r\n\r\nGovernment-related  cost components such as  reduction  of  land\r\n\r\ncosts,  property taxes, port and telecommunication  charges  and\r\n\r\ngiving  income  tax  rebates.  This  could  go  a  long  way  in\r\n\r\nenhancing  the  much needed confidence and stimulating  spending\r\n\r\nand  reinvestments.   Much of these have been  touched  upon  by\r\n\r\nothers who have spoken earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some SMEs continue to express disappointment with the much\r\n\r\nbeefed-up Local Enterprises Financing Scheme (LEFS).  They  felt\r\n\r\nthat  their eligibility to take advantage of the scheme is  left\r\n\r\nentirely to the banks.  The latter decides solely whether or not\r\n\r\nthe applicants are eligible for the loan applications.  While  I\r\n\r\nfully  subscribe to the fact that the scheme should not  support\r\n\r\nclearly  hopeless  cases, I am concerned about borderline  cases\r\n\r\nwhich  may  become  victims of the crisis if  not  appropriately\r\n\r\nhelped.   There should be an appeal channel for such  cases.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest the formation of a Committee  comprising\r\n\r\nmembers from the Singapore Productivity and Standards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard and banks to review borderline but worthy\r\n\r\ncases in deciding financial assistance eligibility for such\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP charges for business vehicles was also a hot topic when\r\n\r\nthe  GPC  for Finance and Trade and Industry, of which  I  am  a\r\n\r\nmember,  met  with various business groups.  Many strongly  felt\r\n\r\nthat ERP charges for goods vehicles (pick-up trucks, lorries and\r\n\r\nothers)  used for purely business reasons should be  temporarily\r\n\r\nexempted  from ERP charges during the current economic downturn.\r\n\r\nMost of such vehicles make multiple entries into the CBD and the\r\n\r\nERP charges certainly add up to business costs.  Suspending such\r\n\r\ncharges  will  certainly help at a time when every dollar  saved\r\n\r\ncontributes to the lowering of business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important sector that has long been suffering is the\r\n\r\nretail sector.  This has seen a decline over the years and, more\r\n\r\nrecently,  hefty double digit declines.  They are suffering  not\r\n\r\nonly  as  a  result  of consumers being more cautious  in  their\r\n\r\nspending, but also in the slowdown of the tourism industry since\r\n\r\nlast  year.   With tourist arrivals not within our control,  the\r\n\r\nretail  sector  will have to look up more to  domestic  consumer\r\n\r\nspending.  The wage and bonus cuts undoubtedly will have further\r\n\r\nnegative  impact  on  spending  as consumers'  purchasing  power\r\n\r\nbecomes  more  diminished.  This strongly supports the  argument\r\n\r\nfor further tax rebates to stimulate the already weak demand, as\r\n\r\nechoed  by many MPs earlier.  A temporary suspension of  GST  on\r\n\r\nessential goods and supplies such as clothing and food will also\r\n\r\ngo  a  long  way  in  not only enhancing demand  but  also  help\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  burden of the people affected by  wage  and  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts.  Such tax exemptions on the essential goods are common  in\r\n\r\nmany  states of the USA to dampen the cost of living  impact  on\r\n\r\nthe working class.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers are also hopeful of rental reductions relative to\r\n\r\nthe  fall in the retail sales.  They are heavily counting on the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Tourism Board, working doubly hard to  boost  visitor\r\n\r\narrivals  through more active tourist promotions, especially  in\r\n\r\ncountries  not  affected  by  recession  such  as  the  European\r\n\r\ncountries, the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates, China, Taiwan and perhaps India.  They also\r\n\r\nfelt that bringing more exhibitions and conventions and staging\r\n\r\nworld-class events such as the performing arts, musical and\r\n\r\nsports events will not only enhance Singapore's competitiveness\r\n\r\nbut also help position Singapore as the Broadway of ASEAN, if\r\n\r\nnot Asia.  We have the world-class infrastructure to support\r\n\r\nthis objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the social concerns. Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndeserve  special  salute  for  having  shown  understanding  and\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  move ahead with the CPF  and  wage  cuts.   The\r\n\r\ncoordinated efforts by the Government and the unions to  explain\r\n\r\nthe  important need for immediate business cost reductions,  the\r\n\r\nrationale  behind the need for CPF and wage cost  cuts  and  the\r\n\r\nprospect  of  massive  job  losses if  these  measures  are  not\r\n\r\nundertaken,  have  generally gone down  well  with  the  working\r\n\r\npopulace.   However, anxieties are still abound, especially  the\r\n\r\neffect of these cost-cutting measures in the ability to continue\r\n\r\nservicing their mortgage loans.  While the Government  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  it will help HDB dwellers, nothing appears to be in  store\r\n\r\nfor  the  lower middle income earners who, especially  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years, have upgraded to private properties.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthem have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an interim measure, I would like to propose that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider the relaxation of CPF usage  to  allow  for\r\n\r\npooling of CPF resources among immediate family members to  help\r\n\r\nthose in trouble tide over their mortgage repayments during  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  period.   Working parents, children  or  siblings  could\r\n\r\nassist  the  family member or members in trouble by  temporarily\r\n\r\nallowing them usage of their CPF savings to pay for the  monthly\r\n\r\nmortgage  payments  subject to certain  regulations.   Once  the\r\n\r\ntroubled  family member becomes gainfully employed and overcomes\r\n\r\nhis problem, the assistance should cease and the amount borrowed\r\n\r\nshould be returned back progressively to the lenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savings in the Special Account of the CPF should also be\r\n\r\ntemporarily freed up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor such purposes and should similarly be returned\r\n\r\nupon employment stability and recovery of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regulatory measure to assist troubled first-time private\r\n\r\nproperty   purchasers,  the  Government,  through  perhaps   the\r\n\r\nMonetary   Authority  of  Singapore,  could  assist  in   pacing\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  involved  in  lending  money  for  such\r\n\r\npurposes  to  help  them  reschedule  loan  repayments  wherever\r\n\r\nfeasible.   HDB  policy and guidelines employed  to  assist  HDB\r\n\r\nflatowners could be used as a basis to regulate this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower should also seriously consider the\r\n\r\ntemporary reduction of the domestic worker levy.  A reduction of\r\n\r\n30-50%  will  go  a long way in helping struggling  dual  income\r\n\r\nfamilies affected by the CPF and wage cuts, but yet could not do\r\n\r\naway  with  the services of a maid to look after their  children\r\n\r\nand/or aged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses that are doing well and are benefiting positively\r\n\r\nfrom the cost reduction exercise, they should also shoulder some\r\n\r\nsocial   responsibility  in  these  tough  economic   times   to\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly lower their product prices or service charges to\r\n\r\nhelp  cushion the impact of wage cuts taken by the  people.   If\r\n\r\nthe  overall intention is to bring wages down to 1994 level,  it\r\n\r\nis  imperative  that  every constituent of  the  land,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  corporate citizens and the  people,  do  their\r\n\r\ncollective part to also bring down our cost of living as well as\r\n\r\nwe   can  to  1994  standard.   Only  then  will  some  form  of\r\n\r\nequilibrium be achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, allow me to applaud the CSC for their effort\r\n\r\nand  boldness in making several important recommendations,  both\r\n\r\nfor  the  short and long term which, I believe, will  have  far-reaching  implications for Singapore when implemented.   Looking\r\n\r\non the horizon, it is my hope to see the Government put in place\r\n\r\na  regular  ongoing competitiveness monitoring and  benchmarking\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  prevent us as far as possible  from  again  being\r\n\r\ncaught  off  guard.  While it is fair to note that the  currency\r\n\r\ncrisis leading to significant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepreciation of regional currencies, which is also\r\n\r\na major cause of the erosion of our competitiveness was hard to\r\n\r\npredict, there were many tell tale signs pointing to the\r\n\r\nescalating cost of doing business in Singapore, which the\r\n\r\nGovernment and statutory boards have influence in moderating\r\n\r\nwithout having to undermine the free market mechanism.  This\r\n\r\nincludes, as I have mentioned earlier on, land pricing and\r\n\r\nrental regulations, a major business cost component, port,\r\n\r\nutilities and communication charges.  Ways must also be found to\r\n\r\nfurther refine our flexible wage and compensation system to\r\n\r\nprevent the need for the CPF mechanism from being continually\r\n\r\nrelied upon in the future to adjust cost and address\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusually long growth period in Asia, including here in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  has  made  us  forgotten that  crises,  bubbles  and\r\n\r\ncrashes are an inevitable part of economic business cycles.   We\r\n\r\nshould now brace ourselves to be better prepared for future  ups\r\n\r\nand  downs.  Sir, having an efficient competitiveness  barometer\r\n\r\nwill  go  a  long way in regularly checking where  we  stand  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  to regional as well as industrialised and  developed\r\n\r\ncountries.    Such  indicators  will  enable  prompt  regulatory\r\n\r\nactions  to  be  taken  that  will  enable  us  to  sustain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  on  a real time basis and, hopefully,  do  away\r\n\r\nwith  the need for off-Budget measures and jolting the lives  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with  CPF and wage cuts.  Such  an  approach  will\r\n\r\nincrease Singapore's and the business community's resilience  in\r\n\r\nweathering the current and future storms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, exceptional times\r\n\r\nrequire  boldness of vision and action.  It calls for  a  common\r\n\r\nunderstanding and purpose by the people to collectively meet the\r\n\r\nchallenges.  These are exceptional times.  Since the release  of\r\n\r\nthe  Report by the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nthe reconvened National Wages Council, I had met up with my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders and residents.  They expressed\r\n\r\nunderstanding and support of the two Reports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make two general remarks before I comment on the measures\r\n\r\nproposed.  In a crisis, we are pressured to find quick  answers.\r\n\r\nYet, in our evolving history, the present crisis will only be  a\r\n\r\nblip.   We  must  be  careful  not  to  pursue  quick  solutions\r\n\r\ninconsistent with sound principles, which underpin our long-term\r\n\r\ninterests  and  survival.   Short-term  solutions  must  by  its\r\n\r\ndefinition  be  exceptions  that can  be  dismantled  after  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.   These  solutions cannot and should not be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nadversely change the long-term course of the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is one thing to accept the rationality and\r\n\r\nrelevance of the recommendations themselves, and yet another the\r\n\r\npains faced upon implementation.  The people want and expect the\r\n\r\nGovernment and employers to convince and show openly  that  they\r\n\r\nunderstand and appreciate the pains suffered and sacrifices made\r\n\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon our employers to declare that they will share fairly\r\n\r\nthe  profits  in good times as they now desire workers  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices  for  the company.  When the good times  return,  the\r\n\r\ncuts  should not only be restored but profits be shared  through\r\n\r\nbonus and other benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the short-term specific measures to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  crisis.   The need for short-term specific measures  arises\r\n\r\nfrom  our  sudden loss of competitiveness.  A major  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis loss of competitiveness is the relative appreciation of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  to the currencies of our  competitors.   Some\r\n\r\nhence feel that allowing the Singapore dollar to depreciate is a\r\n\r\nless  painful answer to cutting cost.  It would be  helpful  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to make more efforts to explain why cutting cost\r\n\r\nis the better alternative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me look at the short-term measures from both the company's\r\n\r\nviewpoint  and  the worker's viewpoint.  I will start  with  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   The  cut  in business cost is not only  for  external\r\n\r\ncompetition, but also internally to help our companies survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is thus strong support for the specific\r\n\r\nmeasures proposed by the Committee, particularly the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign worker levy should be reduced. This will bring\r\n\r\nmuch  relief  to  those companies with high dependence  on  such\r\n\r\nworkers.   These workers do not pay CPF and a cut in the  latter\r\n\r\ndoes not lighten the cost burden.  Affected sectors include  the\r\n\r\nfood  and beverage, and construction.  The amount of cut in  the\r\n\r\nlevy should provide as good a relief as the CPF cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cut in Land/Factory Rent</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent of industrial land, factory and commercial\r\n\r\nproperties should be further reduced.  The proposal to return to\r\n\r\nthe  1990  rent level is much welcomed.  HDB and JTC, being  the\r\n\r\nlargest  landlords  of such properties, should  take  the  lead.\r\n\r\nPrivate  owners will follow.   The short-term help  is  obvious.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  a long-term impact as companies can  remain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Singapore will also be more attractive  to  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB and JTC should also be more willing to rent out vacant\r\n\r\nland  on  TOL.   I  have been told that Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\nforced to go overseas to grow turf grass for import to Singapore\r\n\r\neven  though  vacant lands are available for this purpose  here.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also difficult and expensive to obtain the use  of  such\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also calls for the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Training Subsidies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to train their workers, the\r\n\r\nsubsidies  given should be increased.  This will  encourage  and\r\n\r\nmake  it  easier  for  companies  to  retain  the  workers   for\r\n\r\nretraining.  Training fees should also be kept low.  These  fees\r\n\r\nhave been escalating much too quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Medisave Rate for the Self-Employed</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the self-employed, the increase in the Medisave\r\n\r\ncontribution planned for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext year should be deferred.  In fact, the\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider reducing it during this period of\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Parking Charges</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking charges for commercial and heavy vehicles should be\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Banking Charges</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various banking charges like the opening of letters of\r\n\r\ncredit should be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the workers. As wages form a large part\r\n\r\nof  the  cost  to  companies, cost cutting means cutting  wages.\r\n\r\nThis  is  painful  for the people.  Hence,  at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nefforts must be made to provide relief to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the reliefs that were sought include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Housing Loans Repayment</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help should be given for the repayment of housing loans. A\r\n\r\nmajor  concern  with  the  CPF cut is the  worker's  ability  to\r\n\r\nfinance  the  monthly repayment of his housing  loan.   As  most\r\n\r\npeople  own  HDB  flats,  I  hope the Government  will  announce\r\n\r\nschemes to help owners of HDB flats.  HDB has constantly assured\r\n\r\nflat  owners that they will be assisted.  They must continue  to\r\n\r\nreassure  the  people.  I am happy that several banks  are  also\r\n\r\noffering  alternative  repayment schemes to  lower  the  monthly\r\n\r\nrepayment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent decline in interest rates has helped to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  monthly  instalments of housing loans  substantially.   But\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  are capricious.  We should not be  lulled  into\r\n\r\ncomplacency  by  this development.  It is necessary  to  set  in\r\n\r\nplace schemes to help with the housing loan repayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maid Levy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy should be reduced. This will bring much relief to\r\n\r\nfamilies  who desperately need the assistance of maids  such  as\r\n\r\nfamilies with very young children and old parents to look  after\r\n\r\nand both spouses are working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cut in Fees and Charges</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, every bit of cut to the cost of living\r\n\r\nis a help to the people.  There were calls for reduction in fees\r\n\r\nand charges and for increase in rebates:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School fees at all levels from kindergarten to university\r\n\r\nbe reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utility charges including telephone charges be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport charges like bus and taxi fares be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service and conservancy charges by Town Councils be\r\n\r\nreduced.    Government  should  also  give  more   service   and\r\n\r\nconservancy rebates, especially to the lower income group.    In\r\n\r\nthis  period of crisis, the rebate should be extended to  5-room\r\n\r\nand Executive flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should give more income tax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical charges should be reduced. The number of Class C\r\n\r\nbeds should be increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies and hawkers should reduce prices.\r\n\r\nParticular  concerns were expressed for the  low  income  group.\r\n\r\nQuestions were asked if this group of people could be spared the\r\n\r\ncuts, or alternatively be provided with additional reliefs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keen interests were expressed on the restoration of the\r\n\r\nwage  and  CPF cuts.  Residents were keen to know when the  cuts\r\n\r\nwill  be  restored.    They would like the  NWC  to  review  the\r\n\r\nsituation  regularly  so that the cuts can be  quickly  restored\r\n\r\nwhen the crisis blows over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the long-term measures to Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  While we seek to develop new strategies, it is\r\n\r\nimportant  not  to forget, but to renew and revitalise  existing\r\n\r\ncore strengths.  Let me share the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have enjoyed rapid growth for over 30 years.\r\n\r\nParents who had gone through hard times try to make sure that\r\n\r\ntheir children are never in want of anything.  This is\r\n\r\nunderstandable.  But we also run the risk of our young not\r\n\r\nunderstanding poverty and what it means to be resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to always compete with the world for our existence.\r\n\r\nThis  requires  hard  work, commitment, a  fighting  spirit  and\r\n\r\nconstantly  to  remind our young of the need to be  competitive.\r\n\r\nIf  we lack this motivation, we are doomed.  After having it  so\r\n\r\ngood  for  so long, is our mental and physical capability  still\r\n\r\nstrong?  We must stress national values and priorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional countries have been ravaged by the economic\r\n\r\nstorm.   They are chastened.  Their systems will now be  leaner.\r\n\r\nWe must take this opportunity to learn and emerge wiser from the\r\n\r\ncrisis.  We must remind our people that they cannot take  things\r\n\r\nfor granted, that our rosy future is not preordained.  While  we\r\n\r\nenjoy  during the good times, we must also prepare for  and  set\r\n\r\naside  something for bad times.  The future of Singapore  is  in\r\n\r\nour  hands.   We decide and make the future.  If we  learn  this\r\n\r\nlesson  and  emerge from the crisis stronger as a people  and  a\r\n\r\nnation, the pains will not be in vain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to add a word of caution. As we plan\r\n\r\nfor  the  future, we must not give the impression to the  people\r\n\r\nthat   this   will   guarantee  us   against   future   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   We must remind the people that  whatever  we  do\r\n\r\ndifficult  moments can surface.  There are too many factors  and\r\n\r\nimponderables in the real world.  What we can do and must do  is\r\n\r\nto  constantly anticipate and prepare for them. We must  not  be\r\n\r\nlulled into complacency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be better motivated and committed to our work and\r\n\r\ncompanies.    Several  employers  told   me   that   they   have\r\n\r\ndifficulties hiring people, or if they do manage to  hire,  some\r\n\r\nworkers  do not stay on long, even during this difficult period.\r\n\r\nOur  workers are fussy.  If the work is demanding, they  do  not\r\n\r\nstay long.  They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhop from one job to another for pay increases, even\r\n\r\nsmall amounts.  They do not like to go for training.  If they\r\n\r\naccept training, they are not happy with their bonds.  Those who\r\n\r\nare trained often do not stay long, lured away by higher salary\r\n\r\nelsewhere, feeling no obligations to the companies which train\r\n\r\nthem.  I have personally encountered others who during this\r\n\r\ncrisis would rather stay unemployed at home than to take up a\r\n\r\nlower paid job, or a job that is \"too far\" away from their home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed lucky to have painstakingly cultivated\r\n\r\ntripartism.  We had shared both the bounty in good times and the\r\n\r\nprivation during bad times.  This has built trust, consensus and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  among  the Government, employers  and  employees.\r\n\r\nMany foreigners have expressed disbelief that our workers agreed\r\n\r\nto  have  their  salaries  cut.  In  some  countries,  the  very\r\n\r\nsuggestion  itself will already cause an uproar.  For  this,  we\r\n\r\nmust  indeed be proud as a nation.  This is an element  of  long\r\n\r\nterm   strength  and  competitiveness.   We  must  ensure   that\r\n\r\ntripartism endures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the present cost cutting proposals cut down the value\r\n\r\nof the resources, the actual resources used do not decrease.  In\r\n\r\nview of the scarcity of many resources, we should make an effort\r\n\r\nto  use  less  of  them.  We should call  upon  our  people  and\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  cut  down waste by using  these  resources   more\r\n\r\nefficiently.  They must be constantly aware of the importance of\r\n\r\nconserving   resources.   If  necessary,  we   should   consider\r\n\r\ncampaigns  to  remind  and encourage people  to  use  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity more carefully, to be more productive in  our  work,\r\n\r\nto help keep our environment clean, to protect our facilities so\r\n\r\nthat  less maintenance and repair expenses are needed.  This  is\r\n\r\nan element of enduring competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I call upon our people to stand united during\r\n\r\nthis  time of crisis, to make painful sacrifices for the nation.\r\n\r\nWe  must support the cost cutting measures to help our companies\r\n\r\nand  hence  ourselves to ride out the storm.   This  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the nation and for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollective good.  Meanwhile, the Government and\r\n\r\nemployers must show understanding of the pains incurred and\r\n\r\nprovide unstinting help to alleviate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a longer term, we must remember that vicissitudes are\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel  of the economic life of a  nation.   We  must\r\n\r\nremember this when the good times return. We must never take the\r\n\r\ngood  times for granted.  We must always prepare for lean  times\r\n\r\nin times of plenty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our existing strategy has done us proud as we have braced\r\n\r\nthe  current  crisis much better than our neighbours.   We  must\r\n\r\nforge  an  even more robust strategy and a national cohesiveness\r\n\r\nthat will anchor the country against future uncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  full  support of the motion by the Minister  for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is wide consensus that the Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Competitiveness  has carried  out  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nanalysis and made well constructed recommendations.  Many of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have dwelt at length on the strategic issues.   So  I\r\n\r\nwill confine my comments to the short term measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback by the various industry groups that the GPC spoke\r\n\r\nto highlighted two observations.  Firstly, there is a sense that\r\n\r\nmany  of  the recommended interim measures are weighted  towards\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  construction.   Secondly,  sectors  such  as\r\n\r\nretail  and  food  and beverage are worried  that  the  proposed\r\n\r\nreduction in wages will dampen consumption, which will more than\r\n\r\noverwhelm the benefits from a reduction in operating costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, companies, especially the smaller operators in\r\n\r\ntrading and services, are seeking help as they face a cash  flow\r\n\r\ncrunch  in  the  short term and would like  to  better  position\r\n\r\nthemselves after the downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to propose specific recommendations\r\n\r\nto achieve the following two objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to help improve the cashflow for\r\n\r\ncompanies and, secondly, to mitigate against the inevitable\r\n\r\ndampening effect on consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improve cashflow for companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the interim, in order to provide maximum\r\n\r\nimpact,  as  well  as send a strong message  to  private  sector\r\n\r\nlandlords,  can  the proposed reduction in rentals  be  extended\r\n\r\nbeyond  the JTC and HDB to all statutory boards and wholly-owned\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, various statistics have pointed to much lower\r\n\r\ncommercial  property  values.  For property  tax  purposes,  can\r\n\r\nthese benefits be felt in a more timely fashion by reducing  the\r\n\r\nlag in pegging valuation levels?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, although various assistance schemes such as LEFS\r\n\r\nhave   been  widened  to  benefit  more  companies,  many   non-manufacturing concerns, such as trading companies, still do  not\r\n\r\nqualify.  They seek the availability of some form of Government-assisted  trade  financing scheme to help offset reduced  credit\r\n\r\nlines by banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, whilst many applaud the emphasis on training and\r\n\r\nupgrading,  companies would like existing  schemes  to  be  more\r\n\r\ngenerously   applied  to  executive,  managerial   and   general\r\n\r\ntraining.   This  will  allow  for  smoother  progression   into\r\n\r\nmanagerial roles within the same organisation or industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, most companies realise the importance of\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  are  willing to invest in  spite  of  the  high\r\n\r\ncapital costs.  However, they usually find maintenance to  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  heavy  burden to bear, especially during  this  period  of\r\n\r\nslowing,  if  not contracting, revenues.  Can the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance consider allowing deductions for maintenance costs,  for\r\n\r\ntax purposes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mitigate against dampening effect on consumption</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of my colleagues have commented on the dampening\r\n\r\neffect on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsumption of wage reduction.  There is\r\n\r\nrecognition by retailers that consumption is closely linked to\r\n\r\ndisposable income, confidence and consumer psychology.  As much\r\n\r\nas we can wish that the media would not be overly negative or\r\n\r\npessimistic, I would like to suggest the following as well:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, can some temporary relief be provided for\r\n\r\nindividuals, for example, as has been raised by several Members,\r\n\r\nby  reducing the foreign maid levy by, say, $100 per  month,  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the impending reduction in household  income,  but\r\n\r\nwith   the  Ministry  of  Manpower  still  maintaining   control\r\n\r\nadministratively?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister for Finance consider granting a\r\n\r\nbigger personal tax rebate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, can Electronic Road Pricing, especially into the\r\n\r\nCentral Business District, be temporarily suspended on Saturdays\r\n\r\nto give the retail sector a boost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of debate over how much\r\n\r\nGovernment should bear, whether it should be an equal burden  or\r\n\r\nin  equitable proportions.  Unlike other countries, we at  least\r\n\r\nhave  the luxury of such a debate.  It is a luxury that did  not\r\n\r\nhappen  by  accident,  but  one that has  resulted  from  strong\r\n\r\nfundamentals  and good Government.  Although both arguments  are\r\n\r\nequally  compelling, I think we should refrain  from  distorting\r\n\r\nthe  cost  structure  too  much in  order  to  gain  more  moral\r\n\r\nauthority.  We all understand that wage and CPF cuts are hard to\r\n\r\nstomach, but we all recognise that unless companies can survive,\r\n\r\njobs cannot be preserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider  the additional recommendations outlined above  and  to\r\n\r\nimplement the CSC proposals as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Committee  on  Singapore's  Competitiveness  is\r\n\r\ncomprehensive.  If only we had the benefit of the  findings  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations  two years ago.  For a long  time  now  we  have\r\n\r\nheard grumbling about the high cost of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperating in Singapore.  I have often heard\r\n\r\ndisbelief expressed over the BERI's Report.  For a long time now\r\n\r\nemployers have grumbled about rapidly rising labour costs\r\n\r\nunmatched by an increase in productivity, disloyalty of labour,\r\n\r\npoor attitudes of new entries to the labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current economic downturn, some employers have expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  hope  that people's expectations will be moderated,  more\r\n\r\nrealistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has done an excellent job of identifying the issue\r\n\r\nand  I  am generally in agreement with its recommendations.   My\r\n\r\nconcern  is  with  the  details,  the  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations that, if mishandled, can cause much pain without\r\n\r\nproviding  the  cure.  I share many of the areas brought  up  by\r\n\r\nearlier speakers and I shall not repeat them.  I shall focus  on\r\n\r\na couple of areas that I feel have not been raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realign our wage structure to be competitive. The\r\n\r\nquestion has been raised as to whether the targeted 15%  cut  in\r\n\r\nwage  cost is enough.  Concern has been raised on the impact  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a cut on the lower paid wage earners and there has been  a\r\n\r\ncall  to  make a bigger cut for higher wages to help  the  lower\r\n\r\npaid  workers.  I would like to caution that higher paid workers\r\n\r\nmay  not necessarily have such a large advantage over the  lower\r\n\r\npaid  workers.  Many do not benefit from large housing subsidies\r\n\r\nor  other subsidies.  Many are heavily mortgaged on their  home.\r\n\r\nThese  people  will  not  have a benevolent  Town  Council  with\r\n\r\npatience  over  late payments of conservancy  charges.   I  fear\r\n\r\nthat,  without care, suspicion may arise that one party  or  the\r\n\r\nother  is  not bearing a fair share of the pain, and  this  will\r\n\r\nhave an impact on social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our enterprises will have to carry on the best they can. There\r\n\r\nwill  always be a need to supplement our workforce with  skilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers.  There is an urgent need to reduce the levy for\r\n\r\nskilled foreign workers substantially.   I do, however, question\r\n\r\nthe  appropriateness of reducing the levy on  unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould not encourage the import of unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers.  Jobs, usually filled by such workers, should\r\n\r\nbe kept for Singaporean workers who, due to the lack of\r\n\r\nappropriate skills, have to be retrained and are temporarily\r\n\r\nrequiring a job, any job, to survive. As for the foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, we should require employers to hire from among the pool\r\n\r\nof retrenched foreign workers, instead of forcing them to be\r\n\r\nrepatriated.  Many of these foreign workers cannot and do not\r\n\r\nwant to return home because of the heavy debt that they incur in\r\n\r\ngetting to Singapore.  It would be a humanitarian policy which\r\n\r\nwill also help see the continuing need for foreign workers\r\n\r\nwithout resulting in an increase in their numbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our enterprises seek new markets and establish offices\r\n\r\noverseas, we should set up Singapore Trade Centres in the cities\r\n\r\nwhere  business opportunities exist.  These centres should offer\r\n\r\na  one-stop business support service where Singapore businessmen\r\n\r\ncan rent temporary office facilities at low cost and obtain help\r\n\r\nto transcend language and cultural barriers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the recommendations made by the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on Singapore's Competitiveness.  It is now  essential\r\n\r\nto  ensure proper implementation of the recommendations  and  to\r\n\r\ncontinue monitoring our competitiveness and fine-tune the system\r\n\r\nas  Singapore  regains its footing and get  back  on  track  for\r\n\r\ncontinuing economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I applaud the\r\n\r\nCommittee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) for its calls  to\r\n\r\ncut  wages,  electricity  and  telecommunication  charges,  port\r\n\r\nservice  charges,  extend property tax and income  tax  rebates,\r\n\r\nreduce income and road taxes, offer infrastructural support  for\r\n\r\nworking   mothers   who  need  child  care  facilities,   adjust\r\n\r\nindustrial  land prices to international benchmarks, and  adjust\r\n\r\ndownwards  the cost of owning cars through reducing customs  and\r\n\r\npetrol duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many \"goodies\" in the package for businesses, but\r\n\r\nI want to highlight the plight of the consumer and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe help that we too sorely need.  I ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in accepting the CSC's Report, to spare a thought\r\n\r\nfor the consumers, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, I have a few proposals, but I would not repeat the\r\n\r\nproposals  like  the maid levy and GST cut which  my  colleagues\r\n\r\nhave raised in this House and which I fully support.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  want  to  speak against the CSC's  recommendation  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the $200 GST exemption for day trippers who have shopped\r\n\r\noverseas.   Much  as I wish Singaporeans would  have  a  greater\r\n\r\nsense  of  dignity  and solidarity in the face  of  abusive  and\r\n\r\nhostile  treatment from those they buy from, I realise that  the\r\n\r\nsavings  are significant and there are some who need the savings\r\n\r\nbadly  enough to face shoddy treatment.  If Singapore  retailers\r\n\r\nwant  to increase their customer base, they must really work  to\r\n\r\nbring  back  the  customers  and not  take  the  path  of  least\r\n\r\nresistance  by  preventing Singaporeans from shopping  overseas.\r\n\r\nThey must take heart from the experiences of good retailers like\r\n\r\nBorders, Robinsons and NTUC Fairprice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned too that once the call to reduce or remove GST\r\n\r\nexemption is heeded, we would open the floodgates for more calls\r\n\r\nto  prevent \"GST leakage\".  Such a call will have an  impact  on\r\n\r\nthe  numerous small transactions that will be made by  consumers\r\n\r\non  the  Internet.  Are we going to say that GST is being leaked\r\n\r\nthere  too  and  so  retailers should be protected  through  the\r\n\r\ndiligent collection of GST from such individuals?  If so, I fear\r\n\r\nefforts  in  promoting e-commerce will be greatly hampered.   If\r\n\r\nretailers  are  hurting from competition,  whether  from  Johor,\r\n\r\nBatam or cyberspace - surely the answer is in themselves.\r\n\r\nI  urge Government to further consider easing the burden of  the\r\n\r\naverage  consumer  by, for example, making sure  that  not  only\r\n\r\nthose  who  earn below $1,200 be spared the wage  cut,  but,  in\r\n\r\naddition, Government should continue to give rebates for service\r\n\r\nand conservancy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges in respect of 1- to 3-room flat dwellers\r\n\r\nand town councils.  As my colleague, Mr Gerard Ee, has\r\n\r\nmentioned, we should have the compassion to allow for those who\r\n\r\nhave financial difficulties to pay their charges in instalments\r\n\r\nin easy payment schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB also provides a benchmark for property prices, in that\r\n\r\nthe  price  ceiling  of the HDB market is a convenient  base  on\r\n\r\nwhich to prop up the floor of the private property market.  With\r\n\r\nthe distance between top end HDB flats and low end private flats\r\n\r\nas  little  as  they  are  at present (and  almost  non-existent\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Executive  Condominiums and  entry  level  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums)  - surely the HDB could lower their  sale  prices.\r\n\r\nIf  this means a larger subsidy from the Government, is this not\r\n\r\nthe right time to do it?  Similarly, HDB mortgage rates could be\r\n\r\nlowered to provide flat owners some relief.  If necessary,  such\r\n\r\na  measure  could just be limited to the owners of 1- to  4-room\r\n\r\nflats, so as to free the disposable income currently frozen into\r\n\r\nthe property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to businesses. Landlords, especially the GLCs, HDB\r\n\r\nand JTC, must reduce their rental; retailers must cut the prices\r\n\r\nof  at  least the basic necessities, as NTUC Fairprice has done;\r\n\r\ninsurance companies must ease up on their collection of premiums\r\n\r\nor  provide easy payment schemes, as NTUC Income has  done;  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals such as doctors and pharmacists must charge  lower\r\n\r\nfees  so healthcare becomes more affordable.  Restaurant  owners\r\n\r\nmust take their heads out of the sand and work at charging less,\r\n\r\nand  accept  that  they must not insist on a  flat  10%  service\r\n\r\ncharge in all circumstances.  If they could reduce their service\r\n\r\ncharge  to  only 5%, I suspect the rise in clientele would  more\r\n\r\nthan make up for the loss!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I call on the Government to be easy on the SMEs\r\n\r\nwho  scramble  to  pay the Government charges,  levies  and  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  on time - but fail.  A little more  understanding\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  civil servants could go a  long  way  towards\r\n\r\nputting  a  human face on the efficient bureaucratic machine  we\r\n\r\nhave.

The employers who are business  owners\r\n\r\nmust  also  contribute their share.  In all this, the Consumers'\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore (CASE) too has a part.  CASE's  mission\r\n\r\nis  to  inform, educate and protect consumers.  We have embarked\r\n\r\non  a campaign to identify cheap places and inform consumers  on\r\n\r\nbusinesses  which will give them value for money - whether  they\r\n\r\nbe  hawker centres, shops, supermarkets, restaurants,  or  other\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   We  will  be  conducting  seminars  and   printing\r\n\r\nbooklets  to educate and help consumers to stretch their  dollar\r\n\r\nand  to  understand their rights when, for example,  their  hire\r\n\r\npurchase  companies  foreclose in  on  them.   We  will  protect\r\n\r\nconsumers and campaign to expose profiteers, opportunists, those\r\n\r\nidentified  with  the  help  of our \"eyes  and  ears\"  all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore  - our 600,000 members, union members and  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.   We  also call on consumers not to patronise  food\r\n\r\nestablishments  which  impose  a mandatory  10%  service  charge\r\n\r\n(especially if this is on top of a compulsory pickle  or  peanut\r\n\r\ncharge)  without giving real service in return.  We will publish\r\n\r\nthe  names of these institutions that do not charge the way that\r\n\r\nwe  advocate and we will channel more customers to those who are\r\n\r\neasy on the customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope, of course, that the Government will show its concern\r\n\r\nfor consumers and give us a grant to work on this project.

One is on how to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  current  economic crisis, while the  other  is  on  how  to\r\n\r\nprepare our economy to face the future challenges.\r\n\r\nIn  the  short-term, our workers and the trade  unions  have  to\r\n\r\naccept pay cuts to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp the companies regain competitiveness and, in\r\n\r\nthe process, to save our jobs.  In the long term, we have to\r\n\r\nequip ourselves with new skills to operate in a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomic environment. We, in the labour movement, support both\r\n\r\nsets of recommendations because we are convinced that they are\r\n\r\nin the best interests of our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our debate in Parliament yesterday, I was surprised to\r\n\r\nhear  one  MP  saying that the 15% wage cut is not  enough.   He\r\n\r\nsuggested  a  30%  cut.  The question is: during  the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths  when  we  were  debating on these issues,  why  did  the\r\n\r\nemployers and companies not put forward the reasons for the  30%\r\n\r\nwage  cut?   They  should  list out the cost  structure  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious sectors in the business community to present their case.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  over the last few months, they have remained  silent.\r\n\r\nSo,  after we have explained to our workers why we should  agree\r\n\r\nto  take a 15% wage cut,  they accepted it.   Now, the employers\r\n\r\nare saying that it is not enough.  Furthermore, the said MP is a\r\n\r\nmember of the National Wages Council (NWC) which recommended the\r\n\r\n15%  wage cut.   Why is he now questioning the 15% cut?    Since\r\n\r\nhe sat in the NWC, he should be in the best position to know why\r\n\r\nthe reduction should be 15%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yesterday's debate, we can sense how difficult it is for\r\n\r\nus   in  the  trade  unions  to  explain  to  our  workers  such\r\n\r\ncomplicated economic matters.  Here, I would like to  thank  our\r\n\r\nworkers  for  being  so understanding and  for  supporting  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation to reduce 15% of their employers' wage cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the economic downturn, grassroots leaders and\r\n\r\nunionists have asked whether we have the means to help those  in\r\n\r\nfinancial hardship as a result of wage cuts and job losses.   Do\r\n\r\nwe  have  a social security net to meet their needs?   When  our\r\n\r\nworkers are retrenched or have suffered a wage cut, do we have a\r\n\r\nsocial security net to help them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some developed countries, the jobless can look to\r\n\r\nunemployment benefits.  So some people are questioning why we do\r\n\r\nnot have social security in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Does it mean that because we do not\r\n\r\nhave unemployment benefits, we do not really have social\r\n\r\nsecurity?  Are they correct in their accusation?  I do not think\r\n\r\nso.  I do not think we should look at the issue so narrowly - that just because we do not provide unemployment benefits, there\r\n\r\nis no social security in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what are the basic needs of the people? First, jobs;\r\n\r\nsecond,  housing;  third, medical care; fourth,  education.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  all of these have been provided for in our social  system\r\n\r\nbut very often we take them for granted, and we forget that they\r\n\r\nare part of our social security system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take jobs, for example. We have made job creation our top\r\n\r\npriority.   Over  the  years, we have brought  in  many  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  Singapore.  Many jobs have been  created.   Our\r\n\r\npreference is on quality investments because they are  the  ones\r\n\r\nthat  can  afford to pay higher wages.  Over the past 10  years,\r\n\r\nour  real wages have gone up by an average of 5% per year.  This\r\n\r\nis  better  than  what has been secured even in  many  developed\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy is to train people for life-long employability.\r\n\r\nThis  is like teaching people to fish rather than merely  giving\r\n\r\nthem fish to eat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this economic downturn, our top priority must be to find\r\n\r\nnew jobs for the retrenched workers.  A job with a steady income\r\n\r\nis  anytime  better than any form of unemployment benefit.   The\r\n\r\nNTUC has joined hands with the Ministry of Manpower and the SNEF\r\n\r\nto  develop  a  job  bank to match those who are  retrenched  or\r\n\r\nunemployed  with the vacancies available.   At the moment,  when\r\n\r\nwe  accept  this 15% reduction in our total wage  cost,  we  are\r\n\r\nappealing to the companies to retain the workers in this  period\r\n\r\nof crisis, and retrench only as a last resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, housing is not a problem. We must thank HDB and\r\n\r\nits \"Home Ownership\" scheme.  Since as many as 90% of our people\r\n\r\nown their own homes,  even in this time of economic crisis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey do not have to worry that they may be thrown\r\n\r\nout of their homes by unscrupulous landlords when they default\r\n\r\nin paying their rents.  But in many other countries, like Korea,\r\n\r\nfor example, the workers live in quarters provided by their\r\n\r\nemployers.  The moment they lose their jobs, they lose their\r\n\r\nshelters over their heads too.  In fact, in most developed\r\n\r\ncountries, home ownership is about 60% (40% of them are living\r\n\r\nin rented properties).  Once they lose their jobs, they will be\r\n\r\nthrown out of their house.  So to them, unemployment benefit is\r\n\r\nof paramount importance.  Despite that, in many of these so-called  welfare states, many people are sleeping in the streets.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, our situation is different.  We have different\r\n\r\nschemes to help our people.  Therefore, I feel that our model is\r\n\r\na better one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another social security is medical benefits. We all know that\r\n\r\nour  workers  in Singapore are adequately provided with  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.   They  have  the  Medisave  accounts  and  they  have\r\n\r\nMediShield.  For those who genuinely cannot afford to pay  their\r\n\r\nmedical  fees,  there  is  Medifund to  stake  them  out.  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh Chok Tong has stated on more than one occasion that\r\n\r\nno  one  in Singapore will be deprived of medical benefits  just\r\n\r\nbecause he has no money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another social security is education. In Singapore, there are\r\n\r\nplaces  for  all  school-going children.   The  quality  of  our\r\n\r\neducation  is  good.  Government has set up an Edusave  Fund  to\r\n\r\nhelp  meet  the educational needs of every child aged between  6\r\n\r\nand  16.   Workers can use their CPF to pay for  their  own  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children's tertiary education.  For university  students,\r\n\r\nif  they are in difficulty, they can apply for loans.  About 25%\r\n\r\nof our students receive some form of bursary or scholarship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, if workers lose their jobs, their children\r\n\r\nhave  to  stop  going to school because they cannot  afford  the\r\n\r\nfees.   There  is a report in the newspapers that  half  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian children have stopped going to school.  Such a report\r\n\r\nmay  be  exaggerated  but it is true that many  parents  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger  afford  to  send their children to  school.   This  will\r\n\r\nresult in a loss in one generation, with very serious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsequences.  In Singapore, every effort is made\r\n\r\nto help children from families in financial hardship to remain\r\n\r\nin school and to receive education, and bursaries are offered by\r\n\r\nNTUC,  the grassroots organisations and various organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a comprehensive system of in-employment training. The\r\n\r\nSkills Development Fund subsidises the training cost.  The NTUC-initiated  Skills Redevelopment Programme is aimed at  upgrading\r\n\r\nthe  skills  of  workers, especially the older and less-educated\r\n\r\nones.  In  the SRP and CREST alone, the Government has committed\r\n\r\n$240 million.  This is the best welfare because it helps workers\r\n\r\nto acquire the necessary skills to stay employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the training programme for workers, we would like to\r\n\r\nrequest the Government to set up a task force to study the needs\r\n\r\nof  older and the less educated workers.  This task force should\r\n\r\nprovide  the workers with information on vacancies and types  of\r\n\r\nskills  required in the market and educate them to change  their\r\n\r\nattitudes  so  that they will be prepared to accept  jobs  which\r\n\r\nthey  were  previously rejecting.  At the same  time,  the  task\r\n\r\nforce   can  educate  the  employers  so  that  they  will   not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against the employment of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may ask: \"Since Singapore is not a welfare state,\r\n\r\nwhere   can   the   retrenched  workers  turn  to?\"    Although,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not a welfare state, we have all sorts of  schemes\r\n\r\nwhich  are  even better than the welfare state system   to  help\r\n\r\nthose who really need help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are in difficulties, they often seek help from\r\n\r\ntheir  MPs.   Some  of  them  say that  they  cannot  pay  their\r\n\r\nutilities  bills, S&C charges, rentals, etc.  As  MPs,  we  know\r\n\r\nwhere  to  turn  to  for  assistance  to  these  people.    Many\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations like the CDCs and self-help groups  are\r\n\r\nready  to extend a helping hand.  In extreme cases, there is  of\r\n\r\ncourse  the public assistance scheme, the bridging loan  scheme,\r\n\r\nSmall   Families  Improvement  Scheme,  Rental   and   Utilities\r\n\r\nAssistance   Scheme,   Edufund  and   the   assistance   schemes\r\n\r\nestablished by the various community self-help groups.  So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong as they accept our recommendations, they will\r\n\r\nbe looked after under any of  these schemes that are relevant to\r\n\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those workers who were retrenched, and are unionized, the\r\n\r\nunions  will  negotiate with the employers.  Many  are  paid  an\r\n\r\naverage  of two weeks' wages for every year of service rendered,\r\n\r\nand some get as much as 12 to 24 months of salaries in terms  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits.  Not too long ago, I had the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  find out from an officer from a developed country that there\r\n\r\nis  a  cap of 12 months' salaries as unemployment benefits.   So\r\n\r\nactually  our retrenchment benefits compare favourably with  the\r\n\r\nwelfare states.  As for those who are not unionized and are  not\r\n\r\nin  a position to negotiate with their employers, I urge them to\r\n\r\nquickly organise themselves and register as  members of the NTUC\r\n\r\nso that we can help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our social security network is good, there is\r\n\r\nstill room for improvement.  For example, we need to look at how\r\n\r\nwe  can  simply  find  procedures for applications  for  various\r\n\r\nschemes  to help workers in distress.  Perhaps, we can also  see\r\n\r\nhow we can improve on the level of support, especially for those\r\n\r\nwho remain unemployed for a long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge the Government to set up a one-stop agency\r\n\r\nwhich  could coordinate the various financial schemes.  In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  CDC  is well placed to be the focal point of all assistance\r\n\r\nschemes.   In other words, if an unemployed person goes  to  the\r\n\r\nCDC, he can seek not only financial assistance but also help  in\r\n\r\nfinding  an  alternative job through the  Internet  network   or\r\n\r\nthrough  other means which can be  coordinated by the  CDC.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  the CDC will be able to help the unemployed  persons\r\n\r\nget  all  the  relevant  assistance under  one  roof,  including\r\n\r\nmatching  up  of  training courses and job vacancies  available.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  counselling can also  be  provided  to  help  the\r\n\r\nworried  unemployed persons cope with stress and  learn  how  to\r\n\r\nmanage family expenses and job expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a necessity for us to\r\n\r\nenlighten the people in Singapore on  our social network and to\r\n\r\nlet them know how to seek assistance from these schemes, if\r\n\r\nnecessary.

As the regional crisis has deepened and spread, we\r\n\r\nhave  been drawn in.  Our economy does not have the problems  of\r\n\r\nthe other countries in difficulty.  Our banking system is sound.\r\n\r\nOur  companies  have not borrowed excessively,  especially  from\r\n\r\nabroad.  Neither  has  the Government. Government  finances  are\r\n\r\nstrong, with adequate reserves built up over many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the collapse of regional demand, and the change in\r\n\r\nthe  business  climate has caused our economy to  slow  sharply,\r\n\r\nfrom  6.2%  in the 1st Quarter 1998 to -0.7% in the 3rd  Quarter\r\n\r\n1998.  We  have  now  had two quarters of  negative  quarter-on-quarter growth, and are technically in recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government implemented a $2 billion package of cost\r\n\r\nreduction  measures  in June.  These were not  intended  as  the\r\n\r\nfinal  package.  We could not take drastic measures, such  as  a\r\n\r\nCPF  cut,  lightly.  We needed time to assess how  events  would\r\n\r\ndevelop  and we used the time to develop the consensus necessary\r\n\r\nfor stronger measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC), the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has over the last 18 months tapped a wide  range  of\r\n\r\nprivate sector views on ways to strengthen the economy.  The CSC\r\n\r\nhas  recommended  both  long-term  and  short-term  measures  to\r\n\r\nimprove Singapore's competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term measures are a comprehensive strategy for\r\n\r\nSingapore to invest in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits human resources and infrastructure, to build up\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services, and to continue to grow and develop.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis is on building new capabilities and new areas of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short term measures focus on reducing business costs, to\r\n\r\nhelp companies to survive the crisis, and to preserve jobs.  The\r\n\r\nproposal is to reduce wage costs significantly, through a cut in\r\n\r\nthe  employer's  CPF contribution rate and in  flexi-wages,  and\r\n\r\nalso to reduce non-wage costs to make an overall package of  $10\r\n\r\nbillion, or 7% of GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the CSC Report and the thrust of the CSC\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  They will not only help Singapore to  overcome\r\n\r\nthe present problems, but also lay the foundations for sustained\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has made some 300 specific proposals. We will study\r\n\r\nthem  individually to decide how to implement each one.  In some\r\n\r\ncases   we   have   already  acted,  for   example,   with   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  further  develop  the  financial   services\r\n\r\nsector, and the June package of off-budget measures.\r\n\r\nWe   will   implement  the  long  term  measures  progressively.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  short term recommendations call for an  immediate\r\n\r\nresponse.   The  Government has worked out  a  substantial  cost\r\n\r\nreduction  package covering the key elements of business  costs,\r\n\r\nas proposed by the CSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wage Costs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with wages. Labour cost is a key component of\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs.   The  CSC has proposed that  Singapore  reduce\r\n\r\noverall wage costs by 15% from the 1997 level.  This will  bring\r\n\r\nour  relative unit labour cost back to the position in 1994, and\r\n\r\nwill  substantially  improve our international  competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe CSC has recommended that part of this 15% should be achieved\r\n\r\nthrough  a  10%  point reduction in employer's CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate,  from  20% to 10%.  This represents some 8%  reduction  in\r\n\r\noverall wage costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council (NWC) has endorsed the CSC proposal,\r\n\r\nand recommended that wages be reduced by 5% to 8% from 1997\r\n\r\nlevels.  Together with the 10% point CPF cut, this will be\r\n\r\nsufficient to achieve the target of 15% reduction in overall\r\n\r\nwage costs.  The wage reduction should be implemented through\r\n\r\nthe flexible wage system, ie, by cutting variable components of\r\n\r\nwages such as bonuses. The NWC urged employers to moderate the\r\n\r\nwage cut for lower income employees by implementing a\r\n\r\nproportionately deeper cut for the higher income executives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF Reduction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the CSC's recommendation to reduce the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contributions by 10% points.  Of this, 6%  points\r\n\r\nwill  come  from the Ordinary Account, and 4% points  will  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Special  Account.  In effect,  contributions  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Account will be suspended for the time being.\r\n\r\nFor  older  workers whose CPF contribution rates are  less  than\r\n\r\n40%,  and for pensionable civil servants receiving partial  CPF,\r\n\r\nthe reduction in their employer's CPF contributions will be pro-rated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cut will take effect from 1st January 1999. It will\r\n\r\nremain  in  place for 2 years.  Thereafter, the Government  will\r\n\r\nreview  the situation.  The Government agrees with the NWC  that\r\n\r\nthe  rate of employer's contribution should be adjusted  upwards\r\n\r\nwhen the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cut will reduce costs by about $3.9 billion per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Government Accepts NWC Recommendations</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts all of the NWC's recommendations,\r\n\r\nincluding  the recommendation to reduce wages by 5%  to  8%.  We\r\n\r\nurge  companies  to  follow  the NWC guidelines  in  their  wage\r\n\r\nnegotiations   and  decisions  on  bonuses.    Companies   which\r\n\r\ncompleted their wage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnegotiations earlier should review their plans if\r\n\r\ntheir previous assumptions about the economic environment are no\r\n\r\nlonger valid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% to 8% reduction in wages is estimated to cut costs by\r\n\r\nabout $3.6 billion per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>NWC Award for Civil Servants</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a major employer, the Government will take the lead in\r\n\r\nimplementing  the NWC's revised wage recommendations  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government will reduce the Annual Variable Component\r\n\r\n(AVC)  to  be  paid  in  December.  Last  year,  civil  servants\r\n\r\nreceived two months of AVC: 3/4 month in July and 1 1/4 month  in\r\n\r\nDecember.  This year in July, the Government paid 1/2  month,  a\r\n\r\nreduction  of 1/4 month.  In December, the Government  will  pay\r\n\r\n1/4  month's AVC, which is one month less than last year.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  a  total reduction of 1 1/4 months in AVC payment for  the\r\n\r\nyear.   However, the usual Annual Wage Supplement or 13th  month\r\n\r\npayment will be paid in full.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year, the Government will decide on civil service\r\n\r\nannual  variable  payments  after  the  NWC  has  published  its\r\n\r\nproposals for 1999, which it usually does in May.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government will reduce the variable component of\r\n\r\nmonthly salaries of officers in Division II and above.  The  cut\r\n\r\nwill  be in the Non-Pensionable Variable Payment (NPVP) that  is\r\n\r\npaid  monthly, and will be graduated.  It will be 1% of  monthly\r\n\r\nsalaries  for Division II officers, 2% for Division I  timescale\r\n\r\nofficers,  3%  for Superscale officers, and 5% for  Staff  Grade\r\n\r\nofficers.  There will be no cut for junior staff at the Division\r\n\r\nIII  and  IV  levels and daily-rated employees.  This  reduction\r\n\r\nwill take effect from 1st January 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cuts in NPVP will be for one year, and will be reviewed at\r\n\r\nthe end of 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government will suspend the normal annual adjustments\r\n\r\nto salaries of Ministers and top civil servants for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond year in 1999.  The Government had followed\r\n\r\nthe private sector down in 1997 when the benchmark of private\r\n\r\nsector salaries had declined by 8%, but it did not follow back\r\n\r\nup this year when the benchmark rose by 13%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year, the benchmark for Staff Grade I has increased by\r\n\r\n19%,  and  that for Superscale G by 12%. I do not believe  these\r\n\r\nlarge  increases  reflect  current  conditions  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  The mismatch arises because of the long time  lag:  the\r\n\r\n1999  benchmark  is  based on private sector earnings  in  1997,\r\n\r\nbefore  Singapore felt the impact of the regional  crisis.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will study ways to reduce this time lag, in order  to\r\n\r\nmake public sector salaries reflect private sector conditions in\r\n\r\na more timely and responsive manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures will apply to both civil servants and\r\n\r\npolitical appointment holders.  They will reduce the total civil\r\n\r\nservice wage bill by $176 million, or 6.2%. The combined  effect\r\n\r\nof  reductions in monthly and annual variable salary  components\r\n\r\nwill result in higher level officers accepting steeper wage cuts\r\n\r\nthan   more   junior   officers,  in   line   with   the   NWC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  In terms of annual pay, the cuts range from  5%\r\n\r\nfor  Division  III  and  IV officers, to  10%  for  Staff  Grade\r\n\r\nofficers, including Ministers and this is separate from the  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts, which naturally also apply to civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance Schemes For Mortgages</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage and CPF reductions will affect many Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nhave  committed  to mortgages, especially those who  planned  to\r\n\r\nrepay  their  mortgages  out of their  CPF  contributions.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower and the Housing and Development Board  have\r\n\r\nstudied the problem.  After the CPF cut, 18% of CPF members will\r\n\r\nhave  insufficient monthly CPF contributions to  their  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount to pay for their housing instalments.  But despite this,\r\n\r\nHDB  has  found that most HDB borrowers have been  prudent,  and\r\n\r\nhave  not  over-extended themselves.  They  should  have  little\r\n\r\nproblem continuing to service their loans as long as they remain\r\n\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent falls in interest rates will help to cushion the\r\n\r\nimpact of the CPF cut on borrowers.  Singapore banks have also\r\n\r\nstated their willingness to help customers who face problems\r\n\r\nrepaying their mortgage loans, for example, by rescheduling\r\n\r\ntheir loan repayments.  Nevertheless, the Government will\r\n\r\nimplement supporting measures to help Singaporeans cope with\r\n\r\nthese difficulties, as we did in 1986.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Use of CPF Special Account</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For CPF members whose reduced Ordinary Account contributions\r\n\r\nwill  now be insufficient to pay their mortgages, the Government\r\n\r\nwill allow them to use the balances in their Special Accounts to\r\n\r\nmeet the shortfall in repayment caused by the CPF cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bridging Loan Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also introduce a Bridging Loan Scheme for\r\n\r\nmembers who have depleted the savings in both their Ordinary and\r\n\r\nSpecial Accounts for their monthly repayments.  The loan will be\r\n\r\nat a concessionary rate of the CPF interest rate plus 0.1%.  The\r\n\r\nscheme will apply to private property mortgages, as well as  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  owners  paying HDB market interest rates, ie, Credit  POSB\r\n\r\nhousing loan interest rates, for their mortgages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>HDB Schemes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most HDB lessees are already paying the concessionary interest\r\n\r\nrate  of  the CPF rate plus 0.1% for their mortgages.   The  HDB\r\n\r\nwill take several measures to help them.  For example, they  may\r\n\r\ninclude more working family members as joint owners, in order to\r\n\r\ndraw  upon  their  CPF  monies.  They can reduce  their  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments, lengthen the term of their mortgage loan, or  defer\r\n\r\nmortgage payments. Those in arrears may pay the outstanding  sum\r\n\r\nby   instalments.   HDB  will  also  assist  applicants   taking\r\n\r\npossession of new flats who are affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Taxes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give substantial tax rebates as part of this\r\n\r\npackage. Unlike in the previous recession in 1985, we are giving\r\n\r\nrebates rather than reducing the tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrates.  This is because we have progressively and\r\n\r\nsignificantly reduced our major tax rates since 1985.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the corporate tax rate was 40% in 1985, but is now only\r\n\r\n26%, close to our long-term target of 25%.  The property tax\r\n\r\nrate was 23%, but is now only 12%.  Our tax rates are now\r\n\r\ngenerally competitive internationally. No major changes are\r\n\r\nimmediately necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will go as far as possible to help businesses\r\n\r\nduring  this difficult period.  However, any tax concessions  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the present problem should be broadly consistent with  our\r\n\r\nlong   term   taxation  policies,  and  should  not  erode   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's tax base after the crisis has passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebate on Corporate Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signal our commitment to help businesses, a corporate tax\r\n\r\nrebate  of  10%  will  apply to corporate  income  for  Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 1999, excluding Singapore dividends.  This will  cost\r\n\r\n$450 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of Property Tax Rebate and Stamp Duty Exemption</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The June off-Budget measures included a 55% property tax rebate\r\n\r\non  commercial and industrial properties for the year commencing\r\n\r\n1st July 1998.  This 55% rebate will be extended by another year\r\n\r\nto  30th  June  2000.  HDB and JTC will pass the rebates  on  to\r\n\r\ntheir tenants and lessees.  Landlords in the private sector  are\r\n\r\nalso urged to pass on the rebates. The exemption of property tax\r\n\r\nfor  land  under development, which was announced  in  the  FY98\r\n\r\nBudget Statement, will also continue.  These measures will  cost\r\n\r\nthe Government $680 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension of stamp duty on contract notes for share\r\n\r\ntransactions, which started on 30th June 1998, will be  extended\r\n\r\nfor another year.  This will cost the Government $70 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>GST</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have asked for the GST rate to be reduced from 3%.\r\n\r\nHowever, this would be the wrong approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a reduction of the GST rate to 2% or 1% would cost the\r\n\r\nGovernment a large amount of revenue.  The GST was introduced in\r\n\r\norder to achieve a better balance between direct taxes like the\r\n\r\ncorporate tax, and indirect taxes like GST.  When GST was\r\n\r\nintroduced, both corporate and personal income taxes were cut\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  The overall package was revenue neutral; in\r\n\r\nfact, in the short term, revenue negative.  The GST is therefore\r\n\r\nan integral part of our revenue structure, and not something\r\n\r\noptional which we can lightly give up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, from the economic point of view, the GST is a \"good\"\r\n\r\ntax.  I know from the taxpayers' point of view, there is no such\r\n\r\nthing,  but, economically, this is a good tax.  It is a  tax  on\r\n\r\nconsumption,  not  income.  Its incidence is widely  and  evenly\r\n\r\ndistributed across all types of economic activity.  So  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  amount of revenue collected, the burden of the GST is felt\r\n\r\nless heavily than other taxes.  It is better to give rebates  on\r\n\r\nother taxes, such as property tax, which levy a higher rate on a\r\n\r\nnarrower range of activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a comprehensive package of rebates for lower\r\n\r\nincome  households to offset the impact of the  GST,  which  are\r\n\r\nstill in effect.  If our concern is the impact of the crisis  on\r\n\r\nlower  income  households,  then it  is  far  more  precise  and\r\n\r\neffective to extend the GST offsets package, than to change  the\r\n\r\nGST rate itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC did not recommend changing the GST rate. However, it\r\n\r\ndid propose one minor refinement to our GST scheme.  It observed\r\n\r\nthat the current exemption limits on Goods and Services tax  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  returning from abroad are  rather  generous.   For\r\n\r\ntravellers  who are out of the country for more than  48  hours,\r\n\r\nthe  exemption  limit is $400 for adults and $200  for  children\r\n\r\nbelow 18 years old.  For travel less than 48 hours, the limit is\r\n\r\n$200  for adults and $100 for children.  This has resulted in  a\r\n\r\nsignificant   leakage   of  retail  business   to   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  as  Singaporean day-trippers shop abroad.   The  CSC\r\n\r\nrecommended tightening the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexemption limits in order to help the domestic\r\n\r\nretail trade, which is facing a protracted downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation. The new limits will\r\n\r\nbe as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travellers away for more than 48 hours, $300 for adults and\r\n\r\n$100 for children;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travellers away between 24 and 48 hours, $150 for adults and\r\n\r\n$50 for children;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travellers away for less than 24 hours, $50 for adults with\r\n\r\nno exemption for children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will take effect tomorrow, 25th November 1998. You can\r\n\r\nhave a final fling tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies depend heavily on foreign workers, especially\r\n\r\nmanufacturing companies.  While the Government uses the  Foreign\r\n\r\nWorker Levy (FWL) to regulate demand for foreign workers, to the\r\n\r\ncompanies the FWL is a significant cost burden.\r\n\r\nThe  reduction in CPF contributions for citizens  allows  us  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  foreign worker levy while maintaining the  relative\r\n\r\nwage   costs  between  Singaporean  and  foreign  workers,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore without creating an incentive for companies to  employ\r\n\r\nforeign workers and displace Singaporean workers.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  will reduce the foreign worker  levy  for  both\r\n\r\nskilled and unskilled foreign workers.\r\n\r\na.  The levy for skilled workers in all sectors will be reduced\r\n\r\nfrom $100 to $30 across the board.  This is the second round  of\r\n\r\nreductions  this  year, as we had reduced the levy  for  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers in April from $200 to $100.\r\n\r\nb.  The levy for unskilled foreign workers will be reduced  by\r\n\r\n$90  for  companies  in the manufacturing, marine  and  services\r\n\r\nsectors.    These   sectors  are  more  prone  to   competition,\r\n\r\nregionally and internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc.  The levy for unskilled construction workers\r\n\r\nwill remain unchanged, as we need to continue to upgrade the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry to use more skilled labour and improve\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy for domestic maids will also remain unchanged, as it is\r\n\r\nnot a cost burden on businesses, and working mothers are already\r\n\r\nallowed  to claim double tax deduction on the cost of  the  maid\r\n\r\nlevy from their income tax assessments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this will disappoint many MPs including Mr Chiam who\r\n\r\nasked for it, but then he asked for everything.  So I have asked\r\n\r\nmy  colleague,  Dr Lee Boon Yang, to give him a  fuller  and,  I\r\n\r\nhope, a more satisfying explanation tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reductions will take effect from 1st January 1999. They\r\n\r\nwill yield cost savings of about $204 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Talent</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that at such difficult times, some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we  should do the opposite, ie.  raise  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworker  levy  and  exclude foreign workers,  in  an  attempt  to\r\n\r\npreserve  jobs  for  Singaporeans.  But this would  be  counter-productive.   Compelling  companies to recruit  Singaporeans  at\r\n\r\nhigher cost than foreign workers or professionals can only  work\r\n\r\nin  the  short  term.  But in the longer-term the companies  may\r\n\r\nrelocate elsewhere, or simply close down if this makes them  not\r\n\r\nviable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to preserve jobs for Singaporeans is to allow firms\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility to employ some foreign workers, and at the same\r\n\r\ntime  to  upgrade and retrain Singaporean workers to  make  them\r\n\r\nproductive and employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, it is vital for us to continue attracting\r\n\r\ntalent, because international competition will be based  on  the\r\n\r\nknowledge,  expertise,  creativity and entrepreneurship  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   The Government has formed a multi-Ministry  committee,\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Singapore Talent and Recruitment (STAR)  Committee,\r\n\r\nwith  BG  George Yeo as Chairman and Dr Lee Boon Yang as  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noversee this strategic effort.  Its mandate covers\r\n\r\nall aspects of international talent attraction and retention, in\r\n\r\norder to make Singapore a hub for international talent, while\r\n\r\nretaining our social cohesiveness and national resilience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial Land</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our high land cost is conspicuous to investors and is a major\r\n\r\nhandicap  in  investment  promotion.   The  industrial  property\r\n\r\nmarket  has softened considerably.  It has fallen by  about  30%\r\n\r\nsince last year.  And recent URA tenders of industrial land have\r\n\r\nconfirmed this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>JTC</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will reduce its posted\r\n\r\nland  rentals  to  reflect  current market  conditions.   Posted\r\n\r\nrentals for industrial land will come down by an average of  24%\r\n\r\nfor  outlying  areas  and  40% for  urban  and  suburban  areas,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  locations.   Rentals  for  flatted  and  standard\r\n\r\nfactories will come down by 20 - 30%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower rates will take effect on 1st January 1999. These\r\n\r\nwill  be  permanent reductions, and not temporary rebates.   The\r\n\r\nrevised  posted  rents  will form a lower  base  for  subsequent\r\n\r\nrental adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, for lessees paying rentals at posted rates, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no rental escalation for two years, in 1999 and  2000.\r\n\r\nThereafter,  their rentals will be subject to a  maximum  annual\r\n\r\nincrease  of  5.5%, reduced from the present cap of  7.6%.  This\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that JTC will automatically raise rents  by  5.5%\r\n\r\nevery  year. The actual adjustment will vary from year to  year,\r\n\r\ndepending on business conditions.  Nevertheless, for lessees who\r\n\r\nprefer certainty, JTC will offer the alternative of a fixed rate\r\n\r\nof  increase  of  4%  per annum throughout the  lease  duration,\r\n\r\nregardless of market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing JTC lessees and tenants who are paying rentals above\r\n\r\nthe revised rate will have their contractual rent reduced to the\r\n\r\nrevised rates.  Those paying below the revised posted rates will\r\n\r\ncontinue to enjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir current rebates up to end-1999.  JTC's rental\r\n\r\nreductions are estimated to yield savings in business costs of\r\n\r\n$230 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>HDB</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will make similar adjustments. HDB will reduce rentals for\r\n\r\nindustrial  land lessees, and rents of commercial and industrial\r\n\r\ntenancies which exceed the new posted rates, through contractual\r\n\r\nrent  revision  or rent rebates.  For commercial and  industrial\r\n\r\ntenants  paying above posted rates, the rebates will be  subject\r\n\r\nto  an  overall rebate cap of 20%.  For land lessees and tenants\r\n\r\nof industrial factories, workshops and commercial properties who\r\n\r\nare  paying below the new posted rates, HDB will continue  their\r\n\r\nexisting rebates until December 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's reductions will contribute savings of $76 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transport and Communications</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport and communications are a vital sector of our economy,\r\n\r\nand  form  an  important component of business costs.   We  will\r\n\r\nreduce a broad range of costs in this sector, spanning air, land\r\n\r\nand  sea transport as well as telecommunications, in support  of\r\n\r\nthe   efforts  to  bring  down  overall  business  costs.    The\r\n\r\nreductions will amount to $790 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's measures to restrain ownership of vehicles have\r\n\r\nbeen   effective  in  controlling  congestion.   But   ownership\r\n\r\nmeasures  have been a blunt instrument, which cannot distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween those who add to congestion and those that do not.   The\r\n\r\nhigh ownership charges that are necessary have added to business\r\n\r\ncosts.  With Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), we are able to shift\r\n\r\nemphasis  from ownership to usage management measures. And  this\r\n\r\nshould  enable  us  to  achieve the  same  effect  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling congestion, but using lower taxes and charges.\r\n\r\nTherefore   the  Government  will  not  be  slowing   down   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the ERP system, or giving any rebates on ERP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges.  It will press on to expand the ERP system\r\n\r\nto better manage traffic flow.  This will allow us to reduce\r\n\r\nownership charges and thus the overall cost of operating\r\n\r\nvehicles.  However, reduction of ownership charges, especially\r\n\r\nupfront costs such as the customs duty and ARF, cannot be done\r\n\r\ntoo suddenly, as this would affect the asset value of existing\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, the Government will reduce the customs duty on cars\r\n\r\nfrom  41% of OMV to 31% of OMV.  The customs duty for new  taxis\r\n\r\nwill  similarly be reduced from 17% to 7% OMV.  This  will  take\r\n\r\neffect tomorrow, 25th November 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first phase of ERP, the Government gave a rebate on road\r\n\r\ntax  of $200 per PCU.  For the second year, the Government plans\r\n\r\nto  grant  a larger road tax rebate of $250 per PCU.  This  will\r\n\r\ntake  effect  from  1st  September  1999,  in  tandem  with  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of the Electronic Road Pricing system under Phase 2.\r\n\r\nExcise  duties on petrol and diesel are revenue items, but  they\r\n\r\nare  also  a traffic management tool, albeit a blunt  one,  that\r\n\r\nhelps to discourage excessive use of cars and to promote greater\r\n\r\nuse of public transport. Excise duty on high-speed diesel is 7.4\r\n\r\ncents  per  litre. Petrol excise duty is currently 46%  of  pump\r\n\r\nprice,  subject  to  floor rates which vary  for  the  different\r\n\r\ngrades of petrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ERP, we will completely remove the excise duty on high-speed diesel. We will also reduce petrol excise duties rate from\r\n\r\n46%  to 40%, and cut the floor rates by 7 cents per litre. Since\r\n\r\nat  present  petrol prices at the floor rates are effective  for\r\n\r\nmost  grades  of  petrol, the overall result is to  reduce  pump\r\n\r\nprices by at least 7 cents per litre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take effect from tomorrow, 25th November 1998. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  expects  the oil companies to pass  on  the  savings\r\n\r\narising from the reduction of excise duty fully and promptly  to\r\n\r\nmotorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reductions in land transport costs should yield savings of\r\n\r\n$320 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Sea and Air Transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime and Port Authority will extend a 20% port dues\r\n\r\nconcession  for  container ships, and give a similar  concession\r\n\r\nfor  harbour craft, with effect from 1st January 1999.  PSA, now\r\n\r\na  corporatised entity, has also agreed to give a one  time  10%\r\n\r\nrebate on lift-on/lift-off charges, local container store rents,\r\n\r\nKeppel  Distripark  rents, office properties  rents,  commercial\r\n\r\nwarehouses  rents, wharf handling and local store rents  at  the\r\n\r\nMulti-Purpose  Terminal, all with effect from 1st January  1999.\r\n\r\nThese are estimated to yield business savings of $32 million per\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will be giving\r\n\r\na  10% rebate on landing fees for airlines with effect from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 1999.  It will also extend rebates currently enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nairport retailers for another 12 months beyond June 1999.  These\r\n\r\nare  estimated to yield business savings of some $57 million per\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications form a significant component of business\r\n\r\ncosts,  especially  for  information-intensive  activities  like\r\n\r\nfinance and banking. Telecommunication tariffs have been falling\r\n\r\nsteadily  in Singapore, as in many other countries, as a  result\r\n\r\nof  rapid  technological advances, more liberal  regulation  and\r\n\r\ngreater  competition. However, there is still scope for them  to\r\n\r\ndecline further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS will reduce the licence fee for mobile radio-communications\r\n\r\nstations  with  effect from 1st January 1999.   This  will  mean\r\n\r\nbusiness savings of $2 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Telecom has informed the Government that it will be\r\n\r\nimplementing  a  tariff  reduction  package  of  $340   million,\r\n\r\nstarting  1st  January  1999.  This  comprises  two  components:\r\n\r\nfirst, rate reductions amounting to $90 million under the  price\r\n\r\ncontrol framework administered by TAS.  Second, additional  rate\r\n\r\nreductions,  new  calling  plans,  volume  discounts  and  other\r\n\r\nschemes  amounting to $250 million.  These are part of SingTel's\r\n\r\ncontinued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprovements in its tariff scheme in view of\r\n\r\nintensifying competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SingTel is a publicly-listed for-profit entity. It is making\r\n\r\nthese  changes  in  order  to respond to  the  current  economic\r\n\r\nconditions  and  impending competition,  and  to  contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  overall competitiveness which will in turn  benefit\r\n\r\nSingTel's business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Utilities - Electricity</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional currency realignments have made our electricity\r\n\r\ntariffs  less competitive.  The June off-budget package included\r\n\r\na  rebate  of  0.3 cts/kWh or a 2.6% reduction  in  the  average\r\n\r\nelectricity   tariff.   With  effect  from  1st  January   1999,\r\n\r\nSingapore Power will increase the rebate on electricity  tariffs\r\n\r\nfrom  0.3 cts/kWh to an average of 1.3 cts/kWh, for a period  of\r\n\r\ntwo  years.   However,  part of this  rebate  will  be  used  to\r\n\r\ncompensate the higher fuel costs incurred by Singapore Power, so\r\n\r\nthe  net  rebate  to consumers will average 0.9  cts/kWh,  or  a\r\n\r\nreduction of 7.7% in electricity tariffs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net rebate will vary somewhat between different consumers,\r\n\r\nbecause PowerGrid will be unbundling the charges for the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  electricity grid, to reflect actual costs incurred  by  the\r\n\r\ndifferent categories - Extra High Tension, High Tension, and Low\r\n\r\nTension.  Singapore Power will announce the details later.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  also remove the 2% Government  tax  levied  on\r\n\r\nhousehold utilities bills with effect from 1st January 1999. The\r\n\r\nelectricity tariff rebate and the removal of the Government  tax\r\n\r\nwill yield cost savings of $372 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other rates and fees</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government levies a multitude of rates and fees. We will\r\n\r\nnot freeze or reduce them across the board. Each of these levies\r\n\r\nhas  its  own  rationale  and purpose. To  freeze  all  of  them\r\n\r\nregardless  of  their  merits will hinder  the  Government  from\r\n\r\nmaking adjustments that become necessary from time to time.   It\r\n\r\nwill  create  rigidities and distortions which will  impair  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of our public services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government will review critically all its\r\n\r\nrates and fees, and lower those where there is justification. It\r\n\r\nhas identified $8 million of other fees and charges to be\r\n\r\nreduced in this package. These include rental concessions by\r\n\r\nvarious ministries to tenants, generally in the form of 10%\r\n\r\nrebates for one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these is the concession to hawkers paying market rents.\r\n\r\nEnvironment will extend the current one year rental rebate given\r\n\r\nto  these  hawkers  in  July 1998 for a further  six  months  to\r\n\r\nDecember  1999.   If  despite  this rebate  their  rental  still\r\n\r\nexceeds  the  January 1999 market rates, Environment  will  give\r\n\r\nthem  an  additional  rebate of up to 10%  for  12  months  from\r\n\r\nJanuary 1999.  In effect, many hawkers paying market rents  will\r\n\r\nget up to 20% off what they were paying before July 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other short-term measures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as we cut costs, we must also encourage\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  expand.  The economic agencies  will  work  with\r\n\r\ncompanies to support their promotion and marketing efforts.\r\n\r\nTo spur more investments in both manufacturing and services, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will reintroduce the Liberalised Investment Allowance\r\n\r\nScheme,  which  it  used  in  the  1985  recession.   Investment\r\n\r\nallowance  of  30% will be liberally granted for investments  in\r\n\r\nproductive  equipment  used  for qualifying  activities.   These\r\n\r\nactivities  include  manufacturing,  engineering  and   computer\r\n\r\nrelated  services,  as well as a wide range of  other  specified\r\n\r\nservices.     For   investments  which   meet   more   stringent\r\n\r\nrequirements  like  contribution  to  value  added,   a   higher\r\n\r\nallowance of 50% will be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebates for individuals and households</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reductions in CPF and bonuses will cause a drop in the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living that Singaporeans have become used to.  This\r\n\r\ncannot be avoided, because it is through this sacrifice that  we\r\n\r\nwill reduce our costs and strengthen our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be painful to Singaporeans, as we have grown\r\n\r\naccustomed to many years of steady growth and wage increases.\r\n\r\nBut because inflation is zero and even negative, actual\r\n\r\nstandards of living have fallen by less than earnings.\r\n\r\nRetrenchments and unemployment have risen, but jobs are still\r\n\r\navailable, provided workers are willing to be flexible. Flights\r\n\r\nout of Singapore over the Deepavali long weekend and during the\r\n\r\nDecember school holidays were and are fully booked. Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are still going overseas for holidays, maybe\r\n\r\nbringing their maids along, though perhaps to nearer\r\n\r\ndestinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everybody goes on overseas holidays. MPs have\r\n\r\nall  noticed  an  increase  in cases  at  their  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions of people asking for help to find a new job, or wanting\r\n\r\nto  change  their  HDB  booking to  a  smaller  flat  type.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  and will assist lower income  Singaporeans,  to\r\n\r\nhelp them avoid undue hardship as a result of the package.   For\r\n\r\nthis purpose, it will take the following measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>GST Offsets</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further assist lower income groups, we will extend the\r\n\r\npackage of rebates for HDB rentals and town council service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy charges, introduced in 1994, to offset the impact of\r\n\r\nGST.  These rebates were transitional measures meant to help 1-,\r\n\r\n2-,  and 3-room HDB households, and were due to expire by  March\r\n\r\n1999.   The  Government will now extend them for a  further  two\r\n\r\nyears. This will cost the Government $22 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Utilities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997 and 1998, the Government gave a set of utilities and\r\n\r\nservice  and  conservancy rebates to HDB 1-4 room households  to\r\n\r\noffset  the  increase in electricity and  water  tariffs.    The\r\n\r\nutilities rebates are $100 for 1-, 2-, and 3-room HDB flats  and\r\n\r\n$50  for  4-room  HDB flats.  There are also monthly  grants  in\r\n\r\nservice  and conservancy charges to these 1-, 2-, 3- and  4-room\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.  The Government will now extend these rebates for  a\r\n\r\nfurther two years. This will cost $72 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area of public concern is the cost of basic necessities,\r\n\r\nespecially   public   transport  fees  and   hospital   charges.\r\n\r\nGrassroots and union leaders have fed back to the Government the\r\n\r\nhope that transport companies and hospitals will pass on to  the\r\n\r\npublic their savings from the wage cuts, since wage costs form a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  part  of the business costs for  both.   These  are\r\n\r\nreasonable requests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has discussed this with the public transport\r\n\r\ncompanies.  They  have  agreed  to  pass  on  their  savings  to\r\n\r\ncommuters.   With effect from 1st January 1999, a 50 cents  fare\r\n\r\nrebate  will  be  given and added for every $10 topped  up  into\r\n\r\nfarecards.  Concession card holders will be given a 5%  discount\r\n\r\non the value of their monthly concession stamps.  The concession\r\n\r\nwill be for 12 months. The total cost to SBS, TIBS and SMRT will\r\n\r\nbe  $40  million  over a year.  Transitlink  will  announce  the\r\n\r\ndetails in a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Hospital charges</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government and restructured hospitals will review their charges\r\n\r\nto  pass  on  the cost reductions to Singaporeans. However,  the\r\n\r\nactual  reduction in hospital charges will depend on  individual\r\n\r\nhospitals and the class of ward. Different classes of wards have\r\n\r\ndifferent cost recovery targets. Some hospitals have been under-recovering  their  costs,  particularly  for  class  A  and   B1\r\n\r\npatients. Our newer hospitals are in deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals will be working out the impact of the cost\r\n\r\nreduction measures on their own business costs.  They will  give\r\n\r\nemphasis  to  reducing charges for class B2 and C patients,  who\r\n\r\ncan  expect  on average reductions in hospital bills  of  5-10%.\r\n\r\nThe reductions will be implemented in January 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have an effective medical safety net in place with\r\n\r\nour   system  of  different  ward  classes,  plus  Medisave  and\r\n\r\nMedifund.   Patients should choose the class of ward which  they\r\n\r\ncan   afford.   Those  using  Medisave  should  not   have   any\r\n\r\ndifficulties, because we have deliberately not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduced the Medisave component of CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the bill size in class C is already very low. Those\r\n\r\nwho still cannot afford to pay their Class C bills can apply for\r\n\r\nhelp from Medifund.  The Ministry of Health has advised Hospital\r\n\r\nMedifund  Committees to be more sympathetic  towards  those  who\r\n\r\nhave been adversely affected by the economic downturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>General relief measures</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also implement general relief measures for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, such as personal tax rebates, rebates  on  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges and rentals for HDB dwellers.  However,\r\n\r\nI shall not announce these today.  These are being worked out as\r\n\r\npart  of the Budget proposals for the next Financial Year.  They\r\n\r\nwill be tabled in the  Budget Speech next February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Companies Must Also Cut Non-Wage Costs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the Clerk to distribute a table\r\n\r\n(Cols.  1479  -  1482) of the total package of the  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures which summarises the position and shows that the  total\r\n\r\npackage  adds up to $10.5 billion over one year, more than  what\r\n\r\nthe  CSC  recommended?   [Copies of table  distributed  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers.]     This    will    substantially    strengthen    our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  It will help workers to keep their  jobs,  and\r\n\r\ncompanies to stay viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19981124/19981124-HA-0691479.htm\">table (Cols. 1479 - 1482)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, companies must not depend on cuts in wage costs and\r\n\r\nGovernment   charges  alone  to  solve  their  problems.   Their\r\n\r\nmanagements should also take the initiative to look for  savings\r\n\r\nfrom  their  non-wage costs. Most of these are internal  to  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.  For  example, they should study  how  they  can  use\r\n\r\ncapital  more efficiently, improve sales, streamline  processes,\r\n\r\nor  reduce inventories. However efficiently a company may  think\r\n\r\nit  is  run, there is always room to do better. Companies  which\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  trimming  their non-wage  costs  get  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nsavings. Every dollar saved this way is a dollar added to  their\r\n\r\nbottom  line,  just as much as a dollar saved from paying  lower\r\n\r\nCPF  or  smaller  bonuses. This will give companies  more  scope\r\n\r\neither to increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir earnings and avoid making a loss, or to\r\n\r\nreduce prices and increase sales, especially exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Balance of cost cuts</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three quarters of this cost saving package - $7.5 billion worth\r\n\r\n-  comprises wage costs, through the CPF reduction and  the  NWC\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to reduce wages.  In the public  discussion  of\r\n\r\nthe  CSC  Report  and  also here over the  last  two  days,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  has  often been asked whether wages  are  bearing  too\r\n\r\nlarge  a share of the burden, and whether the Government can  do\r\n\r\nmore.   Some have even suggested that the Government  match  the\r\n\r\nreduction in wage costs dollar for dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not possible. To understand why, we need to examine the\r\n\r\ncomposition of our GDP.  We can think of GDP as the sum  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  incomes generated for the domestic production of goods  and\r\n\r\nservices.   You  add  up  all the money earned  from  productive\r\n\r\neffort  and  that is our output for the year.  If you  use  this\r\n\r\n\"income  approach\" to GDP, then you can divide  GDP  into  three\r\n\r\ncomponents:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Wages (including salaries and CPF) which make up 43% of\r\n\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Indirect taxes (e.g. GST, ARF of cars) making up 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The remaining 47% of the GDP is gross operating surplus,\r\n\r\nie.  earnings  of  companies  and  statutory  boards,  including\r\n\r\ndepreciation.\r\n\r\nSo  wages,  43%;  indirect taxes 10%;  and  the  balance,  gross\r\n\r\noperating surplus, 47%.  So any cost reduction package will have\r\n\r\nto  come  out  of  either wages, indirect taxes, or  essentially\r\n\r\ncompany   earnings   (companies  meaning,  including   statutory\r\n\r\nboards).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis is already squeezing company earnings. Our\r\n\r\naim  is  to help companies improve their bottom lines.   Getting\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  bear a large share of this cost  reduction  would\r\n\r\ndefeat this objective.  So most of the cost reduction must  come\r\n\r\nfrom the other two components of GDP, ie, wage costs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment levies.  Since total wage costs are much\r\n\r\nlarger than Government charges, wages must inevitably account\r\n\r\nfor a large part of the total cost reduction package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course companies doing well may pass on their cost savings to\r\n\r\nconsumers,  or  invest  them  in business  expansion  or  worker\r\n\r\ntraining.   This  includes,  of  course,  statutory  boards  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies, such as JTC and Singapore  Telecom.\r\n\r\nHowever,  statutory boards and GLCs cannot simply run a  deficit\r\n\r\nin  order to give money away.  Santa Claus has not come to town.\r\n\r\nThey must operate as efficiently as possible so as to keep costs\r\n\r\nto  a  minimum.   They  also  have a responsibility  to  operate\r\n\r\ncommercially, just like any other company.  Even hospitals  must\r\n\r\nrun  efficiently and break even, given the cost recovery targets\r\n\r\nfor the different classes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we deviate from this cardinal principle, and our statutory\r\n\r\nboards and GLCs ignore their bottom lines to operate contrary to\r\n\r\ncommercial  and  economic logic, they will lose discipline,  and\r\n\r\nbecome  bloated  and  inefficient.   Service  will  deteriorate.\r\n\r\nEventually they must either go bankrupt and close down, or  else\r\n\r\nthe  Government must bail them out, and raise taxes to  pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir deficits . This is exactly what has happened in many other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $3 billion reduction in Government taxes and charges in this\r\n\r\npackage  is  substantial, especially coming on  top  of  the  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  announced in June, which was completely  borne  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and which, judging by the debate over these last  two\r\n\r\ndays,  has been largely forgotten.  We already expect  a  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  of 1% of GDP this year.  Ministry of Finance  estimates\r\n\r\nthe  deficit to grow to 3% to 4% of GDP next year.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nsharp contrast from our usual surplus budgets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a position to run this temporary deficit, only because\r\n\r\nwe have been prudently maintaining budget surpluses and building\r\n\r\nup  our  reserves for many years.  MPs and others have suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we  should dip more deeply into the reserves, in order  to\r\n\r\nminimise the hardship to Singaporeans.  Some have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven calculated how just a few percent of our\r\n\r\nreserves would mean many billions of dollars to spend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reservation is not with the arithmetic, but the psychology.\r\n\r\nIt  is like high-living heirs who cannot wait to divide up their\r\n\r\nwealthy  grandfather's estate.  If we did this, we would  change\r\n\r\nfrom being a nation of savers accumulating wealth to a nation of\r\n\r\nspenders depleting it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poh Say Teck ( ) wrote a piece in the\r\n\r\nLianhe Zaobao today, and as he said, this would send out all the\r\n\r\nwrong  signals.  First, that our situation is so grave  that  we\r\n\r\nhave no choice but to use the reserves, and second, that we have\r\n\r\na low threshold of pain, and cannot bear austerity and hardship.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an excellent piece.  It shows he understands, and  there\r\n\r\nare  Singaporeans who understand, and I commend it to you.   His\r\n\r\ntitle    is    Zhen   yao   dong   yong   lao    ben    ma?    [\r\n\r\n], loosely translated: \"Do we really want to eat our seed corn?\"\r\n\r\nSo  I asked Dr Ow Chin Hock, what does lao ben mean?  He says it\r\n\r\nis  very difficult to translate.  It really means the money  you\r\n\r\nkeep  for  your  old age.  Some people call it guan  cai  ben  [\r\n\r\n].  It is something you keep for a last resort, not spend at the\r\n\r\nfirst opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crisis is far from over. We must husband our reserves,\r\n\r\nbecause  we cannot tell what the future may bring.  We must  not\r\n\r\nspend  them  at the first sign of trouble, to generate  a  false\r\n\r\nsense  of  prosperity and well-being.  If we did,  the  reserves\r\n\r\nwould  soon  be  gone.   And the next time  we  run  into  rough\r\n\r\nweather,  which will happen sooner or later, we  would  have  no\r\n\r\nmore  safety  net, no more rabbits to pull out of the  hat.   We\r\n\r\nmust therefore get back to prudent, balanced budgets as soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Confidence</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are worried about what is happening. They have\r\n\r\nfollowed  events in the countries around us, and seen how  these\r\n\r\nhave  affected us.  They know retrenchments are higher,  bonuses\r\n\r\nare  smaller, and prospects are highly uncertain.  They want  to\r\n\r\nknow what we can do to help ourselves.  But to judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the recent TCS survey, they also know that we\r\n\r\nmust cut business costs to stay competitive (83% thought so).\r\n\r\nThey think that the Government has been effective in responding\r\n\r\nto the crisis (82% thought so), and they believe that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be the first country in Asia to recover (76% thought so).\r\n\r\nThese are substantial majorities, almost enough to cause the\r\n\r\nOpposition to lose their deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reason for confidence. Since the crisis began last\r\n\r\nyear,  Singapore has shown that it is different from  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   Not  only  is  our economy  sounder,  but  the  way\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have responded to this crisis has  shown  that  we\r\n\r\nunderstand this problem, we know where our interests lie, and we\r\n\r\nare  quietly  working  together to tackle this  challenge.   Few\r\n\r\nother  countries are in a position to implement a  package  like\r\n\r\nthis,  or  to  persuade  the workers to support  such  austerity\r\n\r\nmeasures as being in their own long term interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign investors and analysts have noted this, as have ratings\r\n\r\nagencies.  Standard & Poor's has just reaffirmed Singapore's AAA\r\n\r\nrating.  Fitch IBCA has rated us AA+, just one notch below  AAA,\r\n\r\nand  equal  to their rating for Japan.  As Fitch IBCA  commented\r\n\r\nwhen  they  made  this assessment: \"Singapore  stands  head  and\r\n\r\nshoulders  above most of its East Asian neighbours.   It  has  a\r\n\r\nwell-diversified,  open  economy; a  strong  external  financial\r\n\r\nposition;  and a sound, well-regulated financial system.   Deep-rooted economic fundamentals, matched by sound economic policies\r\n\r\nhave limited the fall of the Singapore dollar and should enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as a leading regional financial centre, vis-a-vis Hong Kong and Japan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Outlook</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package will help to make Singapore companies, and the\r\n\r\neconomy  as  a  whole, more competitive, to reduce retrenchments\r\n\r\nand  unemployment, to attract new investments and business,  and\r\n\r\nto lay the basis for long term prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot be certain that as a result of this package,\r\n\r\nthe economy will recover quickly.  That depends on developments\r\n\r\nin the region and the broader international economy that we can\r\n\r\nneither predict nor control.  At present the prospects are that\r\n\r\nIndonesia will take an extended period to stabilise and recover,\r\n\r\nwhile the situation in Malaysia following their imposition of\r\n\r\nexchange controls and the dismissal of former Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Anwar Ibrahim has not yet clarified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest to assume that we will have at least one more year\r\n\r\nof difficult conditions.  MTI has forecast growth of between -1%\r\n\r\nand +1% for 1999.  With this package, we hope growth will be  at\r\n\r\nthe upper end of the range.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crisis is not just an economic challenge. It is a\r\n\r\nchallenge to our social cohesion and national resilience.  Tough\r\n\r\ntimes  put  our mettle to the test.  The tougher the times,  the\r\n\r\nmore   we  must  bond  together,  strengthened  by  our   shared\r\n\r\nexperience   of   adversity  and  struggle.   Whatever   happens\r\n\r\nexternally  over the next few years, we have the resources,  and\r\n\r\nthe  resilience,  to  weather the storm.  Let  us  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncohesion  and sense of common purpose, and then we will preserve\r\n\r\nour  high  international  standing, and  emerge  stronger,  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive, and set to thrive for many more years.

I  want  to   seek   one\r\n\r\nclarification.  It appears from the Table, that  has  just  been\r\n\r\ncirculated,  that Government will incur a saving of  about  $7.5\r\n\r\nbillion  in  wage cost, and Government will forgo a  revenue  of\r\n\r\nabout  $3  billion.   If  my interpretation  of  this  Table  is\r\n\r\ncorrect,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is a net saving of $4 billion to the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There is a net saving of $7.5 billion in labour\r\n\r\ncosts to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not all the savings\r\n\r\nin  labour  costs accrue to the Government.  Many employers  are\r\n\r\nnot  the Government, contrary to popular perception.  And  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that they are going to pay the Government what  they\r\n\r\nsave.   So  most  of  the  $7.5  billion  accrues  not  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Government will be substantially out of  pocket\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of  this.  And I have said, we  are  expecting  a\r\n\r\ndeficit of 3% to 4% of GDP next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> My question to the Government is that\r\n\r\nfigures  notwithstanding,  whether  the  Government  will   also\r\n\r\nconsider pump priming the economy at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would also\r\n\r\nlike to join my colleague to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for\r\n\r\nthe  excellent speech covering many points.  But I just like  to\r\n\r\nask  one  question.  Can he explain why is it  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Government to actually look into measures like\r\n\r\nincome tax rebate for the personal level at this point in  time,\r\n\r\nbut leave it only to the Budget debate later in March next year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  ask  the DPM what is the rationale for not allowing reduction\r\n\r\nof the maid levy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we do consider\r\n\r\npump-priming measures.  Our June package did include some  pump-priming measures.  They are still in effect and we will consider\r\n\r\nwhether  we need to do some more next year.  I think we have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  this carefully because pump-priming measures  are  not\r\n\r\nthe  same  as  cost-cutting measures.  They stimulate  different\r\n\r\nparts of the economy.  We need to help the manufacturing sector,\r\n\r\nthe export services sector, maybe even the financial and banking\r\n\r\nsector,  telecommunications, transport.  These will not directly\r\n\r\nbe  helped by pump priming.  Because if we pump prime,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  money will go into infrastructure, that means construction,\r\n\r\nand we cannot have the rest of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy minus 5% and construction plus 50%, and\r\n\r\nclaim that we have a balanced economy.  We will be out of\r\n\r\nkilter.  So we will pump prime but the projects have to be\r\n\r\njustified.  We cannot build white elephant monuments.  We will\r\n\r\nidentify worthwhile projects which make sense for the long term.\r\n\r\nIf we have some more, they will be done in next year's budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax rebate, why not now? The answer is that you are\r\n\r\nnot paying tax now.  You have already paid tax for last year  in\r\n\r\nYear  of Assessment 1998 and the tax for Year of Assessment 1999\r\n\r\nis  not yet due.  We will announce the income tax rebate in good\r\n\r\ntime  for that purpose during the Budget because it is really  a\r\n\r\nBudget item.  And again, it is not a cost item.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the maid levy, as Mr Rai has asked, we have promised a\r\n\r\nfull and satisfying explanation tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

The other issue is on the prolonged unemployment\r\n\r\nfor  older workers.  Are there any contingency measures to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the problem, particularly, those aged between 48 and below\r\n\r\n55 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are rebates for\r\n\r\n1- to 3-room families.  Firstly, because of the GST offsets, and\r\n\r\nsecondly, because of the utilities offsets.  And on the  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges and rental rebates, which  I  think  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo  is specifically asking for, there is already a set, which\r\n\r\nwas announced in the last Budget, which is still running.  And I\r\n\r\nthink the next Budget will be a good time to announce an updated\r\n\r\nset  for  next  year.   But you can be sure  that  we  have  not\r\n\r\nneglected them because our focus should be on padding the impact\r\n\r\non the lower income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do about prolonged unemployment, particularly,\r\n\r\nfor  the older workers?  I think NTUC has been working very hard\r\n\r\nat  this  -  retraining them, reskilling them, also  encouraging\r\n\r\nthem  to  be  more  flexible  in their  expectations  and  their\r\n\r\napproach, what sort of job they are looking for, where  the  job\r\n\r\nis, what they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpecting to be paid for it.  NTUC's experience is,\r\n\r\nif they are willing to be flexible, the jobs are available.  The\r\n\r\ndifficulty arises when they have very specific desires and we\r\n\r\nare unable to accommodate them.  I think that as long as there\r\n\r\nare jobs available in the economy, we should be very slow to\r\n\r\nthink of touching the CPF or other structural measures which,\r\n\r\nonce done, cannot be undone and will change us into a different\r\n\r\nkind of society, one heavily dependent on safety nets rather\r\n\r\nthan self-reliance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  DPM,  with  the  reduction in the allowances  for  shopping\r\n\r\noverseas,  how much GST does he hope to recover?

Firstly,  I  quoted  DPM  Lee's\r\n\r\nParliamentary speech yesterday in my speech and I would like him\r\n\r\nto  clarify what has happened to his assessment made in February\r\n\r\n1998 and why, despite his assessment, he now says we need such a\r\n\r\ndeep cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is why is there a need for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to mandate the cut in wages.  I believe in  response\r\n\r\nto  the economic situation, the workers are already taking a cut\r\n\r\nand  every  individual company has a different profit  and  loss\r\n\r\nsituation.   Why  do  we want to set a percentage  of  reduction\r\n\r\nacross  the  board?   Why  cannot  we  leave  it  to  individual\r\n\r\ncompanies to decide?  I believe they know what to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am not very convinced about the explanation on the\r\n\r\npercentage on the component of wages, the profit of companies as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  Government charges, vis-a-vis GDP.   BG  Lee  has\r\n\r\nexplained  that wages are a major component.  But based  on  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  a  company, and this was published by  the  Trade  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  about 51% of the  business  cost  comprises\r\n\r\nservice  costs  as  well as indirect Government  tax.   Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  help  the companies to reduce  costs  by  first\r\n\r\ncutting the part on non-wages costs?  And then we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassess the situation again to see whether there is\r\n\r\na need for a wage cut because I think it is quite a painful\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> I wish to ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  will  consider giving  greater  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  or rebate for workers who may take this  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  go for further training and to improve their skills in order\r\n\r\nto prepare them for the next upturn in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S.C.

My\r\n\r\nanswer  is,  I  really do not know.  It depends  how  much  less\r\n\r\nfrequently he shops overseas.  But I imagine it will  be  a  few\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars  a year.  Will it cause a reappearance  of  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  jam?   I hope not, because our Customs will  be  doing\r\n\r\ntheir best in order to clear the cases efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked several very pertinent\r\n\r\nquestions.  First, what has changed since February when  I  said\r\n\r\nour costs were in line and we did not need a wage cut, unlike in\r\n\r\n1985.   I think the answer is, the world has changed.  The whole\r\n\r\nsituation  has  changed.  In February, we did not  see  so  many\r\n\r\nclouds  on  the horizon.  Since February, Indonesia  has  had  a\r\n\r\nrevolution and there is still a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical transition in process and riots from time\r\n\r\nto time, and no signs of being completed yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, in February, the news was that the banking system\r\n\r\nwas  sound, the companies were sound, a few needed marginal top-ups  in  capital  really as a voluntary, discretionary  gesture.\r\n\r\nBut  there  was no basic problem and the whole system  had  been\r\n\r\nstress-tested and it was all right.  But, today, in Malaysia, it\r\n\r\nis   in   a   different  situation.   They  have  Danamodal   to\r\n\r\nrecapitalise  the banks.  They have Danaharta to take  over  the\r\n\r\nbad loans and they are looking for large amounts of money to  be\r\n\r\nraised  overseas.   They  have imposed exchange  controls.   The\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister, who was also Finance Minister, has  been\r\n\r\ndismissed  and arrested, and the situation is quite a  lot  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated than it used to be.  We did not foresee all this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a broader landscape what used to be an Asian problem and\r\n\r\nwas  still  an  Asian  problem in February, became  an  emerging\r\n\r\nmarkets  problem.  In August, Russia defaulted and a chill  went\r\n\r\nthrough financial markets.  Dow Jones dropped drastically.  Then\r\n\r\npeople  focused  attention  on Brazil  and  countries  have  now\r\n\r\nscrambled  and cobbled together a $41 billion package to  rescue\r\n\r\nBrazil.   Brazil  has  promised on  oath  to  adhere  to  fiscal\r\n\r\nausterity and not to spend money which they have not earned  and\r\n\r\nto  bring  their budget in balance.  Even then, people  are  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether  this  is  going to solve the  Brazilian  problem.\r\n\r\nBecause  if the Brazilian problem does not get solved, then  the\r\n\r\nimpact on Europe and America will be very substantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, and around the world, as a result of this,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a tremendous shrinking back of investors.   They\r\n\r\ncall  it flight to quality, that means they only want to  invest\r\n\r\ntheir  money in the very safest and most liquid assets  like  US\r\n\r\ntreasury  bills  and  even then, the most  current  US  treasury\r\n\r\nbills,  and away from emerging markets.  So the emerging markets\r\n\r\nspread  has  gone up.  If a developing country wants  to  borrow\r\n\r\nmoney,  it  is T+.  At one stage, it was T+15%.  \"T\"  means  the\r\n\r\ntreasury bills interest rate, plus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15 percentage points.  That means it may cost you\r\n\r\n20% to borrow.  It is even more than sepuluh dua.  So now, it is\r\n\r\nT+9.  But there is a tremendous shrinking back of willingness to\r\n\r\nventure for funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole landscape has changed. We are an emerging market\r\n\r\ntrying  to  persuade investors that we are different from  other\r\n\r\nemerging markets, and that is why we must have one package,  not\r\n\r\nlittle  items, non-wage components first, let us give it a  try,\r\n\r\ndoes  not work, another little bit of component.  We have  taken\r\n\r\nsome time to sit together, assemble our ammunition and one bang.\r\n\r\nAnd  now we will have to see how the medicine works.  You cannot\r\n\r\ndo  these things by little trickles here and there, and hope  by\r\n\r\nfine-tuning  to  avoid hard decisions, that is disastrous.   The\r\n\r\nJapanese  have  tried that.  Little bangs every now  and  again.\r\n\r\nThey  have had seven or eight fiscal stimulation packages.  They\r\n\r\njust  had another big one, and the Nikkei dropped because people\r\n\r\nhave  lost confidence in the Japanese government.  The  Japanese\r\n\r\npeople have lost confidence in their own government.  So  if  we\r\n\r\nare  going to have a decisive measure, let us decide what  needs\r\n\r\nto be done, and do it.  And that is what we have done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why the Government needs to mandate the cut in wages, that\r\n\r\nis  also  a good question from Mr Low.  For many years  now,  we\r\n\r\nhave  moved away from that in the NWC recommendations and  given\r\n\r\nqualitative  recommendations.  In other words, we just  make  an\r\n\r\nassessment of the situation, give a sense of how tight or  slack\r\n\r\nthe  market is, but leave maximum room for companies to  discuss\r\n\r\nand  to  settle on their own without constraining  them  with  a\r\n\r\nguideline.  But this is the first time the NWC has to  come  out\r\n\r\nwith the recommendation to tighten wages rather than to increase\r\n\r\nwages.   We  are  working this because of our flexi-wage  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich we have operated since the last recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure that if we left it to companies and unions to say,\r\n\r\n\"Please  do your best and if need be, cut wages.\" they  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to resolve the matter quickly and expeditiously?  I doubt.\r\n\r\nBecause every union leader will feel under pressure from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis members to do the best he can for them at the\r\n\r\nnegotiating table.  If we have this NWC guideline, it does not\r\n\r\nconstrain the company to have to go between 5% and 8%.  But it\r\n\r\nsets expectations and therefore I think makes it easier for the\r\n\r\ntwo sides to converge on a solution which would take into\r\n\r\naccount the conditions in the company.  Some will be making\r\n\r\nmoney and want to have bigger bonuses.  Some already have got\r\n\r\nformulas by which bonuses go up and down with business and they\r\n\r\nshould stick to those formulas.  Some may be making greater\r\n\r\nlosses than this and may need to make even deeper cuts.  Those\r\n\r\nflexibilities, we allow.  But I think it is useful to set a\r\n\r\nclear signal nationally that this is a general direction, and\r\n\r\naround that thrust, we allow some freedom of manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about rebates for worker training. I\r\n\r\nthink there is a recommendation in the CSC Report for Skillsave.\r\n\r\nIt  is one of the recommendations which we will be studying.  It\r\n\r\nis  an  area  which we are sympathetic to.  The problem  is  not\r\n\r\nfinding  the money really.  The problem is making sure that  the\r\n\r\nprojects  are  viable and effective.  And we have already  given\r\n\r\n$100  million this year for the Skills Redevelopment  Programme.\r\n\r\nIf that is not sufficient, we will look for more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked about statutory boards and whether they need\r\n\r\nto  make  profits.  The answer is, it depends on which statutory\r\n\r\nboards.   A statutory board fulfilling an economic function  has\r\n\r\nto  function on economic principles.  JTC cannot give  its  land\r\n\r\naway for free because there is a value to the land and it has to\r\n\r\nprice  the  land properly, not just to protect the reserves  and\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the Elected President, but because if you misprice  the\r\n\r\nland, you will have misallocation of resources and all sorts  of\r\n\r\nindustries built here which should not be here.  Other statutory\r\n\r\nboards  like  EDB  and NPB, of course you will have  to  develop\r\n\r\nother  measures.  Because if EDB decides to make money, we  will\r\n\r\nget no investments.  It is a cost centre.  NPB should break even\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want to know that the training skills and  projects\r\n\r\nthey are doing are viable, and there is a demand for it.  It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvaries from company to company and statutory board\r\n\r\nto statutory board.  But I think where there is an economic\r\n\r\nfunction, then we must take that into account.  It is not just\r\n\r\nan arbitrary matter of dividing numbers by two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for monopoly of GLCs, he mentioned telecommunications,\r\n\r\nwater and electricity.  Are we sure that it has gone far enough?\r\n\r\nWe  have  to separate them into different categories.  Water  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  matter of reducing prices in order to match  costs.   In\r\n\r\nfact, we are raising water rates.  We did this year, and we will\r\n\r\ndo  it again next year.  It is for strategic reasons, and we are\r\n\r\nnot   going   to  change  that  because  we  have  to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to conserve water and to realise that the  cost  of\r\n\r\nthat  incremental drop of water is not just collecting  it  from\r\n\r\nthe  sky.  We have already collected all we can.  But distilling\r\n\r\nit that is very expensive.  Water is a different matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for electricity, it is not yet a competitive market but\r\n\r\nit  will be a competitive market with Tuas Power coming on-line.\r\n\r\nBut,  already, even within Singapore Power, there is competition\r\n\r\nbetween  Seraya and Senoko because we set up two companies  with\r\n\r\nnon-overlapping  boards  and  independent  directors,  and  they\r\n\r\ncompete against each other.  If you look at electricity tariffs,\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  electricity now varies by about a factor  of  two\r\n\r\nbetween the day time and night time.  For some of that,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  reflect  to  consumers in this package  so  that  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  will  have  the  right  incentives  to  operate,  for\r\n\r\nexample, three shifts, do more at night, and pay electricity  at\r\n\r\na lower price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for telecommunications, it is still a monopoly, but the\r\n\r\nmonopoly is running out because we have decided that come  April\r\n\r\n2000,  a  second  operator is going to provide  basic  telephony\r\n\r\nservices,  fixed  line  including  IDD,  and  that  prospect  of\r\n\r\ncompetition is a strong reason why Telecom is now bringing their\r\n\r\nprices  down.  There is some further distance to go compared  to\r\n\r\nwhat   prices   will   prevail  in  a   completely   competitive\r\n\r\ntelecommunications market.  We have to respect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelecom's monopoly until April 2000 because this\r\n\r\nwas the undertaking we gave when we corportised and privatised\r\n\r\nthe company and we have to honour and live up to our bargain\r\n\r\nwith the Telecom shareholders, which include people other than\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. I now\r\n\r\nunderstand that the Government has failed to foresee  the  rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  this economic crisis.  But  I  understand  that\r\n\r\nrecently,   there   were   some   favourable   assessments    by\r\n\r\ninternational agencies that economic conditions may  improve  in\r\n\r\n1999.   I  do not know whether the Government has foreseen  this\r\n\r\nhappening   before   deciding  on  the  package   presented   in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is that with the current package, are\r\n\r\nwe  confident  that we will garner the necessary foreign  direct\r\n\r\ninvestment  (FDI)  into  Singapore as targeted.   The  DPM  also\r\n\r\nmentioned why we cannot leave the companies alone to do the cost-cutting  measures and wage reduction.  I thought  we  wanted  to\r\n\r\nproject our workforce to the world as well as to investors.   If\r\n\r\nour  workforce  is rational, they will respond  to  our  current\r\n\r\neconomic situation and be prepared for the wage cuts proposed by\r\n\r\ncompanies which are not making money or in the red, rather  than\r\n\r\nlosing  their  jobs.  I thought NTUC has been very  powerful  in\r\n\r\ngarnering the support of the workers to respond to the  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment. So I am quite surprised that DPM says that  it  may\r\n\r\nbe  difficult to do if we leave it to the companies to negotiate\r\n\r\nthe wage cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we failed to foresee\r\n\r\nwhat  happened in the last six months.  I fear that Mr Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang probably also failed to foresee that.  Nobody expected it\r\n\r\nto  happen and in fact it is impossible to know, not because you\r\n\r\ncannot  make the calculations, but because they depend on  human\r\n\r\ndecisions of leaders, investors, populations, and that cannot be\r\n\r\ncomputed.   Similarly, they ask me whether  next  year  will  be\r\n\r\nbetter.   Some  analysts think so.  Maybe  if  we  just  project\r\n\r\neconomic  charts it looks like that.  But can you tell  how  the\r\n\r\npolitical situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill develop?  What new turns of the kaleidoscope\r\n\r\nmay happen?  What totally new landscapes may emerge?  Nobody can\r\n\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were reluctant to move earlier because the situation had not\r\n\r\nyet  worsened  and I think if we had made such a package  before\r\n\r\nthe  situation had worsened, it might have shaken confidence and\r\n\r\nbeen  not very well accepted by the public.  Because they  would\r\n\r\nhave  said, \"Why?\"  I am sure that Mr Low would be the first  to\r\n\r\nstand  up to say, \"Why?  The situation is not so grave.   We  do\r\n\r\nnot  need to do this yet.  Keep it till later on.\"  We  have  to\r\n\r\nmake  a judgment.  We made this move.  If next year, things turn\r\n\r\nfavourable,  well,  that  is good.  We  can  adjust  our  policy\r\n\r\nthereafter.  But if we do not make this adjustment and next year\r\n\r\nthings do not turn out good, then it may be too late for  us  to\r\n\r\ntake the steps by next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we confident of getting the FDI? I think the numbers\r\n\r\nwill  go down this year.  But if this package gets clear support\r\n\r\nfrom the population and from political leaders and MPs, then  it\r\n\r\nwill be a very strong selling point when EDB knocks on doors and\r\n\r\ntell people, \"Look, I am able to do this.  Other people cannot.\"\r\n\r\nWe  can encourage workers to accept a wage reduction.  Can other\r\n\r\ncountries  do that?  Even in the freest economies in the  world,\r\n\r\neconomists  will tell you that wages are sticky  downwards,  ie,\r\n\r\nwhen  things are good, they go up and when things are bad,  they\r\n\r\nare  very slow to come down.  That is the way human beings  are.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to accept that and we have to find a way to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  to nudge them into a direction  which  they  will\r\n\r\neventually do on their own, but which may take longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their own, yes, they will take wage cuts if the company\r\n\r\nis  about  to go bust. But what we are trying to achieve  is  an\r\n\r\nacross-the-board  general shift in their wage level,  not  every\r\n\r\ncompany, but a general shift, and even companies which  are  not\r\n\r\nyet  on the verge of disaster, we are saying, \"Better  make this\r\n\r\nadjustment now.  I am already cutting CPF for everybody.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  wise,  if  you  are not performing  exceptionally\r\n\r\nbrilliantly, to be cautious and also to make some adjustment  on\r\n\r\nyour bonuses.  After all,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is what they were built up for.\"  If next\r\n\r\nyear, things are better, well, good for you.  Certainly, if\r\n\r\nthere is no need for companies to cut bonuses, there is no need\r\n\r\nto touch reserves.  But the same Member has been asking us why\r\n\r\ndo we not touch reserves earlier.  I think he may want to re-examine his position.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A.

Secondly, on property  tax,\r\n\r\nthe 55% tax rebate is of course welcomed.  But is anything going\r\n\r\nto  be  done  to  speed up the re-assessment of property  values\r\n\r\nbecause the net effect of that 55% and the failure to assess the\r\n\r\nrecent  property values, which have gone down  by  40%  to  50%,\r\n\r\nnegate the impact of that 55% rebate. Thirdly,  I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  whether  for  tenants of JTC and HDB industrial  land,  for\r\n\r\nthose  who are paying rentals slightly below the posted  values,\r\n\r\nwould they also see some reduction in rentals?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The question on whether the rates are\r\n\r\nback  at the 1994 levels, the answer is that it varies.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of industrial land, which is probably the most important of\r\n\r\nthem,   they   will   be   back   there.    In   the   case   of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications charges, it is not only at  1994  levels  but\r\n\r\nconsiderably below that because in the last few years, in  fact,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications charges have been coming down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reassessment of property tax is in progress and I know\r\n\r\npeople have been receiving property tax reassessment notices and\r\n\r\nfor once, the figures have become smaller rather than larger.  I\r\n\r\nam  not sure whether this is good news, generally, but those who\r\n\r\nhave received them have welcomed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For JTC and HDB tenants who are paying below the posted prices,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, they will have certain rebates given to them  which\r\n\r\nwill hold until December 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Harun Ghani asked about higher learning institutions. I will\r\n\r\nhave  to ask the Minister for Education to look into this.  What\r\n\r\nhe told me is that generally he thinks that the fees do not need\r\n\r\nadjustment, except for one or two specific areas where there are\r\n\r\nproblems.  But he will look into the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. In view\r\n\r\nof  the  current  situation where there are  more  people  being\r\n\r\nretrenched, what is the view of DPM Lee on the need to set up  a\r\n\r\nfund  to help those who are sole breadwinners of the family  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  retrenched.   Secondly,  he  has  announced  certain\r\n\r\npercentage  cut  on  the salaries of top civil  servants.   What\r\n\r\nwould  be  the estimated percentage cut that would be applicable\r\n\r\nto Ministers and MPs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As I have explained, the way to help\r\n\r\nthe retrenched people is to help them find a new job and if,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  despite  all their efforts, they have not  been  able  to\r\n\r\nfind  new jobs, there are a variety of people they can  turn  to\r\n\r\nfor  help, including the CDCs, unions, and the MPs who would put\r\n\r\nthem in touch with the right agencies.  If MPs have any specific\r\n\r\nproblems,  they  should  get  in  touch  with  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  or the Ministry of  Manpower,  and  they\r\n\r\nwould be able to assist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cut of Ministers and MPs? As I have explained,\r\n\r\nthey will follow the same as the civil servants.  For Ministers,\r\n\r\ntheir  cut is 10% per year in the annual wage bill and for  MPs,\r\n\r\nprobably something less than that.  For the rank and file  civil\r\n\r\nservants  (Divisions III, IV and DREs) it is 5% of total  annual\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does DPM Lee think it is sufficient to\r\n\r\nproject political leadership by just taking a 10% cut?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, nothing\r\n\r\nwill be sufficient to persuade Mr Low Thia Khiang that it is\r\n\r\nsufficient.  So from that starting point, we have to judge what\r\n\r\nis the right number which makes sense and allows us to fulfill\r\n\r\nthe principle of the NWC, which is, the higher levels, will have\r\n\r\na deeper cut than the working rank and file, and also to\r\n\r\nmaintain the principle that we really pay people for their job.\r\n\r\nAnd we have set Ministers' salaries and civil servants' salaries\r\n\r\nat levels which we think are sensible and justifiable and are\r\n\r\nright to get the sort of people we want for the jobs which we\r\n\r\nare looking to fill.  And especially at times like this, I think\r\n\r\nwe would be looking for good Ministers rather than cheap\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, it is quite strange that Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang  has  made the accusation that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nfailed  to foresee these economic difficulties.  I am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  he  heard his Secretary-General, Mr Jeyaretnam,  a  few\r\n\r\nhours  ago in this House relating a story about a banker  friend\r\n\r\nof  his who told him that way back in 1996, he already knew that\r\n\r\nwe  would  face  this problem.  Had Mr Low been informed  by  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam about that story he heard from his banker friend  and\r\n\r\nraised  it  in  this  House,  then  today  he  would  have  been\r\n\r\nproclaimed  a  prophet.   Unfortunately, his  Secretary-General,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  first stepped into this House in 1997,  also  did  not\r\n\r\nraise  this  subject of his conversation with his banker  friend\r\n\r\nand  thereby  depriving  him  of the  opportunity  of  making  a\r\n\r\npolitical  point against this Government for failing to  foresee\r\n\r\nthis serious crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think Members, having heard 13 MPs who have spoken today\r\n\r\nand  the  statement  by the DPM and all the clarifications  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  asked this evening, would think that  it  is  enough\r\n\r\nalready for the day.  So we will call it a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Debate be now adjourned.\" [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Debate to be resumed on what day, Mr\r\n\r\nLee?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">half-past Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19981124/19981124-HA-0691479.htm\">table (Cols. 1479 - 1482)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
