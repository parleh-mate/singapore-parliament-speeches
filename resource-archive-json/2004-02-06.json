Jayakumar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S Jayakumar):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the visit by the Prime Minister&nbsp;of&nbsp;Malaysia Abdullah Badawi on 12th January 2004 was his introductory visit, in keeping with the ASEAN tradition of such introductory visits.&nbsp; PM Abdullah, of course, needs no formal introduction as PM Goh and many other Singapore Ministers have known him for many years.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an introductory visit, it was not expected that both sides would have substantive discussions to resolve any outstanding issues.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, PM Goh and PM Abdullah did use the opportunity to have&nbsp;frank and friendly exchange of views on the state of bilateral relations.&nbsp; They resolved to put bilateral ties back on the right track.&nbsp; They agreed that good relations are important, not just for the benefit of Singapore and Malaysia, but also for ASEAN, and that both sides should explore ways to maximise the common areas in order to strengthen our cooperation.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that at our sitting on 5th January 2004, I said that there are deadlocked issues from the old era of Dr Mahathir which both sides will have to address and address them in a way that does not reopen the acrimonious paths which we have travelled previously. In the new era, we have to start a new chapter in bilateral relations without being saddled by the deadlocked issues of the old era.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 260 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they met on 12th January, the two Prime Ministers also discussed how to deal with these deadlocked issues. I can do no better than recall what PM Goh said at their joint press conference:</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I told him frankly how I saw we could move our relations forward.&nbsp; I've been at this for many years now, discussing issues with Prime Minister Mahathir, and over the years, the issues which were discussed as a \"package\" and later on as individual items outside the package had ended up in what I told him as \"dead knots\".&nbsp; It's like Gordian knots; you can't untie them. &nbsp;So I suggested that maybe for the future, we should refer these \"dead knot\" issues to third parties to arbitrate or to adjudicate.&nbsp; Then we can look forward to co-operation in many areas and if there are new issues, we will try and resolve them before they become tied in knots which we cannot disentangle.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi prefers that we give it another try.&nbsp; He would like to offer new ideas, he wants to think out of the box, to see how we can resolve the issues.&nbsp; Basically, he prefers discussions before we move them to third party.&nbsp; I listened to him.&nbsp; I told him that I'm agreeable to his approach if he can come up with something that we can consider.&nbsp; So that's the agreement that we have. &nbsp;Let's try and discuss and see how we can resolve the issues and then, if we can't resolve them, both of us will be alert to the danger of tying ourselves in knots again.&nbsp; So, if we can't resolve the issues, we will recognise (it) and then, of course, we will in that point of time refer them to third parties.\"</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, in other words, it is Singapore's preference that these issues are referred to third party settlement so that we can move forward with our bilateral relations without being saddled by them.&nbsp; However, since PM Abdullah wanted to attempt another effort at talks, PM Goh agreed.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The understanding therefore is that<p align=left>Column: 261 <p> PM Abdullah will revert to PM Goh, at a future date, with specific proposals for PM Goh to consider.&nbsp; As PM Abdullah himself said at the Press Conference on 12th January 2004, \"<I>\u20ac\u00a6</I>then I will come back with some very, very specific issues and some suggestions on how we can resolve these issues\".</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also agreed that these proposals will be first discussed at the Prime Ministers' level, and as Foreign Minister Syed Hamid said recently, \"<I>\u20ac\u00a6</I>it is up to us [Malaysia] to make our proposals in each issue to find ways to resolve them individually.&nbsp; The leaders will consult each other first and once they have come to some agreement, the officials can come in\".&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, both Prime Ministers, however, were realistic and agreed to be alert to the problem that if in the process of such discussions, we could not untie the dead knots then, at that point of time, we need to find ways to move forward and refer to third party settlement.&nbsp; And again, I&nbsp;quote from&nbsp;Mr Syed Hamid who said: \"We want to avoid dead knots that can harm efforts by Prime Minister (Abdullah) to revitalise ties with Singapore\u20ac\u00a6. If no agreements are reached, we will seek third party help.&nbsp; We do not want to stoke controversy.\"</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is where matters stand.&nbsp; We look forward to receiving PM Abdullah's proposals on how to resolve bilateral issues and how to move bilateral relations forward.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another matter, both Prime Ministers stressed the need for greater interaction and contacts between the Ministers and officials from both sides.&nbsp; They agreed that the inter-Ministry games should be resumed.&nbsp; Members will also have read that PM Goh, DPM Lee and several Ministers from Singapore attended the Open House in Johore Bahru at the<p align=left>Column: 262 <p> invitation of PM Abdullah, and the following day, PM Abdullah and his Ministers came down to Singapore for a social visit.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may sum up, these recent events have generated much goodwill and have created a conducive atmosphere within which we can discuss future bilateral cooperation as well as tackle substantive issues.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Prof. Jayakumar</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not wish to speculate on what are the \"low-hanging fruits\" that Prime Minister Abdullah referred to.&nbsp; I prefer to wait till Prime Minister Abdullah reverts to Prime Minister Goh with specific proposals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have said, the deadlocked issues from the Mahathir era are very difficult and, as PM Goh said, are dead knots which are difficult to untie.&nbsp; This is why our preference was to have them settled through third-party settlement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But since PM Abdullah wanted to give the talks another chance, PM Goh agreed.&nbsp; So in good faith, Sir, we will study the proposals when we receive them.&nbsp; Of course, we can only reach agreement if the proposal is fair and if there is a balance of the benefits on both sides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the discussions should make no progress then, as we agreed, we will refer to a third party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the important point, Sir, is that both sides want to move on with our bilateral relations.&nbsp; We want to maximise our common areas to strengthen our<p align=left>Column: 263 <p> cooperation.&nbsp; The outstanding deadlocked issues, in my view, are not the sum total of our relationship.&nbsp; And there is much both countries can benefit from good relations.&nbsp;

But PM Abdullah said that he would prefer to give the talks another chance.&nbsp; Now, what he has in mind, we will have to wait until his proposals come forward.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if the Malaysian side has formally raised the issue of the now preferred straight bridge on our side of the Causeway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; They have not raised the issue of the bridge formally with us.&nbsp; I think Members would have read many statements in the press and in the media by various quarters.&nbsp; I think it is counter-productive to speculate on these reports as to what they will send us, what they may propose, and so on.&nbsp; In fact, at this stage, I do not even know for sure whether the bridge will be one of the issues that PM Abdullah will raise with PM Goh.&nbsp; We have to wait for the proposals so when they come,&nbsp;when we receive them, we will study them in good faith and give our reply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Members will recall that at the sitting on 5th January 2004 I dealt with this issue of the bridge and I reminded the House that when Singapore reluctantly agreed to the demolition of the Causeway and to build our part of the bridge, it was as part of a package deal which covered several issues, including continued supply of water for another 100 years from 2061.&nbsp; But Malaysia called off the package in October 2002 and, as I said then, building our part of such a full bridge along with related CIQ revisions would cost us over $500 million and, furthermore, would also sterilise the use of the land under the bridge.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, with the end of the Cold War, countries like China and India are re-joining the global marketplace with a vengeance. Technology has facilitated the movement of goods and capital, of people and ideas. With tariffs coming down world-wide, manufacturing for example has become global in nature. For simpler products, China has now become a giant factory for the world. Services are also increasingly outsourced with India becoming a major supplier. Businessmen have to consider different global options carefully before deciding where to invest. Capital has never been more mobile. All this presents Singapore with new challenges, both threats and opportunities. There is no doubt that the competition has become more intense and positioning Singapore well for the New World PM Goh&nbsp;talked about is critical to the well-being of our economy.\r\nThe Economic Review Committee under Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed these challenges, and we debated at length the recommendations in this House last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On economic structure, our tax and wage systems are being reformed in a fundamental way to make our economy more competitive. &nbsp;We have been bringing down our direct taxes, liberalising our economy, especially the services sectors, and making the labour market more flexible.&nbsp; Our FTAs help to expand our external&nbsp;economic space.&nbsp; We are promoting entrepreneurship and innovation on a broad front, with particular emphasis given to smaller companies.&nbsp; The education system is<p align=left>Column: 266<p> being revamped to prepare our students for the economy of the future.&nbsp; WDA has been formed to facilitate job matching and worker retraining.&nbsp; We are also investing significant resources in R&amp;D and the build-up of our scientific manpower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been highlighting these challenges&nbsp;to Singaporeans through speeches, media campaigns and public forums. However, there is no greater incentive to learn than the pressure of necessity itself.&nbsp; The economic difficulties of the last few years have done more to alter our mindset than any particular publicity exercise.&nbsp; Just recently, NTUC Secretary General Lim Boon Heng told me how workers now welcome overtime work when only a few years ago there were complaints of too much overtime.&nbsp; IE Singapore has reported a significant increase in interest by small Singapore companies in overseas business missions. Many young Singaporeans are now prepared to work overseas.&nbsp; It is right that we are always worrying about the future, because the greatest danger is complacency.&nbsp; We must&nbsp;not let up on our efforts to alert Singaporeans to the new trends in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many programmes to foster the growth of world-class companies.&nbsp; These are broadly in three main areas: capability development, market opportunities and finance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For capability development, IE Singapore helps companies with branding and design and the training of manpower for internationalisation. &nbsp;Smaller companies identified by SPRING to have growth potential beyond Singapore are passed on to IE Singapore.&nbsp; A*STAR, EDB, IE Singapore and SPRING have also come together to provide comprehensive assistance to companies in the areas of innovation, technology development, operations upgrading and overseas expansion under a scheme called Growing Enterprises with Technology Upgrading (GET-Up).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 267<p> Second, as for access to market opportunities, we have a number of schemes.&nbsp; Let me highlight just a couple of them.&nbsp; The S$30 million iPartners Programme encourages companies to form alliances in venturing overseas. &nbsp;A market leader becomes the anchor company, drawing on board other companies with complementary products or services.&nbsp; SPRING has recently launched the Business Alert Internet portal, which alerts local enterprises to some 90,000 business opportunities worth S$120 billion each year, including information on Government procurement opportunities in the US. &nbsp;Under the US-Singapore FTA, Singapore companies can compete on an equal basis with US companies for tenders of value greater than US$56,000 put out by the US Federal government<b>. &nbsp;</b> In future, this service will also include tenders by the governments of Australia, New Zealand and other FTA partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, to help companies secure financing for international expansion, the Regionalisation Financing Scheme under IE Singapore offers loans to Singapore companies when they expand their operations overseas.&nbsp; Last year, IE also launched its iFinance Consulting Programme to help companies get professional advice on the financing of their overseas ventures. &nbsp;In addition, the Government is facilitating efforts by private sector players to set up a private equity exchange, which may become an important additional source of finance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, our strategy is not to depend only on the success of our local companies.&nbsp; MNCs will remain the mainstay of our economy.&nbsp; We are also encouraging SMEs from other countries to hub in Singapore with some success so far.&nbsp; Our strategy is to develop a strong economy that is knowledge-intensive, creating a range of good jobs for Singaporeans and conducive to the <p align=left>Column: 268<p>growth of entrepreneurship, for which we need to be broad-based and well-connected internationally.&nbsp; It is important for us to diversify our risks and not be overly dependent on particular companies, sectors or markets.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My second question is: are there any specific programmes that are geared towards preparing&nbsp;Singaporeans' mindset for the new challenges?&nbsp; Much&nbsp;has been&nbsp;talked about&nbsp;in the education industry and in skills acquisition, but&nbsp;is there any specific programme for mindset change?&nbsp;

We will always need foreign players in large numbers to operate here.&nbsp; That has&nbsp;always been&nbsp;the history of Singapore and I believe that it will remain the basis of the Singapore economy well into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to efforts to change the mindset of Singaporeans, I believe this is already happening.&nbsp; Among young Singaporeans now, there is a more realistic assessment of where we stand in relation to present and potential competitors in the future.&nbsp; And this is seen in the growing number of Singaporeans who are prepared to work overseas.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, more and more Singapore companies are now taking part in&nbsp;overseas missions and sniffing for prospects and opportunities elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is like cities such as London and New York.&nbsp; The economies of London and New York cannot be based on the native population of London and New York alone.&nbsp; So, it is the same for Singapore.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as I informed hon. Members late last year, my Ministry's goal is to anchor our existing airline partners here, attract new airlines to use Changi Airport, and position Singapore for the long term.&nbsp; These fundamentals have not changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 270<p>Let me describe some of the key measures to achieve these objectives.&nbsp; Changi Airport has to maintain and even improve upon its unique \"Changi Experience\" to its passengers and airlines.&nbsp; Passengers using Changi enjoy speedy immigration and other processes, a lively and bustling shopping mall, friendly service, a wide range of passenger facilities and first-rate infrastructure.&nbsp; Surveys have shown that passengers do value this very pleasant experience.&nbsp; To continue to enhance this \"Changi Experience\", we will continue to innovate and improve our facilities and services. Terminal 2 (T2), which opened in 1990, is now undergoing its first major upgrading at a cost of some $240 million.&nbsp; The upgrading works will be completed by the end of next year.&nbsp; The construction of Terminal 3 (T3)&nbsp;is on schedule.&nbsp; When completed in 2008 at a cost of $1.75 billion, T3 will provide capacity for 20 million additional passengers in an exciting setting. &nbsp;Plans are also underway for the major upgrading of T1, to revitalise it and enhance the range of services available there.&nbsp; We expect to begin&nbsp;upgrading works at the end of 2005, and to complete them in 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgrading of T1 and T2 will rejuvenate these buildings and give them&nbsp;a modern, fresh look with its own individual distinctive character.&nbsp; In addition, the current retail areas will be enlarged and re-configured to offer passengers an even wider range of shops and merchandise.&nbsp; They will be given more interesting and appealing shopfronts.&nbsp; There will also be better integration of the shops, F&amp;B outlets and new passenger facilities.&nbsp; All these will give passengers a new and even more interesting and exciting \"Changi Experience\".&nbsp; The new T3, with its outstanding architectural and interior design, will also provide passengers a brand-new and enjoyable experience in air travel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 271<p> Sir, we will continue with our efforts to attract and anchor airlines at Changi Airport.&nbsp; One key factor is our connectivity.&nbsp; Strengthening our connectivity will attract even more airlines to fly here.&nbsp; In the past year alone, Changi welcomed six new airlines, bringing the total number of Changi's airline partners to 69.&nbsp; Our international network has also grown to 150 cities.&nbsp; By facilitating more airlines to build their network to and through Changi Airport, we will also strengthen our status as a regional air hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also looking at ways to address the needs of low cost carriers (LCCs) at Changi Airport.&nbsp; The success of LCCs hinges critically on their ability to keep their costs low.&nbsp; This, in turn, enables them to keep their air fares low.&nbsp; They do so by doing away with frills.&nbsp; LCCs are a phenomenal success in the US and Europe, and this phenomenon has now arrived in Asia.&nbsp; At home, Valuair and Tiger Airways expect to be flying later this year.&nbsp; To maintain Singapore's position as a regional air hub, we will need to attract not only more of the&nbsp;traditional full service airlines but also the LCCs.&nbsp; CAAS is now studying the feasibility of building a LCC terminal at Changi Airport that will meet the operational requirements of these airlines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our efforts to improve Changi's competitiveness focus both on reducing costs and incentivising traffic growth. Last year, we introduced a $210 million Air Hub Development Fund and the SARS relief package which include landing fee and rental rebates to help the airlines through the difficult times.&nbsp; There was also the post-SARS Air Traffic Development Scheme to incentivise the recovery of passenger traffic at Changi Airport. &nbsp;This year, we have put in place a new $40 million Growth Incentive Scheme (GIS) for airlines.&nbsp; This new scheme will operate from 1st January this year to 31st December next year.&nbsp; It will<p align=left>Column: 272<p> reward each airline based on its passenger growth, and will be on top of the other incentive schemes or rebates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as announced recently, we will be introducing a third ground handling company at Changi Airport.&nbsp; The enhanced competition will improve ground handling services at Changi, and make them more price-competitive.&nbsp; I have just described some of the measures to maintain Changi Airport's status as a leading air hub in the face of the changing, more challenging and competitive environment.&nbsp; These measures are dynamic, and we will continue to evolve them to meet changing circumstances.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</B>:&nbsp; At this point, Sir, I would like to declare that I work for SIA Engineering Co.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what&nbsp;actually is the rationale for the establishment of a third ground handling company?&nbsp; Has the number of foreign carriers or the volume of business activities at Changi grown to warrant the establishment of a third ground handling company?&nbsp; Has the overall business pie grown bigger, or is it the intention to have the three ground handling companies fighting over the same pie?&nbsp; May I ask the Minister: &nbsp;is it a belief that with three ground handling companies, there will be a higher motivation to cut operating costs to survive?&nbsp; If not, would not the existing two ground handling companies have taken the initiative to reduce drastically costs in the first instance when the aviation industry was hit by the downturn last year?&nbsp; Has it been studied that with three ground handling companies, there will be an overall improvement at Changi with better service levels and more attractive pricing for handling of aircraft in Singapore?&nbsp; Will it make Changi a more attractive airport for the operators to fly to?&nbsp; Will there also be a review of the special permission to US carriers to self-handle?&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<p align=left>Column: 273<p>\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mdm Ho asked about the reason for having a third ground handler.&nbsp; As I mentioned very briefly in my reply, it is to ensure that the situation in Changi is more competitive and that the airlines will be able to enjoy better service and, hopefully, better pricing as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mdm Ho asked whether there has been growth in the passenger load and&nbsp;number of airlines to justify having a third ground handler.&nbsp; Let me bring the hon.

Today, there are 69.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of cargo, the growth has been&nbsp;phenomenal.&nbsp; When we started in 1981, the cargo volume&nbsp;was only 200,000 tonnes a year.&nbsp; Today, the cargo traffic has gone up to 1.6 million tonnes.&nbsp; That is an increase of eight times.&nbsp; So I would say that the business pie has definitely grown and we expect the business pie to continue growing in the years ahead.&nbsp; I think it would be instructive for me to show the experience elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong Kong International Airport has a throughput of 27.4 million passengers last year and they have seven passenger handling companies there and three apron handling companies, as well as three flight catering companies.&nbsp; That is in <p align=left>Column: 274<p>comparison with our two operators.&nbsp; Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has about 40 million passengers a year. They have four ground handling companies and three flight catering companies.&nbsp; It shows that in Changi, there is plenty of scope for a third operator.&nbsp; The third operator would definitely stimulate the existing two operators to become more innovative, and perhaps come up with new methods of work, improve their productivity and therefore be able to offer a better service and, hopefully, at a better price.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked whether we will review the special permission given to US carriers to self handle. Sir, this is part of the bilateral air services agreement that Singapore has with the US and therefore it is something that is entrenched. Although the US carriers have the right, so far, they have not done so because there are other factors involved, such as whether it is more cost-effective for them to&nbsp;do it versus buying services from SATS, CIAS or the third ground handling company that we will be setting up.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</B>:&nbsp; Sir, in view of the cheaper alternatives sprouting around us, should not the Minister&nbsp;consider cost reduction as the top priority, rather than simply the upgrading and enhancements as detailed?&nbsp; Also, will this upgrading and enhancements add to the cost for the users?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong</B>:&nbsp; Sir, if Mr Chia had listened to my answer just now, I did mention that we have embarked on significant cost reductions for the airlines.&nbsp; But, in the first place, Changi Airport is already very cost-effective. Today, Changi Airport is the second least expensive airport in the whole of Asia.&nbsp; So we are already very cost-effective, but we are&nbsp;finding more ways to be even more cost-effective.&nbsp; One of the ways, as I have said, is to make the ground handling market in Changi more competitive.&nbsp; And if the third operator comes in and is able<p align=left>Column: 275<p> to stimulate the market and help to reduce&nbsp;ground handling cost, it will make Changi Airport even more attractive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Chia also asked&nbsp;whether we are spending too much money on enhancements of the airport and whether it will end up costing passengers more.&nbsp; Sir, the situation with regard to the airport facilities is a very competitive one.&nbsp; T1 was built in 1980. T2 was completed in 1990.&nbsp; Between 1990 and now, I think Mr Chia would have realised that many new airports have opened and they are all very modern, very advanced and very attractive.&nbsp; If Changi Airport does not take steps&nbsp;to continue upgrading itself and keep pace with the competition, we are going to be left far behind. So we have no choice but to continue making sure that our facilities&nbsp;and&nbsp;services are tip-top so that passengers would choose to fly through Changi Airport if they have a choice of other airports to fly through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the cost be passed&nbsp;on to the passengers?&nbsp; Sir, as I have mentioned just now, our costs are already kept very low. We will try not to pass on any upgrading cost, but of course, when operating costs are increased, because of manpower cost increase and technology,&nbsp;we may have to pass some of that to the passengers. But, so far, we have tried not to increase our costs to the passengers.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)</B><B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether&nbsp;the Ministry will be opening the position of the third operator to&nbsp;foreign players or is there a plan to set up another Government-linked company as&nbsp;we did in the past.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong</B><B>:</B>&nbsp; Sir, in preparation for the appointment of&nbsp;a third operator, CAAS actually went round the world, talking to all the major international players, to alert them to what we are doing and to interest them in bidding for that licence.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\r\n<p align=left>Column: 276<p>\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the apparent effect of having three operators is that the third ground handling company will also have its own fleet of equipment.&nbsp; With an increase in the operating equipment and vehicular traffic at Changi, will&nbsp;it not become more hazardous for staff operating at the airport?&nbsp; What measures are being considered to ensure a high level of safety?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong</B><B>:</B>&nbsp; I can assure Mdm Ho that all these will be well looked after and that the safety at Changi will definitely be maintained at the highest possible level.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ABUSE OF WORKERS AND VIOLATION OF EMPLOYMENT ACT--><p align=left>Column: 276<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ABUSE OF WORKERS AND VIOLATION OF EMPLOYMENT ACT</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Action against employers--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Action against employers)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower in view of recent media reports of abuse of workers by some employers, (a) how many workers have filed claims against employers for failure to pay wages or other benefits; (b) how many of these claims were successful and what was the total amount recovered; (c) how many employers have been prosecuted for violations of the Employment Act; and (d) what steps have been taken by the Ministry to enforce the labour laws and prevent abuses and violations.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi</B>) (<B>for the Acting Minister for Manpower</B>):&nbsp; Sir, in 2003, a total of 10,232 local and foreign non-unionised workers sought the assistance of the Ministry's Labour Relations Department and filed claims/complaints against their employers for failure to pay wages and other benefits.

But employers who violate the law belong to a small minority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, no company was prosecuted for violation of the Employment Act. Warnings to 279 employers were issued. In 2002, the Ministry prosecuted&nbsp;two <p align=left>Column: 278<p>companies for non-payment of salaries to their employees. The Court meted out fines against&nbsp;one company while the other had the charge compounded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the provisions of the Employment Act are complied with, the Ministry adopts the following measures:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)&nbsp; Educational and promotional programmes to bring about greater awareness of the law and penalising employers who flout the law to deter other offenders. Generally, employers, especially in the larger companies, comply with the law. Employers who have problems complying with the law are mainly the small and medium-sized companies. Apart from advisories to employers on the relevant provisions of the Employment Act, they are also asked to attend courses on the Employment Act conducted by the Ministry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp; Employers who continue to flout the law would be barred from employing foreign workers.

A total of 36,601 training places have been achieved under the WSTP for the past two years. Some 1,900 training places have been achieved from October to December 2003. Over 50% of the trainees have secondary and below educational qualifications. About 30% of them are 45 years old and above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A survey conducted on trainees who attended the WSTP between the period of December 2002 to May 2003 shows that some 42% of professionals and executives found employment after the training, and some 47% of workers in general found employment after the training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training for job seekers will have to be customised to the needs of job seekers. For those job seekers who have been retrenched after many years in a certain job and feel that they are not equipped to seek re-employment, work skills such as job search skills and coping with change may help them get started in their job search and regain employment. Those job seekers who already have the necessary job search skills and have the right mindsets may find job related training more useful in helping them regain employment. In recognition of this, WDA has trained the job placement officers in the Distributed CareerLink Network (DCN) of job centres in client profiling and to offer training advice targeted at the needs of job seekers. In addition, the officers attending to the job seekers in the DCN are also trained to provide career coaching and impart to the job seekers work skills such as writing effective resume, interview skills, and understanding the realities of the labour market.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 283<p><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, will the Ministry consider reviewing the place-and-train programme again?&nbsp; Because feedback has it that the present place-and-train programme is actually not reaching out to a segment of the working population that needs more encouragement to change their attitude to acquire skills to enable them to be more employable.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</B>&nbsp; Sir, we will welcome ideas on how we can make it more effective.&nbsp; But based on the figures that we have and the number of people who have benefited from the training,&nbsp;we find that it is quite effective.&nbsp; But if we can have new ideas on how to reach out to those who really need assistance in coping with the changes so that they can be more employable and are better prepared to changes in the world of work, then we will review and see whether it is possible to implement them.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TEENAGE VIOLENCE--><p align=left>Column: 283<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>TEENAGE VIOLENCE</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for Community Development and Sports in view of recent newspaper reports on teenage violence, whether there is (a) a rising trend in teenage violence involving girls; (b) a statistical breakdown of female and male teenage offenders and victims; and (c) a corresponding increase in the helplines and organisations that focus on helping problem teens.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for Community Development and Sports in view of recent newspaper reports on teenage violence, whether there is any survey or study to ascertain the (i) cause of teenage violence; (ii) income and family profile of offenders; and (iii) relative degree of maternal and paternal care received by offenders.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Community </b><p align=left>Column: 258<p><b>Development and Sports):</B> Sir, can I take Question Nos. 8 and 9 together because they are related?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B> Yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, based on the figures of the Police, from 2001 to 2003, 670 male and 86 female juveniles were arrested for violent offences. For the same period, there were a total of 659 male and 983 female juvenile victims of violent crimes. These juveniles are between 7 and 15 years of age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reports of such violent crimes tend to be quite sensational.&nbsp; In fact, if Members look at the newspapers, in December 2003 as well as January 2004, there were quite a number of very sensationalised reporting.&nbsp; But it is not correct to conclude therefore that juvenile crimes are out of control.&nbsp; If you look at those reports carefully, about half of these reports are reports of trials of crimes that were committed in 2003 or 2002.&nbsp; In fact, I would like to say that there was a 56% decrease in the number of female juveniles arrested for violent crimes last year as compared to the year before.&nbsp; Therefore, it is definitely not true that crimes involving female juveline delinquents have increased.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the family profile of young offenders, over 70% of juveniles who are referred to my Ministry for probation come from intact, rather than dysfunctional families.

There is an&nbsp;Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crimes (IMYC) chaired by Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee&nbsp;comprising senior representatives from the Ministries of Community Development and Sports, Education and Home Affairs and other agencies, to monitor the youth crime situation and coordinates the programmes of various agencies to tackle this issue.&nbsp; In fact, there are many programmes that have been initiated to tackle and prevent youth crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, 81 schools initiated the School Community Security Programme which targets at preventing juvenile delinquency. Other measures include the Police-School Liaison System, and the Honorary Volunteer Special Constabulary (School) Scheme.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the Police, together with IMYC and National Crime Prevention Council, developed a Youth-Crime Prevention Roadshow last year. The roadshows were targeted at students and their parents as well as teachers of schools, Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs) as well as polytechnics. Feedback gathered from more than 3,000 students who attended the roadshows indicated that the roadshows achieved the objective of raising greater reflection on crime. For example, 83% indicated that they better understood why youths commonly committed offences, such as simple theft, shop theft and rioting, and an overwhelming 90% recognised the dire consequences of committing a crime.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are many programmes and measures in place to tackle youth crime, I cannot sufficiently emphasise the critical role parents play in instilling<p align=left>Column: 286<p> positive values in our youths. Prevention efforts to combat youth violence must begin in the family. Parents who require assistance in parenting can seek help from my Ministry or any voluntary welfare organisation. They can also approach the Family Service Centres near their homes or call the hotline at 1800-838 0100 for assistance.

The recently released regulations on credit and <p align=left>Column: 287<p>charge cards preserve the fundamental objective of discouraging Singaporeans from spending beyond their means by curbing the easy availability of consumer credit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have removed the limit of two supplementary cards per principal card account. Feedback from card issuers showed that, in practice, the limit has had an unintended effect. Because of the limit, a cardholder who wishes to have more than two supplementary cards tied to his account will need to apply for an additional card from another issuer. As a result, the overall credit available to the cardholder is raised. Therefore, lifting the limit will remove this unintended outcome, while keeping the overall credit limit available to the cardholder unchanged. In any event, a cardholder should exercise discretion when applying for supplementary cards tied to his account, since he is liable for charges incurred by the supplementary cardholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also allowed a credit or charge card issuer to issue additional cards to its existing principal cardholders without first having received an application. However, there should be no increase in the credit limit granted to the cardholder. For the cardholders' protection, the cardholder must first notify the issuer that he accepts the use of the additional card and its accompanying terms and conditions. Otherwise, the cardholder will not be liable for any amount charged to the card.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</B>: Sir, in view of the rising importance of Internet e-commerce, should not lower income earners also be allowed</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>to own&nbsp;at most one credit card, even if their income falls below the $30,000 minimum?&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister agree with me that allowing lower income earners to have one credit card with only two times the monthly salary credit line is more prudent than having a minimum $30,000 income <p align=left>Column: 288<p>criterion but owning many credit cards with many different banks?&nbsp; Should the minimum income qualification not be waived and the maximum amount of cards allowed, based on the income level, be more prudent?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Hsien Loong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lee Hsien Loong</B> <B>Loong</B>:&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, there are two parts to the question.&nbsp; One for Internet e-commerce, you can do the business without a&nbsp;credit card because you can do it with a debit card.&nbsp; It functions in the same way, except that your account&nbsp;is debited straightaway and there is no credit extended by your bank.&nbsp; And the second question&nbsp;on whether we should not allow lower income individuals to have credit cards and that this is a lower risk than having a $30,000 income individual having many many credit cards,&nbsp;the practical answer is this.&nbsp;We would like to prevent a person from being&nbsp;imprudent with his&nbsp;own money because it gets him into trouble and he has a lot of difficulties, and if we can have him avoid going into debt, I think we save him some trouble for himself. &nbsp;But it is not easy for us to restrict the amount of total borrowing which a person&nbsp;can have because he can borrow from one bank and another bank, one credit card, another credit card source, and even an overseas credit card&nbsp;source.&nbsp; So, what we have said&nbsp;is if you have $30,000 of income, you have one credit. Then, when you borrow on each credit, the credit limit is two months of income.

ICA has also deployed mobile X-ray machines at the land checkpoints to scan cargo vehicles. As a result of the stricter checks, fewer illegal immigrants now try to come in by land.&nbsp; This is reflected in the seizure of 17 vehicles and the arrest of 27 conveyors&nbsp;last year, a significant decrease from the 43 vehicles seized and 51 conveyors arrested in 2002.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 291<p>ICA has also acquired advanced forgery detection equipment.&nbsp; ICA detected about 1,700 immigration offenders&nbsp;attempting to enter or depart Singapore using forged or tampered passports last year.&nbsp; This is a decrease from the 2,170 detected in 2002, an indication that immigration offenders are now less inclined to risk using forged or tampered passports to enter or depart Singapore, as they know that they would be detected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, intelligence-led operations to counter forgery syndicates resulted in the arrest of 85 persons last year, compared to 28 persons in 2002.&nbsp; Follow-up investigations have led to the seizure of forged immigration rubber stamps, work passes, travel documents and computer equipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police and ICA regularly exchange information with their foreign counterparts on the abuse of travel documents, and the modus operandi and trends of human smuggling activities.&nbsp; ICA is an active participant in regional conferences, such as the Pacific Rim Immigration Intelligence Conference, which serves as a platform for members to share strategic and operational intelligence, and promotes international cooperation to combat human smuggling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have also sought the assistance of foreign missions in Singapore to help disseminate information of our strict immigration laws and our enforcement action to their nationals, to discourage them from trying to enter Singapore illegally.&nbsp; Cases of illegal immigrants being cheated by the traffickers are also being shared with the foreign missions to help them warn their nationals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot over-emphasise the critical role the public can play in helping to<p align=left>Column: 292<p> tackle the illegal immigration problem.&nbsp; Members of the public should not make Singapore attractive to immigration offenders by offering them employment or harbouring them.&nbsp; By doing so, more illegal immigrants will be encouraged to risk their lives to enter Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore important to spread the message that Singapore will not tolerate immigration offenders.&nbsp; Police and ICA have been working with the local media to raise public awareness of this issue.&nbsp; Our agencies issue media releases regularly when immigration offenders are arrested.&nbsp; We will continue to make use of programmes such as \"Crime Watch\" to feature the illegal immigration problem in Singapore and highlight the severe penalties imposed on immigration offenders, traffickers, harbourers and employers.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Could I please ask about the specific area of cooperation with the State of Johor because most of them are swimming across and the snakeheads are operating in the coastal villages?&nbsp; The problem must be serious enough for us to erect fences. &nbsp;What is the level of effort there?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

This is especially so during peak hours.&nbsp; Students should alight and board within the school compound for their safety.&nbsp; However, we also acknowledge the schools' operational needs, and that some of the school compounds are not big enough to accommodate a large number of parents who drive their children to school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a balance between these needs, LTA works closely with the schools and relevant agencies, such as Traffic Police, Neighbourhood Police and sometimes the grassroots organisation, to put in place effective traffic management schemes in the vicinity of schools.&nbsp; Adequate and appropriate warning signs are also installed to warn motorists of students using the roads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of a slip road for parents to drop off their kids is a good concept, especially along a busy road, but would require more land to be set aside.&nbsp;

But there are several factors that determine safety, besides just slip roads, points where cars should stop and students should alight.&nbsp; As every school in Singapore is slightly different, in&nbsp;terms of its entrance, the kind of traffic around it, this solution has to be individualised to the school.&nbsp; Hence, where the school needs LTA to change the rules around the schools, LTA does so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; At Anderson Primary School, there is a traffic crossing and there is a central railing.&nbsp; The children&nbsp;did not use the signalised crossing and they were bypassing the railing because it was not long enough.&nbsp; And when the school brought this up to LTA, LTA extended the railing so that the children had to use the crossing.&nbsp; In this way, LTA will work with schools to help schools ensure&nbsp;safety.&nbsp; So if any school were to request LTA to restrict part of the road so that cars do not stop there, LTA will put up signs, if it is possible, to ensure that no car stops there and that children do not alight.&nbsp; But we have to work with the principals of the schools so that we have a practical solution on safety&nbsp;in schools.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If we take last year, based on the screening test and recommendations from teachers,&nbsp;9,586 Primary 1 pupils (that is about 20% of&nbsp;cohort) received additional support through the Learning Support Programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of the family profiles of the Learning Support Programme pupils showed that 24% of them were from 1 to 3 room HDB flats, 45% from 4-room HDB flats, 24% from 5-room/HUDC/Executive flats;

We have briefed all the self-help groups on the programme, and provided opportunities for them to publicise their services, for example, at the Zonal Meetings that we have for the specialist teachers on the Learning Support Programme, our&nbsp;Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs).&nbsp; Several sessions have in fact been conducted by the self-help groups&nbsp;for the Learning Support Coordinators&nbsp;to raise awareness of what they each provide. These meetings have led to closer working relationships between the self-help groups and the Learning Support Coordinators, which we encourage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in fact&nbsp;encourage the Learning Support Coordinators&nbsp;to refer families <p align=left>Column: 302<p>who they think are in some difficulty to the self-help groups&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Family Service Centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;These organisations can help to provide support and advice to the families, both in the interests of the Primary 1&nbsp;child as well as younger siblings, if any.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, Avian Flu is a viral disease infecting poultry.&nbsp; The current outbreak of Avian Influenza caused by the influenza A H5N1 sub-type, which is highly contagious in poultry, has so far affected 10 Asian countries, excluding Malaysia and Singapore.&nbsp; It has been reported that 17 people who had close contact with infected chickens have died from the disease.&nbsp; More than 50 million chickens have been culled.&nbsp; I would like to brief the House on what steps the Government has taken to prevent the disease spreading to Singapore and, if it does, to eradicate it.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is free of Avian Influenza.&nbsp; All our tests on local farms, imported chickens, migratory and local birds at Sungei Buloh and the Bird Park have consistently yielded negative results.&nbsp; Common birds like crows, pigeons and mynahs are not known to spread the disease.&nbsp; However, we are doing more tests on them to be doubly safe.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we cannot be complacent, there are some significant factors in our favour. &nbsp;Firstly, we stopped slaughtering live poultry in wet markets 12 years ago.&nbsp; This means that the public generally does not come into contact with live chickens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we only have five chicken farms and two quail farms with a population of 2.1 million birds.&nbsp; These are all modern commercial farms with proper protection against outside sources of infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, Avian Influenza remains a disease that affects only poultry.&nbsp; In rare<p align=left>Column: 304<p> cases, people who come into close contact with infected chickens without adequate protection may be infected.&nbsp; There is until now no evidence of human-to-human transmission.&nbsp; WHO and the Ministry of Health&nbsp;have assessed that even if human-to-human transmission of Avian Flu is possible, such transmission is limited and inefficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Precautionary measures</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now&nbsp;inform the House of the precautions that the Government has taken to keep Avian Influenza out of Singapore.&nbsp; We have stepped up the inspection and tests on imported chickens and poultry products to ensure that they are safe.&nbsp; We immediately suspended the import of live birds and poultry products from all&nbsp;countries affected by Avian Influenza.&nbsp; We have tightened the biosecurity of our farms and stepped up disease surveillance of migratory birds.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are removing or have removed the free-ranging chickens from Pulau Ubin's backyard farms, which lack the protective measures necessary to keep out Avian Influenza.&nbsp; The poultry slaughter houses have expressed interest in buying the entire stock of poultry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that since last night they have already reached an agreement to do so. Nevertheless, the farms and the residents on Pulau Ubin will be allowed to keep a few poultry in cages as pets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we have introduced measures to protect the workers in the poultry industry, ie, those who are working in the farms as well as in the slaughter houses.&nbsp; So, we require everyone working with live poultry in the farms and at the abattoirs to wear protective gear, such as masks, to follow strict hygiene practices and to undergo daily temperature checks.&nbsp; Workers are being vaccinated against human influenza.&nbsp; This will prevent people who are down with human flu from also becoming<p align=left>Column: 305<p> infected with&nbsp;bird flu, therefore,&nbsp;avoiding the risk of genetic mixing of the Avian flu and human flu viruses to form a new virus strain which&nbsp;may be transmissible between humans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>State of preparedness</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we are confident that our measures will keep the disease out, we cannot be complacent.&nbsp; In addition to MND and AVA, other Government agencies are on high alert and monitoring the situation closely.&nbsp; In case Avian Influenza slips through our tight defences, we will act swiftly to contain and eradicate the disease.&nbsp; A Ministerial Committee for Avian Influenza, comprising Ministers from relevant Ministries and supported by an Executive Group, has been set up to oversee our preparations and to decide on the contingency measures necessary if the disease appears in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Culling plans</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Avian Influenza is detected in imported poultry in the abattoirs, import will cease immediately and all birds imported on that day will be slaughtered and safely disposed of.&nbsp; Poultry from earlier consignments in the day will be recalled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven local farms that I mentioned earlier are all clustered in the Lim Chu Kang, Murai and Sungei Tengah areas, within close proximity&nbsp;of each other.&nbsp; If the Avian Influenza hits any one of these farms, all the 2.1 million birds in all seven farms will be culled and safely disposed of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will start the culling as soon as clinical signs of the Avian Influenza appear and we&nbsp;have supporting post-mortem findings and laboratory tests of Type A Influenza. &nbsp;We will not wait for<p align=left>Column: 306<p> laboratory confirmation that it is the H5N1 strain, which will take another five to seven days.&nbsp; All the farms will be \"sealed up\" during the culling.&nbsp; No poultry and eggs will be allowed in or out, and strict controls will be imposed over human and vehicular movements.&nbsp; The eggs produced during this period will be destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such quick and comprehensive action is necessary to eradicate the disease, safeguard public health, and maintain the confidence of our people as well as visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will make ex-gratia payments to the owners of the farms for the live poultry that are culled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Coordinated Government response</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Health and Government agencies, such as the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Civil Defence Force and the National Environment Agency, are all ready to assist the AVA in the culling operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Food safety and supply</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now like to talk&nbsp;about food safety and supply.&nbsp; I wish to&nbsp;assure the House that poultry and poultry products in Singapore are safe to eat. &nbsp;We have a stringent accreditation and surveillance regime to ensure that the food imported&nbsp;into Singapore is safe.&nbsp; As the virus is destroyed by heat, properly-cooked poultry and eggs, and canned and processed poultry products are safe to eat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to poultry supply and prices, as the Avian Influenza hits more areas in Asia, sources of poultry supply will be affected and we&nbsp;expect prices to go up temporarily.&nbsp; Fortunately, we do not require much of the world's supply, so I do not foresee any major problems with getting enough poultry for our needs.&nbsp; Frozen poultry is a good substitute for <p align=left>Column: 307<p>freshly slaughtered poultry, and we have large supply sources from non-affected&nbsp;countries like&nbsp;Brazil and the USA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For eggs, Malaysia is our main supplier, providing 70% of our needs.&nbsp; In the event that these egg imports have to be suspended, we can turn to other accredited countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp; However, eggs from these countries are more expensive.&nbsp; So, consumers may decide to&nbsp;switch to substitutes, such as liquid or powdered eggs, which are commonly used by the food manufacturers and hotels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Economic impact</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to the economic impact.&nbsp; The impact of an Avian Influenza outbreak on Singapore's economy should be minimal if the fallout from the disease is contained within the poultry industry.&nbsp; According to the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), the Avian Influenza will not have the same effect on the tourism industry as the SARS crisis did last year.&nbsp; This is because, unlike SARS, the virus is not transmitted from one human being to another.&nbsp; It is mainly&nbsp;transmitted through close contact with infected chickens. &nbsp;The World Health Organisation has not issued travel advisories on Avian Influenza. &nbsp;A 10-country meeting of ministers and health experts in Bangkok on 28th January also concluded that travel advisories are not necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, there has been no&nbsp;significant adverse impact on our tourist&nbsp;arrivals.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if the situation worsens in the coming weeks, the psychological impact could dampen regional tourism, including Singapore's.&nbsp; The worst-case scenario would be that of a viral mutation that allows human-to-human transmission.&nbsp; The economy, particularly the travel and tourism-related sectors, such as&nbsp;airlines, hotels and retailers, would be badly affected in such circumstances. As of <p align=left>Column: 308<p>now, this remains very unlikely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying that&nbsp;Avian Influenza is still primarily a disease affecting poultry.&nbsp; It does not pose a public health threat.&nbsp; We have implemented measures to keep it out.&nbsp; But we are vigilant and on high alert.&nbsp; We have worked out contingency plans and are ready to take decisive action should Avian Influenza appear in Singapore.&nbsp; Poultry and eggs in Singapore&nbsp;are safe to eat.&nbsp; I advise the public to stay calm but to remain alert.&nbsp; The Government will continue to keep the public informed of developments, in an open and transparent manner.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister three supplementary questions.&nbsp; Firstly, what is the probability of human-to-human transmission and how prepared are the hospitals and our public healthcare system if this should happen?&nbsp; Secondly, how long will it take for the egg farms to restart operations and production, if they were to be shut down, and what would be the impact on supply and demand, and would this shutdown period be taken into account when determining <I>ex-gratia</I> compensation for the farmers?&nbsp; Finally, can the Minister update us on the situation in Pulau Ubin, as I have heard that some farmers are unhappy over the need to get rid of their ducks and chickens?&nbsp; Would they be allowed to restart operations in future?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, on the question of human-to-human transmission, I believe the medical experts in WHO and the scientists have assessed that while there is a theoretical possibility of such transmission happening, which in turn depends on the mutation of the virus, the assessment at this stage is that such a possibility is very low.&nbsp; They are not able to put a number to it but, based on what they know at this point in time, such a possibility is low.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 309<p>because the implication of something like this happening is very significant, all agencies involved - WHO, OIE, FAO - plus the various countries, are very concerned about this.&nbsp; Therefore, we must take&nbsp;action to ensure that such a possibility remains a remote one.&nbsp; And this is the reason why we are vaccinating all the workers who are involved in the poultry farms and abattoirs and, if ever there is a need for culling, they would also be vaccinated.&nbsp; This is to prevent any possible cross-genetic mutation of the virus.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the preparedness of the hospitals, MOH has already sent out advisories to all medical personnel,&nbsp;all doctors, including the Chinese <I>sinsehs</I>, to be on the alert for any possible evidence of such infections in humans.&nbsp; The hospitals have also been placed on alert.&nbsp; All the precautionary measures that we put in place for SARS, eg, temperature checking of infected people coming in, are also still in place.&nbsp; So, if ever there is a need for us to activate, we can do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In so far as restarting production is concerned, frankly, at this point in time, our priority is to make sure that the Avian Influenza virus does not hit Singapore, and all our attention is focused on this aspect of it.&nbsp; We have not really thought about the restarting of egg production right now.&nbsp; But in a theoretical situation, if a farm were to be infected, the first thing after we have culled is to make sure that the farm is thoroughly disinfected.&nbsp; It would also take some time for us to make sure that the viral load in the farms is totally eliminated.&nbsp; This can take anything from three months to six months.&nbsp; So, it is not easy for the farms to restart production.&nbsp; And this is why I believe it is important for us to make sure that our farms do not get infected.&nbsp; If they do get infected and if they have to take a long time to restart, then obviously the farmers <p align=left>Column: 310<p>would have to take an economic&nbsp;decision whether they wish to restart the farm.&nbsp; But this is something that they would have to decide for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also asked about the situation in Pulau Ubin.&nbsp; The reason why AVA went into Pulau Ubin was because all the information that they had, suggested that the threat usually would come from the backyard farms, ie,&nbsp;those that are not biosecured.&nbsp; All the farms that are in Singapore have been required to put in place extensive biosecurity measures, eg, bird proofing, putting nets to make sure that the migratory birds do not come into contact with their chickens, disinfection, quarantine facilities, etc.&nbsp; But it is extremely difficult and expensive for the backyard farmers to put in place similar measures.&nbsp; And this is the reason why AVA decided that they would persuade the farmers, buy the chickens from them in order to make sure that this does not become a backyard entry, as it were, for the bird flu.&nbsp; We wanted to make sure that that is not the weak link in the chain</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

They are coordinating a group of laboratories to produce such a flu vaccine, specifically&nbsp;for H5N1.&nbsp; But at this point in time, such vaccines are not available.&nbsp; But there is an anti-viral drug that is available called Tamiflu.&nbsp; Tamiflu is a drug that is able to&nbsp;prevent as well as to treat the bird flu in humans.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, as far as vaccination of chickens is concerned, yes, it is true that the WHO and the OIE, when they met in Rome just a few days ago,&nbsp;did issue an advisory which appears to state that we should be vaccinating the chickens instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the advisory in greater detail and discussed this with my officials in AVA.&nbsp; I would like to clarify this point.&nbsp; It is very clear that they are not talking about vaccination instead of culling.&nbsp; In fact, what they are saying is: \"stamping out&nbsp;or culling is the preferred control option for an outbreak of H5NI, which is the bird flu, and it should be used for all flocks exhibiting clinical diseases.&nbsp; It has been highly effective in controlling outbreaks of H5NI where there is limited spread and low risk of reintroduction.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, the position really is that if you can cull, you should do so, because that is still the best way of eradicating&nbsp;the disease.&nbsp; This is what Hong Kong did in 1997.&nbsp; They culled 1.5 million birds and, effectively, stopped the outbreak from spreading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I think what they are saying now&nbsp;is&nbsp;for situations where it is not <p align=left>Column: 318<p>practical or perhaps economic cost is high for culling all chickens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, if you are talking about Indonesia or China, it is practically impossible for such a method to be effective.&nbsp; How can you cull all the chickens in China or all the chickens in Indonesia?&nbsp; It is just not practical.&nbsp; What I think they are trying to say is that in such a situation where you can cull the infected birds and those around them, do so.&nbsp; For the rest, you vaccinate.&nbsp; But in our case, the situation is quite different.&nbsp; Our farms are all located very close together.&nbsp; We do not have such a large population as in those countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are actually able to cull and use this more effective method of eradication of the disease, and this is what we prefer to do.&nbsp; So we will cull completely in the event of an outbreak.&nbsp; And if we do so, it is not just to eradicate the disease effectively, it also ensures that there is no reservoir of the disease remaining so that public health is safeguarded.&nbsp; Equally important, it increases or maintains the confidence of our own people and visitors to Singapore if we can do that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you can vaccinate if you cannot cull completely.&nbsp; But if you can cull completely, please do so.&nbsp; This is how we read the FAO and WHO advice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Pulau Ubin situation, yes, there were long queues.&nbsp; Let us put things in perspective.&nbsp; We are talking about maybe 700 chickens altogether in Pulau Ubin.&nbsp; I do not think we can take the risk of letting the disease come in via these 700 chickens and putting the two million odd birds in Singapore at risk.&nbsp; That is the reason why AVA went in to Pulau Ubin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on ex-gratia payment, the principle of this is that if&nbsp;there is an infection and we have to cull.&nbsp; The chances are that all the birds will be infected and will be destroyed anyway.&nbsp; Ex-gratia payment allows us to move in quickly and take pre-emptive measures.&nbsp; So what do we do?&nbsp; We will pay what we <p align=left>Column: 319<p>believe to be&nbsp;the market rate for the layers.&nbsp; But beyond this point, I think it is difficult for us to completely or totally compensate the farmers on loss of business and all the other expenses involved.&nbsp; I accept that there will be many other expenses involved.&nbsp; In the same way, when we compensated the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, we were not able to compensate them fully for the&nbsp;loss of business.&nbsp; In fact, there was some unhappiness there.&nbsp; We have to explain that we are prepared to compensate on an ex-gratia basis.&nbsp; This is an indication that Government is willing to share part of the cost with them.&nbsp; But it is not our intention nor is it correct for Government to fully compensate them for all the losses that they would incur as a result of this.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best thing that we can do is to make sure that it does not come.&nbsp; And for that, I think we are putting in a lot of effort and a lot of money to make sure that it does not hit us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The farmers have also been asked to cooperate and I am happy to say that they themselves realise that their livelihood is at stake and they are cooperating fully on that.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They do not come here.&nbsp; So far, for the last many years, we have not seen them here.&nbsp; They come from Siberia and they bypass Singapore and they go to Indonesia, the Philippines and other places, and then they go down south.&nbsp; I am not sure why.&nbsp; The fact remains that they do not come here, which is another&nbsp;blessing in disguise.&nbsp; Migratory birds are being watched very carefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for mynahs, crows, etc, as I indicated earlier in my reply to Mdm Halimah, such free-flying wild birds are not known to be transmitters of the Avian flu virus.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as I indicated in my statement, we are monitoring them.&nbsp; We are catching them and checking them to make sure that this is indeed so.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; an active programme&nbsp;to cull them, because I know that many of our residents find them a nuisance&nbsp;

All our chickens for the table come from either Malaysia's live chickens or frozen chickens from Brazil mainly, and from the US.&nbsp; The only chickens that we have are the layers.&nbsp; They are the ones who produce 30% of our eggs.&nbsp; So the question really is whether we need to be self-sufficient in eggs.&nbsp; Off-hand, I would say no, because there is really no reason why we cannot get sources of supply from other countries, and there are many, many sources of supply.&nbsp; But having said that, I think this is a decision which we would have to discuss and consider several steps down the road.&nbsp; Our first priority is to make sure that our farms are biosecure and that it does not hit us.&nbsp;

In other words, we do not import from any farm or every farm in Malaysia.&nbsp; Only those farms that are accredited by AVA are allowed to export to Singapore.&nbsp; The reason is that we want to be able to do those things that she is talking about.&nbsp; In other words, to check the farms to make sure that the farms are biosecure, to make sure that the procedures are in place, and to make sure that the farm workers are following good hygienic practices, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to inform her that AVA is indeed stepping up its checks on these farms.&nbsp; So far, it has been satisfied that all the necessary precautions are taken.&nbsp; In fact, AVA is working very closely with its counterparts in Malaysia, which is the Department of Veterinary Science, to monitor, to exchange information, and to check as thoroughly as possible.&nbsp; Do not forget that their livelihoods are at stake too.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a big industry and I think it is in their interest, and they realise it, that they have&nbsp;to be extra vigilant.&nbsp; So they have been doing the checks.&nbsp; We are also doing the checks and as another level of check, when the chickens come to Singapore at the Second Link, and they all come in through one point,&nbsp;they are checked again.&nbsp; And on top of that, apart from physical checking of the symptoms,<p align=left>Column: 324<p> random checks are done, birds are taken off the trucks, sent to the laboratory, checked again.&nbsp; So there are various levels of checks to make sure that the chickens that we import into Singapore, that are slaughtered here, that we eat here, are free from the bird flu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about a travel advisory?&nbsp; So far, the health authority (WHO) has not seen it necessary to issue any travel advisory.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Ministers have met, and they&nbsp;have also not issued any travel advisory.&nbsp; So there is really no need for any country to issue a travel advisory.&nbsp; But commonsense precautions must be taken when you go to these countries.&nbsp; And there are situations, for example, they do have markets where live poultry is being sold, and you should avoid&nbsp;close contact with poultry.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also, if you feel it necessary, get a flu jab, but this is again something that we are not advising everybody to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for taking of Tamiflu, again this is something which I do not think should be taken unless it is necessary.&nbsp; It is not a vaccine.&nbsp; Unless you think that you are going to be placed in a position where you are going to be in contact with a farm worker or&nbsp;somebody who is going to be engaged in the culling operations, in that situation, yes, take the Tamiflu, and we will give them Tamiflu.&nbsp; But, otherwise, I do not see any necessity for doing so.&nbsp; The stocks that we are carrying really is meant for those people who are going to be involved in the culling operations.&nbsp; We want to make sure that they are all protected.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They are separately checked.&nbsp; Birds are pulled out from there on a random basis, and random testing has been stepped up.&nbsp; So far, it has not shown any sign of the bird flu in the birds coming in.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the tests effective?&nbsp; Yes, of course, they are.&nbsp; What we are doing is to test them for&nbsp;H5N1.&nbsp; We would test them for type A first.&nbsp; The H5N1 virus strain needs a bit longer to identify.&nbsp;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill collates a number of minor amendments to several Acts. They are mostly technical amendments, but let me highlight the key ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Community Mediation Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Community Mediation Act.&nbsp; Clause 3 amends section 15 of the Community Mediation Act to enhance the power of a Magistrate to refer complaints to a Community Mediation Centre for mediation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 327<p>Section 128 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for a person seeking redress against another whom he believes has committed an offence, to appear before a Magistrate to make a complaint, called a Magistrate's Complaint.&nbsp; Section 15 of the Community Mediation Act currently empowers the Magistrate to refer appropriate complaints to the Community Mediation Centres for mediation, but only if the disputing parties agree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment will enable the Magistrate to refer appropriate cases to the Community Mediation Centres, even when both parties do not agree, especially where the cases relate to neighbourly and community-related disputes. This is already the approach adopted by established jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada.&nbsp; We are making this amendment, bearing in mind feedback received from our volunteer mediators, Members of Parliament and members of the public who had experienced such disputes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is currently the case, in deciding whether a case should or should not be referred to mediation at the Community Mediation Centres, the Magistrate would bear in mind various factors such as the nature of the dispute, their previous attempts to resolve the matter and the appropriateness of sending the parties to mediation given the facts of the case. The order to attend mediation will only restrict the parties in so far as it relates to process. In other words, the parties are free to decide the outcome of their case when they meet at the mediation table. Hence, no one will be compelled into a settlement. If the mediation is unsuccessful, parties may proceed to have their day in court. But it is good to strengthen our processes to at least have the parties talk it over before an impartial, trained mediator. This way, we hope that more disputes on the ground, especially<p align=left>Column: 328<p> those between neighbours, can be settled amicably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Acts of Parliament have express provisions that allow selected offences under the respective Acts to be made compoundable. Sir, this is in regard to the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp; Such a power allows public authorities the discretion to compound offences where it is not sufficiently serious to warrant prosecution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review by Government agencies has identified several Acts that have offences which are suitable for composition, but which do not have the required provisions to allow the offences to be compounded. Clause 4 amends the Criminal Procedure Code to provide a general power to the relevant authorities to make offences compoundable, by specifying the offences through subsidiary legislation. This will obviate the need to amend multiple Acts to insert the power to compound the offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition amount that an authority may impose under this clause is capped at half of the maximum fine prescribed for the offence, or $2,000, whichever is lower. The power conferred under this clause does not extend to Acts which already have provisions relating to the composition of offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is part of MinLaw's initiative to encourage regulatory agencies to decriminalise minor offences, especially regulatory ones, and promote the use of non-criminal sanctions. Although the offences where composition may be offered remain as criminal offences, offenders are given the opportunity to avoid prosecution and possible criminal conviction if they pay the composition fine offered by the authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=left>Column: 329<p><I>Amendment to the Bankruptcy Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Bankruptcy Act.&nbsp; Currently, bankrupts have to notify both the Official Assignee and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) when they change their residential address. Clause 2(a) amends the Bankruptcy Act to deem notice of a change of address to the ICA as notice to the Official Assignee. The Official Assignee can use information from the National Registration Office of the ICA for service of notices on bankrupts. Bankrupts will henceforth no longer need to separately notify the Official Assignee once they have notified the change to the ICA or any Neighbourhood Police Centres or Police Posts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2(b) amends the Bankruptcy Act to remove the requirement for the Official Assignee to make annual publications of the list of bankrupts. This is because the Official Assignee now provides an online enquiry service which enables the public to enquire as to the bankruptcy status of individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Miscellaneous amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me&nbsp;wrap up now by taking&nbsp;the House briefly through the remaining key provisions of the Bill which are in the nature of facilitating better administration of the Acts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends paragraph 5(a) Part I of the Fourth Schedule of the Land Transport Authority Act to replace the phrase \"in contravention of any written law\" with \"without the contravention of any written law\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is to give effect to the intention of the LTA to pay compensation for the removal, pursuant to LTA's <p align=left>Column: 330<p>instructions, of only structures that were legally erected and maintained. The current wording, resulting from a 1997 amendment, creates the impression that LTA compensates the cost of removing structures that were erected and maintained illegally. This was not the intention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Legal Aid and Advice Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends the Legal Aid and Advice Act to remove a reference to the Rent Conciliation and Tenants Compensation Board, which is no longer functioning following the repeal of the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act in the year 2002.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 repeals section 4 of the Public Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act which provides for the prohibition of trading in blood. This provision was made redundant when the Human Organ Transplant Act was enacted which also provides for a similar prohibition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Probate and Administration Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends the Probate and Administration Act to replace several references to the Official Assignee with the Public Trustee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is because over the years, administration has become more specialised such that there is now a clear distinction between the functions of the Official Assignee and the Public Trustee even though the two positions are currently held by the same person. The Public Trustee deals mainly with administration of a deceased's estate, whereas the Official Assignee deals with bankruptcy matters. In addition, there is the possibility that if the Official Assignee <p align=left>Column: 331<p>handles a deceased person's estate when he is not a bankrupt, the public may get the wrong impression that the deceased was a bankrupt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Street Works Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir,&nbsp;clause 9 amends section 32A of the Street Works Act to enable the Land Transport Authority to delegate to authorised officers of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) the power to take enforcement measures against obstructions on certain footways. URA has agreed to the delegation as it wants to ensure that such footways are kept obstruction-free, so that building linkways remain pedestrian-friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 334<p> The Fire Safety Act was last amended in 2000.&nbsp; Since then, the threat from terrorism has required us to put regulatory control on flammable materials under the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).&nbsp; Building designers have also requested that more flexibility be given to them to design fire safety solutions.&nbsp; The SCDF has introduced new operating procedures, which require the delegation of more powers to their junior officers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this, MHA is now proposing several key amendments to the Act to enable:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; the adoption of a performance-based approach towards fire safety;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; extension of regulatory control to flammable materials, including petroleum; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; provision for other changes relating to fire safety in buildings and the extension of SCDF powers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Performance-based approach to fire safety</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall first touch on the proposed performance-based approach to fire safety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fire Safety Act provides for the fire safety regulations and effective enforcement of fire safety standards.&nbsp; Currently, fire safety standards for buildings in Singapore are governed by the Code of Practice for Fire Precautions in Buildings, commonly known as the \"Fire Code\".&nbsp; The Fire Code, first introduced in 1974 and last revised in 2002, prescribes specific fire safety requirements and measures without stating the intention or desired outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prescriptive approach is rigid and restricts flexibility in building designs, as requirements specified in the Fire Code have to be strictly adhered to.&nbsp; For example, the types of construction <p align=left>Column: 335<p>materials and fire protection systems to be used are specified in the Fire Code and the Qualified Person, who is the registered architect or professional engineer, has to follow these specifications strictly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such rigid requirements have led to feedback and requests from building designers and owners for more flexibility.&nbsp; In fact, some have hired Qualified Persons to propose alternative solutions that still meet the fire safety standards, and sought waivers from compliance with the Fire Code requirements.&nbsp; Examples of buildings where performance-based solutions have been used include the Singapore Expo and the Esplanade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, the trend overseas is towards adopting a performance-based approach towards fire safety.&nbsp; Countries that have adopted the performance-based approach include New Zealand, Australia, Sweden, USA, UK and Japan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the feedback and developments in other countries, SCDF consulted the relevant professional bodies, such as the Singapore Institute of Architects and the Institute of Engineers, Singapore, as well as the academia, and has recommended the adoption of a performance-based approach towards fire safety in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fire Code will be amended to incorporate the performance provisions, which would specify the desired fire safety objectives.&nbsp; It would then be up to the fire safety engineers to devise fire safety solutions that meet these objectives.&nbsp; The proposed fire safety engineering approach will not compromise the current high standards and levels of fire safety, and is in line with the Government's approach to reducing over-regulation and be business-friendly.&nbsp; In some instances, there could be cost savings as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to emphasise that the<p align=left>Column: 336<p> prescriptive measures will be maintained in the Fire Code because it will still be used in designing buildings that have less scope for design flexibility, eg, residential houses, apartments and offices.&nbsp; Developers who do not wish to incur extra costs in engaging fire safety engineers can also follow the prescriptive measures in the Fire Code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall now elaborate on the amendments required to introduce the performance-based approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Duties and responsibilities of Fire Safety Engineers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 specifies that only Qualified Persons trained in fire safety engineering may design performance-based fire safety solutions.&nbsp; A Qualified Person who is not a fire safety engineer must be supervised by a fire safety engineer in the preparation of the plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 also requires the appointment of a peer reviewer.&nbsp; The job of the peer reviewer is to assess whether the performance-based solution proposed by the fire safety engineer satisfies the requirements of the Fire Code.&nbsp; This review by an independent and competent party acts as a safeguard to ensure that the fire safety standards are maintained.&nbsp; This peer review system is similar to the Building and Construction Authority's accredited checker system, where an accredited checker would check the calculations done by the structural engineer and conduct a separate analysis to verify if the structural design is sound before the structural plans are submitted to BCA.&nbsp; To ensure the integrity of the independent review, the peer reviewer must not have any professional or financial interest in the fire safety works he reviews.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Registration of Fire Safety Engineers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 provides that a person with<p align=left>Column: 337<p> the necessary educational qualifications in the field of fire safety engineering and has at least five years of practical experience in the design of fire safety works can be registered as&nbsp;fire safety engineers.&nbsp; These criteria would be prescribed in the regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Formation of the Investigation Committee</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 also empowers the Commissioner SCDF to take disciplinary actions against a fire safety engineer should a complaint be received against him.&nbsp; To ensure professionalism and independence in the investigation process, the Commissioner SCDF may form an Investigation Committee.&nbsp; Members of this committee will be drawn from the Fire Safety Engineers Discipline Panel, which the Minister will appoint, and comprise fire safety engineers and officers of the SCDF.&nbsp; For consistency, clause 5 amends the existing appointing authority or persons on the Inquiry Panel for registered inspectors from the Commissioner SCDF to the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to extend regulatory control to flammable materials</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to other amendments.&nbsp; The Act currently regulates the transportation and storage of petroleum-based flammables but does not include non-petroleum flammable materials, eg, magnesium and hydrogen.&nbsp; Presently, there are more than 2,000 companies handling hazardous materials, or Hazmat, in Singapore.&nbsp; This number is expected to increase with the rapid growth of our petrochemical, pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals industries on Jurong Island and other parts of Singapore.&nbsp; The rise of international terrorism has added a further dimension to the Hazmat threat.&nbsp; Terrorists could hijack vehicles transporting flammable materials for use as improvised weapons of mass<p align=left>Column: 338<p> destruction.&nbsp; It is, therefore, necessary to address this threat arising from this fast-growing industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To better deal with these threats, MHA proposes to extend its regulatory control to encompass other flammable materials.&nbsp; Clause 16 repeals and re-enacts section 35 with two new sections 35A and 35B to extend the regulation of transport and storage of petroleum to import, transport and storage of petroleum and flammable materials.&nbsp; The new section 35 disallows any person to store any flammable material unless the premises are licensed and the quantities stored are in accordance with the prescribed conditions in the licence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 35A requires a person importing any class of petroleum or any flammable material to hold a valid licence to import petroleum or flammable material.&nbsp; To ensure that Hazmat transportation drivers are security cleared and trained in handling emergencies while on the road, section 35B requires the drivers of road vehicles transporting any class of petroleum or flammable materials to hold a valid licence to transport such materials and a permit to drive the vehicle.&nbsp; It also requires the vehicles used to transport the petroleum or flammable materials to be licensed by the Commissioner SCDF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Petroleum Act will be repealed consequentially as a result of these proposed amendments.&nbsp; It is obsolete as most of its provisions are already covered under the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Extension of Fire Certificate scheme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to the amendments concerning fire safety in buildings.&nbsp; The Act currently requires&nbsp;offices and other commercial buildings to engage a Professional Engineer to certify that the fire safety systems in their<p align=left>Column: 339<p> buildings are in good working condition before Fire Certificates can be issued.&nbsp; This requirement currently does not extend to industrial buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fires in industrial buildings have increased over the years.&nbsp; In 1998, 34 cases of fires were reported.&nbsp; It doubled in 1999 and 2000, reaching a high of 130 cases.&nbsp; For the year 2003, there were 93 cases.&nbsp; These industrial fires since 1998 have resulted in four deaths and 66 injuries.&nbsp; Therefore, there is a need to ensure that the fire systems in industrial buildings are functioning properly, so that life and property are not put at risk.&nbsp; For this reason, MHA proposes that the Act be amended</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Although it means an additional business cost to owners, it is a small price to pay to ensure that the fire safety systems in these industrial buildings are in good working condition.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Fire safety requirements in Government-owned buildings</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA is also amending the Act to cover the fire safety works in Government-owned buildings. Currently, the Act requires plans to be submitted to SCDF for fire safety works done in any building, except those owned or occupied by the Government.&nbsp; Although Government-owned and occupied buildings submit plans of fire safety work, SCDF is not empowered to take action against the Qualified Persons engaged for Government-owned buildings if they fail to comply with the fire safety requirements or do not build according to the approved plans.&nbsp; To plug this loophole, the proposed amendment makes it clear that any building that is wholly or partially owned or occupied by the Government is also subject to the provisions of the Act and empowers the<p align=left>Column: 340<p> SCDF to take action against Qualified Persons or fire safety engineers who do not comply with the fire safety requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Extension of powers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Act currently empowers any authorised&nbsp;SCDF officer ranked Second Lieutenant and above, with other members under his command, to take necessary action in the event of a fire, for example,&nbsp;entering or breaking into premises to prevent the spread of fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The employment of advanced and more mobile fire fighting equipment by the SCDF, for example,&nbsp;its two-men fire bike teams, means that junior officers may arrive at the scene of the fire ahead of&nbsp;the&nbsp;main team and the senior officers. As quick action can make a difference in life and death situations, it is important to empower them to be able to take quick action at the scene of the fire.&nbsp; The proposed amendment empowers all SCDF officers to take the necessary actions in the event of a fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the Act empowers any authorised SCDF officer ranked Second Lieutenant and above to arrest without warrant, any persons whom he suspects to have committed an offence under the&nbsp;Act, for example, obstructing any&nbsp;SCDF officer from carrying out&nbsp;his duty in fighting fires.&nbsp; Such powers of arrests are necessary as calling for Police assistance may unnecessarily slow down the fire fighters in the performance of their duties.&nbsp; The perpetrator may also escape before the arrival of the Police. The proposed amendments will extend the powers of arrest to SCDF officers holding the rank of Warrant Officers and above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposals that I have presented today are necessary to ensure that the Act remains relevant to our needs.&nbsp; They will enable us to maintain our high fire safety standards<p align=left>Column: 341<p> while offering design flexibility in buildings.&nbsp; The amendments will also allow us to maintain a high level of security by preventing flammable goods from being misused by terrorists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</B> Sir, this is an important piece of legislation for the safety of the public&nbsp;from fire and chemical hazards.&nbsp; From that perspective, it is to be particularly welcomed.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important issue, however, is to convince the public that the costs,&nbsp;which will be necessarily&nbsp;incurred, as referred to by the Minister, will need to be made.&nbsp; He said that it was a small cost to improve the safety of the public.&nbsp; But I think it has to be demonstrated that this scheme will definitely be necessary to upgrade the safety of institutions and buildings in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my questions, therefore, on the Bill, relate to the measures to be taken to implement these provisions, rather than the policies behind the Bill.&nbsp; One preliminary question is whether existing industrial buildings, which hitherto were not subject to fire regulations, may require to satisfy the new regulations under the Fire Safety Bill once enacted.&nbsp; That is my first preliminary question, ie, will the existing industrial buildings be subject to the new regulation and, if so, when will they have to satisfy such regulations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Bill provides for the setting up of a body of fire safety engineers. As I understand it, this is not&nbsp;a type of engineer that&nbsp;has hitherto been recognised.&nbsp; There is a new body of fire safety engineers to be put in place.&nbsp; The Minister has referred to some of the qualifications necessary for such<p align=left>Column: 342<p> engineers, to be called fire safety engineers.&nbsp; But I wonder whether there are actually enough fire safety engineers in Singapore to carry out the purposes of&nbsp; the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, SCDF is now to take over the regulation of storage, transport and import of flammable materials.&nbsp; Does that mean that SCDF has the overall authority to prescribe conditions and give licences for such activities?&nbsp; And if so, what is the extent of this new regulatory scheme?&nbsp; For example, does this mean that even delivery vans of cooking gas cylinders will be subject to licensing by SCDF?&nbsp; If this is the case, does that really mean that more paperwork and more licensing authorities to go to, because such operators will now have to go to both LTA and SCDF to get such certification and licensing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Minister mentioned that there will be extended powers of arrest without warrant&nbsp;extended to all SCDF Warrant Officers.&nbsp; What are the reasons for this?&nbsp; Will there be prescribed procedures to make sure that such powers of arrest, which are very wide, should be used with circumspection?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> Sir, I have something to clarify.&nbsp; I refer to new section 22A of the Bill, which deals with fire safety engineers, and how to ensure the integrity&nbsp;and&nbsp;independence of the peer reviewer appointed to review or assess whether any alternative solutions to satisfy any fire performance requirements.&nbsp; In subsection (7)(b) of this section, it states that \"in the case of a husband and wife living together, the interest of one spouse shall, if known to the other, be deemed to be also an interest to &nbsp;the other.\"&nbsp; Sir, I wonder why the Bill specifically states a husband and wife living together.&nbsp; Is there a special meaning to it, or does it mean that if they are husband and wife, but not living together,<p align=left>Column: 343<p> it does not fall within this&nbsp;section if there is a&nbsp;conflict of interest or&nbsp;whatever?&nbsp; I would like the Minister to clarify.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, the question of cost, of course, is always a big concern among our building owners and others who may have to spend money to&nbsp;improve or provide for fire safety.&nbsp; I think the cost should be justifiable, because we are talking about saving lives.&nbsp; Whatever measure that is needed to&nbsp;prevent a fire is a necessary measure that will prevent harm being done to unsuspecting individuals who may be victims of fire caused by&nbsp;whatever reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take that into account when we&nbsp;talk about saving lives.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding&nbsp;industrial buildings that are already there now, the question is whether&nbsp;we immediately require them to put in all these fire safety measures or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a period of inspections, I am sure our SCDF officers will visit&nbsp;industrial buildings to ensure that they have good fire safety measures in place.&nbsp; But we will not apply the Act retroactively to require all building owners to comply immediately.&nbsp; But, over time, through inspections we will give advice and require industrial building owners to comply with the new measures&nbsp;in protecting lives in their buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Chin said that the fire safety engineers is a new term.&nbsp; But actually it is not new.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is new perhaps to Singapore.&nbsp; In other countries, they have fire safety engineering courses.&nbsp; The SCDF has been working in conjunction with the University of Western Sydney to prepare&nbsp;for our people to take such a course. So far, 40 fire safety engineers have been trained and they have received&nbsp;their Masters degree from the University of Western Sydney. Another 21 have just taken their examinations and&nbsp;awaiting&nbsp;the results. Another 18 are on the first-year course and 18&nbsp;on the second-year course.&nbsp; In November this year, they are going to<p align=left>Column: 344<p>have the next intake of another 20 students. Taking into account the need for fire safety engineers to deal with performance-based fire safety regulations, this should be adequate, because we expect the number of building plans that will use the&nbsp;performance-based fire safety approach will be a small one. We are talking about complex buildings, difficult to design buildings, etc.&nbsp; From our calculations, based on&nbsp;past plans, it is about 5% of the plans submitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of engineers should be adequate to meet this demand.&nbsp; Over time, more will be trained and also others&nbsp;who have gone to courses overseas on their own and have returned, they will also form part of the pool of expertise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the SCDF's extension of powers to regulate flammable materials,&nbsp;we are not extending to all kinds of vehicles.&nbsp; The Member was talking about the gas cylinders used for domestic cooking.&nbsp; Currently, these are already licensed under the Fire Safety Petroleum Regulations.&nbsp; It is not part of the new extended measures under this&nbsp;amendment Bill.&nbsp; It is also not practical to control small quantities of flammable materials or petroleum. We talk about reasonable bounds beyond a certain quantity that will be&nbsp;subject to these new prescriptions.&nbsp;I think there is no need to worry about the SCDF chasing all vehicles to make sure that they comply. But for those that convey LPG for home domestic uses or to&nbsp;our hawker centres, etc, they are already subject to regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether we should make it easier and convenient for people so that there will not be too many places to apply for licences, currently there are only two authorities&nbsp;inspecting&nbsp;vehicles.&nbsp; One is done by the SCDF for vehicles that carry Hazmat and&nbsp;one is by&nbsp;LTA on the vehicle itself. We will work with LTA to see whether both inspections can be carried out at the same time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 345<p> As regards the powers of the officers, I have explained in my speech that, with&nbsp;the two-men operation on&nbsp;fire&nbsp;bikes,&nbsp;most of the time, that will be adequate to deal with some situations, particularly the HDB flat fires or HDB rubbish&nbsp;chute fires.&nbsp; There is no need to have a big turnout of fire-fighters.&nbsp; But in case there is a&nbsp;fire in a flat and the SCDF&nbsp;fire bikes are the first to approach and they cannot get access to it because the officers are too junior and do&nbsp;not have the powers to enter, that is the precise reason why&nbsp;we are providing for this measure so that they can do their duties before the arrival of the senior team.&nbsp; It is for the good of the flat owner who&nbsp;is affected because many&nbsp;a time,&nbsp;we find that the&nbsp;more junior officers are the first to arrive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the powers of arrest, I have mentioned in my speech that only Warrant Officers and above are empowered to do the arrest.&nbsp; This is not different from equivalent levels of ranks in the other uniformed services, like the Police.&nbsp; We need to give them the powers because right now, it is only granted to the Lieutenant.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;an extension to&nbsp;enable more officers to exercise their powers, just in case&nbsp;in the performance of&nbsp;their duties, our more junior officers are obstructed by people who&nbsp;want to prevent them from doing their job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Currently, the Registry of Companies and Businesses (RCB) is responsible for the incorporation of companies and the registration of businesses. It seeks to ensure that companies and businesses comply with the relevant laws, and maintain a repository of financial reports and business information. The Public Accountants Board (PAB) registers and regulates public accountants who are qualified to sign off companies' accounts as auditors. It also maintains professional auditing standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Rationale for merger</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of our efforts to promote a more conducive business environment, we have been moving towards a disclosure based regime for business regulation. &nbsp;This requires enhancing our regulatory framework for monitoring and enforcing companies' compliance with disclosure requirements and accounting standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is with this&nbsp;objective that the Government announced its plans to merge RCB and PAB in May last year. The merger will achieve synergies between the monitoring of companies' compliance with disclosure requirements and the regulation of public accountants performing statutory audit. This merger will consolidate within a single Government entity the expertise to carry out these functions effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Bill provides for the formation of this new statutory board on 1st April 2004. To reflect its role as a regulator of corporate entities, businesses and public accountants, the statutory<p align=left>Column: 348<p> board will be called the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, or ACRA for short.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACRA's mission will be, \"to provide a responsive and forward looking regulatory environment for companies, businesses and public accountants, conducive to enterprise and growth in Singapore.\" ACRA will maintain a strong focus on issues concerning businesses, such as developing the corporate law framework, accounting, and corporate governance. It will also register and regulate public accountants who act as auditors of companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a regulatory agency, a substantial part of ACRA's work will be to ensure that companies, businesses and auditors observe relevant standards and comply with legal requirements. However, an effective enforcement regime cannot rely solely on tough penalties for offenders. ACRA will promote greater awareness and understanding of the requirements and standards. It will engage its stakeholders regularly through public consultations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important aspect of ACRA's work is to promote a business-friendly environment. This is fundamental to our drive to make Singapore an attractive global hub for business. ACRA will support the work of the Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance, a private-sector led committee set up to prescribe accounting standards in Singapore and advise the Government on corporate governance and disclosure matters. ACRA will also work closely with other Government agencies as well as professional organisations such as the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore and the Singapore Institute of Directors to maintain high auditing standards and to help companies adopt good disclosure and corporate governance practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve its mission and meet the<p align=left>Column: 349<p> challenges ahead, the ACRA Board will comprise private sector representatives and professionals as well as people from the public sector and academia.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Main povisions in the Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, I shall now highlight the main features of the Bill. Parts I and II of the Bill establish ACRA as a statutory board under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. Specifically, clause 5 empowers the Minister to appoint up to a maximum of 16 Board members, with two appointed in their capacity as representatives from the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part III sets out ACRA's functions and powers which are essentially those already undertaken by RCB and PAB today. In addition, ACRA will represent the Government internationally on matters relating to the registration and regulation of business entities and public accountants, and promote public awareness on new business structures, compliance requirements, and corporate governance practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV of the Bill sets out the provisions for the appointment of the Chief Executive and officers of the Board. It also gives protection from personal liability to an officer or employee in discharging his duties in good faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part V specifies that ACRA will be set up as a self-funding statutory board with full revenue retention. Clause 16 of the Bill requires ACRA to submit a copy of all annual estimates and supplementary estimates to the Minister for Finance, and to publish a summary of the estimates in the <I>Gazette.</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part VI of the Bill provides for the transfer of property, assets, liabilities and employees to ACRA.

In these days of complex business environment governed by various laws and regulations and, in some ways, confusing to our new businesses, it will be convenient for corporations to refer to one authority for answers on company matters and for accountants to refer to it for clarification when circumstances require it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since businesses have to follow the frequent changes to the Companies Act as well as the rules governing accounting and its reporting, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority should be the agency to reach out to for clarification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The formation of ACRA will also help the Authority understand the business risks that accountants and businessmen take, as well as the regulatory web that businesses have to go through in their pursuit for profits.&nbsp; This is now possible as clause 6(1)(a) allows ACRA to administer both the Accountants Act and the Companies Act together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaction to changes in the Companies Act will influence the way accountants advise their clients, especially when it comes to external reporting.&nbsp; Complying<p align=left>Column: 351<p> with the latest standards in financial reporting would be easier to encourage when it becomes enforceable under the powers possessed by ACRA.&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, statutory standards in accounting are set by the Companies Act, which provides detailed provisions governing accounting and auditing of companies.&nbsp; Such close correlation between the Companies Act and its reporting requirements makes it easy to respond to market changes and demands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.14 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The formation of ACRA will mean that the Government regulatory arm will be far-reaching in respect of influencing how businesses report their financial performance and as to how businesses govern&nbsp;their affairs.&nbsp; The collapse of corporate icons of Enron and WorldCom has shown that corporate disclosures in the US and other jurisdictions are lacking and that there is plenty of room for improvements.&nbsp; Furthermore, the ACRA will no doubt be emphasising more on matters such as corporate disclosure&nbsp;in response to the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the US.&nbsp; The next question on everyone's mind would now be on the style and manner which&nbsp;ACRA would take in influencing changes and enforcement of regulatory requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public reporting is a public interest activity and places the responsibility on all participants in the process.&nbsp; These include corporate management and board of directors who have the primary responsibility in public reporting.&nbsp; Auditors, standard setters</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>and regulators all have a part to play to improve the information process to the public.&nbsp; Let us also not forget the lawyers, investment bankers, analysts and credit agencies.&nbsp; It is only when everyone places primary<p align=left>Column: 352<p> importance on this role, and subsequently a change in attitude to responsibilities, will the credibility of financial information be raised.&nbsp; Such recognition will also lead towards better business ethics and a strengthened business culture.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to suggest further that the Singapore approach to greater responsibilities in public reporting be much less dependent upon regulation, but to try to strike a balance between regulation imposed by authorities and reliance on market mechanisms.&nbsp; Legal requirements should be viewed as a necessary minimum, while self-regulation should still be encouraged wherever possible.&nbsp; Statutory regulation still has a part to play but&nbsp;should not be the mainstay of the new Authority.&nbsp; Primary legislation, for example, should contain a general (rather than a specific) obligation on the part of listed companies to make continuous disclosures.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these can also lead to less bureaucratic costs when transparency is not via the legalistic route but instead by self-regulatory market mechanisms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the question of speed in introducing new laws.&nbsp; It has been known that lawmakers and standard setters have been engaging in a catch-up game in the mushrooming use of innovative derivative products.&nbsp; While the time taken to produce innovative derivative financial instruments may only take months, the time taken to implement new security legislation to govern their use, and accounting rules to determine how one should report them in the company accounts, can take years.&nbsp; Thus, putting excessive confidence in a legalistic approach may lead to a less innovative business environment when corporations fear using new instruments without the comfort of the law.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, under the legalistic approach, there may be a reduction in performance reporting from companies to investors as they do not try to understand<p align=left>Column: 353<p> what information is needed to communicate to investors, in order to most effectively explain their business model.&nbsp; Instead, they focus on what regulators have set out as important to investors.&nbsp; In such a reporting environment, there is little room for best practice since satisfying regulatory requirements is all that is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the countries around us and the competition posed, we have to ask, how much attention will East Asia play to the rush to be more transparent and to take corporate governance seriously.&nbsp; I believe that a lot will depend on the political will of each government.&nbsp; But the introduction of this Bill will hasten the need for other countries to follow suit, not because it is a legal requirement but because good corporate governance will help to draw new capital.&nbsp; Take, for example, when CalPERS (California Public Employees Retirement System), one of the largest institutional investors, in February 2002 pulled their investments out of companies in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, citing concerns over corporate governance, badly needed capital&nbsp;dried out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the competition for new capital will push the need for good corporate governance among the countries in this region.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when ACRA exercises its role in the marketplace, we must not allow it to remove the risks associated with investing.&nbsp; Capital market works well with&nbsp;the presence of risks, and ACRA should instead ensure that every corporation play by the rules with investors having access to reliable information needed to make prudent decisions, and that everyone who violates the law is held accountable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I look forward to a more dynamic marketplace with the passing of this Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 354<p>\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, with the introduction of ACRA, I would envisage that the authority will enhance and improve the grounds for greater corporate governance that is the order of the day.&nbsp; I hope that an enlarged entity will provide the requisite resources that will further the development and encourage a culture of good governance and reward systems for good behaviour in the regulation of companies.&nbsp; This will result in immense benefit to the corporate and business scene in Singapore.&nbsp; Furthermore, potential synergies or other efficiencies that will arise from the merger of the various functions may provide for a more efficient regulatory and administrative service.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to express my support for the proposed Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Bill.&nbsp; However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are some areas that I would like to seek further clarification from the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former Registry of&nbsp; Companies and Businessess served a mainly administrative function.&nbsp; But it appears from the provisions that the new authority is meant to be granted greater policing powers.&nbsp; I would like to know how the authority is meant to exercise its powers in a regulatory manner when other bodies, like the SGX and SIC, already administer and enforce certain elements of the aforementioned Bill.&nbsp; How is the authority supposed to complement the existing regulatory authorities with regard to the Bill?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, although I understand that the administration of a company is very much linked to that of accounting practices, I would like to hear from the Minister the specific advantages for merging an accounting regulatory body with a corporate regulatory body.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, these roles are as different as chocolate and cheese.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how he proposes to<p align=left>Column: 355<p> implement these two distinct roles into one body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point I would like to seek some clarification on is the fact that there is specific legislation in the proposed Bill that grants an officer or employee of the authority certain police powers.&nbsp; In addition, the Bill provides that when an offence under the proposed Bill is committed by a body corporate and is later proven to have been committed with the&nbsp;consent, connivance or neglect of a director, manager, secretary or similar officer of that body corporate, that officer of the company will be guilty of an offence.&nbsp; I would like to know whether this means that, firstly, the protection offered by the corporate veil has been lifted in respect of these offences committed under the law; and, secondly, whether the authority now has certain police powers and may bring proceedings against individuals as well as companies.&nbsp; And, if this is the case, to what extent are the officers of the authority allowed to exercise their authority, and exactly how does this fit in with the existing policing activities such as the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau?&nbsp; Does this mean that two separate police regimes will exist with regard to companies and their officers?&nbsp; And will offenders be liable to be&nbsp;charged under two separate bodies?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would further like to ask the Minister what it means for the authority to be able to conduct its own proceedings as stated in clause 33 of the Bill.&nbsp; Does this mean that the authority may hold its own court and convict an individual or company for offences committed under the Bill which the authority is meant to administer?&nbsp; And if the authority is allowed to conduct its own court proceedings, would this not be taking away some of the authority of our judicial courts and the Attorney-General?&nbsp; At any rate, it would be good to understand the position of the authority and where it fits in with that of our judicial courts and the Attorney-General, <p align=left>Column: 356<p>and whether the Bill might take away, perhaps inadvertently, some of the inherent authority of these two legal bodies.&nbsp; If there are two separate regimes of enforcement, will offenders likely to be charged two times and receive two penalties?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last issue I would like to raise is related to the fact that under the new Bill, the authority is allowed to form companies and enter into stakeholdings with existing companies.&nbsp; Given the fact that the authority is supposed to administer and police the Companies Act and related Acts, I would like to ask what is the rationale behind allowing the authority to enter into such transactions.&nbsp; How will the authority police companies in which it has an interest?&nbsp; Natural justice dictates that no appearance of bias should be present and therefore to allow the authority to enter into such transactions and police such companies itself may seem to be a case of conflict of interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, save for the further clarifications and understanding I have sought from the Minister, I would support the efficiency that is brought about by the creation of ACRA.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, first, I would like to thank the Members for their support and for raising the concerns and clarifications.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me assure the House that the setting up of ACRA will not in itself lead to the imposition of more regulations or greater enforcement actions on companies and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is&nbsp;not our intention.&nbsp; Our intention of combining the two entities really is because we see complementarity in the way they execute their functions and therefore it makes greater sense to put the two entities together.&nbsp; Putting the two entities together will enable us to create a statutory board of about 100 people, which gives us a decent size to attract <p align=left>Column: 357<p>talent, provide better career development and have a repository of expertise to follow international developments, keep up with best practices and so maintain the right regulatory environment for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Dr Gan that all&nbsp;the concerns that she has about greater policing powers and offences, prosecution of offenders and ACRA conducting its own court proceedings&nbsp;are unfounded.&nbsp; The whole idea of merging these two is to get the efficiency and to make sure that we are able to keep up with international practices more speedily, like what Mr Andy Gan suggested.&nbsp; So, putting the two entities will not create more onerous responsibilities on the companies or businesses.&nbsp; What we want is a single entity, as Mr Andy Gan alluded to, that allows companies to refer to, interact with, for interpretation of the Companies Act, for we will have a single entity to champion the changes that we need to keep up with the developments around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where would the complementarity or&nbsp;synergies be derived?&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, if we have two separate groups, we in fact have two very small entities - the Registry of Companies and Businesses and the Public Accountants Board.&nbsp; In fact, they need people from the small&nbsp; background - accountants, lawyers, professionals - and putting them together gives us a better structure to manage the career development and&nbsp;the professional training and upgrading of their staff.&nbsp; We also need a mechanism by which the single entity can interact with the private sector through committees,&nbsp;councils&nbsp;and&nbsp;public consultations, so that the private and public sector work closely together in dealing with the new and changing global environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Andy Gan pointed out, there is greater competition, and for Singapore to succeed as a hub for global<p align=left>Column: 358<p> businesses, if we are able to establish clear rules, a very conducive pro-business environment, good practices, good corporate governance, I think that will add to our competitive advantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that is the whole idea of ACRA.&nbsp;&nbsp;ACRA will work with the private sector and make sure that we strike this balance of having the right regulatory rules in place, proper observance and compliance of these rules, and at the same time not making it too onerous</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This includes the registration of public accountants, accounting corporations and accounting firms, as well as the regulation of the auditing practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill sets up a Board committee, to be called the Public Accountants Oversight Committee, or PAOC for short. The Committee will comprise representatives from the public and private sectors, including at least one public accountant. The PAOC will assist and advise the main ACRA Board on matters pertaining to the regulation of public accountants. The main ACRA Board will focus on strategic and policy-related issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Regulatory framework for public accountants, accounting corporations</I> <I>and accounting firms</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts III to VII of the Bill strengthen the regulatory framework for the audit profession in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accounting firms</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, this Bill sets up a Register of Public Accounting Firms, in line with the regulatory framework already in place for individual public accountants and accounting corporations. It allows ACRA to take disciplinary action against errant accounting firms. This is consistent with the practices in leading jurisdictions, such as the US and UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new Accountants Act will require only two-thirds, rather than all, of the partners of an accounting firm to be public accountants. This allows firms that engage in tax or corporate secretarial work, in addition to audit work, to register as accounting firms. As long as two-thirds of the partners in their firms are already registered as public accountants, partners<p align=left>Column: 360<p> who do not perform audit work no longer need to register as public accountants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, this Bill deregulates the \"Certified Public Accountant\", or \"CPA\" title. All accountants, including public accountants, will be free to use titles indicating membership of professional organisations or accountancy degrees. As a safeguard against fraudulent representation, the Accountants Act will prohibit a person, body corporate or firm who is not registered by ACRA from practising as, or holding out to be, a public accountant, accounting corporation, or accounting firm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Registration criteria for public accountants</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registration criteria for public accountants will continue to include qualifications, practical experience and membership in a professional association. With regard to membership in a professional association, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore, or ICPAS, will be the only professional association recognised for this purpose, at least for the time being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICPAS will transit from a statutory body to a non-statutory society for the accounting profession in Singapore. This is consistent with the practices in other leading jurisdictions such as the UK, the US and Australia, and will be similar to the approach that we have adopted for other professionals, including the architects, doctors and engineers. The Bill transfers ICPAS's assets, liabilities, employees and members to its successor entity. To further facilitate the transition, the current ICPAS Council will serve as the interim governing committee of the successor entity until new elections are held.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Practice monitoring programme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill formalises the Practice Monitoring Programme, or PMP.<p align=left>Column: 361<p> This is a key provision in strengthening the regulatory framework for public accountants. Through the PMP, the PAOC will monitor the professional standards and practice of public accountants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 provides for the establishment of a Practice Monitoring Sub-committee to assist the PAOC in designing and implementing the PMP. PAOC will have the powers to take action against public accountants who fail PMP reviews, including the recommendation of remedial steps to improve professional practice, restriction of practice, suspension and de-registration. The Bill also provides public accountants an avenue of appeal to the High Court against decisions of the PAOC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Two-tier disciplinary process</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the two-tier disciplinary process.&nbsp; Part VI of the Bill sets up a two-tier disciplinary process comprising the Complaints Committee and the Disciplinary Committee to process complaints against public accountants. The improved disciplinary process is modelled after the legal and medical professions in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All complaints will first be evaluated to determine if a prima facie case has been established for the setting up of a Complaints Committee. The Complaints Committee will review the case to determine whether the case is to be dismissed or whether it necessitates a letter of advice or warning to the errant public accountant, accounting corporation or accounting firm. If the case requires further investigation, the Complaints Committee will recommend to the PAOC to constitute a Disciplinary Committee to hold a formal inquiry. The Disciplinary Committee will recommend to the PAOC the appropriate disciplinary action, including de-registration, suspension,<p align=left>Column: 362<p> restriction of practice, imposition of penalty and censure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Penalties on professional misconduct</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill increases the maximum penalty that may be imposed on an errant public accountant, from $5,000 to $10,000. In addition, the Bill sets at $100,000 the maximum penalty that may be imposed on an errant accounting firm. The higher penalties are necessary to serve as a deterrent against professional misconduct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, I would like to thank the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore for giving valuable feedback in the drafting of the Accountants Bill. ACRA will continue to work with all its stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition and to uphold a forward looking regulatory framework for the auditing profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</B> Mr&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Accountants Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill seeks to further refine the Accountants Act (Chapter 2) and include in it more powers to control the practice and standards of the accounting profession.&nbsp; I support this move as it seeks to establish the image and standing of the accounting profession among other established countries.&nbsp; Although this Bill seeks to protect the investing public rather than setting the standards for excellence for accountants, it should positively spur the profession into setting its own standards for the investing public to rely on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the accountant's job&nbsp;has been misunderstood often, and it is important <p align=left>Column: 363<p>that it be put in the right perspective.&nbsp; The accountant's job is not merely to apply the facts against preset standards and make&nbsp;a judgement, but to exercise his personal judgement and expertise to determine whether the information provided is \"true and fair\".&nbsp; Indeed, the accounting profession in the United Kingdom survived for over a century on&nbsp;the personal ethics of its members.&nbsp; Accountants in UK, other established economies and in Singapore were held in high esteem by the public then, and I hope it still is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, while much of this independent professionalism remains,&nbsp;times are changing.&nbsp; Political power has now influenced accounting standards, as have capital markets and international efforts for harmonisation.&nbsp; This has been brought about in a great part by the collapse of companies in&nbsp;UK, USA and Australia, owing to the lack of judgement from well-known accounting firms.&nbsp; Hence, the introduction of this Bill should in some way restore the public's confidence in the accounting profession which has been eroded by high profile failures of public companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One marked change of this Bill will be the new Public Accountants Oversight Committee, as stated under&nbsp;clause 4.&nbsp; It shall in addition have its functions and duties conducted by members who may not be accountants, thus removing any possible conflicts of interest and lack of independence in setting standards and enforcement.&nbsp; This will further enhance the accountants' integrity and trustworthiness in the performance of&nbsp; their duties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Part VI of this Bill also provides for errant accountants to be disciplined and for complaints to be reviewed by a Disciplinary Panel.&nbsp; While this provides&nbsp;comfort to the investing public, it will also act as a deterrent for those accountants who may be tempted to sway from the straight and narrow <p align=left>Column: 364<p>path.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I hope that the Oversight Committee will have the wisdom to distinguish professional negligence of accountants as opposed to corporate management negligence when fingers start pointing as a consequence of corporate failures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate failures, such as when a period of economic difficulty follows a bull market, when managements make unwise assumptions about the future prospects of the business, poor management of company finances which may lead to financial collapse and the temptation to hide or distort reports of poor financial performance, are natural consequences of the market system.&nbsp; Furthermore, in these fast moving times when businesses react to changes in the market with light speed as compared to the days before the introduction of the Internet,&nbsp;no degree of regulation will overcome the certainties that corporate failure is inevitable and public accountants will inevitably be blamed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, what we are facing in Singapore is that our corporations are going global.&nbsp; In such an increasing international scenario, regulation within Singapore, or for that matter any individual country, cannot reduce the risks attendant on the need for public accountants to rely upon auditors in other less regulated environments.&nbsp; In this aspect, the Accountants Act may expose the Singapore accountants to greater professional liabilities than accountants practising in other less regulated regimes.&nbsp; This may thus create a high risk&nbsp;environment which may stunt the growth of a healthy professional body of accountants.&nbsp; If this does happen, the high risks associated with being a&nbsp;public accountant versus not being one will see a lack of supply of accountants following economic growth in a country.&nbsp; This will not bode well for Singapore as it pursues<p align=left>Column: 365<p> to build local talents in&nbsp;accountancy to supplement the Big Four international accountancy firms that are the market leaders at the moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Sarbanes-Oxley&nbsp;Act of 2002, the&nbsp;Public Accounting Oversight Board is considering registering all foreign accounting firms that perform audit for US companies outside the US.&nbsp; This means that these foreign accountancy firms have to make sure that they meet the standards set by the US regulators before they can provide accountancy services to US-registered corporations.&nbsp; Perhaps, the Public Accountants Oversight&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;under the Accountants Bill in Singapore can also come&nbsp;up with a scheme to ensure that our listed corporations with subsidiaries in other countries are also audited by overseas public accounting firms with similar standards set.&nbsp; As more listed companies, both local and foreign, spread their operations outside Singapore shores and these business operations need to be consolidated with the accounts of the parent companies in Singapore, I would be grateful if the Minister will respond to this treatment of non-Singapore auditors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public accounting firms often offer a range of tax services.&nbsp; With this Bill, many public accounting&nbsp;firms are concerned that some other services they offer may fall outside the definition of this Bill.&nbsp; If non-accounting firms are allowed to offer traditional services, such as corporate secretarial, book-keeping and tax services, and such companies&nbsp;need not comply with the regulated demands of this Bill, it may lower the standards of the accounting profession, which has to be kept high for continuing public confidence&nbsp;in Singapore companies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Government is trying to help our local small and medium-sized corporations grow in size to provide a <p align=left>Column: 366<p>strong base for enterprise in Singapore, and also to be strong enough to venture abroad, assistance must also be made to help our local public accounting firms grow in size in order to provide audit and other public accounting services to our growing SMEs.&nbsp; At the moment, most of our local businesses will switch to larger international public accounting firms before seeking listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.&nbsp; It is perceived that this will provide credibility in the eyes of the authorities and hasten the approval process for a listing to take place.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Perhaps some Government-related companies can lead the way by casting their net wider and engaging the services of local public accountants, instead of just relying on the Big Four.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have also raised concerns about the costs of compliance with new rules for smaller firms.&nbsp; While it is important that the Accountants Bill leaves&nbsp;little gaps in governing our financial reporting system, it is also important&nbsp;for our regulators to conduct an appropriate cost-benefit analysis in&nbsp;crafting those regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add that this Bill, while recognising the importance of keeping the investor community, the issuer community, the accounting profession and the interested public informed of developments by the Public Accountants Oversight Committee when it carries out its duties, must establish a general practice of conducting its rule making in a public forum and seek public comment on proposed rules.&nbsp; Such a robust rule change process will instill further confidence in building a&nbsp;thriving business environment where accounting standards can be tested and followed by others.&nbsp; I<p align=left>Column: 367<p> look forward to our building a stronger and forward-looking community of accountants through this Bill.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</B> Mr&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the only public accountant in this House, and also as a council member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants (ICPAS), it is my duty to comment on these Bills.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to set the tone right, I would like to thank the Ministry of Finance for its close consultation with the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in drawing up the Bills which affect the accounting profession.&nbsp; As earlier said, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Bill will see the merger of the Public Accountants Board, which used to regulate public accountants, and the Registry of Companies and Businesses into one body, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, in addition, will also see the reconstitution of ICPAS into a society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me preface my comments by also recalling the role of auditors which has evolved since the early days of industrialisation.&nbsp; The primary role of auditors is to provide assurance to financial statements to stakeholders, ie, shareholders, creditors and the public at large.&nbsp; It also acts to serve as a check on management, so that they will continue to act in the best interest of all parties concerned.&nbsp; This reporting function of auditors is very crucial to the proper functioning of financial markets because it will help to ensure that reliable and relevant information is provided to stakeholders and fund providers to help them make informed decisions as to where to place their financial resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it all contributes to the effective and efficient functioning of financial markets because, without checks, management will have a free rein, and&nbsp;auditors come in to make sure that that does not happen.&nbsp; Management would want to present a<p align=left>Column: 368<p> much more robust and positive picture of the businesses they run, but stakeholders require an objective view.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the responsibility of providing this objective view rests on auditors and this helps to instill public trust in financial statements of companies.&nbsp; I would like to say that the Institute of Certified Public Accountants is committed to maintaining this public trust not only in the accounting process but also in the auditing process as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accounting profession is an important constituent and pillar of the business community and the capital markets,&nbsp;as Mr Andy Gan has pointed out, and it is therefore important that the Institute, which has some 16,000 members, is strongly supported by the business community and the Government.&nbsp; It should&nbsp;be regarded as an important beam in the economy to support capital markets.&nbsp; Therefore, the reconstitution of ICPAS as a society should not be perceived as diminishing the role, standing and pride of the Institute and the profession.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to thank the Ministry of Finance for its understanding and support.&nbsp; As&nbsp;quite rightly pointed out, very large corporate failures as well as investor losses have heightened the need to restructure the regulation of the accounting profession.&nbsp; I may not be entirely objective here, but I would say nonetheless that some of these losses and failures have sometimes been unfairly blamed on accountants, because it should be noted that there have also been great lapses in institutional structures and opportunism reflected in managerial conduct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said, the market, as it is today, and particularly in the US, is challenged by this multifaceted lack of trust in the corporate system, and&nbsp;corporate reputation, which has taken a long time to build, has been diminished and needs rebuilding.&nbsp; It will take some <p align=left>Column: 369<p>time - as we often say, it will get worse before it gets better - but there are global efforts amongst those who see an urgent need to gear up on damage control.&nbsp; Of course, the US, where all these took place, is at the forefront of reforms and initiatives, and a significant outcome, as mentioned by the Minister as well as Mr Andy Gan, is this Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which introduces sweeping legislation targeted at the core issues of accounting, auditing and corporate reforms.&nbsp; Elsewhere, as has been mentioned, in the UK, Canada, Australia, the European Union, they are all actively engaged in all these reforms.&nbsp; So, our changes are indeed in line with&nbsp;international capital market initiatives.&nbsp; And I would say that, because Singapore aspires in this globalised world to further enhance its standing&nbsp;as a financial centre by taking a leading role in raising standards and so on, it will surely bode well for Singapore as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1999, the Ministry of Finance set up three committees to look into corporate governance practices, standards of disclosure, and&nbsp;the legal and regulatory framework.&nbsp; As a result, we have the Corporate Governance Code in 2002, the establishment of the Corporate Disclosure and Governance Council in 2002, there have been revisions and further ongoing revisions to the Companies Act and also to the regulatory framework not only to accord with, as we say,&nbsp;best practices in terms of governance, but also to promote a much more competitive economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accountants Bill further introduces the Practice Monitoring Programme and sets out consequences for accountants who fail the practice reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is common knowledge that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US is a reaction to the situation there.&nbsp; Many consider this Act to be an over-reaction.&nbsp; So, the point to be made here is that, in<p align=left>Column: 370<p> formulating regulations, it is always good to have good necessary regulation and not over-regulation because, by taking on very strict rules, the flip side is that there is always a cost to it and it can also retard entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I suppose we can take comfort that these failures and losses are a distance away, and we can comfortably take and read the signal signs and implement preventive measures, which we are doing.&nbsp; As Singapore aligns itself with the major and more developed&nbsp;markets, it should be noted that this heightened scrutiny, an environment of stricter controls, will become global facts of life for accountants in Singapore.&nbsp; Already, much has been introduced, eg, audit exemption for dormant companies;&nbsp;for companies with turnovers below a prescribed amount, there is now no longer a requirement for qualified secretaries;&nbsp;accountants now have to go through the Practice Monitoring Programme, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we understand and acknowledge the spirit and intentions which underlie these reforms, it should be noted that it is a fact that these reforms do impact on the accounting profession and&nbsp;will affect the smaller companies&nbsp;in particular.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globalisation will bring about increasing dominance in terms of self-interest in the conduct of corporate events.&nbsp; We acknowledge that change is needed and provisions will have to be made for a much more far-sighted accounting profession to adapt to these changes.&nbsp; Here again, ICPAS, as demonstrated in the restructuring process, is very willing to work with the Government and other constituents of the capital markets to ensure that the profession continues to gain the confidence of the various parties concerned.&nbsp; Having said that, it should again be noted that the accounting profession was imposed on the corporate system in order to promote trust and order.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 371<p>accounting profession has evolved and has been transformed over many years.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;the Institute will have to redefine itself but it can always continue to actively act&nbsp;as an agent of societal regulation and&nbsp;continue to contribute in many ways.&nbsp; As a vehicle of communication between the Government and its members - as I have said, ICPAS is a professional body with 16,000 members - a united voice would be preferred in negotiation and compromise.&nbsp; It can continue to render its expertise to various wings of Government,&nbsp;get actively involved in the establishment of accounting and auditing standards, and&nbsp;ensure competency, professionalism and ethical standards, especially in a world of changing values and ideals.&nbsp; It can do all these and more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that the financial market will benefit from all these improved arrangements.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Institute has to work with constituents of the market to ensure confidence and trust in the corporate system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Everybody must play his part if we want to make the market efficient and we want to maintain the<p align=left>Column: 372<p> trust of the investing public.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes that we are making in the Accountants Bill is to reinforce this trust in them.&nbsp; The changes in making ICPAS from a statutory body to a professional association should not be seen in any way as a diminution of their&nbsp;standing or role.&nbsp; ICPAS will continue to play a very important role, working with the Government, with the regulatory agencies as well as with the private sector, to develop the accounting profession in Singapore and to continuously upgrade the profession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will recognise ICPAS as the only professional association in the Accountants Act and the Government will continue to work closely with ICPAS in areas such as auditing, mutual recognition agreements with regulators of public accountants in other jurisdictions and in other initiatives to enhance the professionalism of public accountants in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree entirely with Mrs Fang Ai Lian that there is tremendous advantage in having only one professional association representing the accountants in Singapore.&nbsp; A body with 16,000 members&nbsp;is a very effective body.&nbsp; Our experience so far has been very good in working with ICPAS to review and upgrade standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mrs Fang and Mr Andy Gan raised the issue of the problems of the small and medium accounting firms in having to adjust to these changes.&nbsp; I think this is unavoidable.&nbsp; The global market is changing and&nbsp;standards are being reviewed.&nbsp; On the one hand, we are relaxing some of these statutory requirements so as to lower business cost because we do not see the necessity for making private&nbsp;exempt companies to&nbsp;put up statutory reports.&nbsp; But I would like to assure the small and medium accounting firms that this does not mean that there is no need for such reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many<p align=left>Column: 373<p> companies, whether it is private exempt or other small companies, if they are in the market for loans or for other requirements, as Mrs Fang explained just now, investors and other parties would like to have auditors to provide a view of the company to give a fair, impartial and objective assessment of the company.&nbsp; So the role of the auditors and accountants has not diminished even if the Government removes the need for this statutory report.&nbsp; I think the market will continue to require such reports even if the Government removes the statutory requirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we do recognise that there will be changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our small and medium accounting firms will have to adapt, just like the small and medium companies have done so in other jurisdictions where such statutory reports are not required as well.&nbsp; For this, the small and medium accounting firms will have to look into increasing their revenue from other practices, both domestically and overseas. This may require consolidation and expansion into other jurisdictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan asked whether a stricter Accountants Act in Singapore will expose Singapore accountants when they practise in other countries or where they consolidate reports with the subsidiaries from other countries.&nbsp; Let me take this opportunity to explain that this is not something new.&nbsp; When the parent company in Singapore has to consolidate its reports with the accounts of the subsidiaries overseas, the audit firm in Singapore will have to make an assessment of the validity and&nbsp;objectivity of the accounts of the subsidiaries.&nbsp; Of course, it depends on where these subsidiaries are located, and on the reliability of the audit companies of these subsidiaries in the other jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something new.&nbsp; What the Act offers is better clarity.&nbsp; I do not think it&nbsp;in<p align=left>Column: 374<p> any way exposes Singapore accountants to greater risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan also highlighted that we should be mindful of regulatory cost.&nbsp; We will definitely do so. The whole idea of making sure we strike the right balance between regulatory requirements and making sure we are competitive will require us to keep a very close watch on the regulatory cost on companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan&nbsp;would also like to know how the Public Accountants Oversight Committee (PAOC) would go about its work.&nbsp; I would like to assure him that the PAOC, which includes non-accountants, ie,&nbsp;other professions in the corporate world, will make sure that when we make changes to the rules,&nbsp;we seek the views of all the participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The public consultation process that we have put in place when we reviewed these rules in the past 4-5 years, would be the standard practice when we go forward and when we make changes to rules in future.&nbsp; I would like to assure Members that the interest of all participants in the financial and capital markets will be taken into account and they will be asked to help when we review such rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very mindful that when we make these changes&nbsp;we do not over-react.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a range of things that we can do. We want to improve the regulatory regime but, at the same time, we are mindful that we should not over-react and, in so doing, cause higher regulatory cost on our people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments in mind, I hope that the Members will be reassured that the changes are necessary to make sure that accountants and, in particular, public accountants, continue to be a major pillar of our markets and our businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 375<p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - &nbsp;[Mr Lim Hng Kiang&nbsp;].</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 375<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in May 2003, the Companies Act was amended to implement 20 recommendations of the private sector-led Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee, or the CLRFC. This Bill proposes further amendments to the Companies Act, taking into account other recommendations of the CLRFC and public feedback on the draft Bill. The changes will simplify and update provisions in the Companies Act to create a more robust regulatory environment for our companies and businesses.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the public feedback received, the Ministry of Finance will defer the implementation of some of the recommendations of the CLRFC such as the removal of par value and share buybacks out of capital and take more time to consult the business community on the operational details of their implementation.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments proposed in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Abolition of ultra vires</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Companies Act contains an 'ultra vires' doctrine and requires the proposed objects of a company to be stated exhaustively in its Memorandum. If the company performs an act that is not authorised by the object clauses, it will be considered 'ultra vires'.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 376<p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill amend sections 22 and 23 respectively to abolish this requirement. Given that a company is already considered in law to be a legal person, it will be statutorily conferred all the powers of a natural person and will have full capacity to carry out any lawful business or activity. The amendment will also allow companies the choice to limit its capacity, rights or powers in its memorandum or articles of association to preserve the rights of internal redress by members against the directors. The amendment is in line with the current practices in New Zealand and the UK.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p><I>One shareholder, one director companies</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, all companies are required to have at least two shareholders and two directors, with the requirement that at least one director must be locally resident.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill amends the Companies Act to allow all companies, regardless whether they are public or private companies, to have one director and one shareholder. To preserve the accountability of such companies, we will retain the local residency requirement for at least one director.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be two additional safeguards. First, while the same person can be both the director as well as the shareholder, he cannot act as the company secretary. This ensures that there will always be an independent company officer. Second, the shareholders will be personally liable for the debts and obligations incurred by the company if it is left without a director for more than six months. One director, one shareholder companies are already permitted in New Zealand.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the UK government is also considering implementing such a regime.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Company auditors</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a person intending to be an approved company auditor goes through<p align=left>Column: 377<p> two separate approval processes. First, he registers himself as a public accountant with the Public Accountants Board pursuant to the Accountants Act. Second, he applies to the Minister for Finance to be an approved company auditor under the Companies Act.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill streamlines the procedure and removes the statutory requirement for public accountants to have to seek approval from the Minister. Instead, any person who satisfies the registration requirements to be a public accountant under the Accountants Act will automatically be an approved company auditor.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Capital raising by private companies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a private company is prohibited from raising capital by inviting members of the public to subscribe to its shares or debentures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill removes the prohibition and allows private companies to raise capital through public offerings without converting to public companies, so long as they fulfil the disclosure requirements under the Securities and Futures Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Inclusion of registration numbers</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2002, one of the amendments was to dispense with prior screening of similar company names. As a result, the distinctive registration number of a Singapore-incorporated company, rather than its name, has become a more unique identifier for companies.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 28 of the Bill amends the Companies Act to require a company to show its registration number on all business letters, statements of account, invoices, official notices and publications issued by the company. Taking into account feedback from businesses, the<p align=left>Column: 378<p> Government will grant companies a grace period of six months after the amendment comes into force for companies to use up their existing stock of stationery and to modify their internal systems to comply with the new regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Penalty provisions</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Companies Act imposes a penalty for directors who fail to comply with the prescribed financial reporting standards and to ensure that the financial statements present a true and fair view. &nbsp;It also imposes a penalty on any person who makes or authorises the making of false or misleading statements with respect to the information required under the Act.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill revises the penalty amounts, with the possibility of a jail sentence for fraudulent behaviour.&nbsp; The increased penalties will serve as more effective deterrence.&nbsp; It will give the Courts greater discretion to impose penalties that are more closely proportionate to the possible gains that could be reaped from such non-compliance.&nbsp; The changes are comparable to the existing penalties for similar offences in the Securities and Futures Act.&nbsp; They instil confidence among investors that companies incorporated in Singapore present true and fair financial statements, in accordance with the prescribed accounting standards.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will continue to review the recommendations of the CLRFC. &nbsp;The Government will press on with company law reform to make our corporate environment conducive for companies and entrepreneurship to thrive.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> Sir, the present amendment Bill before this House is part of a series of amendments to the<p align=left>Column: 379<p> Companies Act that the Government has put in place to implement the changes proposed by the CLRFC to make our business environment more cost competitive and efficient.&nbsp; These changes are timely and, in some cases, long overdue.&nbsp; I was in the Committee that mooted these changes and, quite naturally, I fully support the amendments that are now contained in the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even though I generally support the Bill, I do have a number of observations that I wish to place before this House.&nbsp; First, clause 3 amends the present section 9 of the Act by widening the category of persons who are allowed to act as liquidators.&nbsp; Previously, only auditors are qualified to act.&nbsp; However, it would seem that the job of a liquidator may be carried out by other professionals or&nbsp;whoever through experience or training.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe&nbsp;they are equally qualified to rise to the undertaking; hence, the widening of the categories of those who may act as liquidators.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the widening of the categories of people who may qualify to act as liquidators will result in giving the public a wider range to choose from and, hopefully, lower fees in the process, what the amendment Bill has not addressed&nbsp; really are the professional standards and training of liquidators.&nbsp; Up until now, liquidators in Singapore are not qualified by virtue of any specific and dedicated course of study either in a professional or tertiary institute.&nbsp; The principal reason why auditors have traditionally been asked to act as liquidators may perhaps have to do with their familiarity with accounts and finance.&nbsp; Yet, Sir, we all know that liquidating a company involves skill sets that are more than just an ability to handle accounts.&nbsp; They are expected to act as managers, counsellors, lawyers and astute negotiators.&nbsp; These are qualities that their primary training may not prepare them for, and something that they have to pick up along the way.&nbsp; More than just <p align=left>Column: 380<p>skills, liquidators are also required to exercise judgment that only experience can give.&nbsp; They are also required to balance generally the different interest groups in a liquidation from creditors, employees and shareholders.&nbsp; Above all, liquidators are expected to exercise ethical consideration in their judgment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, unfortunately, there is nothing that exists today that can properly be said to formally prepare a person for a career as a professional liquidator.&nbsp; Yet, the role of a liquidator in a winding up situation is no less important than that of an accountant or solicitor.&nbsp; A liquidator's job requires a high level of professionalism and training.&nbsp; In the CLRFC report, there is specific mention of setting up a body similar to the Law Society or Institute of Certified Public Accountants to set the standards, training and regulation of liquidators and insolvency practitioners.&nbsp; Our Government has indicated that it has accepted the recommendation and I am pleased to note that this is not one of those recommendations that Government has put a reservation on.&nbsp; I hope that it will, sooner than later, be the case when such a body is set up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, clause 6 gives effect to&nbsp;recommendation 1.5 of the CLRFC report which argues for more liberal policy of allowing private limited companies to raise money from members of the public.&nbsp; Presently, private limited companies are not allowed to raise money from the public.&nbsp; This has often been a severe limitation on private limited companies that seek additional working capital or funds for expansion.&nbsp; Often, where companies are in a position to raise money from the public, the cost involved together with the demands of regulatory compliance often serve to act as a deterrent.&nbsp; Allowing private companies an easier route to raise money may actually help to lower the cost of business for smaller companies.&nbsp; While we want to make it easier for small companies to raise <p align=left>Column: 381<p>money, one must recognise and accept that there are costs involved.&nbsp; Presumably, standards governing such invitations to&nbsp;investors to put money with these companies will not be as rigorous as the IPOs of public companies.&nbsp; Otherwise, the cost may just be too prohibitive for the company to even consider trying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, if the standards of disclosure expected of such companies are not going to be as rigorous as that of a conventional IPO, how can we be sure that the public interest will be adequately protected from shenanigans and scams?&nbsp; In the case of&nbsp;publicly listed companies, there is always the presence of the Singapore Stock Exchange to act as a watchdog for the public interest.&nbsp; But for non-listed companies, we should continue to ensure that our legal regime will not make it easier for foreign crooks to try their luck here.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is a risk that some unwary and non-financially sophisticated uncles and aunties here may be scammed of their hard-earned money and life-long savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the proposed amendment in clause 31 seeks to introduce a new section 157C which allows directors to place reliance on information provided by management and professional advisers.&nbsp; The amendment seeks to clarify the extent of a director's duty when it comes to acting on information and advice of others.&nbsp; However, there is a caveat.&nbsp; Directors must act in good faith, make proper inquiries and have no knowledge that this reliance is unwarranted.&nbsp; Sir, while the policy intention of the clarification is good, it still does not remove the anxiety on the part of directors that they&nbsp;may still get it wrong.&nbsp; As I see it, the present amendment merely codifies what I believe is the common law position of the duty of care of a director.&nbsp; It does not provide any further guidance on what exactly is the proper scope of<p align=left>Column: 382<p> inquiry on the part of the director.&nbsp; Conduct based on words like \"proper\" or \"reasonable care\" are always, in a legal sense, determined <I>ex post facto.&nbsp;</I> In other words, anxiety continues to remain on the part of a director and I would say that the proposed changes&nbsp;have not exactly given directors much relief by way of clarification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the above comments, I should add that the Government should be commended for its laudable efforts in seeking to make bold changes to&nbsp;our companies legislation to bring our laws in line with international standards and to make Singapore more competitive internationally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Gan See Khem--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Gan See Khem:</B> Mr&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, Sir, I welcome the amendment in the Companies (Amendment) Bill that allows one&nbsp;person to set up, be the sole director and sole member of a company and also allows private companies to raise funds through public offers.&nbsp; This change is much needed in the drive for entrepreneurship and flexibility in the private sector.&nbsp; The abolishment of an unnecessary requirement is an encouraging move for the development of a vibrant marketplace.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provision for an easier facilitation of company resolutions and instructions is also provided for under the proposed amendment.&nbsp; This encourages more risk taking, as individuals who set up companies are protected by the corporate veil identity.&nbsp; This, in turn, should help encourage greater daring and entrepreneurialship coupled with a greater ability to react in a timely manner in times of crisis and change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the new amendment helps to prevent too much abuse of the new amendments of one-director companies.&nbsp; As a sole director, he <p align=left>Column: 383<p>is not allowed to resign from his position.&nbsp; On the other hand, the amendments still do nothing to alleviate the danger of fraud being perpetrated by individuals who might use the corporate identity as a shield to guard against personal liability.&nbsp; In addition, because of the relaxation of the bankruptcy rules, it is now easier for an individual to default on his contractual obligations once he petitions for bankruptcy.&nbsp; However, by passing these amendments, greater risk taking and entrepreneurial behaviour will be encouraged.&nbsp; The old maxim of<I>&nbsp;caveat emptor</I>, or let buyers beware, should be applied at least as far as private companies are concerned.&nbsp; The Government cannot afford to safeguard every single individual who does business with Singapore companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In so far as public companies are concerned, the Government understands the need to further regulate and protect members of the public.&nbsp; However, it is a correct stand to allow private companies more freedom to develop themselves and form business relationships. Yet, accordingly, private individuals and companies who choose to do business with one-director private companies should recognise the dangers and safeguard themselves by conducting the necessary background checks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need to move with the times has also led to the introduction of a major amendment to the Companies Act concerning electronic communication.&nbsp; Companies in the United States are already in the forefront in the utilisation of electronic communication to provide further efficiency in the conduct of their business affairs.&nbsp; The Government has also invested heavily over the years to provide the IT infrastructure for Singapore to compete effectively in the international arena.&nbsp; Arguably, this is the correct time for the proposed amendments to the Act so as to allow Singapore companies to effectively move into the information age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 384<p> The new sections 387A and B allow notices of company meetings to be posted on company websites.&nbsp; Additionally,&nbsp;documents such as circulars, annual reports and announcements may similarly be posted on company websites.&nbsp; I would also note that&nbsp;notices of&nbsp;meetings or company accounts, balance sheets, reports and other documents may be published on a website as long as it is legible,&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>and only subject to agreement between the individual and the company.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I support the move to move into the information age with electronic communication, it took me quite a while to figure out the specific steps and procedures that are drafted in the Bill.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, for example, how he proposes that a company implements this agreement between the members and the company whenever the different purpose applies, and what constitutes \"legible\" in this context.&nbsp; Is it sufficient that a link be provided on the company's homepage directing the Internet users to the appropriate document?&nbsp; Or is it required of the company to paste the entire document on the homepage?&nbsp; It also seems rather strange that a person needs to be given notice of the notice of a meeting.&nbsp; How is this notification meant to take place and what is the rationale behind the need to give a notice of a notice?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our understanding is that over time, electronic communication is meant to give cost savings to companies so that they do not need to print hard copies of documents to be sent out to all members.&nbsp; In the American context, having documents in electronic form does result in substantial cost savings due to the large number of members the larger American companies have.&nbsp; However, in the Singapore context, the move to encourage electronic communication may lead to higher overall cost for listed small and medium-size enterprises as the cost<p align=left>Column: 385<p> to modernise their websites and&nbsp;to render their web documents with computer graphics may outweigh cost savings gained from having to print fewer hard copies.&nbsp; Furthermore, such electronic communication will disadvantage members who are not computer-savvy or have no ready access to the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to enquire on the nature of measures the Government seeks to undertake in order to address the technology disadvantaged, especially prevalent among the older Singaporeans, who may also be very avid investors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the advent of the information age, there is no doubt that the Singapore business community should move with the times and pursue aggressively the move towards electronic transmissions of their communication needs.&nbsp; Except for the need to hear some further clarification from the Minister with regard to the implementation strategy for electronic communication, I support the amendments to this section of the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise some concerns, however, with regard to the further amendment to the Companies Act with regard to the criminalisation of offences by all directors of companies, whether they are independent or executive directors.&nbsp; Under the amendment proposed, directors now have to ensure that the profit and loss accounts are accurate, the profit and loss accounts are laid out at every AGM, the consolidated accounts are laid out at the AGM of a holding company, and the balance sheet and the profit and loss accounts at the AGM must be signed by two directors declaring that the figures are accurate and reflect a true and fair value of the state of affairs of the company.&nbsp; This introduction of additional penalties and tightening of existing regulations in the Companies Act serves<p align=left>Column: 386<p> only to make the duties of directors of listed companies even more onerous, I believe, without having real effect of assuring&nbsp;the reliability and accuracy of data relating to the profit and loss of the company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even the most conscientious director will only know what he or she is told.&nbsp; We have to remember that the boards do not produce the numbers.&nbsp; They got the numbers from someone else.&nbsp; Also, we need to be mindful that no rules or oversight can keep numbers straight if the company has a culture of bending them.&nbsp; Hence, further penalties for board members may make an existing situation where companies are hard pressed to identify and persuade qualified people to assume directorships even more difficult.&nbsp; We need to be mindful that a prescriptive approach to corporate governance also risks encouraging firms to focus on avoiding penalties rather than pursuing good corporate governance.&nbsp; We need to be conscientiously aware that we do not exemplify the form over substance efforts to supercharge the directors with responsibilities that may deter the best amongst us to serve as directors, and hence denying our companies the oppportunity to attract and retain the best talent to serve as members of our boards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rules and regulations may help shore up confidence in the market, but they will not magically produce good behaviour.&nbsp; At the end of the day, we must note that we cannot legislate goodness.&nbsp; The problem is you cannot always see it either.&nbsp; However, I note that the criminalisation of such offences goes in line with new disclosure policies that have been set up in place and are directed at preventing fraud and concealment of company's affairs as well as to seek accountability of directors who have misbehaved.&nbsp; In the wake of the Enron and the Asia Paper and Pulp incidents, these updates in the provisions of the Companies Act seem particularly urgent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 387<p> In light of further developing the culture of good corporate governance as well as promoting the climate for further enterprise, I would like to express and reiterate my support for the proposed amendments to these sections of the Companies Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Members for raising very pertinent issues of the Bill.&nbsp; Let me address them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the issue of liquidators.&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann raised several key points.&nbsp; We do agree that liquidators should not only come from public accountants.&nbsp; There is a range of skill sets required, and that is the rationale for this amendment, that hitherto we only restrict the appointment of liquidators to auditors, but now we have opened up the requirement.&nbsp; By opening up, we also must be mindful that we must set the relevant criteria and qualifications to be appointed as liquidators.&nbsp; As Mr Sin Boon Ann mentioned, there is no&nbsp;professional course to train or develop such a group of people and, therefore, we have to be very careful when we set out these criteria.&nbsp; What we will do is we will look at practices in other countries.&nbsp; For example, we will look at the UK Insolvency Practitioners Regulations where they set out such criteria and see whether these criteria and qualifications are relevant to us.&nbsp; It is going to be something similar to directors.&nbsp; There is no professional course to train&nbsp;directors.&nbsp; But we do know what directors do, and we do know the important roles that directors play.&nbsp; We do know that directors do come from a wide range of backgrounds and professional training and experience.&nbsp; And we do know what the qualifications and criteria of directors ought to be.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;we will go about it in this light.&nbsp; We are not planning to approach this in a legislative manner like the Law Society or ICPAS.&nbsp; We will look at this more like a professional association.&nbsp; MinLaw and MOF would<p align=left>Column: 388<p> study this issue and see how we can set up an Insolvency Practitioners Association, as recommended by the CLRFC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue that Mr Sin brought up is&nbsp;about raising of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with most of the issues in the Companies Act, we have to strike a balance.&nbsp; Previously, we did not allow private companies to raise funds from the public.&nbsp; This, of course, hinders the development of small private companies.&nbsp; Now we will allow them.&nbsp; But if they do so, then I think it is fair that they should comply with some requirements.&nbsp; We are looking into the details, but what we are looking at would be that they first ought to comply with the requirements under the Securities and Futures Act.&nbsp; But, of course, the requirements can be quite stringent and may not be pertinent to the full range of private companies wanting to raise funds.&nbsp; Therefore, we will carve up certain situations where the amounts to be raised are modest or the amounts to be raised are from sophisticated investors or from financial institutions, or the amounts to be raised are from a very small group of people and not from the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think within this wide ambit of the Securites and Futures Act, we will carve up certain sub-categories where the raising of the capital is more directed and therefore may not require such stringent disclosure requirements as with the IPO.&nbsp; These are works in progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point which Mr Sin raised is about the anxiety of directors.&nbsp; I would like to take this point together with what Dr Gan raised about the onerous duties of directors.&nbsp; Again, we have to strike a balance.&nbsp; Directors have&nbsp;a fiduciary duty.&nbsp; It is a heavy responsibility, but that is the reason why we have directors to be there to discharge this responsibility.&nbsp; On the other hand, directors may not have the full range of information that they need, and that is the reason why we try as much as possible to clarify the duties of the directors so as to make it more<p align=left>Column: 389<p> reasonable for them in discharging their duties.&nbsp; This proposed amendment, while not completely removing the anxiety of directors, does accord the directors some protection, ie,&nbsp;if they seek advice and this advice is&nbsp;prepared by and received from the management or from professional advisers and experts, then I think they can take this advice and they will not be responsible for this advice that they have received.&nbsp; But, at the same time, they must use their judgment, which is what we require directors to do, ie, they must ask for the right advice and they must scope the advice.&nbsp; So they cannot totally discharge themselves from these responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all said and done, directors' duties and liabilities are something that are constantly evolving, and we will have to continue to monitor case laws and international developments and study how all these provisions that we are planning to put in place can be refined in the future.&nbsp; This is something that we will have to get in touch with the private sector and make sure that the rules and regulations that we put in place are relevant.&nbsp; In that sense, I do not think we are putting onerous responsibilities on directors.&nbsp; I hope to assure Dr Gan that this is not our intention.&nbsp; We are trying to strike this balance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point which Dr Gan raised is the use of electronic communication.&nbsp; Again, here we have to strike the right balance - how to minimise cost through the effective use of IT and electronic communications, but at the same time ensure that the documents and the<p align=left>Column: 390<p> information are accurately and reliably conveyed to the investing public or to the members of the company.&nbsp; This is something that we have to be pragmatic about.&nbsp; We have to work out the regulations in detail.&nbsp; And the guideline here is that it must be something which the company can execute in agreement with either the investors or the people associated with the company.&nbsp; So we will draft out the general guidelines in the regulations, but the specific implementation of this electronic communication would have to be something that has to be agreed upon between the company and the people that the company is communicating with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that clarifies some of the issues raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee;

Traffic Police, the media and recovery teams are also alerted to any incidents.&nbsp; Early detection and quick reaction to accidents and breakdowns minimise congestion and danger to road users.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hence, to reduce costs, LTA decided to discontinue the routine display of travel time. &nbsp;This is estimated to save LTA about $2.4 million in communications costs.&nbsp; However, the signboards will continue to display traffic incident messages whenever there are traffic obstructions, accidents or other incidents along the expressways.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

When we replied to a parliamentary question on this in 1995, we said that there was no need to amend our laws to make it an offence.&nbsp; The situation has not changed significantly since then.&nbsp; We can study this matter once more.<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not just a matter of enacting a provision in our statutes to make it an offence for Singaporeans to have sex with minors overseas. &nbsp;Difficult legal issues arise in extending our jurisdiction overseas.&nbsp; Besides, there are also practical problems in enforcing such a law.&nbsp; Police will have to first detect such an act; it will then have to conduct investigations overseas and even bring witnesses back to Singapore to give evidence.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our preliminary study is that jurisdictions with such laws have found it difficult to enforce such a law.&nbsp; Successful prosecutions have been few and far between.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;
