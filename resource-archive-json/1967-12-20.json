There is a\r\n\r\nprovision of $60,000 for works and buildings for\r\n\r\nwhich $15,500 is asked to be revoted. There is\r\n\r\nanother revote for furniture and equipment. I\r\n\r\nwould like to point out the lack of facilities in\r\n\r\nmy two standard community centres - one is the\r\n\r\nPunggol Community Centre and the other at Punggol\r\n\r\nPoint. Regarding the Punggol Community Centre, I\r\n\r\nnotice that there is a piece of vacant land near\r\n\r\nthe centre to which facilities can be extended.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, at Pungol Point the centre has been\r\n\r\ntrying to obtain the necessary permission for the\r\n\r\nadjoining land to be utilised as an added\r\n\r\nfacility. Sir, I hope the Minister concerned will\r\n\r\nlook into this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the rural community centres.\r\n\r\nAgain the two items are revotes. I wish to talk on\r\n\r\nthe poor siting of some of the rural community\r\n\r\ncentres in my constituency. They are Kampong\r\n\r\nSungei Tengah Community centre, Jalan Serangoon\r\n\r\nKechil Community Centre and another is located at\r\n\r\n7\u00bd m.s. Upper Serangoon Road. In my opinion, these\r\n\r\ncentres are badly sited. No doubt the centres are\r\n\r\nthere, but very few people go there to make use of\r\n\r\nthe facilities. For example, in Jalan Serangoon\r\n\r\nKechil the centre is sited in a rubber estate,\r\n\r\nmuch to the inconvenience of the people in the\r\n\r\nkampong which is about a quarter of a mile away\r\n\r\nand where the population is about a couple of\r\n\r\nthousand people.

For the\r\n\r\ninformation of the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence, the construction of the\r\n\r\ncentres was carried out in 1961 and\r\n\r\nI was elected to this House in September 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I did not say that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol  was consulted.  I  said  the\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament of the constituency, if there\r\n\r\nwas a Member, or else the sites were decided after\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister had visited these areas and had\r\n\r\ncome  to  an  agreement with  the  elders  of  the\r\n\r\nvillages.  Therefore, having sited  these  centres\r\n\r\nand  having spent the money which was provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance, it  would  be  wasting\r\n\r\npublic  money to shift them. As my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has said, if they feel that a\r\n\r\ncertain  centre is badly sited, they can  move  it\r\n\r\nthemselves.  There are lots of things  which  they\r\n\r\ncan do themselves. For instance, the residents  of\r\n\r\nChangi  themselves built a community  centre,  and\r\n\r\nChangi is a rural area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take up another point brought up\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Punggol and that is the vacant\r\n\r\nland  adjoining  the community centre  at  Punggol\r\n\r\nPoint   which  can  be  used  to  provide   better\r\n\r\nfacilities for the community centre. I  would  say\r\n\r\nthe fault lies with him and his committee, because\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association have obtained permission\r\n\r\nfrom the owner of the land for its use, subject to\r\n\r\nthe  management committee of the community  centre\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  chain-link  fence.  They  have   done\r\n\r\nnothing  so  far and, therefore, they cannot  make\r\n\r\nuse of the facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has\r\n\r\nalso said that his community centre is badly sited\r\n\r\nbecause it is about a quarter of a mile away  from\r\n\r\nthe   nearest  concentration  of  population.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, you know that land in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nrather  limited, and if everyone wants to  have  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre right in front of his  doorstep,\r\n\r\nit  is  something that is impossible. If a man  is\r\n\r\nreally  imbued  with  civic consciousness  and  is\r\n\r\nwilling to serve the public and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nwants to enjoy some of the facilities provided  by\r\n\r\na  community centre, a distance of a quarter of  a\r\n\r\nmile to the community centre is nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that his community\r\n\r\ncentre  is too small for his constituency.  I  for\r\n\r\none  would  like  to see large  areas  being  made\r\n\r\navailable    for    community    centres.     But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, as the hon. Member knows, there  is\r\n\r\na   limitation  of  land  in  Anson  and  in  most\r\n\r\nconstituencies  in Singapore, and  land  is  quite\r\n\r\ncostly.   It  is  a  question  of  putting   every\r\n\r\navailable piece of land to the best economic use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with Mountbatten, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  present community centre there is sited about\r\n\r\na  quarter of a mile away from the place which the\r\n\r\nMember for Mountbatten thinks is a suitable  site.\r\n\r\nI  have  my  doubts, because if we were  to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney on building another community centre in  the\r\n\r\nplace  indicated by him, in a year or two he would\r\n\r\ncome  round  and say the same thing,  that  it  is\r\n\r\nbadly sited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all in all, I think these community centres\r\n\r\nare sited in the best available spots and they can\r\n\r\nserve  the  community there quite  well.  For  the\r\n\r\ninformation  of the Member for Kampong  Kembangan,\r\n\r\nwhat  the Prime Minister said was not, \"Where  you\r\n\r\nhave  200  or  300 people in an area, a  community\r\n\r\ncentre will be built.\" I would rather think it  is\r\n\r\nnearer  the truth if his statement was 300 or  400\r\n\r\nfamilies  living in an area. I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat, inasmuch as we would like to have dozens  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in a constituency, there  is  a\r\n\r\nlimitation of land and funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for MacPherson Estate, I have every sympathy\r\n\r\nwith the Member concerned and I will look into the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nof   Defence  has  said  that  the  Punggol  Point\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre is responsible for putting  up  a\r\n\r\nchain-link fence.

In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  small  monthly subsidies given  to  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  I  think the management committees  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  manage within the limited scope  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies                                 granted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point refers to the Staff Club House\r\n\r\nfor the People's Association.

They have to\r\n\r\nmanage everything well within their means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the Staff Club House for? The\r\n\r\nPeople's Association has a staff of about 1,200\r\n\r\nwho are responsible for the running of, I think,\r\n\r\n183 or 184 community centres. As the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol has pointed out, the staff are:\r\n\r\nspread all over the island and they have few\r\n\r\nopportunities of meeting one another socially or\r\n\r\nof discussing their work. All members of the staff\r\n\r\nare citizens of Singapore and I am sure the Member\r\n\r\nfor Punggol will not deny a section of our\r\n\r\ncitizens facilities for social intercourse and\r\n\r\nsporting netivities. That is one of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy we decided that there should be a Staff Club\r\n\r\nHouse for the, staff of the People's Association.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is to give them the facilities to\r\n\r\nmeet and talk about their problems. I think the\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol is aware that we just held a\r\n\r\nstaff seminar of the People's Association:\r\n\r\nto discuss ways and means ot improving their work\r\n\r\nin the community centres so that there can be an\r\n\r\ninterchange of views between the members of the\r\n\r\nstaff of the People's Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also asked me whether\r\n\r\nwe can afford a Staff Club House. Surely, if we\r\n\r\ncannot afford it, the Minister for Finance will\r\n\r\nnot have allowed it to be in the vote! The answer\r\n\r\nis 'Yes'. This is going to be a substantive Staff\r\n\r\nClub House situated next\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the headquarters of the People's Association\r\n\r\nand the rugger field in Mountbatten Road. The\r\n\r\nfirst priority for its use will be confined to\r\n\r\nmembers of the staff of the People's Association.\r\n\r\nBut we do not like to have any government\r\n\r\nfacilities lying idle and I have already proposed\r\n\r\nto them that they can also entertain applications\r\n\r\nat times - I think it will be quite often - from\r\n\r\nany organisations, bodies or groups of people who\r\n\r\nwant to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It is because I probably\r\n\r\nmight ask for a supplementary estimate next year,\r\n\r\nand that is why there is a token vote of $10. The\r\n\r\ntoken vote of $10 indicates that we either have a\r\n\r\nplan to carry on with the project in mind - in\r\n\r\nthis instance, it is the purchase of a launch for\r\n\r\nthe supervision of barter trade and also for\r\n\r\nenforcing immigration regulations at the Jurong\r\n\r\nwharf - or that the plans are not completely\r\n\r\nfinalised so that we have not made up our minds as\r\n\r\nto what sort of launches we need to have, or how\r\n\r\nmany launches there are, and the cost.

The service is designed to improve\r\n\r\nthe quality of teaching and to supplement ordinary\r\n\r\nclassroom work. The programmes for the first year\r\n\r\nwere directed to Secondary I and II students and,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Choa Chu Kang has pointed out,\r\n\r\nwere very well received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But towards the end of the year, it was felt\r\n\r\nthat the time was ripe for the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpansion of the educational television service to\r\n\r\ncover other classes in stages from Primary III to\r\n\r\npre-University level for 1968. So plans for\r\n\r\nexpansion were drawn up and submitted to the\r\n\r\nEconomic Planning Unit for consideration. The\r\n\r\nEconomic Planning Unit thought that the service\r\n\r\nshould consolidate itself before launching out\r\n\r\ninto new fields and advised deferment of the\r\n\r\nexpansion proposals. That is why the small sum was\r\n\r\nprovided for expenditure next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite financial restrictions,\r\n\r\nstaffing shortages and the comparatively brief\r\n\r\nexperience in this field, ETV has made remarkable\r\n\r\nheadway. This was confirmed by the winning of a\r\n\r\nspecial prize in a contest in Japan, which was\r\n\r\nopen to television establishments all over the\r\n\r\nworld, including the B.B.C. For the information of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Choa Chu Kang, since then the\r\n\r\nEconomic Planning Unit has been having second\r\n\r\nthoughts on the matter, and I understand that a\r\n\r\nreview of the proposals for limited expansion is\r\n\r\nbeing undertaken now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am glad to hear that the\r\n\r\nE.P.U, has reconsidered its decision and that\r\n\r\npossibly a further sum may be voted on.

Since the beginning of this\r\n\r\nyear, the Ministry has noted that secondary school\r\n\r\nhalls can be used for sporting activities, such as\r\n\r\nvolleyball and badminton. However, the halls in\r\n\r\ncertain secondary schools have glass windows.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the principals stop their staff and\r\n\r\nstudents from playing volleyball there. I want to\r\n\r\nknow whether the Minister has plans to change\r\n\r\nthese glass windows into some other type of\r\n\r\nwindows for the school halls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the revote for new\r\n\r\nprimary schools under subhead 101 is for the\r\n\r\nconstruction of three new primary schools. These\r\n\r\nare situated at Mattar Road, Toa Payoh and Delta.\r\n\r\nCircus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revote of $362,000 is meant to carry out\r\n\r\nmajor extensions to the Yio Chu Kang, Canberra and\r\n\r\nSembawang Hill Estate primary schools. Another sum\r\n\r\nof $294,000 is revoted for construction of primary\r\n\r\nschools to replace Rangoon Road and Pulau Bukom\r\n\r\nprimary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary school enrolment will reach its peak\r\n\r\nin 1968 and will register a gradual decline from\r\n\r\n1969. There is enough accommodation to cater for\r\n\r\nthe requirements of primary education in the next\r\n\r\ndecade and no new primary schools need to be built\r\n\r\nexcept to replace old schools or to serve\r\n\r\nresidents in new housing development areas.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the reduction in development\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the construction of primary\r\n\r\nschools necessarily follows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the secondary school building\r\n\r\nprogramme is concerned, eight new secondary\r\n\r\nschools will be functioning in January 1968. These\r\n\r\nnew schools together with the existing ones will\r\n\r\nprovide sufficient secondary places for the next\r\n\r\ntwo or three years. This will give us time to do\r\n\r\nsome hard thinking on our future policy on\r\n\r\neducation and to find answers to questions such as\r\n\r\n-are we doing enough to overcome the traditional\r\n\r\npreference for an academic type of education,\r\n\r\ndespite the better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for those with technical\r\n\r\nor vocational training? is there a case for\r\n\r\nincreasing the duration, scope and content of\r\n\r\nvocational education? Or should more places be\r\n\r\nprovided at pre-university level at the expense of\r\n\r\nsecondary level? To what extent can we afford to\r\n\r\nimprove the quality in education by reducing class\r\n\r\nsizes and increasing the teacher/pupil ratio or\r\n\r\nreverting to a full-day school?

Therefore, I would ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education whether there will be other\r\n\r\nvocational institutes, apart from those mentioned\r\n\r\nin the various subheads, to be built and, if so,\r\n\r\ntheir locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising the important part played by\r\n\r\nvocational training, will the Minister consider\r\n\r\nincreasing the period of vocational training which\r\n\r\nit now provides? In this light, I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat a four-year vocational training period be\r\n\r\nimplemented, i.e., to provide the necessary know-how in respect of skilled labour, or technical\r\n\r\nknow-how which is urgently required in our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation scheme and in the various trades\r\n\r\ntoo. I notice that the vocational institutes\r\n\r\nprovide a two-year course of training for primary\r\n\r\nschool-leavers, especially those who do not make\r\n\r\nthe grade for academic or technical secondary\r\n\r\ntraining. I think a two-year course is barely\r\n\r\nsufficient to enable a 14-year old child to be\r\n\r\nable to pick up the necessary skill or know-how. I\r\n\r\nthink if the four-year scheme were to be\r\n\r\nimplemented, it would not only tremendously\r\n\r\nbenefit the students looking fo: jobs in the\r\n\r\nlabour market, but also the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol is referring to vocational\r\n\r\nschools and not to the Vocational Institute,\r\n\r\nbecause he said that a two-year course is provided\r\n\r\nfor primary school-leavers. There is a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween a vocational school and the Vocational\r\n\r\nInstitute. We have enough vocational schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In fact, in 1967, nearly 9,000 primary\r\n\r\nschool-leavers will be posted to vocational\r\n\r\nschools. The two-year course in the vocational\r\n\r\nschool is intended to provide general vocational\r\n\r\ntraining and not specialised training in any one\r\n\r\ntrade or craft. However, the Ministry is now\r\n\r\nconsidering the extension of this two-year \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse to three years based on a U.N.E.S.C.O.\r\n\r\nreport, so that more intensive training in a\r\n\r\nparticular skill or craft can be given during the\r\n\r\nthird year. However, this will mean an additional\r\n\r\nburden on the Education Estimates and cannot be\r\n\r\nimplemented until more funds are available for\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those students who have done well in\r\n\r\nvocational schools, they are given preference for\r\n\r\nadmission to the Singapore Vocational Institute\r\n\r\nwhere facilities are available for the training of\r\n\r\nskilled craftsmen. As the Member is aware,\r\n\r\nprovision for four more such vocational institutes\r\n\r\nhave been entered in next year's Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. It is our view that if these four\r\n\r\nvocational institutes can be completed by 1969.\r\n\r\nthe shortage of training facilities will be\r\n\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

So i will take\r\n\r\nsome time before the problem of the hawkers can be\r\n\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that it is the aim of the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to ensure that their housing\r\n\r\nestates, which cost very large sums of public\r\n\r\nmoney, do not change the situation of the present\r\n\r\nslums to concrete slums. That is why they have\r\n\r\nasked for powers from the Ministry of Health to\r\n\r\ncontrol the hawker problem within the estates, and\r\n\r\nthis has been conceded. There has been an\r\n\r\namendment to the Local Government Integration\r\n\r\nOrdinance to give them powers to deal with\r\n\r\nhawkers, and in this respect the powers were\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\non the 1st of December this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is only reasonable and fair to allow\r\n\r\nsome time for the Housing and Development Board to\r\n\r\norganise itself to tackle this problem, but in the\r\n\r\nmeantime their officers are being trained by the\r\n\r\nHawkers Department of the Ministry of Health. We\r\n\r\nhave already made a move to resolve the hawker\r\n\r\nproblem, and we ourselves think that it will take\r\n\r\nquite some time before we can tackle the whole of\r\n\r\nSingapore. So to be fair to the Housing Board,\r\n\r\nthey should also be given adequate time to control\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As things stand, with the funds made\r\n\r\navailable to the Ministry of Health, all that we\r\n\r\ncan do at the moment is to concentrate really on\r\n\r\nwhat are known as priority groups, which include\r\n\r\nschool children, pregnant women, and those nursing\r\n\r\nmothers in need of dental care, and lastly adults.\r\n\r\nAs for adults, the only place for them to get\r\n\r\nGovernmental dental care at very low cost is at\r\n\r\nthe Dental Clinic of the Outram Road General\r\n\r\nHospital, which is also used as part of the Dental\r\n\r\nTeaching Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be very dangerous for me to\r\n\r\naccept the Member for Changi's suggestion that\r\n\r\nperhaps I make an application for a supplementary\r\n\r\nvote for a mobile dental clinic. Maybe I can give\r\n\r\nhim a little indication as to how he can get what\r\n\r\nhe wants, not through Government offices, but\r\n\r\nperhaps by an appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto members of the public.

For example, very recently\r\n\r\nthe Rotary Club donated a mobile blood bank,\r\n\r\ncosting probably $40,000, which is being fully\r\n\r\nused at the moment. And there is a philanthropist\r\n\r\nwho wants to donate another mobile blood bank,\r\n\r\nbut, unfortunately, we do not have the staff to\r\n\r\nman this mobile blood bank if it is made available\r\n\r\nto us. We are trying to interest this\r\n\r\nphilanthropist into doing something else.

This is an ordinary complaint by\r\n\r\nthe man in the street.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the loan of $20 million to the\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities Board is, as I understand it, to\r\n\r\nfinance public utility projects so that the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore can enjoy the services of water, gas\r\n\r\nand electricity. The services provided by the\r\n\r\nP.U.B. are of a very high standard as compared\r\n\r\nwith those of any other city in South-east Asia.\r\n\r\nIn our highly urbanised society, practically every\r\n\r\nhousehold is provided with water, electricity or\r\n\r\ngas, and even waterborne sewage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, this is hardly a\r\n\r\ncomplaint!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I will come now to my\r\n\r\ncomplaint. Even our rural dwellers are provided\r\n\r\nwith these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nessential services. So you will agree that the\r\n\r\ntask undertaken by the P.U.B. in improving these\r\n\r\nessential services to cope up with urban\r\n\r\nredevelopment is indeed a gigantic one. However,\r\n\r\nthere is a little complaint I wish to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the billing of service charges to\r\n\r\nthe consumers. The consumers, particularly flat\r\n\r\ndwellers in Housing Board estates, are very\r\n\r\ndissatisfied with the manner in which their con\r\n\r\nsolidated accounts are rendered. In some\r\n\r\ninstances, they are overcharged for the services\r\n\r\nsupplied. I have a few complaints of this nature.\r\n\r\nWhen complaints are taken up with the appropriate\r\n\r\ndepartment, they are rectified and the consumers\r\n\r\nare credited with the overcharge. In other\r\n\r\ninstances, the consumers are usually debited with\r\n\r\nexcessive amounts, many times their normal\r\n\r\ncharges. When queries are made, they are often\r\n\r\ntold that they were undercharged in the previous\r\n\r\nbills, and the surcharge covers a period of 10 to\r\n\r\n12 months. When I examined all their old bills, I\r\n\r\ndiscovered that estimated charges were entered in\r\n\r\nall these old bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not understand why meter\r\n\r\nreadings are not taken every month, so that the\r\n\r\nconsumers are fairly charged for the actual\r\n\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it due to a shortage of meter readers and, if\r\n\r\nso, why has action not been taken to recruit more\r\n\r\npeople to do the job of meter reading? Sir, this\r\n\r\nis now being drawn to the attention of the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned. I earnestly hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will urge the Public Utilities Board to\r\n\r\nimprove the situation so that this undesirable\r\n\r\nstate of affairs will be eradicated. Surely this\r\n\r\nis not the kind of efficiency that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore can expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the question raised\r\n\r\nby the Member for Kampong Kembangan, I would like\r\n\r\nto inform him that the P.U.B. has\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermitted itself to spend $140.32 million for\r\n\r\n1968. This sum of money will be spent as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$57.1 million for the Jurong Power Station;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$54.8 million for a system to distribute electricity;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3.9 million for the Gas Department;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$9.6 million to enlarge the Seletar Reservoir and, at the same time, to increase the filter at Woodleigh; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$6.7 million to create a distribution system for the increase of water supply from Woodleigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of this capital expenditure, the P.U.B can only\r\n\r\nfinance $45.66 million from its own funds. It has\r\n\r\nobtained a loan of $50.59 million from the World\r\n\r\nBank to finance its power and water capital works\r\n\r\nand, at the same time, on deferred payment credit\r\n\r\nit has obtained a loan of $24.07 million. This\r\n\r\ntotal sum does not come up to the required capital\r\n\r\nof $104.32 million and, therefore, the P.U.B, has\r\n\r\nto apply to the Government for a sum of $20\r\n\r\nmillion in order to fulfil the capital works for\r\n\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the increase in the water charges, I can\r\n\r\nonly remind Members of the House that the price of\r\n\r\nwater charged to consumers had remained static\r\n\r\nsince 1954, and for the last 13 years there has\r\n\r\nbeen no increase at all in the price of water\r\n\r\nalthough the cost of production has gone up. For\r\n\r\nexample, in 1962 the cost of producing a thousand\r\n\r\ngallons of water was 72.94 cents and in 1966 it\r\n\r\nwas 72.14 cents. In 1967 this year it is estimated\r\n\r\nto increase to 78.42 cents, and for next year the\r\n\r\ncost is going to rise to as much as 87.4 cents per\r\n\r\nthousand gallons. This, of course, means that\r\n\r\nsomebody has got to bear the losses and up to\r\n\r\ndate, until the P.U.B. raised this water tariff,\r\n\r\nthe cost has been borne by the Public Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard. The result, of course, is that the P.U.B.\r\n\r\nhas found itself in very difficult circumstances,\r\n\r\nand in order for it to obtain a loan from the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank, it has to increase its tariff charges\r\n\r\non water especially, in order to guarantee that\r\n\r\nthe sum returned will be able to meet the interest\r\n\r\non the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital borrowed as well as to return the\r\n\r\nprincipal sum. I think that will satisfy the query\r\n\r\nof the Member for Kampong Kembangan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the complaints raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten, I can only say that there are 660,000\r\n\r\nmeters involving 230,000 bills which are dealt\r\n\r\nwith by the P.U.B. each month. On the average, it\r\n\r\nhas been found that 12,000 meters cannot be read\r\n\r\nper month. That is, 1.8 per cent of the total\r\n\r\nnumber of meters have not been accessible to the\r\n\r\nP.U.B. meter readers for one reason or another.\r\n\r\nSome of these reasons are that the houses were\r\n\r\nlocked and the meter readers could not have access\r\n\r\nto the meters, or the meters were faulty or the\r\n\r\ndials were blurred and the meter readers could not\r\n\r\nread and, therefore, had to await changes in the\r\n\r\nmeters. Or there may be obstructions where the\r\n\r\nmeters are placed. Somebody may have placed a\r\n\r\ntable, a box or a pile of firewood next to the\r\n\r\nmeter and the result, of course, is that it is\r\n\r\nimpossible for the meter reader to have access to\r\n\r\nthe meter at all. These are some of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy 1.8 per cent of meters are not read per month\r\n\r\nand, therefore, some estimates of charges will\r\n\r\nhave to be inserted into the monthly consolidated\r\n\r\naccount. These are based on the average\r\n\r\nconsumption per month. The complaints which the\r\n\r\nMember for Mountbatten has mentioned just now\r\n\r\namount to only about 100 a month. There are\r\n\r\n230,000 accounts and 100 complaints a month from\r\n\r\nthese bills, amounting to 0.04 per cent. I think,\r\n\r\nall in all, the complaints are not excessive and I\r\n\r\nbelieve the accounting system is working well. So\r\n\r\nprobably the Member for Mountbatten has come\r\n\r\nacross specific individual cases and these have\r\n\r\nbeen brought to his attention. But it is not a\r\n\r\ngeneral complaint among P.U.B. consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I do not think there is any\r\n\r\ninefficiency or overcharging by P.U.B.\r\n\r\naccountants. In any case, when meters are finally\r\n\r\nchecked, any overpayments are credited to the\r\n\r\nconsumers' account, and if there have been under\r\n\r\npayments then, of course, the consumers have to\r\n\r\npay the balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

The main point I wish to\r\n\r\nraise under this head is about the one-room\r\n\r\nflats. In a block, the passage-way between the\r\n\r\nunits opposite to each other is very narrow.\r\n\r\nAdded to this difficulty, the doors of the unit\r\n\r\nopposite to each other are in the same line.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, when the dwellers of the\r\n\r\nopposite units keep their doors open, one can see\r\n\r\nwhat is happening in the other house. This\r\n\r\nreduces the privacy of these flat dwellers. Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister remedy this defect by changing the\r\n\r\ndesign of future blocks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about the home ownership\r\n\r\nplan. I understand that some of the present\r\n\r\ntenants have been given the option of buying the\r\n\r\nflats in which they live now. Since the Board is\r\n\r\nasking them to buy the flats all of a sudden,\r\n\r\nthey may not be in a position to raise enough\r\n\r\nmoney for a down-payment, though they would be\r\n\r\nhappy to buy the flat. So I request the Minister\r\n\r\nto waive the down-payment and extend the period\r\n\r\nof loan in such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that there are many housing\r\n\r\nestates without community centres, and it seems\r\n\r\nthat there will be none in certain cases. Will\r\n\r\nthe Minister consider providing the residents of\r\n\r\nsuch estates with a community hall or a similar\r\n\r\nfacility so that they can get together?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I wish to point out that there are\r\n\r\nvery few amenities for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe children living in those estates.

This is\r\n\r\nmore the work of my predecessor and of the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard itself. But all we hear are grumbles about\r\n\r\none room and two rooms. \"When you sell a house,\r\n\r\ngive it free,\" they say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to deal with the specific complaints of the\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied. He says the staircases are\r\n\r\ntoo narrow and the doors are on the opposite side\r\n\r\nof each other. But one-room flats are one-room\r\n\r\nflats. They are not very big. Neither is the room\r\n\r\nbig nor the staircase or the corridors in between.\r\n\r\nBut if the doors are opposite to each other, I\r\n\r\nwill ask my housing experts to look into the\r\n\r\ncomplaint and try to satisfy the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the down-payments, it is our policy to\r\n\r\naccept 20 per cent of the purchase price. But we\r\n\r\nmust have some sort of deposit, and in many cases\r\n\r\nthe 20 per cent deposit has been reduced to 10 per\r\n\r\ncent. In fact, there is no problem about the flats\r\n\r\nat Tiong Bahru. All have been bought. Those who\r\n\r\nhave refused to buy for reasons of their own have\r\n\r\nbeen transferred to other accommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again the Member for Aljunied grumbles\r\n\r\nabout the lack of facilities in Housing Board\r\n\r\nEstates. He says there are no community centres\r\n\r\nand no community halls. They are not completely\r\n\r\nabsent. There is a community hall at Queenstown\r\n\r\nand we are building two community halls at Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

There are many reasons why this\r\n\r\ncan happen. One possible explanation is that the\r\n\r\napplicant for estate A may have been far behind in\r\n\r\nthe waiting list and hence was given another flat\r\n\r\nwhich was lower down as far as priority is con\r\n\r\ncerned. But if the Member for Telok Blangah knows\r\n\r\nof two tenants, one living in, say, flat A and the\r\n\r\nother living in flat B and both are unhappy about\r\n\r\nit and wish to do an exchange, this will be\r\n\r\ngranted readily, provided, of course, the rents\r\n\r\nare the same. This has been done. There are\r\n\r\nthousands of flats being allocated. Sometimes\r\n\r\nthese things happen. If you live in a flat in\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru and you do not like it, and you have a\r\n\r\nfriend who likes Tiong Bahru and is prepared to\r\n\r\ngive up his flat for yours, we say good luck to\r\n\r\nyou both.

What I am trying to point out to Members\r\n\r\nis that they do not realise the position. They\r\n\r\ngrumble about one-room flats and narrow passages\r\n\r\nand doors through which tenants can look at each\r\n\r\nother. Their constituents are lucky that they have\r\n\r\nrooms over their heads. That is the point and for\r\n\r\nwhich I take no credit. I have only recently\r\n\r\njoined the Ministry. My predecessors take all the\r\n\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the specific point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang, he says build better\r\n\r\nflats. We are doing so. We have built four-room\r\n\r\nflats in Henderson Road. We thought of putting\r\n\r\nthem up for sale, but then we changed our minds\r\n\r\nand agreed to let these flats out. At the moment,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, only about half of these flats have\r\n\r\nbeen let out. But we hope in a month or two all\r\n\r\nwill be taken up. There are, roughly, a little\r\n\r\nless than 400 flats at Henderson Road. One reason\r\n\r\nmight be that the rent is too high. It is $120 for\r\n\r\na month with conservancy charges of about $6.50.\r\n\r\nAnd should these flats not be taken up, we will\r\n\r\neither have to reduce the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrent to suit everyone's pocket or, in the final\r\n\r\nanalysis, sell the flats to those who want to buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am withdrawing, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 40 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this head, the total estimated expenditure\r\n\r\nis $119,007,000 which will be mainly used to\r\n\r\nprovide loans to the Housing Board of $50 million,\r\n\r\nto the Public Utilities Board of $20 million, and\r\n\r\nto the Jurong Industrial Estate of $20 million. I\r\n\r\nwould like to put forward two suggestions under\r\n\r\nthis topic. Firstly, I would like to point out to\r\n\r\nthe Minister that the policy of house ownership\r\n\r\nfor the people has been well received, but this\r\n\r\npolicy has been confined only to certain areas. I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask him whether he will consider\r\n\r\nselling all the Housing Board flats to the tenants\r\n\r\nbecause this will be welcomed by the people.\r\n\r\nSecondly, last year I suggested to the House that\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board should employ lift attendants\r\n\r\nfor the flats. The Minister seems not to have\r\n\r\nlistened to what I said. I believe that the\r\n\r\nexpenses for such lift attendants will be\r\n\r\nwillingly borne by the tenants. There are three\r\n\r\nadvantages to this. Firstly, more job\r\n\r\nopportunities will be created. Secondly, the lifts\r\n\r\nwill be kept clean. Thirdly, the tenants' safety\r\n\r\ncan be well taken care of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, we have two and a half\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Shortly, in answer to the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, our policy is to sell as many flats as\r\n\r\npossible. We want to encourage home ownership in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But not everybody can afford to buy a\r\n\r\nflat. So I would suggest that the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang gets his facts right before he asks me\r\n\r\nto sell all Housing Board flats in Singapore.\r\n\r\nRented houses are subsidised and houses which are\r\n\r\npurchased are not. And besides it is because of\r\n\r\nlack of finance that many a tenant cannot buy his\r\n\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question of lifts, he alleges that I\r\n\r\nwas not listening to him last year. I can assure\r\n\r\nhim that I did. I did listen Land surveys have\r\n\r\nbeen carried out asking tenants whether they want\r\n\r\nlift attendants. Surveys were conducted in Queens-town and MacPherson estates. But the xesponse to\r\n\r\nthese surveys showed a very negligible percentage\r\n\r\nof tenants who are in favour of an additional\r\n\r\ncharge in rder to pay for these lift attendants.\r\n\r\nThe last survey was carried out in MacPherson\r\n\r\nestate, resulting in 3.6 per cent who agreed in\r\n\r\nprinciple to pay the :additional charge of $2.50\r\n\r\nper month, 19.5 per cent were not in favour, and\r\n\r\n76 per cent did not bother to reply. So this is\r\n\r\nthe reason why I suggest to the Member that he\r\n\r\ngets his facts right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In fact, this was pointed out as\r\n\r\nearly as 1957 by Dr Van der Hoogh who was then a\r\n\r\ntemporary museum adviser to U.N.E.S.C.O. when he led a\r\n\r\nmission to Singapore. In his report, he pointed\r\n\r\nout that while the Museum was rich in its\r\n\r\ncollections and centrally located, it was none the\r\n\r\nless outmoded and gave an old-fashioned\r\n\r\nimpression. He suggested ways in which the Museum\r\n\r\ncould be modernised to fulfil the functions\r\n\r\nrequired and expected of a modern museum. We have\r\n\r\nstudied the matter in conjunction with the recom\r\n\r\nmendations made in the same direction by the\r\n\r\nScience and Industry Museum Committee in its\r\n\r\nreport to the Minister for Education in 1961.\r\n\r\nPlans are in hand to reorganise and modernise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Museum, and I assure Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse that their opinions have already been\r\n\r\nconsidered in our planning. I shall not go into\r\n\r\ndetails on how the money is to be spent in view of\r\n\r\nthe shortage of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally touch on the suggestion by the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta that the, exhibits should be\r\n\r\nwritten in four languages?

My understanding is\r\n\r\nthat the Botanic Gardens will shut by 7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to\r\n\r\nhelp romantic couples go in and enjoy themselves!\r\n\r\nThis would damage the dignity of the Gardens.

In actual fact, Singapore is a\r\n\r\nyoung country. I think it would be a good thing.\r\n\r\nEvery young couple should go through this stage!\r\n\r\nIf they cannot go to the Botanic Gardens, they can\r\n\r\ngo elsewhere and make friends. Since we have seen\r\n\r\nso many couples along the beaches, we must not\r\n\r\nthink that when young couples go to the Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens they will act indecently. I think members\r\n\r\nof the public should have the right to go in. It\r\n\r\nis now under consideration only. We have not come\r\n\r\nto the final stage yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the time when the Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\nwill remain open, this has yet to be decided. It\r\n\r\nmay depend on whether or not there are incidents\r\n\r\nsuch as robbery, and so on which may happen in the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens. The security of the people there\r\n\r\nshould be taken into consideration. They should\r\n\r\nhave a sense of security when they visit the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about a national park, the suggestion by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten is a good one. I think\r\n\r\nthe Ministry can consider this point. But there\r\n\r\nare other considerations to bear in mind. It is\r\n\r\nnot so simple to have a national park. According\r\n\r\nto my understanding, a national park may involve a\r\n\r\nlot of artificial structures such as we can see in\r\n\r\nthe national parks in other countries. Even zoos\r\n\r\nare included in the national park. Some types of\r\n\r\nplants are also sold in the national parks. The\r\n\r\nquestion to be considered is whether artificial\r\n\r\nthings put into the park will spoil the natural\r\n\r\nscenery or beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has\r\n\r\njust said, Sir, if you will permit me ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The\r\n\r\nbeaches in Singapore have been littered with\r\n\r\nrubbish like beer cans and other things. I am also\r\n\r\nvery glad to see that my colleague, the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi, also took a very active part in the\r\n\r\ncampaign which was also helped by some very\r\n\r\nprominent businessmen in our Republic.

In this\r\n\r\nregard, Sir, may I ask the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nthe question of providing more bins properly\r\n\r\nlabelled? For example, call a spade a spade; call\r\n\r\na rubbish bin a rubbish bin and not a litter bin,\r\n\r\nbecause there can be a misunderstanding by\r\n\r\ntourists who are not English-educated.

To date,\r\n\r\nthe fire site has not been developed. I wish to\r\n\r\nknow the area of the site acquired by Government,\r\n\r\nand also can the Government lease the site to the\r\n\r\nresidents there for the purpose of building\r\n\r\ncommunity projects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1963 Government\r\n\r\nacquired about 44,650 square feet of land in\r\n\r\nKampong Eunos affected by fire. The acquisition\r\n\r\nwas undertaken in anticipation of future\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the area. The site, however, is too\r\n\r\nsmall to be developed independently. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan wishes to use the site for a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre or a centre for his Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee. The People's Association\r\n\r\nappear to have completed their development\r\n\r\nprogramme for community centres, which may account\r\n\r\nfor the fact that no applications have been\r\n\r\nreceived by the Land Office for the use of this\r\n\r\nsite as a community centre. I can assure the\r\n\r\nMember that the land will be released to the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association if it is prepared to\r\n\r\nundertake the construction, maintenance and manage\r\n\r\nment of a community centre there. But taking into\r\n\r\nconsideration the fact that there is another\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in Jalan Pengaga which is about a\r\n\r\nquarter of a mile away from the fire site, it is\r\n\r\nnot unlikely that the People's Association may\r\n\r\nfeel that another community centre in such close\r\n\r\nproximity may not be justified. But that is a\r\n\r\nmatter for the People's Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing land for Citizens' Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees is an entirely different matter. There\r\n\r\nare about 51 such corninittees on the island, and\r\n\r\ngiving one means meeting demands from others.

As the present position stands, these obnoxious trades are not offered alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation in the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard's housing estates. For instance, 17\r\n\r\nworkshops affected by the \"Golden Mile\" Scheme\r\n\r\nwere not offered Board's accommodation. The\r\n\r\ncharcoal shops from the urban renewal areas were\r\n\r\nalso told to change their trade because it was not\r\n\r\npossible to relocate them to Housing Board shop-houses in view of the nature of their trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resettlement officers maintain that it is\r\n\r\nvery difficult for this type of trade to survive\r\n\r\nin Housing and Development Board housing estates\r\n\r\nbecause the Board's flats are supplied with\r\n\r\nessential utilities. Here, Sir, I have a\r\n\r\nrepresentation from the Singapore Charcoal\r\n\r\nDealers' Association which is in my constituency.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal dealers have been in this trade for\r\n\r\nmore than 20 years, dating as far back as pre-war\r\n\r\ndays. About 20.000 persons are directly or\r\n\r\nindirectly dependent on the trade for their\r\n\r\nlivelihood. It is easy for our Government\r\n\r\nofficials to suggest to them that they should\r\n\r\nchange their trade,, but they do not realise the\r\n\r\ndifficulties that will confront these charcoal\r\n\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Charcoal Dealers' Association\r\n\r\ncontend that charcoal dealers should be allowed to\r\n\r\ncarry on with their business in the Board's shop-houses until such time as they are able to adapt\r\n\r\nthemselves to other trades, otherwise if they\r\n\r\ncannot find suitable alternative accommodation,\r\n\r\nthey will have to close down their business. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, this is a very obnoxious trade and so are\r\n\r\nthe workshops and machine-shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will be kind enough to\r\n\r\nurge the Housing and Development Board to look for\r\n\r\na solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to touch on the expenditure for\r\n\r\nresettlement.

Sometimes the land\r\n\r\nin question belongs to the Housing Board and not\r\n\r\nto private owners or the Land Office. The question\r\n\r\narises whether compensation will be paid to\r\n\r\nfamilies affected by resettlement. With regard to\r\n\r\nthe vote for resettlement, what areas does the\r\n\r\nMinister have in mind?

I am\r\n\r\nmaking a special appeal in this House for the\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Minister to construct rural\r\n\r\nabattoirs in certain rural areas where they can be\r\n\r\nlocated for the convenience of the' butchers. In\r\n\r\nthe markets, probably the butchers could sell a\r\n\r\nfew pigs a day.. But if you have to travel all the\r\n\r\nway to the Central Abattoir in Jurong, which\r\n\r\nactually is meant for meat canning - do you get the\r\n\r\nservices you want? I do not know, but this is an\r\n\r\nimportant point that I want to press home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, shortly, the\r\n\r\nCentral Abattoir at Jurong was built not only for\r\n\r\nthe slaughter of livestock for local needs but\r\n\r\nalso for export. However, the facilities that the\r\n\r\nabattoir provides may not be made use of by\r\n\r\nresidents in rural areas remote from Jurong. Their\r\n\r\nneeds are fully appreciated, and accordingly it is\r\n\r\nproposed to build three rural abattoirs of smaller\r\n\r\nunits in the rural areas. These would provide\r\n\r\nconvenient slaughtering facili -ties for the\r\n\r\npeople in the rural areas, enable the\r\n\r\nimplementation of veterinary public health\r\n\r\nmeasures to be carried out effectively in the\r\n\r\nsupply of wholesale meat, and reduce illegal\r\n\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote of $10 is only nominal. The reason is\r\n\r\nthis: these three projects can only be implemented\r\n\r\nafter the new Jurong abattoir has been in full\r\n\r\noperation, so that a full assessment of the needs\r\n\r\nof subsidiary rural abattoirs can be made, after\r\n\r\nwhich we can decide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether or not to have these rural\r\n\r\nabattoirs and where to build them.

Until the Jurong Abattoir has been\r\n\r\ncompleted, the residents living in areas remote\r\n\r\nfrom Jurong in the meantime will be suffering and\r\n\r\nhow can we relieve them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if they have been\r\n\r\nsuffering, they must have been suffering for many a\r\n\r\nyear!

We do not\r\n\r\nexpect Jurong to satisfy the needs of the whole\r\n\r\nisland. The only reason, as I have said, for the\r\n\r\n$10 vote is that we do not have immediate plans to\r\n\r\nbuild these abattoirs, but we certainly have not\r\n\r\nforgotten the need for such abattoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, and these centres and schemes are hardly\r\n\r\nfelt there. Perhaps the Minister can let the House\r\n\r\nknow what are the centres and schemes going to do\r\n\r\nand also to give it the widest publicity so that\r\n\r\nthe rural people who are engaged in agriculture\r\n\r\nwill have the benefit of any schemes that are being\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, first, the $10 vote for\r\n\r\nAgriculture Extension Centres.\r\n\r\nThere are 10 Agriculture and Veterinary Centres at\r\n\r\npresent in various parts of the rural areas in\r\n\r\nSingapore where there are large concentrations of\r\n\r\nfarming communities. Workers from the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department operate from these centres.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is quite a large number of smaller\r\n\r\nconcentrations of farming communities quite remote\r\n\r\nfrom existing centres where farmers cannot\r\n\r\nregularly obtain the services of the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department.\r\n\r\nThe department, therefore, proposes to set up\r\n\r\nsmaller extension centres, each comprising a house-cum-office where an extension centre worker will be\r\n\r\npermanently based in these remote farming\r\n\r\ncommunities, so that the farmers there will also\r\n\r\nbenefit from the services provided by the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item - Intensive Farm Improvement\r\n\r\nSchemes. In order to find ways and means of\r\n\r\nincreasing the agricultural productivity of\r\n\r\nexisting farms in Singapore and to improve the\r\n\r\nfertility of swamp land reclaimed for agricultural\r\n\r\nuse, the Primary Production Department proposes to\r\n\r\nestablish\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities for research in soil and fertilisers,\r\n\r\nplant breeding and selection of seeds,\r\n\r\ninsecticides and control of plant diseases. The\r\n\r\nestablishment of this proposed soil and fertiliser\r\n\r\nlaboratory is complementary to the schemes for re\r\n\r\nclaiming swamp land for agricultural use and\r\n\r\nimproving and intensifying the production of\r\n\r\nvegetable crops from existing farms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang may be interested\r\n\r\nto know that a U.N, team was invited to Singapore\r\n\r\nin 1965 to make a feasibility study of reclamation\r\n\r\nof tidal swamps for agricultural use. The mission\r\n\r\nrecommended, inter alia, soil surveys and physical\r\n\r\nand chemical analysis of soil samples taken from\r\n\r\nswamp land as well as experiments in cover crops,\r\n\r\nvegetable crop selection and rotation, soil\r\n\r\nimprovement and fertilisation. Farming in\r\n\r\nSingapore is extremely intensive in that a wide\r\n\r\nvariety of crops, mainly vegetables, are grown in\r\n\r\nsmall plots of land about an acre per farm. Due to\r\n\r\nperennial planting and in the absence of seasons,\r\n\r\nsoil fertility, crop varieties, and pests and\r\n\r\ndisease control play an important part in\r\n\r\nsustaining the economic returns from the land. The\r\n\r\nproposed laboratory, therefore, has an important\r\n\r\nrole to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item, Sir - Factory Farming Pilot\r\n\r\nScheme. In view of the limited land area in\r\n\r\nSingapore, farming must of necessity be of an\r\n\r\nintensive nature so that farmers can carry out\r\n\r\ntheir activities in the minimum area of land to\r\n\r\nachieve maximum production. This is as the Member\r\n\r\nfor Choa Chu Kang has advised. He thinks that it\r\n\r\nis particularly desirable, and so do we. In live\r\n\r\nstock production, animals or poultry can be reared\r\n\r\nin livestock houses and cages, so that the minimum\r\n\r\narea of land is required. It is the intention of\r\n\r\nthe department to carry out a series of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperiments on livestock husbandry with particular\r\n\r\nemphasis on intensive housing for livestock.

I think\r\n\r\nthis organisation is quite important for the\r\n\r\nexport of orchid blooms to Europe and the United\r\n\r\nStates. I have here with me the Asia Magazine\r\n\r\ndated 22nd October, 1967. At page 6, column 4,\r\n\r\nline 23, I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In l960 Singapore growers exported a relatively\r\n\r\ninsignificant US$37,600 worth of cut orchid blooms\r\n\r\nto florists in Europe and the United States. By\r\n\r\n1965 this figure had been tripled. Last year, that\r\n\r\nis 1966 the exports soared to US$250,000; and,\r\n\r\nwith demand rapidly snowballing, few doubt that\r\n\r\nSingapore's orchid industry will pass the million-dollar mark before long.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In 1966 we earned US$250,000, that is to say, the\r\n\r\namount that was declared. But I think it is well\r\n\r\nover US$250,000. From this little effort by\r\n\r\nbackyard orchid growers and four or five big\r\n\r\norchid growers, we can get such a big amount of\r\n\r\nforeign exchange. If there is proper organisation\r\n\r\nand research, I, think the orchid industry can\r\n\r\nassist our economy to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make this suggestion to the\r\n\r\nMinister for his consideration. Since our climate\r\n\r\nis very suitable for orchid growing and we have\r\n\r\nwhat I would call a natural greenhouse, would he\r\n\r\nconsider the establishment immediately of an\r\n\r\norchid institute like the Rubber Research\r\n\r\nInstitute of Malaysia, and lease out suitable\r\n\r\nagricultural land to orchid growers who are\r\n\r\ninterested in the study of orchids, and build an\r\n\r\norchid nursery subject to the requirements of the\r\n\r\nauthorities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in order to make maximum\r\n\r\nutilisation of whatever land resources we have in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the Government realises that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to investigate into lands which\r\n\r\nare not yet fully utilised. Though we are a small\r\n\r\nisland, we have smaller islands around us, three\r\n\r\nof which are in Changi - i.e., Pulau Ubin, Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong Besar and Pulau Tekong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKehil. The two biggest islands are Pulau Ubin and\r\n\r\nPulau Tekong. They have areas of approximately\r\n\r\n2,500 acres and 4,500 acres respectively. The populations are small, about 2,000 in Ubin and about\r\n\r\n6,000 in Tekong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They are very poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> They are poor, as the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi has pointed out. I did visit\r\n\r\nthese islands not very long ago and I myself felt\r\n\r\nthat there was scope for the lands to be put to\r\n\r\nuse. My Ministry has carried out a survey of the\r\n\r\npossibilities which these two islands may have to\r\n\r\noffer. The survey has been completed and the\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been made to Government.\r\n\r\nAccording to preliminary information, the lands on\r\n\r\nboth islands are most suitable for intensive\r\n\r\nagricultural use. We have as yet not acted on\r\n\r\nthese recommendations, but I can assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor Changi that the matter is well in hand and\r\n\r\nGovernment will soon act on the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Member dealt with the question of\r\n\r\norchids. As the Minister for Finance pointed out\r\n\r\nthe other day, we have little land in Singapore\r\n\r\nand perhaps the most economic way of using the\r\n\r\nlittle land we have is to cultivate orchids, sell\r\n\r\nthem abroad and bring in a lot of foreign\r\n\r\nexchange. The Member for Changi has pointed out\r\n\r\nthat we only have a $10 vote. But I can assure him\r\n\r\nthat the Primary Production Department has\r\n\r\nrecognised the importance of the annual export of\r\n\r\norchids which, as the Member has pointed out,\r\n\r\namounts to about US$250,000 per year, and the\r\n\r\nDepartment has taken steps to encourage more\r\n\r\nfarmers to grow more orchids. Pamphlets and\r\n\r\nbulletins are distributed to farmers for the\r\n\r\npurpose of instructing them on the technical as\r\n\r\npects of growing orchids. In fact, the Department\r\n\r\nis planning a larger orchid nursery than the one\r\n\r\nthat it has now. It is envisaged that more orchid\r\n\r\nsaplings will be propagated and sold to farmers at\r\n\r\na nominal charge. The question of selling orchids\r\n\r\nabroad, of\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse, is another matter. The Government does not\r\n\r\nsell orchids. It is the private sector which does\r\n\r\nthat, and it is the private sector that has its\r\n\r\ncontacts abroad. We have done nothing in this\r\n\r\nrespect and, if we do, perhaps objections will be\r\n\r\nraised on the ground that we are helping private\r\n\r\npersons to make money. We can do a little by way\r\n\r\nof the Tourist Promotion Board advertising\r\n\r\nSingapore abroad - \"Singapore is the land for\r\n\r\norchids.\" The Land Office has favourably\r\n\r\nconsidered applications for temporary occupation\r\n\r\nlicences from orchid growers and I can assure the\r\n\r\nMember that in this respect there have been no\r\n\r\ndelays by the Land Office as alleged by some other\r\n\r\nMembers. We are definitely behind the campaign to\r\n\r\ngrow more orchids and sell them abroad. We will\r\n\r\nmake available whatever land we have for the\r\n\r\npropagation of orchids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at least I\r\n\r\nhave a supporter in this House in my appeal to the\r\n\r\nGovernment to explore markets for our orchids. In\r\n\r\nfact, I stressed this in my debate on the Budget\r\n\r\nstatement on 14th December, 1967. Orchid growing\r\n\r\nat the present moment is confined to a few private\r\n\r\ngrowers who from time to time make use of the\r\n\r\nBotanic Gardens. That is why I suggested to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Social Affairs yesterday that the re\r\n\r\nsearch work, the breeding and growing of orchids,\r\n\r\nshould be transferred to the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment. If I remember correctly, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social\r\n\r\nAffairs said yesterday that if the research work\r\n\r\nwas transferred to the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment, there would be a duplication of work.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I am inclined to agree with him\r\n\r\nbecause there is already a token vote provided in\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates under Primary\r\n\r\nProduction.

I have\r\n\r\nobserved that many pedestrians do not make use of\r\n\r\nthe bridge at Collyer Quay. Instead they cross the\r\n\r\nroad by cutting through the traffic. I have also\r\n\r\nobserved that construction work is being carried\r\n\r\nout on the road divider at Collyer Quay which\r\n\r\nappears to be designed for the purpose of inducing\r\n\r\npedestrians to use the overhead bridges. This is\r\n\r\nvery timely and useful. But the erection of\r\n\r\nphysical obstacles to compel pedestrians to use\r\n\r\noverhead bridges where available for crossing\r\n\r\nroads is rather an expensive way of popularising\r\n\r\noverhead bridges and underpasses. A more suitable\r\n\r\nremedy, I think, is to obtain legal sanction\r\n\r\nagainst pedestrians crossing the roads at their\r\n\r\nwhim and fancy instead of using overhead bridges\r\n\r\nwhere these are available. The remedy is to legis\r\n\r\nlate against jay-waiking by pedestrians as it has\r\n\r\nbeen done in many other countries. I am no\r\n\r\nmotorist myself but I think it is only fair that\r\n\r\npedestrians should be made to observe, as the\r\n\r\nother road users, the same set of rules that are\r\n\r\ndesigned to protect life and limb and to promote\r\n\r\nthe smooth flow of traffic. In the absence of any\r\n\r\nlegislation, it appears to be a waste of time to\r\n\r\nerect more overhead bridges. It is an expenditure\r\n\r\nof money which pedestrians do not appreciate and\r\n\r\nwhich do not materially benefit the other road\r\n\r\nusers. The provision of overhead bridges merely\r\n\r\nstrives to remedy the symptoms without removing\r\n\r\nthe cause of the problem of the kamikaze attitude\r\n\r\nof Singapore residents. I should think that the\r\n\r\nmoney set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naside for overhead bridges and under-passes will\r\n\r\nbe more fruitfully devoted to the education of\r\n\r\nroad users, including pedestrians, and to bring\r\n\r\nhome to them the point that by failing to observe\r\n\r\ntraffic rules, they are not only risking their\r\n\r\nlives and the lives of other road users, but they\r\n\r\nare also guilty of social indiscipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the answer to the questions\r\n\r\nposed by the Member for Telok Blangah is to\r\n\r\neducate the public. We must educate them not only\r\n\r\nnot to dirty our beaches; we must even educate\r\n\r\nthem on how to cross roads. If we do not build\r\n\r\npedestrian bridges in Singapore, we will be\r\n\r\ncriticised because anyone trying to cross\r\n\r\nFinlayson Green/Collyer Quay at rush hours without\r\n\r\nthe use of a pedestrian bridge will be attempting\r\n\r\nto commit suicide. But we build the bridges in the\r\n\r\ninterest of pedestrians to enable them to cross\r\n\r\nroads safely. And these bridges should help to\r\n\r\nreduce traffic accidents and provide for a\r\n\r\nsmoother and faster flow of vehicular traffic. If\r\n\r\nthe pedestrians do not want to use them and are\r\n\r\nprepared to risk their lives and limbs, perhaps\r\n\r\nsometimes through sheer laziness, then I do not\r\n\r\nsee how a set of rules could serve to force these\r\n\r\npeople to do so. However, my Ministry has not been\r\n\r\nidle. We are not prepared to watch these people\r\n\r\njust risk their lives trying to cross roads. So we\r\n\r\nhave built safety fences along the centre divider\r\n\r\nand on the edge of the footpaths to deter these\r\n\r\npeople from crossing the road and to encourage\r\n\r\nthem to use the overhead bridges. But if some high\r\n\r\njumper decides to take a jump over that fence, I\r\n\r\nsay let him do it. The position is continually\r\n\r\nunder review and it is hoped that, in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith the assistance of the traffic police, more\r\n\r\neffective measures\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be taken to ensure that all pedestrians will\r\n\r\neventually use the available overhead crossings.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have pointed out earlier, this is a\r\n\r\nmatter of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I would like to dwell on\r\n\r\nthis topic - pedestrian overhead bridges and\r\n\r\nunderpasses. I fully agree with what the Minister\r\n\r\nhas said. But I have another point here and that\r\n\r\nis two pedestrian crossings were obliterated at\r\n\r\nUpper Serangoon Road 6\u00bc m.s. An overhead bridge was\r\n\r\nconstructed near one of them. But over on the\r\n\r\nother side, away from Tampines Circus where\r\n\r\ntraffic lights have just been installed, the\r\n\r\npedestrian crossing has been obliterated by the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department. I did point out to the\r\n\r\ntraffic police and the P.W.D, that they should\r\n\r\nhave studied the case first before removing such a\r\n\r\ncrossing, since this has caused a lot of\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the public in that the pedestrian\r\n\r\ncrossing happened to be used mostly by the\r\n\r\nresidents in Punggol and those living around that\r\n\r\narea. Although that pedestrian crossing has been\r\n\r\nremoved, people are still treating it as if there\r\n\r\nis still a pedestrian crossing there and crossing\r\n\r\nthe road at random, and on many occasions I had to\r\n\r\nslow down my car in order to enable the\r\n\r\npedestrians to cross. On this note, will the\r\n\r\nMinister kindly look into this matter regarding\r\n\r\nthe obliteration of the pedestrian crossing at\r\n\r\nUpper Serangoon Road 6\u00bc m.s.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Upper Serangoon Road. Previously there\r\n\r\nwas no overhead pedestrian bridge. There was a\r\n\r\nzebra crossing and people using the crossing\r\n\r\ninterfered with the traffic. In compliance with\r\n\r\npopular demand headed by the Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon, we built a pedestrian bridge and we\r\n\r\ntook away one of the pedestrian crossings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if people do not choose to use the overhead\r\n\r\nbridge but prefer to cross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe road where the pedestrian crossing was and no\r\n\r\nlonger is, what can my Ministry do? I say again\r\n\r\nthat it is a matter of education. We can block the\r\n\r\ncentre. We can prevent people crossing the road by\r\n\r\nbuilding this safety device about four or five\r\n\r\nfeet right along the central divider. But even\r\n\r\nthat will not prevent them. They are in a hurry to\r\n\r\nget across to do whatever they want to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But basically, Sir, I say once again that we\r\n\r\nhave to educate our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether it cannot be made law that a\r\n\r\npedestrian must use the overhead bridges otherwise\r\n\r\nhe will be committing a traffic offence.

I\r\n\r\nfeel it is better to encourage people to use the\r\n\r\nbridges perhaps by placing traffic policemen at\r\n\r\nstrategic spots and getting the policemen to ask\r\n\r\nthem to use the bridges. At this stage when\r\n\r\npedestrian bridges are somewhat new to the island.\r\n\r\nI myself would not favour laws forcing people to\r\n\r\nuse these bridges.

The P.W.D, is now carrying out\r\n\r\nthe study with the assistance of the United\r\n\r\nNations Development Programme Special Fund. A\r\n\r\nspecial unit was formed in September this year and\r\n\r\nits aim is to formulate long-term comprehensive\r\n\r\nguiding concepts for the development of the\r\n\r\nRepublic in the fields of transportation, urban\r\n\r\nrenewal and redevelopment and even in industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment. But a comprehensive transportation\r\n\r\nstudy forms an important component of all these\r\n\r\nprojects and is aimed at producing a long-range\r\n\r\nplan for the most efficient transportation system\r\n\r\npossible within the limitations of our financial\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of the scheme comprises a series\r\n\r\nof traffic surveys to collect data on the nature\r\n\r\nand pattern of the distribution of people and\r\n\r\ngoods on the island of Singapore. This data, when\r\n\r\ncollected, will provide the basis for traffic\r\n\r\nforecasting which is necessary for the preparation\r\n\r\nof road network and mass transportation plans. In\r\n\r\nOctober and November this year, pilot surveys were\r\n\r\ncarried out.

Following this, the data collected will be\r\n\r\nprocessed and work on planning of the\r\n\r\ntransportation system will then follow. The whole\r\n\r\nproject is expected to be completed within three\r\n\r\nor four years, but the surveys and experts cost\r\n\r\nmoney.

All we need is a heavy downfall\r\n\r\ncoinciding with the high tide, and low-lying areas\r\n\r\nin Singapore are flooded. Flood alleviation\r\n\r\nschemes have been carried out in the areas\r\n\r\naffected, but looking at the Estimates for next\r\n\r\nyear, I feel that priorities have not been\r\n\r\ncarefully considered. My colleagues whose consti\r\n\r\ntuencies are also affected by flooding may not\r\n\r\nagree with me. Nevertheless, I wish to bring this\r\n\r\nmatter up not on the ground of inconvenience\r\n\r\ncaused to the people by flooding, but on the\r\n\r\ngrounds of the suffering that people undergo when\r\n\r\nthe areas in which they live are flooded. For\r\n\r\ninstance, Bukit Timah Road has been flooded ever\r\n\r\nsince I can remember. Sir, how much misery has it\r\n\r\ncaused to the people other than its being a\r\n\r\ntemporary inconvenience? Although Bukit Timah Road\r\n\r\nis a trunk road to the city, all you have to do is\r\n\r\nto by.pass it if it is flooded or wait until the\r\n\r\nflood subsides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flooding in other areas cannot be treated\r\n\r\nas lightly as that which occurs in Bukit Timah.\r\n\r\nFlooding in areas such as Lorong Kinchir or Lorong\r\n\r\nChuan, which is in the Serangoon Gardens\r\n\r\nConstituency, and even those bordering Braddell\r\n\r\nRoad, is not only an inconvenience to the people\r\n\r\nin the area, but\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit also destroys all the vegetables which they\r\n\r\nhave toiled from morning to night to cultivate,\r\n\r\nand their chickens and pigs which cannot swim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of the people of Singapore who\r\n\r\nlive in urban areas do not probably realise how\r\n\r\nmuch toil and sweat is put into the growing of\r\n\r\nvegetables or the rearing of pigs. I can assure\r\n\r\nthem that it is no picnic and that if they tried\r\n\r\nit they would not even get to first base, because\r\n\r\nfrom experience I know what it is like. The\r\n\r\nfarmers in Singapore are a tough breed, but I do\r\n\r\nnot think the Government should take it for\r\n\r\ngranted that just because they are tough they can\r\n\r\nwithstand misfortunes forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore appeal to the Minister to review the\r\n\r\nexpenditure under this head and to give more\r\n\r\npriority to areas more deserving than those which\r\n\r\nhave more sums allocated to them in the Estimates\r\n\r\nfor just concrete lining. To mention a few, for\r\n\r\nsuch subheads as 102, 107, and 108.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Gonzales, if you want\r\n\r\nthe Minister to reply, you will have to finish\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gonzales:</b> Yes, Sir. All I say is that if\r\n\r\nthere is a fairer allocation of priorities, the\r\n\r\npeople will be very much happier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, subhead 109 refers\r\n\r\nto the extension of Sungei Kallang. This scheme is\r\n\r\none of the schemes under the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. During the First Five-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan prior to 1966, Sungei Kallang between Braddell Road and Upper Serangoon was realigned,\r\n\r\nstraightened, widened and deepened. As a result,\r\n\r\nflooding at Potong Pasir has been greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, the improvement in realignment of Sungei\r\n\r\nKallang was extended beyond Braddell Road by 2,500\r\n\r\nfeet towards Peirce Reservoir to alleviate\r\n\r\nflooding of the low-lying Lorong Chuan area. This\r\n\r\nyear the improvement was extended further from\r\n\r\n2,000 feet upstream of Braddell Road to 5,900\r\n\r\nfeet. In 1968, it will be extended by another\r\n\r\n3,000 feet. So we are not neglecting Upper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSerangoon, as it were. The flooding in Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nhas been neglected for the last ten years. In my\r\n\r\nview, it should have been done in 1955 or 1957, because the floods along the main trunk road between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Johore Bahru lead to utter chaos on\r\n\r\nthe island. During the last floods, school\r\n\r\nchildren had to be rescued and it was fortunate\r\n\r\nfor us that, when these areas were flooded a few\r\n\r\ndays ago, the schools were having their holidays.\r\n\r\nBut the effect of floods along Bukit Timah Road is\r\n\r\nto cause traffic diversion to Holland Road ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We all know that every year\r\n\r\nthe Urban and Rural Services Committee is\r\n\r\nallotted large sums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof money to be distributed to various\r\n\r\nconstituencies. But in some constituencies the\r\n\r\nmoney is not fully used or even used, and in\r\n\r\ncertain rural areas the sums allotted are not\r\n\r\nsufficient for their use. So will the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee consider re-allotting\r\n\r\nthose sums of money which are not made use of to\r\n\r\nother constituencies which are urgently in need\r\n\r\nof more money? In some areas, not a single cent\r\n\r\nwas spent out of the vote given to them, while in\r\n\r\nmy constituency Paya Lebar, two years have\r\n\r\nalready elapsed without the necessary funds being\r\n\r\napproved for the construction of a drain. $60,000\r\n\r\nis required for the building of the drain, and\r\n\r\nyet only $2,000 is allotted each year. Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development whether he\r\n\r\nwill consider transferring the unspent sums to\r\n\r\nneedy areas for such development projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another question I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood of Housing Board estates in certain\r\n\r\nconstituencies. It usually happens that when a\r\n\r\nnew housing estate is being built, the roads are\r\n\r\nmade up and street lamps are provided. I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether in such cases the balance of the vote for\r\n\r\nthese constituencies can be transferred to the\r\n\r\nrural constituencies to be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I would like to ask is about\r\n\r\nthe principle and basis of allotment. 95 per cent\r\n\r\nof the Paya Lebar area is rural and the rest is\r\n\r\nsuburban. We are getting less funds now for the\r\n\r\nimprovement of this area. What I mean to say is\r\n\r\nthis. There are some constituencies where one-quarter or one-eighth of the area is rural or\r\n\r\nurban. I would like to ask the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary whether he can adjust his allotment so\r\n\r\nthat the overall development of the\r\n\r\nconstituencies is fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

I\r\n\r\nam their elected representative, and it is my duty\r\n\r\nto forward their representations to the Government\r\n\r\nin this House, even if it is tired of listening to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials of the U.R.S.C. from the Katong\r\n\r\nDistrict have visited my area, and have\r\n\r\ninvestigated its conditions.

I myself have put\r\n\r\nforward representations to the Minister, but his\r\n\r\nreply is that the money is in the hands of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance who, when he spoke on the\r\n\r\n11th instant, in his capacity as Member for Kreta\r\n\r\nAyer, said that not a single cent had been spent\r\n\r\non development in Kreta Ayer.

On this matter of allocation, I\r\n\r\nwould like to air my views. I remember this matter\r\n\r\nwas brought up in last year's debate on the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates in this House. At that time\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development said that the allocation of\r\n\r\nfunds was based on the population density as well\r\n\r\nas the area of the constituency concerned. The\r\n\r\nallocation is based on the principle that the\r\n\r\nmoney of the ratepayers is allotted to the con\r\n\r\nstituencies in a fair and just way. But what\r\n\r\nresult do we get under this princi, pie of\r\n\r\nallocation? The Member for Paya Lebar has just\r\n\r\nmentioned it. In some constituencies the funds\r\n\r\nallocated have not been made use of because they\r\n\r\nhave already been developed to an advanced stage.\r\n\r\nThey have all the modern facilities and amenities,\r\n\r\nand they do not have to use these funds. For\r\n\r\ninstance, Delta Constituency, Havelock\r\n\r\nConstituency, Moulmein Constituency and Rochore\r\n\r\nConstituency have not made use of a single cent of\r\n\r\nthe sums allocated to them. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nsome rural constituencies, which are in need of\r\n\r\nfunds, do not receive enough funds. For instance,\r\n\r\nChangi, Choa Chu Kang and Paya Lebar Constituencies are badly in need of more funds to\r\n\r\nspend on development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, these rural areas do not\r\n\r\nhave modern facilities. We know that if you want\r\n\r\nto construct metalled roads in these areas or\r\n\r\nconnect pipe-lines, the sum required would be in\r\n\r\nthe region of thousands of dollars. But according\r\n\r\nto the principle of allocation, each constituency\r\n\r\ncan only get a few thousand dollars. The situation\r\n\r\nis such that when a constituency requires a pipe-line to be laid, there will not be enough funds to\r\n\r\ncarry out other projects. Can the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary tell us whether the principle of\r\n\r\nallocation can be changed or\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadjusted? That is, do not base the allocation on\r\n\r\nthe density of population, the size of the\r\n\r\nconstituency or the locality, lt should be based\r\n\r\non the stage of development of each constituency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a constituency does not require\r\n\r\nany funds for development, then this sum of money\r\n\r\nshould be allotted to other less developed areas\r\n\r\nin order that they may have enough funds for\r\n\r\ndevelopment. For instance, the rural areas should\r\n\r\nget more funds so that in future they can make\r\n\r\nbetter use of the sums allocated to them for\r\n\r\ndevelopment purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nsentiments of the Member for Paya Lebar and the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong. My own constituency is not\r\n\r\nactually a rural area. But I would like to say a\r\n\r\nfew words on behalf of the rural constituencies.\r\n\r\nRural constituencies are normally very large in\r\n\r\narea. Therefore, there are more projects to be\r\n\r\ncarried out there. They therefore require more\r\n\r\nmoney to carry out these projects. I have a\r\n\r\nsuggestion to make. Can the Parliamentary Secre\r\n\r\ntary consider whether in next year's estimates it\r\n\r\nis possible to transfer part of the vote belonging\r\n\r\nto the urban area to the rural areas? In this way\r\n\r\nthe rural areas will have more funds to carry on\r\n\r\nwith their development projects and thus provide\r\n\r\nmore amenities to the people there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as an M.P.\r\n\r\nfrom the rural area I have to dwell on the urban\r\n\r\nand rural services. I notice that in 1966 and 1967\r\n\r\nthere was an estimated expenditure of some $2.78\r\n\r\nmillion, but for next year it is only $2.2\r\n\r\nmillion. That is a big slice of about half a\r\n\r\nmillion dollars less for the provision of such\r\n\r\nservices. I would say that instead of provision\r\n\r\nfor urban and rural services, it should be\r\n\r\nprovision for rural services. I take in particular\r\n\r\nitem 001, for which $700,000 is provided. There is\r\n\r\na big cut of more than $600,000. I fully subscribe\r\n\r\nto what my colleagues from the rural areas have\r\n\r\nstated; that is, give a little bit to the urban\r\n\r\nareas, just a token provision, as what has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlisted in many items in the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\nIf there is a project which warrants a particular\r\n\r\nsum of expenditure, then the Urban and Rural\r\n\r\nServices Committee would decide whether that money\r\n\r\nshould be spent. The funds to be proportionately\r\n\r\nallocated to the constituencies should take into\r\n\r\nconsideration the fact that the rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies need these funds most. The rural\r\n\r\nfolks lack a lot of social amenities. For example,\r\n\r\nyou can see under item 011, extension of water\r\n\r\nsupply, that the vote has been increased to\r\n\r\n$600,000. Many motions on the adjournment have\r\n\r\nbeen made in this House pertaining to the needs of\r\n\r\nthe rural folks in these constituencies. I am\r\n\r\nhappy to note that the provisions have been\r\n\r\nincreased for certain items. However, in the case\r\n\r\nof agricultural and kampong roads, there is a big\r\n\r\ncut. I hope with this $2.256 million the Parlia\r\n\r\nmentary Secretary to the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment will take into consideration the fact\r\n\r\nthat when the U.R.S.C. meet and decide what to do\r\n\r\nwith the requests from the various constituencies,\r\n\r\nit will not be necessary just to say, \"All right,\r\n\r\nwe have expended the provision under the\r\n\r\nparticular item; therefore, nothing can be done\r\n\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on that note I hope the rural constituencies\r\n\r\nwill benefit more as a result of the many requests\r\n\r\nmade by my colleagues, the Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nrepresenting the rural areas, and also as a result\r\n\r\nof the motions on the adjourn, ment put before the\r\n\r\nHouse sometime this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But sometimes when I consider this matter 1\r\n\r\ncould not sympathise with\r\n\r\nthem. Thc reasons are that at the beginning of\r\n\r\nSeptember this year, when\r\n\r\nthere was still a substantial amount of funds in\r\n\r\nthe Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee, my Minister wrote a letter to Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament of the rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies, requesting that if there were any\r\n\r\nprojects in the rural areas\r\n\r\nwhich needed to be completed within this year,\r\n\r\nthen they should, within one\r\n\r\nmonth, put their suggestions to the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee.

We also\r\n\r\napproached the Ministry of Finance on this matter.\r\n\r\nYet these Members of Parliament did not make use of this opportunity given\r\n\r\nto them. Now they want\r\n\r\nto ask for more funds. When we offered them this\r\n\r\nsum of money which they\r\n\r\nneeded, they did not want to take it, and now they\r\n\r\nturn round and ask for\r\n\r\nmore funds.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an incident. This year\r\n\r\nSembawang could make use of $75,000\r\n\r\nand yet only five projects were suggested. It made\r\n\r\nuse of only $55,000, thereby\r\n\r\nsaving $20,000. In the case of Paya Lebar, we gave\r\n\r\nthem more funds than\r\n\r\nthey needed to complete their projects. Paya Lebar\r\n\r\ncompleted only $35,000\r\n\r\nworth of projects. They were allotted $56,000 and\r\n\r\nyet they spent only $35,000\r\n\r\non their projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members have claimed more money under these\r\n\r\ncircumstances. If\r\n\r\nthey could only redouble their efforts and be\r\n\r\nmore efficient in carrying out the\r\n\r\nvarious projects, I think they would go a long\r\n\r\nway towards getting more funds. Let me quote an example in Choa Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nConstituency.

If this work\r\n\r\nhad been undertaken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it would not have been completed\r\n\r\nwithin one year. The expenditure for making up this 30 miles of road was very\r\n\r\nsmall. If other Members of\r\n\r\nParliament can follovv this example, I believe it\r\n\r\nvvill go a long way towards\r\n\r\nreducing their own difficulties. And Members can\r\n\r\nalso make use of this\r\n\r\nopportunity to have more contact with their\r\n\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Punggol and Thomson have also\r\n\r\nraised the question of\r\n\r\ntransferring part of the vote allocated\r\n\r\nto the urban areas to the rural areas. I feel it\r\n\r\nis rather early for them to raise\r\n\r\nthis matter but I think this suggestion merits\r\n\r\nsome consideration. Perhaps when\r\n\r\nthe Economic Planning Unit of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance considers the allocation of funds to the 58 constituencies, I will\r\n\r\nask them to consider this suggestion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, may I deal with one\r\n\r\nparticular point which the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development has pointed\r\n\r\nout?

Sir, in one\r\n\r\nbreath he stated that all the rural M.P.s did not\r\n\r\ndo their job. Therefore, in refuting this I produce the Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee's list showing\r\n\r\nthe aniount of money approved by the U.R.S.C. and\r\n\r\nProjects Committee for\r\n\r\nurban and rural services for the year 1967. Let me\r\n\r\ntrouble the House with a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of detail. Changi, for example, is a\r\n\r\nrural constituency. The revised\r\n\r\nallocation of funds stood at $87,969; the amount\r\n\r\nexpended was $98,180.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a debit amount of  $10,211.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the  M.P.\r\n\r\nhas done his job. Similarly, Choa Chu Kang, which\r\n\r\nis a rural area, was allocated $77,500, and it expended $89,900; over-expenditure $12,000. Now let us\r\n\r\ncome to Kampong Kembangan. Amount allocated was\r\n\r\n$44,100; amount expended\r\n\r\nwas $68,420; amount over-expended was  $24,350.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I remember in an\r\n\r\nadjournment speech in this House sometime this year, the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang complained about\r\n\r\ngoing through complicated procedures before\r\n\r\nprojects could be implemented. Approaches have to be made to various\r\n\r\ndepartments. Every application for a\r\n\r\nproject takes more than six months to  be\r\n\r\nprocessed before it can be implemented. Because of this complicated procedure,\r\n\r\nthe projects were not tabled\r\n\r\nin time before the U.R.S.C.

Members of Parliament are not sleeping\r\n\r\nbecause several projects proposed to the U.R.S.C.\r\n\r\nyears ago are still pending and Members are still\r\n\r\nbeing asked whether they support the projects.
