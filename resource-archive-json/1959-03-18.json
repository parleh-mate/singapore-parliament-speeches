The office  of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary will cease to exist  in  its  present\r\n\r\nform on the coming into force of the new Constitution,\r\n\r\nand  it  will  therefore be necessary  to  make  other\r\n\r\nprovision. It is considered that, following the change\r\n\r\nmade by the Federation, it will be more appropriate to\r\n\r\nhave  the  necessary corporate body in  the  Treasury.\r\n\r\nThis Bill therefore seeks to incorporate the Financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary and to provide for the vesting in him  as  a\r\n\r\ncorporate body of the properties now held by the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  Incorporated. This will mean  that  on  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the new Constitution  the  corporate\r\n\r\nbody  will be the Minister charged with responsibility\r\n\r\nfor finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself follows, in the main, the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Chief Secretary Incorporation Ordinance. There\r\n\r\nis,  I  think, only one new provision to which I  need\r\n\r\ndraw  attention, and that is in clause 5 (3) where  it\r\n\r\nis proposed that there shall be power to vest property\r\n\r\nin  a  public officer or authority, that  is  in  some\r\n\r\nperson other than the Financial Secretary, should  the\r\n\r\nneed  arise.  It may occasionally be more  appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  some other person, perhaps the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLands,  should  hold  certain  types  of  property.  A\r\n\r\nsimilar provision appears in the Federation where they\r\n\r\nhave   it,   mainly   I  believe,   for   the   better\r\n\r\nadministration of the railway. It is not inconceivable\r\n\r\nthat  some such power might be needed in Singapore  at\r\n\r\nsome future date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.-[Mr Shanks].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 27, after \"tenure\", to insert \"and\r\n\r\nfor the like purposes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to correct a drafting error, Sir,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendment made: In page 2, line 36, after\r\n\r\n\"tenure\", to insert \"and for the like purposes\".-[Mr\r\n\r\nShanks].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments made:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 38, to leave out \"the Order\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"such order\".-[Mr Shanks].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 2 and 3, to leave out \"the Order\"\r\n\r\nand insert \"such order\".- [Mr Shanks].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 to 9 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with Amendments; read the Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOREIGN JUDGMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(RECIPROCAL ENFORCEMENT)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.13 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

It provides that the person who has obtained\r\n\r\na   judgment   in   such  territory  may   apply   for\r\n\r\nregistration  of  the  judgment  to  the  High  Court,\r\n\r\nwhereupon  the  Court may, if in all the circumstances\r\n\r\nof  the  case it thinks that it is just and convenient\r\n\r\nso  to  do, order that the judgment be registered  and\r\n\r\nthereby  become enforceable as if it were the judgment\r\n\r\nof the Singapore High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill now before the Assembly goes further in that\r\n\r\nit   applies  not  merely  to  countries  within   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth but to foreign countries where reciprocal\r\n\r\nprovision  has  been  made  for  the  enforcement   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  judgments.  It  follows  very  closely  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the United Kingdom Act of 1933 and  lays\r\n\r\ndown  detailed provisions relating to the registration\r\n\r\nof foreign judgments, with provision for its extension\r\n\r\nwhere substantial reciprocity is assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important difference in the procedure will be\r\n\r\nthat  where  the provisions apply judgments  shall  be\r\n\r\nregistered   by   the  Court  if  certain   prescribed\r\n\r\nconditions are satisfied.

The  first  change\r\n\r\nproposed is that gifts of property should be deemed to\r\n\r\nbe  part of the property of the deceased at his  death\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of liability to estate duty if  made\r\n\r\nwithin  five  years  of  the death  of  the  deceased,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  the  present three years as  provided  in\r\n\r\nsection  7 of the Ordinance as it stands. This  change\r\n\r\nis  effected by clause 4 of the Bill. Clauses 5 and  6\r\n\r\nare  consequential amendments. It is quite  legitimate\r\n\r\nfor a person during his lifetime to make a disposition\r\n\r\nof  his property with a view to evasion of estate duty\r\n\r\non  his  death. The object of these provisions of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  to stop such a loophole.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nfound that the present era of three years is too short\r\n\r\nto be effective in preventing evasion of duty; both in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom and Ceylon, the period  has  been\r\n\r\nextended  to  five  years.  A  similar  amendment  has\r\n\r\nrecently been introduced in Hongkong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change, effected by clauses 7 and 9 of the\r\n\r\nBill,  seeks  to  remove what is considered  to  be  a\r\n\r\ndefect in the law relating to the assessment of estate\r\n\r\nduty.  Under the existing law in sections 38 to 40  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance, no transaction in any of the  property\r\n\r\ncontained in the estate of a deceased person can  take\r\n\r\nplace unless evidence is produced that the estate duty\r\n\r\nhas  been paid. But there is no direct obligation laid\r\n\r\nupon   the   executor   or  administrator   or   other\r\n\r\naccountable  person to submit to the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nEstate  Duty an estate duty affidavit relating to  the\r\n\r\nduty  payable; and in practice no such action is taken\r\n\r\nuntil it is intended to transact with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty.

With  the  gratifying\r\n\r\nsuccess  which  has  been achieved by  the  Federation\r\n\r\nauthorities  in  the  campaign against  the  Communist\r\n\r\nterrorists, it became possible at the end of last year\r\n\r\nfor  the  whole of Johore State, adjacent to Singapore\r\n\r\nIsland,  to be declared a \"white\" area, and  with  the\r\n\r\nagreement of the Federation of Malaya Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Johore Straits Control Scheme terminated  on  the\r\n\r\n31st  December.

These matters are covered by  sections  11\r\n\r\nand  12  of  the  Ordinance, and  in  so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nprovisions are permanently required, they should  more\r\n\r\nappropriately  be  embodied in the  Merchant  Shipping\r\n\r\nOrdinance  itself.  This  is  being  effected  by  the\r\n\r\nMerchant Shipping (Amendment) Bill, introduced at  the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting of the Assembly and which my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry,  will  be\r\n\r\nputting through its remaining stages of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter relates to certain restrictions\r\n\r\nimposed  on  shipping using Telok Ayer Basin  and  the\r\n\r\nwaters  around  Keppel  Harbour,  Pulau  Bukom,  Pulau\r\n\r\nSebarok,  and St. John's Island.

Members are aware, this  status\r\n\r\nwas   agreed   to   at  the  Singapore  Constitutional\r\n\r\nConference held in London in 1957, and is embodied  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 51 of the Report of that Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present Singapore citizenship has only a local\r\n\r\nstatus  and significance, and it will not possess  any\r\n\r\ninternational  status  and  significance   until   the\r\n\r\nBritish  Nationality Act, 1948, is amended  to  confer\r\n\r\nthe  status  of  a  British subject  and  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncitizen on a Singapore citizen. This amendment,  which\r\n\r\nis  embodied in the State of Singapore Act, only comes\r\n\r\ninto  force when the State of Singapore Act comes into\r\n\r\noperation.   This,   in   effect,   means   that   the\r\n\r\ninternational status of Singapore citizenship will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  when  the  new Constitution  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncomes into being. This amending\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance, therefore, will not itself be brought  into\r\n\r\noperation until the appointed day for the introduction\r\n\r\nof the new Constitution or immediately thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the combined effect of clauses 2 (b) and 3 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  to provide that a citizen of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshall,  by virtue of that citizenship, have the status\r\n\r\nof  a  British  subject and Commonwealth citizen,  and\r\n\r\nalso  expressly to confer this status on a citizen  of\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom and Colonies and a citizen of  any\r\n\r\ncountry other than the State of Singapore for the time\r\n\r\nbeing  included in subsection (3) of section 1 of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Nationality Act, 1948. It is considered  more\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  that this common status of  citizens  of\r\n\r\nother  Commonwealth  countries  should  be  explicitly\r\n\r\nconferred   in   Singapore  law   by   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship Ordinance itself than by simply relying on\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the British Nationality Act,  1948,\r\n\r\nto make this common status operative in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 of the Bill, the proposed amendment of\r\n\r\nsection   8  (2)  of  the  Ordinance  is  a  necessary\r\n\r\ncorollary  to  clauses 2 and 3 of the  Bill.  As  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers are aware, under section 8 (2), on a basis  of\r\n\r\nreciprocity,  the  Singapore Government  may  allow  a\r\n\r\ncitizen of any Commonwealth country or the Republic of\r\n\r\nIreland to be registered as a citizen of Singapore  on\r\n\r\nthe  same conditions as citizens of the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nand  Colonies  are registered. Since upon  the  coming\r\n\r\ninto force of the new Constitution, Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwill  also be Commonwealth citizens, section 8 (2)  is\r\n\r\nbeing  amended  to make it clear that this  subsection\r\n\r\ndoes not apply to Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opportunity has also been taken to make\r\n\r\ncertain  other  amendments to  the  parent  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThese  are mainly of an administrative nature and  are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintended  to rectify those provisions to the Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  proved  from  experience  to  raise\r\n\r\ncertain difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (c) introduces a definition of \"reside\" and\r\n\r\nis  intended  to avoid conflicting interpretations  of\r\n\r\nthe meaning of residence in Singapore for the purposes\r\n\r\nof this Ordinance and of the Immigration Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Ordinance provides for the\r\n\r\nregistration   of  births  of  persons  born   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  substantiate claims to  citizenship  by\r\n\r\ndescent under section 5 of the Ordinance at the office\r\n\r\nof  an  official  representative of Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry of birth or, where there is no such office, at\r\n\r\nthe office of the Minister in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 proposes to delete this provision since\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  no representative at present  anywhere\r\n\r\nother than the Trade Commissioner in London, and it is\r\n\r\nintended instead to make provision for registration of\r\n\r\nbirth by post in the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes a small amendment to section 12 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance to make it clear that the Minister refers an\r\n\r\napplication  to the Advisory Committee  only  when  he\r\n\r\ndecides  to refuse the application in the exercise  of\r\n\r\nhis  discretion. Applications which,  on  their  face,\r\n\r\nfail  to qualify under the law will not need to go  to\r\n\r\nthe Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 7 is to tidy up the provisions\r\n\r\nof  section 18 of the Ordinance which deals  with  the\r\n\r\ntreating of periods of absence as periods of residence\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.  The  Minister  already  has  complete\r\n\r\ndiscretion  which is not restricted  by  the  specific\r\n\r\npurposes at present mentioned in the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 (a) is only a drafting amendment which makes\r\n\r\nfor uniformity in expression in respect of sections 22\r\n\r\n(3)  and  (4) of the Ordinance, and clause 8 (b)  also\r\n\r\namends section 22 (4) (b) for the same reason as  that\r\n\r\nwhich I have given in respect of clause 4 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 makes provision for a fine as an alternative\r\n\r\nor  in  addition to imprisonment in the penalty  under\r\n\r\nsection  24  (1)  of the Citizenship Ordinance,  which\r\n\r\ndeals  with  the  making of false statements  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of procuring anything to be done or not to  be\r\n\r\ndone under the Ordinance. At present the punishment is\r\n\r\none of imprisonment only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are the amendments proposed in the Bill, and\r\n\r\nto summarise, they deal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith matters which either are constitutionally\r\n\r\nrequired or seek to clarify the provisions of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as we\r\n\r\nknow,  this amendment is merely just a consequence  of\r\n\r\nthe enactment of the State of Singapore Act. But there\r\n\r\nis one point which I wish the Hon. the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nwill   clarify,  and  that  is  regarding  the  travel\r\n\r\ndocuments.  We cannot deny this as a fact. At  present\r\n\r\nthe  holder  of  Singapore  citizenship  must  have  a\r\n\r\ncertificate of identity in order to travel,  and  even\r\n\r\nif  he wishes to travel to London, he must have a visa\r\n\r\nto  London. And if he is a British subject before  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is  granted,  he  travels  on  a  British\r\n\r\npassport.  I  therefore wish the Chief  Secretary  can\r\n\r\nclarify whether the Government is prepared to issue  a\r\n\r\nSingapore passport for all and not a British  passport\r\n\r\nor a Citizen of Singapore passport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I can deal very briefly with the\r\n\r\npoint raised by the hon. Member for Changi. There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  change  up till now in the  eligibility  for\r\n\r\npassports  as  a  result of the Singapore  Citizenship\r\n\r\nOrdinance. As I explained in moving the Bill,  it  has\r\n\r\nat  present only a local status and significance,  and\r\n\r\nno  international status and significance. All persons\r\n\r\neligible for passports before this Ordinance came  in,\r\n\r\nand  who have acquired the status of citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom and colonies, are still  eligible  for\r\n\r\nBritish  passports. When the State  of  Singapore  Act\r\n\r\ncomes into force on the appointed day, Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  competence to issue its own  passports  and\r\n\r\nwill do so for all Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difficulty which has so far arisen, has arisen\r\n\r\nnot   in   connection  with  the  operation  of   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  that  is the  eligibility  of  Indian\r\n\r\npersons  who have taken out Singapore citizenship  and\r\n\r\nwho  have  thereby lost their eligibility  for  Indian\r\n\r\npassports. That situation will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremedied  when the new Constitution is introduced  and\r\n\r\nthe State of Singapore Act becomes operative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr David].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 16 of 1959)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation\r\n\r\nto move the following motion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $13,500\r\n\r\nshall be supplied to the Government under the heads of\r\n\r\nexpenditure and for the services specified in Schedule\r\n\r\nD contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 16 of 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in its White Paper on Malayanisation Policy, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  stated  that a complete reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Service was in course of being planned. One\r\n\r\nof  the  main  objects  was to  ensure  that  as  many\r\n\r\nMalayans  as  possible should be  enabled,  either  by\r\n\r\npromotion within the service or by recruitment to  the\r\n\r\nservice, to fill posts vacated by expatriate officers.\r\n\r\nThe  general basis for the complete reorganisation  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe public service has been agreed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The large number of salary scales in use for\r\n\r\nofficers in Divisions I-III should be replaced  by\r\n\r\n4  key salary scales for men and 4 key scales  for\r\n\r\nwomen   appropriate  to  candidates  of  different\r\n\r\nacademic  attainments. There should, in  addition,\r\n\r\nbe  a  small number of key salary scales to  which\r\n\r\nofficers, after their first appointment, could  be\r\n\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A new simplified salary structure for Division\r\n\r\nIV  officers,  consisting of 17 key scales,  which\r\n\r\nhad  been  agreed  with  the  Staff  Side  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Civil Service Joint Council in 1957  and\r\n\r\nimplemented for the great majority of Division  IV\r\n\r\nofficers  should be applied to the  remaining  few\r\n\r\n(except the Police) who had been omitted from  the\r\n\r\nmain revision for various reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of these proposals have been completed and\r\n\r\napproved  by the Assembly.

The  revision  and  rationalisation  of\r\n\r\nsalary scales in Division IV as contained in Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper  No.  Cmd.  43  of  1957 was  approved  on  16th\r\n\r\nOctober,  1957.  The General Executive Service  Scheme\r\n\r\nwas  contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 5  of  1958\r\n\r\nand  approved by the Assembly on the 24th April, 1958.\r\n\r\nThe  revision of the salaries of Revenue  Officers  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Customs Department in Division IV was implemented\r\n\r\nin Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 23 of 1958 and approved by\r\n\r\nthe Assembly on\r\n\r\n13th August, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to implement the revision of salary\r\n\r\nscales  of  the  other categories in  Division  IV  in\r\n\r\nrespect of:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Officers in the technical grades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Open vote employees such as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Tan Tock Seng employees, who are 604 in number,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) School servants and others in aided schools, who are 701 in number, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Government employees, who number about 200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  were left out in the original review  in  1957\r\n\r\nreferred to above pending examination of their status.\r\n\r\nThe  details  of  these  revisions  are  set  out   in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparagraphs  3  and 4 and Schedule A of  the  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper, and have been agreed with the Staff Side of the\r\n\r\nJoint Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Department is mainly staffed by officers\r\n\r\nwho  can  seek  their advancement in  that  department\r\n\r\nalone,  i.e. they are not in the Common User Services.\r\n\r\nit is not necessary that they should have professional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualifications  and,  for this  reason,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nspecial  difficulty  in devising  Schemes  of  Service\r\n\r\nwhich  allow able men to reach the higher posts.  They\r\n\r\nbear   comparison  with  officers   in   the   General\r\n\r\nExecutive,   General  Clerical  Officer  and   General\r\n\r\nClerical Assistant Services in respect of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  duties.  On  this  basis,  comparable\r\n\r\nSchemes  of Service have accordingly been agreed  with\r\n\r\nrepresentative staff associations, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Officers Service,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revenue Officers (Senior) Service,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revenue Officers (Lower) Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  salary  scales used in these three  Services  are\r\n\r\nthose used in their counterpart Common User Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, an extensive examination of the\r\n\r\nduties of Customs Officers was undertaken, and  it  is\r\n\r\nanticipated that by a more economical use  of  Customs\r\n\r\nOfficers a considerable saving in expenditure will  be\r\n\r\npossible  in future. No additional funds are, however,\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a complete revision of the salaries of all\r\n\r\nmedical  personnel is contemplated, it has been  found\r\n\r\nexpedient   to   deal  first  with  Nurses,   Hospital\r\n\r\nAssistants and related grades. An extensive survey  of\r\n\r\nthe  working conditions and terms of service of  these\r\n\r\ngrades was carried out in 1957 as a result of which it\r\n\r\nbecame    apparent    that   a    very    considerable\r\n\r\nreorganisation was necessary. For many years prior  to\r\n\r\nthat  date,  a  grade  of officer  known  as  Hospital\r\n\r\nAssistant  had  been  employed on  a  multiplicity  of\r\n\r\nduties  connected  with hospital  work.  Their  duties\r\n\r\nincluded   nursing,   dispensing,   laboratory   work,\r\n\r\nhospital  administration, storekeeping,  etc.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen   found  under  modern  conditions  that  it   is\r\n\r\nimpossible  for a man liable to such varied employment\r\n\r\nto  become  proficient at any  one  duty,  and  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore decided that the Hospital Assistants Service\r\n\r\nshould  be  broken up and its members transferred,  so\r\n\r\nfar   as   possible,   to  the  Specialised   Services\r\n\r\nappropriate   to   the  duties  they   were   actually\r\n\r\nperforming.   Some  Hospital  Assistants  nevertheless\r\n\r\nremain   who  cannot  be  transferred  to  Specialised\r\n\r\nServices on account of differences in training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services to which Hospital Assistants are to be\r\n\r\ntransferred are those which deal with laboratory work,\r\n\r\ndispensing and nursing. At the same time,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the  reorganisation  of  the  Hospital  Assistants\r\n\r\nService   is   effected,  it  is  also  desirable   to\r\n\r\nreorganise  the  services to  which  they  are  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred.  One  of  these  services,  the   Nursing\r\n\r\nService,, is closely related to the Assistant  Nurses,\r\n\r\nMidwives  and  other  Services.  It  has  thus  become\r\n\r\ndesirable  to revise the salaries and Schemes  of  all\r\n\r\nthese related Services in one operation. In the event,\r\n\r\nit  has  been  possible to come to  agreement  on  new\r\n\r\nsalaries and on detailed Schemes of Service for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursing Sisters\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratory Technicians\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Health Inspectors\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispensing Assistants\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midwives\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Technicians\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Nurses\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Nurses\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Assistants, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital Assistants (the residue who cannot be transferred to other Services).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the above reorganisation, in most\r\n\r\ncases,   there   will  be  long-term  economies   when\r\n\r\nrecruitment and promotion is made on the lower  salary\r\n\r\nscales, but from the immediate point of view there are\r\n\r\nadditional  costs. In most cases, there are equivalent\r\n\r\noffset savings and, in all, supplementary provision of\r\n\r\n$13,500 only is required.

I\r\n\r\nbase my assumption on what is contained in Schedule  C,\r\n\r\npage  22,  for example, where at present both male  and\r\n\r\nfemale  nurses,  or assistant nurses are  on  the  same\r\n\r\nsalary  scale  of  $120  to  $190,  there  is   now   a\r\n\r\ndifferentiation as between male and female nurses,  for\r\n\r\nexample, from $170 to $330 per month in respect of male\r\n\r\nnurses, and $160 to $270 per month in respect of female\r\n\r\nnurses. There is also a differentiation, if you turn to\r\n\r\npage  19 - male nurses, as they will now be  called,  and\r\n\r\nstaff nurses on page 23, it appears they are now on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame scale, and there is to be a differentiation in\r\n\r\nfavour of the male nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would like to know the reason which prompted\r\n\r\nthe  Government to make this differentiation. We cannot\r\n\r\naccept the situation that female nurses, of all people,\r\n\r\nshould  be  paid less than their masculine counterpart.\r\n\r\nWhen  one  talks  of  nurses, one naturally  thinks  of\r\n\r\nfemale  nurses - the care, the attention and the devotion\r\n\r\nwhich  women  above all can give to the  sick  and  the\r\n\r\nsuffering.  I  think  there is no  question  that  male\r\n\r\nnurses  come second in our minds as being employed  for\r\n\r\nonly  a  limited  number  of specific  tasks.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, therefore, we oppose this particular  Head  as\r\n\r\nbeing  thoroughly wrong and unjust to the devoted  band\r\n\r\nof  women  who  form  the major  part  of  the  nursing\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the matter raised by the hon.

But it is based  primarily,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, on the responsibilities which attach  to\r\n\r\nthe  male member of the family in maintaining a  family\r\n\r\nas  against his female counterpart. Until such time  as\r\n\r\nthe principle itself is amended and equal pay for equal\r\n\r\nwork   is   accepted  in  the  Government  service   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  do not see that there is any  reason  to\r\n\r\nsingle  out any particular service in order to make  an\r\n\r\nexception to the principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to inquire\r\n\r\nfrom  the Hon. the Chief Secretary whether it is not  a\r\n\r\nfact  that  up  till now there has been equal  pay  for\r\n\r\nequal  service  as  between male and female  nurses  as\r\n\r\nshown in this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> On that, Sir, it was made clear by the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary in moving his motion, that\r\n\r\nthis  has been a cleaning-up exercise in order  to  put\r\n\r\nall  scales appropriately in line with one another, and\r\n\r\nthis has been part of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthe  negotiations with the Staff side of the Singapore\r\n\r\nJoint Council and is agreed with the Staff side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, the Financial Secretary says this is a\r\n\r\ncleaning-up.

If  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect service from a nurse, it is a female nurse  and\r\n\r\nnot a male nurse. If any difference in salary is to be\r\n\r\nkept,  I  think  a  wise  move  on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be to change from \"Male  Nurses\"  to\r\n\r\nsomething else for males.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, as far as I am aware, it is only in\r\n\r\nthe  mental  hospital that male  nurses  are  in  fact\r\n\r\nemployed.

Members</b> will recall that at the last Budget\r\n\r\nsitting, it was forecast that the year would end  with\r\n\r\nrevenue and expenditure balanced at $248 million, with\r\n\r\na deficit of $13 million in the Development Fund and a\r\n\r\ncharge   of   about   $4   million   in   respect   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Compensation, both of which would  have\r\n\r\nto be met from reserve. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneral  revenue balance which stood at $78 million  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of 1957 was estimated to be $83 million at the\r\n\r\nend of 1958, after taking into account on the one hand,\r\n\r\nthe  $20 million which had been received in respect  of\r\n\r\nChristmas  Island  transfer  and  the  appreciation  of\r\n\r\ninvestments,  and on the other hand, deductions  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  meet the deficit in the Development Fund  and\r\n\r\nthe   Malayanisation  Compensation  payment.  The  year\r\n\r\nhowever  ended on a slightly happier note. The  revised\r\n\r\nestimate of revenue at the time of the Budget was  $248\r\n\r\nmillion. It was actually about\r\n\r\n$250  million, an increase of about $2 million, chiefly\r\n\r\naccounted for by an unexpected receipt late in the year\r\n\r\nof   over   $1  million,  which  represent  refund   of\r\n\r\ncontributions  to the M.E.O. after the M.E.O. accounts\r\n\r\nhad  been finalised. The total revised expenditure  was\r\n\r\nthen  $265  million  (which  included  $4  million  for\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Compensation and a contribution  of  $13\r\n\r\nmillion to cover this deficit in the Development Fund).\r\n\r\nAs  it  turned out, the actual expenditure  was  $264.8\r\n\r\nmillion  (which  included $4.7 million  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Compensation  and  $14.3   million   as\r\n\r\nadditional  contribution  to  the  Development   Fund).\r\n\r\nTaking  into  account  the  $20  million  revenue  from\r\n\r\nChristmas Island transfer, there is therefore a surplus\r\n\r\nof about $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again an appreciation of investments to the\r\n\r\nextent  of $3.6 million. Taking this into account,  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  revenue balance as at 31st December, 1958  was\r\n\r\n$87 million, instead of the estimated $83 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Assembly is dissolved at the end of this\r\n\r\nmonth, there will be a lapse of about two months before\r\n\r\nthe  general elections are held.

It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore proposed to create the following  number\r\n\r\nof new posts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 40 graduate teachers,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 50 teachers of vernacular languages,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) 102 Probationer teachers in the Malay schools, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) ancillary staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated cost of the additional staff is\r\n\r\n$453,090.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates there are eight\r\n\r\napplications  for supplementary provision amounting  to\r\n\r\n$1,471,325, and five applications for revotes amounting\r\n\r\nto  $416,154. Taking the revotes first, there is a  big\r\n\r\nitem relating to the purchase of equipment and fittings\r\n\r\nfor  the Polytechnic. The orders were placed last  year\r\n\r\nand   the  payment  cannot  be  met  from  this  year's\r\n\r\nprovision since these purchases are not included in the\r\n\r\nprovision   which   is   meant   for   the   additional\r\n\r\nrequirements  to be purchased this year.  A  revote  is\r\n\r\ntherefore required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional provision of $120,000 is required for the\r\n\r\nthree  District Councils which have been set up in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the year, so that the essential health and\r\n\r\nother  works can be carried out during the  next  three\r\n\r\nmonths.  It will, of course, be appreciated that  until\r\n\r\nthe organisations have started work and have taken over\r\n\r\ncertain  former city areas it would not be possible  to\r\n\r\nassess  the minimum requirements. Provision of  $30,000\r\n\r\nis required for each of the three District Councils for\r\n\r\nimprovement and expansion of works in the rural  areas.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a  number of proposals for small  amenities\r\n\r\nwhich  uplift  the morale of kampong and  rural  folks.\r\n\r\nThey include minimum drainage works which involve-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the placing of culverts, the cutting and widening of drains;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the removal of stagnant water;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the provision of bore holes for sanitation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the levelling of bridle paths and foot paths;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) clearing of streams and canals; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) a host of such similar works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  addition, $15,000 each is required for the  Katong\r\n\r\nDistrict  and  Serangoon  District  Councils  for   the\r\n\r\npurchase of a vehicle for town cleansing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original 1959 Estimates, in keeping with the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  a standstill budget, capital  grants  to\r\n\r\nschools  were limited to revotes of sum voted  in  1958\r\n\r\nbut not used. This has not proved practicable and there\r\n\r\nhave  arisen four urgent cases which will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  consideration now. The reasons for their urgency\r\n\r\nare  given  in pages 15 and 16 of the Sessional  Paper.\r\n\r\nThe  total  amount involved is $302,225. It  should  be\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  Government is contributing  towards\r\n\r\nhalf  the total cost and for each one built or rebuilt,\r\n\r\nthe Government will have one less to build.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we come to the item relating to the\r\n\r\nModernisation and Construction of Division IV Quarters.\r\n\r\nA number of proposals have been put up to implement the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  constructing  institutional  quarters   for\r\n\r\nGovernment officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are to be carried out in phases, and following\r\n\r\nthe need for economy in the middle of last year  it\r\n\r\nwas decided to put a stop to a number of them, some\r\n\r\nof which would have been built but for this freeze.\r\n\r\nNo   provision  has  therefore  been  made  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  for the construction of new quarters  or\r\n\r\nrenovation  of existing ones except in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthose  works  which were in construction  in  1958.\r\n\r\nThese  deferred proposals have been transferred  to\r\n\r\nAppendix DK in the Estimates, a number of which are\r\n\r\nmeant   for   the  Division  IV  employees.

And when they approach the  O.C. of  any\r\n\r\npolice  station, they are told, \"I am sorry, we do  not\r\n\r\nhave enough men to patrol the area.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not long ago I led a delegation of farmers from\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai. They all belonged to the Singapore Rural\r\n\r\nResidents  Association. It had been  reported  to  this\r\n\r\nAssociation by many members that poultry, fruit  trees,\r\n\r\nvegetables and eggs were being plucked or taken away in\r\n\r\nbroad daylight by someone who was daring enough to walk\r\n\r\ninto  their gardens. When they asked him why,  he  just\r\n\r\nshowed  his arm, and said, \"This is my fist.  I  demand\r\n\r\nthose things.\" It was reported to the O.C. of Joo Chiat\r\n\r\nPolice Station, Mr Ong Kian Tong, accordingly. We  had\r\n\r\na  frank and thorough discussion. We indeed owe Mr Ong\r\n\r\nKian  Tong  a debt. After the interview, the delegation\r\n\r\nwas  quite satisfied. But the fact is this. The  Police\r\n\r\npatrol still could not cope with the daily increase  of\r\n\r\nthefts,   house-breakings  and  gang  fights  in   that\r\n\r\nparticular  area. The reason is simple.  There  was  an\r\n\r\nExposition  going on at Kallang Airport, and  therefore\r\n\r\nthere was a shortage of staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is quite clear now, especially since\r\n\r\nthe  election  is  approaching. We know  that  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  dirty  politicians  try  to  make  use   of\r\n\r\ngangsters. We expect that the crime wave will  increase\r\n\r\nand  not decrease. And yet at this juncture, the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary   thinks   fit   to   disband   the   Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  who  have been well trained  since  1945.\r\n\r\nSir, the note says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Special Constabulary was raised in 1945 as an\r\n\r\ninterim  measure to maintain law and order  whilst  the\r\n\r\nRegular   Police   Force  was  being  reorganised   and\r\n\r\ntrained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the subhead Special Constabulary, we see\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  been well trained  for  such  a  long\r\n\r\nperiod, and yet it is thought fit to disband it at this\r\n\r\njuncture when the country is in need of their services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary  must give us an assurance and a satisfactory\r\n\r\nexplanation as to why he is confident that the  present\r\n\r\npolice  force is sufficient to maintain law  and  order\r\n\r\ndespite  the  fact  that the crime wave  is  increasing\r\n\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a further suggestion. Why does the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  not consider another point, to make  use  of\r\n\r\nour  own  people?  Train  them and  encourage  them  to\r\n\r\norganise a Home Guard in every kampong and every street\r\n\r\nto  fight the organised gangsters. With the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  we  will  have  our  own  Home  Guard\r\n\r\npatrolling our own streets. It will not only save a lot\r\n\r\nof  money  but  it will also raise the  morale  of  our\r\n\r\npeople. In other words, there will be true co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween the police and the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish the Hon.

There is no denying this  fact.\r\n\r\nYou  read  the newspaper every day and you find  crimes \r\n\r\n- stabbing  cases, gang fights. In view of  these  crime\r\n\r\nincreases,   it   is  my  opinion  that   the   Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary should not be disbanded because the police\r\n\r\nshould  know by now (I have said that in the  Assembly)\r\n\r\nthat  there is discontent and disappointment among  the\r\n\r\nrank  and file of the police force. This is one of  the\r\n\r\ndiscontents. These people, given guard duties to patrol\r\n\r\nthe  streets  of  Singapore, have  to  look  after  and\r\n\r\nprotect the people of Singapore. Sometimes they have to\r\n\r\nface dangers, and yet the Government see fit that these\r\n\r\npeople should be disbanded. I am really surprised, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know why crimes have been increasing.\r\n\r\nExperienced police officers in the various divisions of\r\n\r\nthe police force, who have the experience and knowledge\r\n\r\nof  all  the secret society members operating in  their\r\n\r\nparticular areas, have been transferred to another area\r\n\r\nat  the  whim and fancy of the senior police  officers.\r\n\r\nThe  removal  of  these experienced detective  officers\r\n\r\nfrom a division where they know the members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the secret societies operating in that area, is only\r\n\r\nto  encourage  the members of the secret  societies  to\r\n\r\ncome out into the open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have another item - to retrench the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary.

They should, as a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, be absorbed into the  regular  Police\r\n\r\nForce, as I feel that they have the experience to be in\r\n\r\nthe Force itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12 noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, both the Member for Changi and the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tiong Bahru spoke with a certain amount  of\r\n\r\nheat,  but I am really not at all clear what  they  are\r\n\r\ngrumbling about because what the Financial Secretary is\r\n\r\ndoing on this motion is asking for additional money  in\r\n\r\norder  that I can keep these Special Constables on  and\r\n\r\nnot disband them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is explained under the item, the intention has\r\n\r\nalways been - the hon.

I have already quoted so many examples to\r\n\r\nprove  to  you that many officers in charge  of  police\r\n\r\nstations  have always complained about the shortage  of\r\n\r\nhands. I am, of course, thankful to the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  for explaining that this item was  passed  at\r\n\r\nthe Budget sittings last year, but the situation now is\r\n\r\nquite changed, as has just been mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tiong Bahru. He says that crimes are increasing and\r\n\r\nthat  the people are getting worried. We know  so  many\r\n\r\nreasons coupled with that. Therefore, my purpose is  to\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to raise a larger Police Force  to\r\n\r\nmaintain law and order.

Now,  similar\r\n\r\nconditions apply to this Head - Prisons. I am  sure  this\r\n\r\nHouse  will  agree with me that the Borstal system  has\r\n\r\nreally  worked very well. We are more than  pleased  to\r\n\r\nhave  spent  more  money on this  Borstal  scheme,  but\r\n\r\nunfortunately, Sir, the Government have failed  in  one\r\n\r\nimportant  point.  Although  they  have  succeeded   in\r\n\r\nreforming  and  training  such  prisoners,   have   the\r\n\r\nGovernment any plans for them after they have completed\r\n\r\ntheir sentences? On one occasion, I had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  spend a solid six hours in Changi Prison. I had  my\r\n\r\nlunch  inside the Prison and I talked to quite a number\r\n\r\nof  prisoners. There is a common worry and  fear  among\r\n\r\nthem. It is employment after leaving the Prison. I will\r\n\r\ncharge  the Government to look into this point  and  do\r\n\r\nsomething  for them. The Government should  concentrate\r\n\r\non  the Borstal scheme and train and reform them. After\r\n\r\nhe  has completed his sentence, the prisoner walks  out\r\n\r\nof  the prison. Where does he go to? Will he go back to\r\n\r\nsociety  with,  he  thinks, equal status  with  others?\r\n\r\nBecause the Government do not take much notice of  him,\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore pay little attention to whether\r\n\r\nthe Borstal system can really work and train and reform\r\n\r\nhim.  The  prisoner  is not a life-long  prisoner.  The\r\n\r\nconvict  is not a life-long convict. It is the  general\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the  people, and it is  the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to give more employment opportunities  for\r\n\r\nthe prisoners.

I am not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  he meant that they should be lumped  together,\r\n\r\nor whether he intended to talk purely on the subject of\r\n\r\nthis application for supplementary provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to inmates of the Borstal Institute, they\r\n\r\nare  invariably  released provided  they  are  of  good\r\n\r\nbehaviour for some considerable time before the  expiry\r\n\r\nof  their  sentences, and during  that  time  they  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  report and a very close eye  is  kept  on\r\n\r\nthem.  I  know of no case in which a boy in  a  Borstal\r\n\r\ninstitution  has  been released from  that  institution\r\n\r\nwithout  being suitably placed. If the hon.

Members will recollect that two big fires took place in Singapore\r\n\r\nduring the last one year. The first fire broke out at Kampong Koo Chye (Lorong\r\n\r\n3, Geylang) on 5th April, 1958, and destroyed over 100 huts and rendered 379 families,\r\n\r\nwhich comprised 2,050 persons, homeless. 172 families have been accommodated in the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. flats in the old Kallang Airport site and 12 families in Queenstown at subsidised rents.\r\n\r\nThe others are residing with friends and relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of rehabilitation has been completed and it is proposed to complete the\r\n\r\nsecond and final phase, by constructing flats for sale to these fire victims. It is estimated\r\n\r\nthat the cost of each flat would be about $5,000 and any victim who wishes to purchase a\r\n\r\nflat must pay $500 as the first deposit and thereafter pay $50 per mensem for about seven years. A lease \r\n\r\nof 60 years at a nominal rental of $1 per year will be granted. Of 308 applications for the purchase\r\n\r\nof these flats, involving 323 families, only 186 families can afford to pay on the terms agreed.\r\n\r\nThe others, including those who do not apply for the purchase of these flats, have asked that\r\n\r\npart of the money collected from the public amounting to about $192,000 be distributed to them, as \r\n\r\nit would be unfair that their share of the money be given to subsidise the cost of buildings which\r\n\r\nwould eventually be purchased by those who could afford to pay. There are 193 families or about 1,000 persons\r\n\r\nwho do not wish to have the flats. Distribution to them will involve a sum of about $90,000 and this will\r\n\r\nbe paid out of the sum of slightly over $90,000 which has been donated to the Department of Social \r\n\r\nWelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to build 190 two-room flats at the cost of $873,000. The City Council will hand over\r\n\r\nto Government a sum of $202,000 comprising:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) contribution from public - $102,000\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) City Council donation - $100,000\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>The Government will contribute $102,000 on a dollar from dollar basis, and this amount has been \r\n\r\nobtained under Head 25 in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 17 of 1959 and will in addition provide the \r\n\r\nbalance of $569 towards the cost of this project. It has since been learnt that the contribution from the\r\n\r\npublic received by the City Council amounts to $106,000. It is, of course, too late to ask for this additional\r\n\r\n$4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T will be asked to construct these flats for sale.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fire at Kampong Tiong Bahru broke out on the 13th February, 1959. It has devastated an area\r\n\r\nof 29 acres and the memories of this diaster are still fresh in the minds of the hon. Members to require\r\n\r\nany repetition. With the assistance of all concerned, the first phase for the rehabilitation of the \r\n\r\nvictims has been completed. A total of 492 two-room flats and 239 one-room flats of the S.I.T. have been \r\n\r\nallocated to 5,023 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thought that the correct long-term solution to the problem at hand would be to develop the site to\r\n\r\nprovide a better standard of accommodation for the victims and to prevent a recurrence of this kind of \r\n\r\ndisaster in the area. It is therefore proposed to acquire the site and ask the S.I.T. to build low cost houses\r\n\r\nfor rental to the victims. The development will be carried out in three phases. Phase I will cover the\r\n\r\nconstruction of 240 tow-room units on the lower portion of the site. The overall cost of each unit will be about $2,500\r\n\r\nincluding site works. The structure will be simple but durable and wooden slabs and concrete blocks will \r\n\r\nbe used. Phases II and III will cover the development of the higher portions of the site. It involves \r\n\r\nthe construction of 500 two-room units in 7-storey buildings containing units exactly similar in plan to \r\n\r\nthose in Phase I, but having balcony access on each floor. The estimated cost per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunit would be $5,000 or $2,500 per single room. The additional cost in this case is accounted for by the need for piling, modern \r\n\r\nsanitation and other ancillary works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of acquiring the site will be about $1.5 million. It is estimated that Phase I will cost\r\n\r\n$600,000 and each of Phases II and III $1.25 million. An additional cost of $200,000 will be involved\r\n\r\nin making up access roads from Kim Tian Road and other miscellaneous works. The estimated total cost\r\n\r\nwill be $4.8 million in respect of which supplementary provision application is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Council of Social Services has started the Kampong Tiong Bahru Relief Fund which closed on the\r\n\r\n13th March with about $600,000 from contributions from the public. It is proposed to distribute these\r\n\r\nproceeds to the fire victims. This will be in addition to $26,100 already paid out by the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council has decided to donate $100,000 together with contributions of $38,000 collected from the\r\n\r\npublic towards this Fund. The U.K. Government has also donated $42,850. This total sum of $180,850 will be utilised towards the cost of\r\n\r\nthe building and the Government expenditure will thereby be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. will again be asked to carry out this scheme and will assist in the other administrative\r\n\r\nwork on behalf of Government. The other financial arrangements such as the amount of rents to be charged\r\n\r\nand maintenance costs, etc. are being worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir. I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Members to a change in the Head of\r\n\r\nExpenditure in the printed Sessional Paper as compared with the cyclostyled copy which was first\r\n\r\ncirculated to Members.

Here, for Kampong Koo Chye, on\r\n\r\na rather comparable site but probably less space taken up, we are going to pay something around $4,600 -\r\n\r\nabout $300 more - and for Tiong Bahru, the cost came to $5,000.

They request that instead of having two flats, one above the other, it\r\n\r\nwould be a better idea to have one two-storey house for each family. In making this request, they were not asking\r\n\r\nfor bigger and better accommodation. The accommodation could be on the same area of about 500 square feet\r\n\r\nper house. At the present moment, each flat occupying about 500 square feet will consist of two rooms, a kitchen and latrine;\r\n\r\nbut if these two rooms are placed above the other, then each family will have their own house with their own staircase.\r\n\r\nI recommend this suggestion to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be much obliged if the Financial Secretary can inform thos House\r\n\r\nof the approximate cost per square foot of the land for acquiring the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I assume that the hon.

This file, I understand, is a file of the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department, in the name of Mr Chew Swee Kee. This\r\n\r\nis  what the Member for Tanjong Pagar said. I refer  to\r\n\r\nHansard, column 2153, of the 4th March:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Financial Secretary said yesterday that Mr Chew\r\n\r\nnever  saw  Mr  Holloway.

And in column 2155 he continued to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, the facts are there. First, for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary, we will just tell him that  we\r\n\r\nhave got all the cards on the table.

It is rather surprising how the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Tanjong  Pagar  was  able  to  get   that\r\n\r\ninformation recorded in a confidential file. As far  as\r\n\r\nI  know,  all  files  or documents of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment are considered confidential. There must have\r\n\r\nbeen then some leakage in that Department, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of the Income Tax Department is to receive\r\n\r\naccounts  from  either  firms or  individuals  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  assessing  income tax,  and  not  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  exposing the contents of any  confidential\r\n\r\ndocuments  or information to any political Party.  Such\r\n\r\naccounts,  I  say  again,  should  be  treated  in  the\r\n\r\nstrictest confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote section 6 of Chapter 166 of the Laws of\r\n\r\nthe Colony, which refers to the Income Tax Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"6.-(l) Every person having any official duty or\r\n\r\nbeing employed in the administration of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>which is the Income Tax Ordinance-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"shall regard and deal with all documents,\r\n\r\ninformation, returns, assessment lists and copies of\r\n\r\nsuch lists relating to the income or items of the\r\n\r\nincome of any person, as secret and confidential, and\r\n\r\nshall make and subscribe a declaration in the form\r\n\r\nprescribed to that effect before the Comptroller or a\r\n\r\nMagistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every person having possession or control over any\r\n\r\ndocuments, information, returns or assessment lists  or\r\n\r\ncopies of such lists relating to the income or items of\r\n\r\nincome  of  any person, who at any time otherwise  than\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of this Ordinance or with the express\r\n\r\nauthority of the Governor-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) communicates or attempts to communicate such\r\n\r\ninformation   or   anything  contained   in   such\r\n\r\ndocuments,  returns,  lists  or  copies   to   any\r\n\r\nperson; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suffers or permits any person to have access to\r\n\r\nany  such information or to anything contained  in\r\n\r\nsuch documents, returns, lists or copies,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall be guilty of an offence against this Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really shocking, when we read that section of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance, how the Member for Tanjong Pagar got his\r\n\r\ninformation.

We also want the highest quality\r\n\r\nand  efficiency in the public service, and I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure  we also want discipline and loyalty in the public\r\n\r\nservice.  This aim, I believe, is shared by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar. It was he himself on the 4th of this\r\n\r\nmonth  who  said  that he required  it.  I  will  quote\r\n\r\nHansard, col. 2118, what he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...we expect and will enforce high standards of\r\n\r\nefficiency, discipline and loyalty to the service,...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is what the Member for Tanjong Pagar and his Party\r\n\r\nexpect if they come into power, and it is going to be a\r\n\r\nvery, very big \"if\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as officers of the Income Tax Department, it is\r\n\r\ntheir  duty  to  safeguard any secret  or  confidential\r\n\r\ninformation entrusted to that Department. This  leakage\r\n\r\nhas  caused much anxiety and has seriously affected the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  the general public in that  Department.\r\n\r\nThe public now feel that the Department cannot maintain\r\n\r\nsecrecy as required by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I am aware. Sir, every officer who joins the\r\n\r\nDepartment will have to sign an oath of secrecy. I have\r\n\r\ngot  a  form  here  which I am told every  officer,  on\r\n\r\njoining  the Department, will have to sign.  This  form\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My attention has been drawn to the Official Secrets\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Chapter 84, Laws of the Colony of Singapore)\r\n\r\nand in particular to Section 5 thereof which relates to\r\n\r\nthe safeguarding of official information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

I further understand that any breach or neglect of\r\n\r\nthis  undertaking  is a disciplinary offence,  and  may\r\n\r\nalso render me liable to prosecution under the Official\r\n\r\nSecrets Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every officer who joins that Department is fully\r\n\r\naware  that any information that he gathers  should  be\r\n\r\ntreated in the strictest confidence, and if that be the\r\n\r\ncase,  how  come  then, may I again mention,  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar got his information? From what\r\n\r\nE  can  see,  this is a clear indication of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy - to  plant stooges here and there, to  infiltrate\r\n\r\nhere  and there. We have evidence, Sir, that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave,  during  the  past year, infiltrated  into  trade\r\n\r\nunion    organisations,   and   even   schools.    Such\r\n\r\ninfiltration  has  caused a a  lot  of  labour  unrest,\r\n\r\ndamage  to  the  schools, and  even  strikes.  We  have\r\n\r\nexperienced so many strikes during these few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the elections coming nearer and nearer, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  no other ways of infiltrating  into  such\r\n\r\norganisations  than into the civil service.  They  know\r\n\r\nthat  they  do  not have the strength, and  their  only\r\n\r\nthought now is to infiltrate into the civil service  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be able to get information  from  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  and use this information against  their\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents. As I said, Sir, secrecy  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  and  should  be  kept  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  Unless the public have faith  that  the\r\n\r\nofficers  of  any  department  of  the  Government  can\r\n\r\nmaintain  secrecy,  I am sure the public  will  not  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pass  on information. Then  how  can  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Department be able to assess properly income\r\n\r\ntax? The Department cannot do so unless the public  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  submit proper income  tax  accounts.  The\r\n\r\npublic  have  no  faith because the  Department  cannot\r\n\r\nmaintain  secrecy. How then can the Department  collect\r\n\r\nthe revenue arising out of income tax?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leakage has not only caused worry to the public\r\n\r\nbut  also  amongst business circles. We are aware  that\r\n\r\nmost  people  or  small  businesses  depend  for  their\r\n\r\nbusiness on credit from big firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  if  the Department cannot maintain secrecy  where\r\n\r\nsuch  accounts are concerned and if any creditor  comes\r\n\r\nto know of the account of a firm or small business that\r\n\r\nis  not making any profit, I am quite sure the creditor\r\n\r\nwill  withdraw his credit account and that  will  incur\r\n\r\nmore  suffering or more misery to the small firms. Such\r\n\r\nsmall  firms depend on credit so that they can maintain\r\n\r\ntheir business. Are we going to cause more hardship  to\r\n\r\nsuch  people?  Certainly not, because  if  business  is\r\n\r\nclosed down, there will not be any employment, even for\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. stooges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk of corruption here and there, Sir. As far as\r\n\r\nI can make out, there are four types of corruption:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Monetary corruption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Political corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Power corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Confidence corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in this particular case, within the four, there\r\n\r\nare two kinds of corruption. The P.A.P. are politically\r\n\r\ncorrupt because they try to influence the civil service\r\n\r\nto  get  information so that they can  use  it  against\r\n\r\ntheir political opponents; and second is the breach  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  by a civil servant or servants  in  leaking\r\n\r\nout such information, which is not proper on their part\r\n\r\nto spill to a political party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the four kinds of corruption, these two are the\r\n\r\nworst forms of corruption, it is rather fortunate, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the whole civil service is not involved  in  this\r\n\r\ncase  because, by this leakage, it is very  lucky  that\r\n\r\nSingapore could have the damage exposed very early.  If\r\n\r\nwe  do not find out such leakage, I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. will infiltrate more into the civil service\r\n\r\nand  then  it will cause damage to the whole reputation\r\n\r\nof  the  civil  service. As I have said, not  only  the\r\n\r\npublic  but  business  circles are  worried  over  this\r\n\r\nleakage.  The  whole civil service is also  worried  by\r\n\r\nsuch  leakage.  How then, Sir, can  we  have  a  strong\r\n\r\nGovernment  if politicians and civil servants  who  are\r\n\r\nentrusted with secret information and documents  cannot\r\n\r\nmaintain  secrecy?  It  was  evident  recently  that  a\r\n\r\npolitician,  who  was  regarded  as  the  most   honest\r\n\r\nMinister in the Cabinet, had leaked out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidential or secret information which was passed  to\r\n\r\nhim by a colleague.

I must  warn\r\n\r\nall civil servants to be on the lookout for such power-corrupt  politicians. Unless they are on the  look-out,\r\n\r\nthey  may ask for trouble. For the purpose of obtaining\r\n\r\ninformation,  politicians  or  political  parties   may\r\n\r\npromise  heaven  and  earth, and when  they  come  into\r\n\r\npower, will they give that heaven and earth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already seen this happening in the City\r\n\r\nCouncil. The Chief Administrative Officer, Mr  Marcus,\r\n\r\nwas  promised  heaven  and  earth  and  was  called  or\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be  the best and the  highest  esteemed\r\n\r\nofficer in the City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Today, we have Marcus vs. Mayor Ong  in  the\r\n\r\nCity Council. Is that what it should be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that no political Party should influence the\r\n\r\ncivil service in order to obtain secret or confidential\r\n\r\ninformation,  and, at the same time, no  civil  servant\r\n\r\nshould  disclose any secret or confidential information\r\n\r\nto a political Party and expect promotion if that Party\r\n\r\ncomes  into power. All civil servants should  be  above\r\n\r\nboard  and  above Party politics and be  loyal  to  the\r\n\r\nservice   in   maintaining  the  faith  and  confidence\r\n\r\nentrusted to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure, after what I have said just\r\n\r\nnow,  that  hon. Members in this House,  including  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar, who is a firm  believer\r\n\r\nof loyalty to the service, will join me in deploring in\r\n\r\nthe  strongest terms the leakage of secret  income  tax\r\n\r\ninformation and will wholeheartedly support my motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to second\r\n\r\nthis  motion  standing in the name of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  and I heartily endorse every word  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has every now and\r\n\r\nagain  said  in  this House that he  would  expect  the\r\n\r\nhighest   standard  of  efficiency   from   Government\r\n\r\nservants and absolutely incorruptible standards. We all\r\n\r\nagree  with him there wholeheartedly. And yet, Sir,  he\r\n\r\ngave  us  an exhibition the other day of how he expects\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants to behave should  his  Party  come\r\n\r\ninto  power.  It  is quite clear that under  his  Party\r\n\r\nrule,  every  Government servant would be  expected  to\r\n\r\ngive  every piece of information that would be required\r\n\r\nby  the  Party,  no  matter how secret  it  should  be,\r\n\r\notherwise  he would get into very serious trouble.  How\r\n\r\ncan  he  justify in this House giving the number  of  a\r\n\r\nsecret  file - No. 47909/GS of the Income Tax Department?\r\n\r\nNot only did he mention this secret file number once in\r\n\r\nthis House,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  three  times, and I have been wondering  for  what\r\n\r\npurpose  he did this  - to show to the world that  nothing\r\n\r\nis  sacred to him? How can he, who so blatantly  throws\r\n\r\nhis  weight  about as if he is to be  the  first  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of Singapore in the next election,  have  the\r\n\r\nface  to  give out the file number and the  information\r\n\r\nthat is contained therein?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer I think is that he wants now to threaten\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants so that in the next two months they\r\n\r\nshould bow to his will and give him all the information\r\n\r\nhe  wants, and give them notice that they must  not  do\r\n\r\nanything against what his Party wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let everyone of us in Singapore take heed and be\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept the form of government that  he  or\r\n\r\nshe  can expect if he or she does not exercise  his  or\r\n\r\nher  vote  properly.  These two  months  are  the  most\r\n\r\ncrucial in the history of Singapore. Everybody who does\r\n\r\nnot  think  in the same way as the P.A.P. does  should\r\n\r\ncome  together and have a straight fight - Party against\r\n\r\nParty, ideology against ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the policy of his Party is\r\n\r\nthat  the  end justifies the means. It does not  matter\r\n\r\nhow  you  get  it so long as you get it, it  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter to them how they get into power and how they can\r\n\r\nwin  the election, so long as they do win the election.\r\n\r\nThe  dreadful part of it is that they have  managed  to\r\n\r\nget  information - secret information - from a  person  who\r\n\r\nholds  such  a  high and responsible  position  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front, so that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> S.P.A.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the S.P.A. have nothing to do\r\n\r\nwith it.

We have just heard what the mover and seconder\r\n\r\nof  the motion said. The seriousness of this leakage of\r\n\r\ninformation from an Income Tax official to a  political\r\n\r\nParty,  is  already a well-accepted fact.  It  is  most\r\n\r\nrecoiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what I want to point out to the House is\r\n\r\nthis. It is a waste of time to come here to deplore the\r\n\r\naction  of someone who is so much pleased with what  he\r\n\r\nhas gained. What the people of Singapore would like  to\r\n\r\nknow   is,  what  is  the  position  of  our  political\r\n\r\nsituation today because of this leakage? What  makes  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  officer  risk his career  to  pass  on  the\r\n\r\ninformation?  He  knows very well, when  he  was  first\r\n\r\nemployed by the Income Tax Department, that he  had  to\r\n\r\nsign a declaration form. May I take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nread it aloud:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I, so and so, of address, so and so, do solemnly\r\n\r\ndeclare that I will regard and deal with all documents,\r\n\r\ninformation,  returns, assessment lists and  copies  of\r\n\r\nsuch lists relating to the income or items of income of\r\n\r\nany  person as secret and confidential and that I  will\r\n\r\nnot,  except  in the performance of my duty  under  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Ordinance, 1947, communicate,  attempt  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate  or  suffer or permit the communication  of\r\n\r\nsuch   information  or  anything  contained   in   such\r\n\r\ndocument,  return, list or copies to any  person  other\r\n\r\nthan  the  person  to  whom such document,  return,  or\r\n\r\ninformation  relates or his authorised  representative.\r\n\r\nSigned, So and so. Declared before me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even a magistrate or the Comptroller of Income Tax\r\n\r\nis  required to witness the declaration. I  tried  very\r\n\r\nhard  to find out from the Income Tax Ordinance,  1947,\r\n\r\nwhether  there was a case to exempt this  officer  from\r\n\r\npassing  on information to the P.A.P. and also  whether\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have any right to know such a secret:  but,\r\n\r\nSir, unfortunately, I could find none. There are a  few\r\n\r\nexceptional  cases:  for example, the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nEstate  Duties, the Financial Secretary and the Auditor\r\n\r\ncan  obtain  information. But members  of  a  political\r\n\r\nParty  or  even the Prime Minister of the day  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  know  everything  about  the  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment. It is through the Official\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecrets  Act  that  we  hold  the  confidence  of   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is quite clear now that the secret is\r\n\r\nout. The file number has been quoted by the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar. He even knew of the interview which took\r\n\r\nplace,   although  it  was  denied  by  the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to read certain passages delivered\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar regarding  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"..to remember this.

Keep your politics and your\r\n\r\npersonal views out of your service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  also said that the Hon. the Chief Minister was ill-advised to advise the public service how to oppose  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

What makes this public\r\n\r\nservant think fit to pass on this information? I do not\r\n\r\nhave  the  slightest doubt that it is  because  of  the\r\n\r\ncorruption of money. The I'.A.P. paid out a lump sum to\r\n\r\nthis  officer. I have never the slightest  doubt  about\r\n\r\nthat; and I do not doubt that power corruption is going\r\n\r\non. \"I offer you a quicker promotion if the P.A.P. come\r\n\r\ninto  power and if I can down the S.P.A., the  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\n-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> No!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> \"- and the Lib-Socs: and then I\r\n\r\ncan promote you to be Permanent Secretary even.\" Sir, I\r\n\r\ntried  to  trace  the cause of this leakage,  why  this\r\n\r\npublic servant had to risk such a severe penalty if  he\r\n\r\nwas  discovered, such a risk to his career to  pass  on\r\n\r\ninformation  to the Member for Tanjong  Pagar.  Does  a\r\n\r\nnational emergency require such an important leakage to\r\n\r\nsave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe whole country, Sir? I shall not waste too much time\r\n\r\nby  using  the same words delivered by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar when he pressed for the appointment of  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry. He said in Hansard,  Volume  3,\r\n\r\nNo. 24, the same date, column 2149:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...in view of what the Hon. Mr Chew has done, that\r\n\r\nthere is any doubt as to the truth of what the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. stated, and a Commission of Inquiry  is\r\n\r\ncompletely unnecessary to prove the allegation! that we\r\n\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I am sure that you will notice that the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education was referred to as Mr Chew  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar said fair play  was  not\r\n\r\nvery necessary. I am not interested in a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry, because the truth is the truth and because Mr\r\n\r\nChew  has  already resigned, not only  his  Ministerial\r\n\r\npost but also as a Member of the Assembly and even from\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. Yet the hon. Member thinks fit  to  let  us\r\n\r\nknow  so  much more in detail. He says that it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary. For the national interests. Sir, no. I quote\r\n\r\nfrom Hansard, column 2152:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There was no crime [in other words, about the\r\n\r\n$500,000]. No act of illegality had been committed.  We\r\n\r\nhave  not  accused the Income Tax Department  of  doing\r\n\r\nsomething  irregular. In fact, we  admit  that  if  the\r\n\r\nmoney  was  a  political gift, as we say it  must  have\r\n\r\nbeen, then it is not liable to income tax.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. themselves admitted that receiving\r\n\r\nthe  $500,000  was  neither  a  crime  nor  an  act  of\r\n\r\nillegality.  They  even supported the  fact  that  this\r\n\r\nmoney  was exempted from income tax. And then the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  tried  to advise the Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nSPA., \"Be brave and say, 'Yes, I have got the money. So\r\n\r\nwhat?'\"   Unfortunately,  this  time  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister is not very good. Sir, it is deplorable,\r\n\r\nbecause  this is not a national emergency  demanding  a\r\n\r\nmartyr,  that  our most valuable public service  system\r\n\r\nshould  be destroyed only for political party interests\r\n\r\nand not for the national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is this. What makes the P.A.P. think\r\n\r\nof  going  deeper  and deeper into this  $500,000?  The\r\n\r\nleader of the P.A.P., the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPagar, made a remark that there was no crime and no act\r\n\r\nof illegality. Why do the P.A.P, not tell the truth? We\r\n\r\nknow  there are many intelligent leaders in the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThey  know what the situation is in Singapore. Was  the\r\n\r\nmoney  from  America? Of course, dollars are  remitted\r\n\r\nfrom America. Of course, an American bank is here,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the money is from America. Sir, it is not  so\r\n\r\nsimple as that. The P.A.P. know exactly that the  money\r\n\r\nis  not  from the American Government. I would like  to\r\n\r\ntell  him that the Formosan Government and the Japanese\r\n\r\nGovernment  have for many, many months  gone  into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  how to make Singapore politics  suit  the\r\n\r\nSouth East-Asia Organisation, how to divide our people-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Maybe I\r\n\r\nhave  to  seek  your clarification. I  spoke  on  three\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is this - that the P.A.P. fail to realise\r\n\r\nthe  actual political position of Singapore today. They\r\n\r\nare  merely seeking their Party interests and  not  the\r\n\r\nnational  interests as a whole. That is  the  point  of\r\n\r\nthis motion. If I am wrong, please rule me out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise this. The damage has\r\n\r\nalready been done to the public service. Nobody  doubts\r\n\r\nthat.  I  may quote a further point. Only last Saturday\r\n\r\nnight I had occasion to meet a foreign diplomat. He did\r\n\r\nnot know that I am an Assemblyman but he knew me as  an\r\n\r\naccountant. He is worried about his money. Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nan   open   secret.  The  surrounding   countries   are\r\n\r\ncorrupted, and there are corrupt diplomats and a lot of\r\n\r\ncorrupt  money.  This diplomat saw fit  to  consult  an\r\n\r\naccountant.

He is seeking certain solutions to  help\r\n\r\nme  out.\"  Sir, that is one likely ironical example - how\r\n\r\nmuch  confidence of the taxpayers has been  lost  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this leakage of information from the  Income\r\n\r\nTax Department through the P.A.P. organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conclusion is this, Sir. Since the P.A.P. said\r\n\r\nthat  this $500,000 was neither a crime nor an  illegal\r\n\r\ntransaction and it was exempted from tax, because it is\r\n\r\na  political  gift, they were prepared to withdraw  the\r\n\r\nmotion  calling for the appointment of a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry. They take this matter so lightly. Why? Because\r\n\r\nthey  have  already achieved their political  aim!  But\r\n\r\nthere is one thing I cannot understand - despite all  the\r\n\r\nremarks  in  favour  of  this $500,000 - case,  yet  they\r\n\r\nthought  fit to do nothing about the integrity  of  the\r\n\r\npublic service. That is the thing that should open  the\r\n\r\nminds  of the people of Singapore - to take a close  look\r\n\r\nand  analyse  what  makes the  leader  of  the  P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nSomebody  says, \"A political bankrupt\"; I do not  think\r\n\r\nit  is  true.  The  P.A.P. are the strongest  political\r\n\r\nParty,  but if they are politically corrupt, then  they\r\n\r\nare  power  corrupted. Although they already  have  one\r\n\r\nfoot  in the grave, yet they choose to sacrifice  their\r\n\r\n\"Marcus\", the hero who passed information to the Party.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  thing that worries me much - that  if  our\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders, or our political Parties  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  work along the lines only for party  interests\r\n\r\nand  not for the national interests, then we are really\r\n\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national movement requires the full support of\r\n\r\nthe  masses,  irrespective of whether you are  rich  or\r\n\r\npoor,  whether you are a Malay or a Chinese, or whether\r\n\r\nyou  belong to Party (A) or Party (B). We must all stay\r\n\r\ntogether to work towards full independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through this leakage, the eyes of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are open to the corruptness of the political\r\n\r\nParties  in  Singapore,  politically  corrupt  at   the\r\n\r\nexpense  not  only of the poor Income Tax  officer  who\r\n\r\npassed  out  the  information, but also  of  the  whole\r\n\r\npublic  service  and  the  interests  of  the  national\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sincerely wish the Member for Tanjong Pagar is\r\n\r\nguilt-conscious,  not  only duty  conscious,  and  that\r\n\r\nbeing so,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  has to reply and make a clear statement about  this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if confidential and\r\n\r\nsecret  information leaks out from Government services,\r\n\r\nit  is  certainly  deplorable and should  not  be, and\r\n\r\nproper  action must be taken to see that  it  does  not\r\n\r\noccur  again. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, I do not think\r\n\r\nthat   appointing  a  Commission  of  Inquiry   is   an\r\n\r\nappropriate and proper action in this case.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis  motion is purely a political motion designed  for\r\n\r\npolitical  advantage and prepared to expose  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  in  the interests of political  advantage.  If\r\n\r\nthere  was a genuine desire on the Government  benches,\r\n\r\nif  there  had ever been a genuine desire that leakages\r\n\r\nshould be cleared up, there would have been calls for a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry long, long ago. There  have  been\r\n\r\ncontinuous  allegations  by the  Press -  out  come  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  \"The  Council of  Ministers  this  morning\r\n\r\ndecided   so-and-so.\"   There  have   been   continuous\r\n\r\nallegations  from confidential and secret documents  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministries; there have  been  almost  weekly\r\n\r\nheadlines  in the papers (not even headlines sometimes)\r\n\r\nabout the allegations that leaks have taken place,  and\r\n\r\nyet   this.  Assembly  has  never  in  the  least  been\r\n\r\ninterested. It is only now, when the political heat is\r\n\r\ncoming on, that we show our keen desire that the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  must be properly careful with all its secrets,\r\n\r\nand all secrets must be revealed to a public enquiry in\r\n\r\norder that they may be more secretly kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an enormous number of Commissions of Inquiry\r\n\r\nin  the last few years, relatively enormous compared to\r\n\r\nthe usual practice. I fear that if we go on calling for\r\n\r\nCommissions  of Inquiry, the whole system  will  become\r\n\r\nridiculous. The tendency now is to call for Commissions\r\n\r\nof Inquiry not because there is anything useful that is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  result,, but because it is a sort  of  jest,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  I  am an honest man; he is a crook:  set  up  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry to prove that I am right.\"  That\r\n\r\nis an absurd way of behaving and brings the idea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Commissions of Inquiry into disrepute. If there\r\n\r\nhave  been leaks, then it is for those in the Civil\r\n\r\nService, through the Civil Service, to stop  those\r\n\r\nleaks and to see that they do not occur again,  and\r\n\r\nto see that proper disciplinary action is taken. If\r\n\r\nthere  had  been a leakage it is as  well  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be made known and preferably made known  to\r\n\r\nthe  responsible Departmental Head or the  Minister\r\n\r\nor whoever is concerned in the Civil Service. If it\r\n\r\nis  made  known to the public, well  that  is  less\r\n\r\ndesirable;  in my view to give publicity  does  not\r\n\r\nhelp  anybody.  But certainly if a leak  has  taken\r\n\r\nplace and if an honest citizen gets to know of  it,\r\n\r\nhe  should not keep silent about it. He should  see\r\n\r\nthat  action  is  taken to stop the  leak  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  We  have  on the Government  benches  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary and the Financial  Secretary - as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, the mechanism of the Service - they were\r\n\r\nboth concerned with a leak of this sort, and I have\r\n\r\nno doubt at all that they would have already looked\r\n\r\ninto  it  and  are  capable of  taking  appropriate\r\n\r\naction  to see that such things do not occur again.\r\n\r\nIf  there is a suggestion that they cannot do their\r\n\r\nwork  and the Commission of Inquiry tells them  how\r\n\r\nto  do  it,  that  is a suggestion that  they  are\r\n\r\nincompetent  in  their own jobs - and  that  is  from\r\n\r\ntheir  own  Government supporters  suggesting  that\r\n\r\ntheir own Ministers sitting with them are not  able\r\n\r\nto  keep proper control of the affairs of the Civil\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an enormous number of ways in which leaks\r\n\r\ncan  take  place, and they need not necessarily  be\r\n\r\nmalicious or deliberate ones. I remember some years\r\n\r\nago  I  was quite a new Minister going to the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's Office, just next door to this  Assembly\r\n\r\nHouse, and seeing a secret document being typed  on\r\n\r\na  typing  machine  and then taken  downstairs  for\r\n\r\nduplication in the Public Relations Office in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  building - what I call the Press  Room  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Relations  Office - on  the  duplicating\r\n\r\nmachine  down there. They had not got a duplicating\r\n\r\nmachine upstairs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  had  to go downstairs, and the secret document\r\n\r\nwhich is supposed to be seen by a very particularly\r\n\r\nlimited  number of people, was being duplicated  in\r\n\r\nan  open office with pressmen coming in and out.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know whether they got it, but there were  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  leaks  at  that time  of  quite  secret\r\n\r\ninformation.  Now  in the Chief  Minister's  Office\r\n\r\nthere is a Confidential Registry - the door is to the\r\n\r\nleft   of   the   room  and  marked   \"Confidential\r\n\r\nRegistry\" - supposed  to  be, I  believe,  inviolate.\r\n\r\nNobody   goes   in   except  confidentially-cleared\r\n\r\npeople,  or  people  who have  had  their  security\r\n\r\nchecked.  Nevertheless, I have seen the  door  open\r\n\r\nwith nobody inside and I had heard two men, looking\r\n\r\nfor somewhere quiet to talk, say, \"Now, come on, it\r\n\r\nis all right.\" And in they went and sat down in the\r\n\r\nConfidential  Registry and they had  their  private\r\n\r\nconversation,  because there was no  other  private\r\n\r\nplace  to sit. What was on the table I do not know,\r\n\r\nas  it  was  not  my business. I  am  not  alleging\r\n\r\nanything  about those things. I made mention  about\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties  of maintaining security.  Papers\r\n\r\nhave  got  to be handled here and there:  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous job and there is always a possibility of\r\n\r\na leak. And in what circumstances was there a leak,\r\n\r\nif  there was a leak, about this file? It seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that  somebody has talked out of  turn  and  it\r\n\r\nappears  to me that the thing must be looked  into.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do not see that any advantage to the public\r\n\r\nat  all  can  come from setting up a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  I consider this motion should be dropped;\r\n\r\nI   consider  that  the  Chief  Secretary  and  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary and their Departmental Officers\r\n\r\nshould  take  proper steps to see that  no  further\r\n\r\nleaks  of  this  sort occur; and I think  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  benches  should  find  other  ways   of\r\n\r\nlooking for votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI am horrified at the disclosures from the hon.

If the hon. Member will not\r\n\r\nsubmit  to  the ruling of the Chair, then of course  he\r\n\r\ncannot carry on.

Sir, on  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  inquiry, we must view the matter  from  the\r\n\r\ngravity of the offence. If a certain person is going to\r\n\r\nleak out news that probably will not harm anybody, then\r\n\r\nI  see no reason why that matter should be taken up and\r\n\r\ninvestigated  into. But if a leakage of such  important\r\n\r\ninformation on Income Tax has occurred, it is a  matter\r\n\r\nthat has the whole attention of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nfocused  on it. We in Singapore have always  said,  \"We\r\n\r\nmust  trust  our  Civil  Service.  We  want  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants  to be neutral. We want them to be  efficient.\r\n\r\nWe  want  them to be able to work well !\" On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, we deplore the public for not coming out to  help\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  deplore the people  of  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nsitting  on  the fence; not coming out with information\r\n\r\nto  help the Police to enforce law and order. We  blame\r\n\r\nthem  for  not  passing on information to the  Criminal\r\n\r\nInvestigation Department. But if we have such  leakages\r\n\r\nas  this  from a Department that is sworn  to  secrecy,\r\n\r\nthen  what  will  the public think of coming  out  with\r\n\r\ninformation  to the Government, when in all probability\r\n\r\nthey  will  be discovered by their enemies  the  moment\r\n\r\nthey step out of Government offices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter, Sir, is of a very grave nature, and it\r\n\r\nmust be thoroughly investigated so that the wrong-doers\r\n\r\nare  not  just  told  off and the matter  not  repeated\r\n\r\nagain.  But  they should be punished, and  punished  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  what the law stipulated.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ncase, Sir, where the Members of this House have thought\r\n\r\nto  be of such a serious nature that it must be brought\r\n\r\nup  with  a motion, and I am certain that everybody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is of the same opinion. We do not say: \"If  a\r\n\r\nperson is wrong, well, other people may carry on. If it\r\n\r\nis  wrong  to  leak out information, well, never  mind,\r\n\r\nthere have always been leakages,\" and so on. I think if\r\n\r\nthere  is  something wrong, and we  know  that  it  has\r\n\r\nhappened, we should find ways and means of stopping it.\r\n\r\nWe  should have ways and means not just of stopping  it\r\n\r\nbut  also of protecting ourselves. We depend,  Sir,  on\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax Department to collect  large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  for our expenditure. If the people have no  more\r\n\r\nfaith in the Income Tax Department. I wonder what  will\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to talk about this matter of honour. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that when a person is on oath, when a person  has\r\n\r\nmade a promise to do something, or not to do something,\r\n\r\nit is of very great importance that he should keep that\r\n\r\npromise.  I certainly feel that a person who has  sworn\r\n\r\nto  secrecy and then leaks out all such information  is\r\n\r\ndoing society a great harm. Such actions strike at  the\r\n\r\nvery roots of our democratic society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always have remembered the good words Westerners\r\n\r\nsay  about  the Easterners. I have heard it being  said\r\n\r\nover  and  over  again,  that  if  you  deal  with   an\r\n\r\nEasterner, especially with a Chinese, you can depend on\r\n\r\nhis   word.   His  word  is  as  good  as   any   legal\r\n\r\ndocument - even  better. He will honour it,  even  if  it\r\n\r\nmeans  a  loss  to him. And today, Sir,  we  find  that\r\n\r\nofficers  whom we have engaged to do confidential  work\r\n\r\nleak   out  such  information.  They  shake  the  very\r\n\r\nfoundation  of  our  society!  Where  will  we  end?  I\r\n\r\npersonally feel that we must keep all that is good that\r\n\r\nwe  have. We must not allow political or personal gains\r\n\r\nto  come  in between us, and disregard honour and  good\r\n\r\nfaith. I certainly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeel  that if people are weak in their faith,  weak  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  their promises, we should help them along,  so\r\n\r\nthat they are able to keep up the good old traditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way of the world today, Sir, is always for\r\n\r\noneself,  always for one's Party, and always for  one's\r\n\r\nown  power. What do we get out of that? Why do I  worry\r\n\r\nabout society? Society can go its way - anywhere, so long\r\n\r\nas  I  can get to where I want. If we do not train  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, or rather - because it is a  matter\r\n\r\nof preservation, and not training that we need - if we do\r\n\r\nnot preserve this code of ethics, that we must keep our\r\n\r\npromises,  then  I think we will end up with  something\r\n\r\nvery sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in Singapore and elsewhere stories\r\n\r\nrepeated   in  the  Press,  stories  talked  about   by\r\n\r\ntravellers.  We  have  read that  in  the  Press  where\r\n\r\nParties  not of a democratic nature are ruling, Parties\r\n\r\nlike  the Communist Party to which the P.A.P. say  they\r\n\r\nare  not  opposed, are having another type of ideology,\r\n\r\nanother standard of conduct. We have heard that if  you\r\n\r\nhappen to be students, you may spy on your teachers and\r\n\r\nreport  to the People's Court, and condemn the teachers\r\n\r\nright  off. If you happen to be employees, you  can  go\r\n\r\nalong and condemn your employers publicly. Even if  you\r\n\r\nhappen to be the children of your own father or mother,\r\n\r\nyou  may  go along and condemn them too, and  then  you\r\n\r\nwill be held as heroes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain, Sir, that we do not want such things.\r\n\r\nSociety  must be built on faith, on the faith  that  we\r\n\r\nhave for our own fellowmen, and not on a spying system,\r\n\r\nwhereby  you may not do what you think is right  to  do\r\n\r\nwithout being reported. You have the fear of punishment\r\n\r\nhanging  over your head, not knowing who is friend  and\r\n\r\nwho is foe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a department like the Income Tax Department. I\r\n\r\ncertainly  have  a very low opinion of the  person  who\r\n\r\nleaks  out  such secrets. Such a person is leaking  out\r\n\r\nsecrets to sources or to persons to whom he should  not\r\n\r\nbe  loyal.  I  certainly believe that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar, who offered us all this information, has\r\n\r\na very low opinion of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson who offered such information in order to destroy\r\n\r\nthose  to  whom  he  owes loyalty  or  loyalty  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment he serves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard, Sir, nowadays of what such people will\r\n\r\nreap in the end. We know that it may be of advantage to\r\n\r\nbe  in the favour of the Party that seems to be up  and\r\n\r\ncoming.  But I would like to warn such people, and  all\r\n\r\ncivil servants, that if they are helping people, and by\r\n\r\nhelping them they are disloyal to the Government,  they\r\n\r\nare  not  going  to  go very far. In the  City  Council\r\n\r\ntoday,  Sir, we have seen with our eyes what  happened;\r\n\r\nwe  have heard that Mr Marcus is the founder member of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party. He had been  promoted  one\r\n\r\nstep  after  another until he came up to the  top.  Mr\r\n\r\nMarcus  was  the  best  man  on  earth!  He  was   very\r\n\r\nefficient! He was rendering the people a great service!\r\n\r\nUnder him there should be great progress! Indeed, there\r\n\r\nshould be great progress - the progress of elimination of\r\n\r\nthe people who have done them service and are now of no\r\n\r\nfurther  use! Such will be the fate of all  people  who\r\n\r\nbetray  others in order to have personal gains. Let  me\r\n\r\nsay  here,  Sir,  that  if anybody  should  betray  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  which they owe loyalty, then  the  next\r\n\r\nGovernment that comes in will have no faith in him. And\r\n\r\nif  they  have  no  faith in such a  person,  the  only\r\n\r\nsolution is the word \"go\" - with all the pension  rights\r\n\r\nwashed off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel that honesty, loyalty and all those\r\n\r\nqualities  that we have learned and that  we  feel  are\r\n\r\ndear  to us have always been a part of our civilisation\r\n\r\nand  should be preserved at all costs. Today, with  the\r\n\r\nelections  coming so near, there will  be  many  people\r\n\r\ntrying to take advantage of the situation. There may be\r\n\r\npeople  who  come along to the Assembly to say:  \"Look,\r\n\r\nyou need not worry. We have all the information - all the\r\n\r\nfiles,  whichever number; and we also know  that  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  conferences  behind  the  scenes  with  Mr\r\n\r\nHolloway,   or   with   whoever  is   controlling   any\r\n\r\ndepartment.  Oh, we know even more. You need  not  hide\r\n\r\nfrom   us.   Even   in  other  departments,   we   have\r\n\r\ninformation.

The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry need not tell us any  tale.  We\r\n\r\nknow  even  more  of the plans. We have  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary working for us, Mr K. M. Byrne.\" I have  the\r\n\r\ngreatest of respect for Mr Byrne, but when his name is\r\n\r\nused in such a manner, when he has just left Government\r\n\r\nservice,  it  does give me a feeling that something  is\r\n\r\nnot  quite  right. I wonder, Sir, if a person  were  to\r\n\r\ngive  information  to his Party when  he  is  still  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service,  would  that  be  right?  Is  that\r\n\r\nhonourable?  However, this may not be true.  But  then,\r\n\r\ncoming  from  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar,  I  cannot\r\n\r\ndisbelieve  it. This is getting more and more  serious.\r\n\r\nWe  have heard the Member for Tanjong Pagar say: \"Civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants, keep politics out of your work!\" And  yet  we\r\n\r\nhave heard from him in the same breath: \"We have so-and-so  in  our Party, a founder member, and another member\r\n\r\nin  the Government service, very high in the Government\r\n\r\nservice. They have resigned to contest the elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is wrong to take an active part in politics\r\n\r\nwhile  in  government service, and  yet  these  people,\r\n\r\nalthough they may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  may  not  have taken part in active politics,  have\r\n\r\ncertainly  given information. What has  the  Government\r\n\r\ndone  about  it? This is something worth  investigating\r\n\r\ninto.  But  I certainly hope that the people  who  have\r\n\r\nalways  been respected as civil servants by the  people\r\n\r\nshould keep politics away from their career, and  keep\r\n\r\nthe  information they have at their disposal away  from\r\n\r\npolitics  until such time as they have left  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and taken up politics. Even then, it will  not\r\n\r\nbe  right  for  them  to divulge secrets.  The  secrets\r\n\r\nshould  remain secret-secrets to which they have  sworn\r\n\r\nsecrecy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
