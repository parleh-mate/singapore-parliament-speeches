The  automatic stopping of  traffic  at  this\r\n\r\ncrossing  for  25  seconds  in  every  90  seconds\r\n\r\nprovides  sufficient gaps in the traffic  flow  to\r\n\r\nenable pedestrians to cross Bendemeer Road between\r\n\r\nBlocks 43 and 25. There is also a light controlled\r\n\r\npedestrian  crossing at the junction of  Bendemeer\r\n\r\nRoad  and Boon Keng Road, a distance of about  500\r\n\r\nfeet from Block 25. The installation of pedestrian\r\n\r\nlights  in  front of Block 25 is,  therefore,  not\r\n\r\nconsidered necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police have taken action against vehicles\r\n\r\nexceeding   the  30  m.p.h. speed   limit   along\r\n\r\nBendemeer Road. For example, for the week  9th  to\r\n\r\n15th  September, 1972, 27 drivers were booked  for\r\n\r\nspeeding  along  the road and offered  composition\r\n\r\nranging from $30 to $50 depending on their  speed.\r\n\r\nThe  Police will continue their operations against\r\n\r\ninconsiderate motorists. Those racing at excessive\r\n\r\nspeeds will be arrested on the spot and charged in\r\n\r\ncourt  under  the Road Traffic Act  for  dangerous\r\n\r\ndriving,  or  under the Penal Code for endangering\r\n\r\nthe lives of other road users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang will be interested to know\r\n\r\nthat  in  the first nine months of this year,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  took action against some 14,000  motorists\r\n\r\nfor exceeding speed limits along our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, can\r\n\r\ntraffic be stopped at this crossing for more  than\r\n\r\n25  seconds  at  a  time to enable  the  aged  and\r\n\r\nchildren to cross the road?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Twenty-five seconds out of every 90\r\n\r\nseconds,  Sir,  is  in  my view  already  quite  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable gap for pedestrians to cross.

The  existing\r\n\r\nallowances  for children, i.e, the  amounts  which\r\n\r\nmay  be  deducted from income to be taxed, are  as\r\n\r\nfollows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    For the 1st child, $750\r\n\r\n    For the 2nd child, $500\r\n\r\n    For the 3rd child, $500\r\n\r\n    For the 4th child, $300\r\n\r\n    For the 5th child, $300\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in reliefs which will take effect\r\n\r\nfrom the year of assessment 1974 will be as\r\n\r\nfollows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    For the 1st child, $750,  \r\n\r\n          as at present.\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n    For the 2nd child, $750, \r\n\r\n          increased by $250 \r\n\r\n          from the  present \r\n\r\n          $500.\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n    For the 3rd child, $500,   \r\n\r\n          as at present.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere   will   be  no  allowances  for  subsequent\r\n\r\nchildren.  The  deductions are in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   policy   of   encouraging   two   but\r\n\r\ndiscouraging  more  than  three  children  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new reliefs will apply to parents who have\r\n\r\nthree  children or less on 1st August,  1973.  Any\r\n\r\nfourth  or  subsequent child born to such  parents\r\n\r\nafter 1st August, 1973, will therefore not get any\r\n\r\nrelief.  However,  parents who already  have  more\r\n\r\nthan  three  children on 1st  August,  1973,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   be  eligible  for  their   present\r\n\r\nallowances  for  these children.  It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  to cause hardship to those who  already\r\n\r\nhave  more  than three children in the family  and\r\n\r\ncannot do anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be an additional variation. The Act\r\n\r\nprovides that, at present, a married woman who has\r\n\r\nearned  income  may opt to be assessed  separately\r\n\r\nfrom  her husband. This provision has given a more\r\n\r\nadvantageous  tax treatment to married  women  who\r\n\r\nare  working. The option will remain so  that  all\r\n\r\nmarried  women who are economically inactive  will\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to  work  and  ease  the  manpower\r\n\r\nshortage in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further induce the more highly qualified and\r\n\r\nprofessionally trained married women  to  work,  I\r\n\r\nhave  decided  also to make the  tax  reliefs  for\r\n\r\nchildren more attractive for them. In the case  of\r\n\r\nsuch highly qualified married women who have three\r\n\r\nchildren  or  less on 1st August,  1973,  and  who\r\n\r\nelect  to claim the tax reliefs for their children\r\n\r\nin   their  assessment,  there  will  be  enhanced\r\n\r\nreliefs as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n      For the 1 child $750 or 5 per \r\n\r\n          cent of the earned annual\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          income  subject to a maximum \r\n\r\n          of $2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      For the 2nd  child $750 or 5 per \r\n\r\n          cent  of the  earned  annual \r\n\r\n          income subject to a  maximum\r\n\r\n          of $2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      For the 3rd child $500 or 3  per \r\n\r\n          cent  of  the earned  annual \r\n\r\n          income subject to a  maximum\r\n\r\n          of $2,000.\r\n\r\n</pre>          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped the enhanced reliefs will serve to\r\n\r\nreverse  any  tendency  for highly  qualified  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  married  women  to  give  up   their\r\n\r\ncareers to look after their children. Since  these\r\n\r\nwomen  have undergone expensive training, it would\r\n\r\nbe a waste of such training if they stop working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

It is intended\r\n\r\nto define it as a married woman who has obtained a\r\n\r\ndegree  from  an  institution  providing  tertiary\r\n\r\neducation,  or  who is a member of a  professional\r\n\r\nbody  oz group regulated by statute, or any  other\r\n\r\nprofession as may be approved by the Minister  and\r\n\r\nnotified in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, as regards children who\r\n\r\nat  present are not yet given tax reliefs  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  claim yet for income tax  from  the\r\n\r\nparent, the intention is that the present position\r\n\r\nwill remain for those who, as I have said, already\r\n\r\nhave more than three children and are not able  to\r\n\r\ndo anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other question, which has been posed by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson, I am afraid that my present\r\n\r\namendment  of the Act does not cover the  question\r\n\r\nof relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The shortage\r\n\r\nof  manpower  today falls within all categories  -\r\n\r\nfrom   the  highly-trained  workers  to  the  less\r\n\r\nskilled workers. Recently, there was an attempt to\r\n\r\nencourage  married women to work in the  factories\r\n\r\nand  so  on, where there is a serious shortage  of\r\n\r\nsuch  manpower. Therefore, I would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the logic behind the rationalisation  of\r\n\r\ngranting  these  reliefs only  to  women  who  are\r\n\r\nclassified as professionally qualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question\r\n\r\nwhether   teachers   are  to  be   considered   as\r\n\r\nprofessionally trained persons, it does  not  come\r\n\r\nwithin the definition which is being proposed. But\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason why consideration  cannot  be\r\n\r\ngiven if it is intended that this definition would\r\n\r\napply  to  them. However, I think that within  the\r\n\r\nreliefs granted, it is unlikely that most  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers would qualify for more than the $750.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the logic of differentiating the\r\n\r\nprofessionally  qualified  from   those   not   so\r\n\r\nqualified,  again  I  think  the  same  arithmetic\r\n\r\napplies  in both cases. And the further  logic  is\r\n\r\nthat,  as I have mentioned in my statement,  these\r\n\r\nprofessionally qualified married women  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained at very great expense, and it would be  an\r\n\r\neconomic waste if we do not make use of this  kind\r\n\r\nof training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nagree   with   the  Minister  that  professionally\r\n\r\nqualified  women who have undergone a considerable\r\n\r\namount  of training should be encouraged  to  come\r\n\r\nforward,  as it would be a waste not to use  their\r\n\r\ntalent  and  ability. Such measures are  desirable\r\n\r\nand  I  accept and support them. However, my point\r\n\r\nis  this: why should the same encouragement not be\r\n\r\ngiven also to the others? There is also a shortage\r\n\r\nof  manpower  in the other categories of  workers.\r\n\r\nThe move should be to encourage our women-folk  to\r\n\r\ncome out of their households to participate in our\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree very\r\n\r\nmuch with that sentiment.

The fact is that  unless\r\n\r\nthey  are  in the $15,000 per annum bracket,  they\r\n\r\nwould not qualify for additional reliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arithmetic\r\n\r\nis  something that is worked out, and  it  can  be\r\n\r\nchanged if the Government so decides.

An\r\n\r\nattempt  is  made  to  give  tax  reliefs  to  the\r\n\r\nprofessionally   qualified   women.   It   is   an\r\n\r\nindication  that  the Government is  conscious  of\r\n\r\nwanting  to  draw out this particular category  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  What  I am saying is, why  is  the  same\r\n\r\nconsideration not given to the other categories of\r\n\r\nwomen workers? There could be some other method by\r\n\r\nwhich  the same purpose of drawing more  women  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in our economic development  could  be\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I\r\n\r\nhave  very much to add to what has been said.

The\r\n\r\nindependence  of  a  nation may,  by  more  subtle\r\n\r\nmeans, be subverted. Although more time-consuming,\r\n\r\npropaganda,  especially from  within,  could  work\r\n\r\njust as well. The gradual erosion of the mind of a\r\n\r\nnation   may   well  be  achieved  by   persuasive\r\n\r\narguments  stemming from vested  interests,  often\r\n\r\nforeign.  Again, an even more subtle method,  that\r\n\r\nof   manipulating  political  parties   within   a\r\n\r\ncountry,  may  be  employed.  This  is  especially\r\n\r\nattractive  in a country like Singapore.  In  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we can never be  over-cautious  in\r\n\r\nsafeguarding  our  integrity  as  an   independent\r\n\r\nsovereign  nation. It is possible  with  unlimited\r\n\r\nfunds   at  one's  command  to  gain  control   of\r\n\r\npolitical  parties,  succeed  at  the  polls   and\r\n\r\nthereafter  bring about the surrender or  transfer\r\n\r\nof  the  sovereignty  of  our  Island-Republic  by\r\n\r\nfusion with another country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, with its industrious and skilled\r\n\r\npopulation,  its  vast  financial  resources   and\r\n\r\nexpertise, its high standard of living and  social\r\n\r\namenities, its superb port facilities and economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and its know-how and  the  skilled\r\n\r\nservices in almost every field that it can provide\r\n\r\nfrom banking to the ship-repairing business, would\r\n\r\nindeed  be  a worth-while plum. Foreign  interests\r\n\r\nwith vast resources might find it advantageous  to\r\n\r\nadvocate,   with  smooth  blandishments   and   in\r\n\r\neuphemistic  terms, a \"merger\"  when  such  merger\r\n\r\nwould  in  reality be a take-over.  These  foreign\r\n\r\ninterests  could attempt to persuade  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  a  surrender  of  its sovereignty  might  be\r\n\r\nadvantageous to Singapore. This could be  done  by\r\n\r\ninfiltrating into political and other  bodies,  by\r\n\r\npumping  in funds into these bodies for  nefarious\r\n\r\npurposes  and by the use of modern mass media,  so\r\n\r\nthat in time the climate of public opinion may  be\r\n\r\nmoulded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seductive blandishments of foreign agents\r\n\r\nmust  not be allowed to succeed. It must  be  made\r\n\r\nimpossible  for  outside  inimical  interests   to\r\n\r\njostle  Singapore  into  incorporation  with   any\r\n\r\ncountry when it is not to Singapore's benefit.  We\r\n\r\nmust   accordingly  seek  to   ensure   that   any\r\n\r\nGovernment of the future seeking to merge  with  a\r\n\r\nforeign country, .may only do so with the sanction\r\n\r\nof a clear and undoubted majority of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore. As the President said in his address at\r\n\r\nthe  opening of Parliament, \"No foreign  interests\r\n\r\ncan  be  allowed  to  take over Singapore  through\r\n\r\nfinancing   and  manipulating  political   parties\r\n\r\nthrough   their  naive  or  vain,  self-proclaimed\r\n\r\nleaders\".  Hence, there is, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  legislation to combat  machinations  by\r\n\r\nforeign   interests  to  the  detriment   of   the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Constitution (Amendment)\r\n\r\n(Protection of the Sovereignty of the Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore) Bill provides at Article 52J that there\r\n\r\nis  to  be no surrender or transfer, either wholly\r\n\r\nor  in part, of the sovereignty of the Republic of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  an  independent nation  whether  by\r\n\r\nmerger  or  incorporation with any other sovereign\r\n\r\nstate,  Federation  or country  or  in  any  other\r\n\r\nmanner  whatsoever  without  the  support   at   a\r\n\r\nnational referendum of at least two-thirds of  the\r\n\r\ntotal   number  of  votes  cast  by  the  electors\r\n\r\nregistered under the Parliamentary Elections  Act.\r\n\r\nNor  indeed without such support of the electorate\r\n\r\nis  there to be any relinquishment of control over\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Police Force or the Singapore Armed\r\n\r\nForces.

That   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is able to introduce this Bill speedily\r\n\r\nin  this  House  proves  that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nattaching  great importance to it as  it  involves\r\n\r\nthe protection of our rights and the rights of our\r\n\r\nfuture generations to survive. It is also meant to\r\n\r\npreserve our sovereignty and independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our country is a small island with limited\r\n\r\nspace  and  a very short history. Our geographical\r\n\r\nposition is at the centre of Southeast Asia and is\r\n\r\nmost   strategically  situated.   Therefore,   our\r\n\r\nposition  has very often roused the attention  and\r\n\r\ninterest  of  world powers. Because of  our  great\r\n\r\nachievements  and  all round development  together\r\n\r\nwith  the raising of the living standards  of  our\r\n\r\npeople   in  recent  years,  many  elements   with\r\n\r\nulterior  motives  and insidious  intentions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  trying to resort to various means to destroy\r\n\r\nour  existence  and sovereignty.  Therefore,  this\r\n\r\namendment Bill is very necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Bill is mainly for the\r\n\r\npurpose of providing that if there is any proposal\r\n\r\nto amend our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution affecting our sovereignty, then  such\r\n\r\nproposal  should  be supported by  at  least  two-thirds  of our electorate at a national referendum\r\n\r\nbefore  it can be passed or effected in this  way,\r\n\r\nthe  intrigues  and  ulterior motives  of  foreign\r\n\r\nelements and ambitious people may be thwarted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the express provisions in the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  I  feel  that  there   is   another\r\n\r\nimportant measure that we should adopt. We  should\r\n\r\nactively and effectively inculcate in the minds of\r\n\r\nour  people a sense of national consciousness  and\r\n\r\npatriotism.  Provided our people  have  this  high\r\n\r\nsense of national consciousness and patriotism,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  all  the nefarious designs  of  ambitious\r\n\r\nelements  and  people with ulterior  motives  will\r\n\r\nfail disastrously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is most appropriate\r\n\r\nto  introduce this amendment Bill at present  when\r\n\r\nwe  have just begun the First Session of the Third\r\n\r\nParliament.  The  First Parliament  had  the  main\r\n\r\ntasks  and  responsibility  of  consolidating  and\r\n\r\nstrengthening  our  political stability,  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  and a defence capability, because  from\r\n\r\nthese  efforts the independence of our country  is\r\n\r\nensured  and our sovereignty preserved. Basically,\r\n\r\nit   was  a  struggle  for  survival.  The  Second\r\n\r\nParliament had the main responsibility of  solving\r\n\r\nthe   various  problems  of  defence  and  economy\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by the withdrawal of  the  British\r\n\r\nArmed Forces. In the last few years, not only have\r\n\r\nwe  solved  all these problems, but we  have  also\r\n\r\nmanaged to achieve a great deal in all fields. Our\r\n\r\neconomic growth rate has been maintained at  above\r\n\r\n10  per  cent. The value of industrial  production\r\n\r\nhas been increasing continuously. Urban renewal is\r\n\r\nprogressing very well and the environment  of  our\r\n\r\ncity  is becoming prettier and cleaner day by day.\r\n\r\nAll  in all, our efforts in industrialisation  and\r\n\r\nmodernisation have been extremely successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these prosperous signs have\r\n\r\ninevitably  created  jealousy  and  a  feeling  of\r\n\r\ninsecurity  on the part of some outside  ambitious\r\n\r\npeople. They are jealous of and perturbed  by  our\r\n\r\nachievements because our rapid rate of development\r\n\r\nbrings  out their deficiency and at the same  time\r\n\r\nit  reflects their slow rate of growth, which will\r\n\r\nmake their own people disenchanted with them. As a\r\n\r\nresult of this jealousy and feeling of insecurity,\r\n\r\nsome  people  attempt  through  various  means  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate some of our political parties,  perhaps\r\n\r\nwith  the intention of taking over the sovereignty\r\n\r\nof  our  country. They think that with their  vast\r\n\r\nfinancial resources they can achieve this  through\r\n\r\ntheir local agents and so manipulate our political\r\n\r\npower,  and  then  perhaps  eventually  completely\r\n\r\nusurp our sovereignty through some changes in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  This  is very  dangerous.  We  must\r\n\r\nexpose and check these attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the introduction of this amendment\r\n\r\nBill is to put a stop to all these wild dreams. At\r\n\r\nthe same time, opportunity is taken to remedy some\r\n\r\nof  the  existing  loopholes in our  Constitution.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  Article 90 (1) of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nconstitutional  amendments may  be  legislated  by\r\n\r\nParliament. In Article 41 (1) a simple majority of\r\n\r\nthose  present  in  the  House  is  all  that   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  pass  any legislation.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nloophole in our present Constitution, because  any\r\n\r\npolitical  party may make use of its  majority  in\r\n\r\nParliament to amend the Constitution according  to\r\n\r\nits  wishes. If every political party  adopts  the\r\n\r\nway  PAP  is working, i.e, to examine any proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation  in detail and with great care  before\r\n\r\nintroducing  it, then there will be no  danger  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution being desecrated. But all  these\r\n\r\npreventive  measures are still necessary.  As  the\r\n\r\nPresident has pointed out in his speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`it would be criminal negligence to allow foreign\r\n\r\ninterests   with  large  financial  resources   to\r\n\r\nmanipulate  our  internal politics,  by  financing\r\n\r\nSingapore    political   parties,    professional,\r\n\r\nacademic  and  other  groups  to  try  to  beguile\r\n\r\ndomestic opinion . . . No foreign interests can be\r\n\r\nallowed  to take over Singapore through  financing\r\n\r\nand manipulating political parties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough   their  naive  or  vain,  self-proclaimed\r\n\r\nleaders.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill provides that unless a two-thirds majority is obtained at a referendum, no\r\n\r\npart  of  our  sovereignty may be  surrendered  or\r\n\r\ntransferred through merger or otherwise  with  any\r\n\r\nother country. It also provides that unless a two-thirds  majority in a referendum is obtained,  any\r\n\r\nproposed amendment to this Part of the Bill cannot\r\n\r\nbe effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many examples in history to show\r\n\r\nthat  these provisions are essential. The  British\r\n\r\nconstitution  is  the result  of  several  hundred\r\n\r\nyears  of  constitutional struggle. Parliament  is\r\n\r\nthe  highest authority in the country. There,  the\r\n\r\ntraditions,  customs  and practices  are  held  in\r\n\r\ngreat  respect and are not amended very frequently\r\n\r\nin Parliament. In the United States of America, it\r\n\r\nis  a, different case. It is a comparatively  new\r\n\r\ncountry.  From  the very beginning,  the  American\r\n\r\npeople even provided for the basic human rights in\r\n\r\ntheir  constitution. In order  to  preserve  these\r\n\r\nbasic  rights, the procedure for the amendment  of\r\n\r\nthe  American Constitution is very complicated and\r\n\r\ndifficult. Any amendment must be approved by a two-thirds  majority in both Congress and the  Senate.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  three-quarters of the  states  must\r\n\r\napprove   the   amendment.   Alternatively,    the\r\n\r\namendment must be introduced by two-thirds of  the\r\n\r\nstates' legislatures and must be approved by  two-thirds  of  both  the Upper and  Lower  Houses  in\r\n\r\nAmerica.  In  the  rest of  the  world  there  are\r\n\r\nsimilar  examples. For instance, in the merger  of\r\n\r\nEgypt  and Syria, a referendum was held before  it\r\n\r\nwas  carried  out.  Recently in  the  Scandinavian\r\n\r\ncountries,   both  Norway  and  Denmark   held   a\r\n\r\nreferendum to decide whether to join the  European\r\n\r\nCommon Market. In the case of Denmark, because the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people supported the  idea,  they\r\n\r\njoined the Common Market. But Norway did not  join\r\n\r\nthe Common Market, because most of the people were\r\n\r\nagainst  the idea. Although participation  in  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Common  Market is  in  appearance,  only\r\n\r\nrelated to economic issues, however, once a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry   is   in   the  Common  Market,   certain\r\n\r\nprerogatives of the country such as those relating\r\n\r\nto  customs, trade, finance, and immigration  will\r\n\r\nbe  affected  by  decisions of the Common  Market.\r\n\r\nTherefore, because this question is too important,\r\n\r\nthe  countries decided to hold a referendum before\r\n\r\ngoing ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958, when General De Gaulle took over power\r\n\r\nin   France,   he  wanted  to  abolish   the   old\r\n\r\nConstitution, and held a referendum to  decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  issue.  In  our own case in 1963,  before  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to join Malaysia, although there  was  no\r\n\r\nprovision in our State Constitution at that  time,\r\n\r\nwe  nevertheless proceeded to hold a referendum to\r\n\r\ndecide on the form and the conditions of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision in this Constitutional\r\n\r\namendment Bill is also very important. It provides\r\n\r\nthat unless a two-thirds majority is obtained in a\r\n\r\nreferendum,  the control of the Armed  Forces  and\r\n\r\nthe Police Force cannot be relinquished. All of us\r\n\r\nknow  that the Armed Forces are the protectors  of\r\n\r\nthe  sovereignty  of  our  country.  We  therefore\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  any foreign forces,  through  their\r\n\r\nlocal agents to take over control; otherwise,  the\r\n\r\nsovereignty of our country will be undermined  and\r\n\r\nthe  designs of the foreigners will be successful.\r\n\r\nI  believe that the majority of our people possess\r\n\r\nthe  correct decision-making capabilities and will\r\n\r\nbe  in  favour  of  resorting to a  referendum  on\r\n\r\nimportant  issues  such as  this.  These  measures\r\n\r\nproviding  for  a referendum are also  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the  principles of democracy. It is  also  a\r\n\r\nsign of democracy at work, because it involves the\r\n\r\ndirect   participation  of  the  people   in   the\r\n\r\nimportant  affairs  of state. Through  these  very\r\n\r\nstrict provisions in our Constitution, the foreign\r\n\r\nambitious  plotters will have  their  efforts  cut\r\n\r\nshort.  It  is  also a blow to  our  own  internal\r\n\r\nservile   politicians  who  try  to   please   the\r\n\r\nforeigners.  This  amendment Bill  will  make  our\r\n\r\nConstitution  more  perfect,  thus  ensuring   the\r\n\r\nintegrity of our independence and sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the amendment\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  speaking on this Bill, I wish  to  stress  a\r\n\r\npoint which may allude to serious appreciation  by\r\n\r\nour  people. Simply put, Sir, our country's growth\r\n\r\nis attributable to the measure of an international\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  country which  attracted  and\r\n\r\ninduced investment. This, in turn, stimulated  the\r\n\r\neconomy  which  generated greater  confidence  and\r\n\r\nwhich  attracted more investments and  development\r\n\r\nskills,  and  so on. This confidence was  achieved\r\n\r\nwithin  the  first three years of our independence\r\n\r\nin  1965. It is a confidence which has been vested\r\n\r\nin  an  independent  and  sovereign  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nbankers,  industrialists and  traders.  These  are\r\n\r\nshrewd men of the world who after much thought and\r\n\r\ncalculation make the decision that ours will be  a\r\n\r\npolitically   stable  and  viable  country.   This\r\n\r\ncalculation surely included the appraisal that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  hard working people, determined to  remain\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign. On that score. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave managed to secure an international commitment\r\n\r\nof extensive investments in our country, which has\r\n\r\naccounted  for  a rapid all-round development  and\r\n\r\nthe general affluence of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our independence and sovereignty, our right and\r\n\r\npower   to  determine  our  own  national  destiny\r\n\r\nthrough  realistic  policies  of  Government  have\r\n\r\nconvinced  sources in various parts of  the  world\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  a  people who  should  survive  and\r\n\r\nprosper.  However, there are also  sources  within\r\n\r\nand  without our country which seriously entertain\r\n\r\ndesigns  to incorporate our country in  a  foreign\r\n\r\nsovereign state, to resolve political or  economic\r\n\r\nirksome   problems  or  to  achieve  a   political\r\n\r\nscenario  in  the region which fits  in  with  the\r\n\r\ngrand designs of super major and foreign powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as the incorporation of Singapore in\r\n\r\na  foreign  sovereign  state remains  conveniently\r\n\r\nachievable  through  a  simple  legislative   act,\r\n\r\ninterested  sources  will  pursue  their   designs\r\n\r\nthrough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblack  operations against the state.  Hence,  this\r\n\r\nConstitutional amendment which seeks  to  preserve\r\n\r\nour independence and sovereignty is welcome, since\r\n\r\nit  makes  the act of losing our independence  and\r\n\r\nsovereignty a less simple one and truly, and  much\r\n\r\nmore, a decision of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to express my wholehearted support  for\r\n\r\nthis amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to ask the Minister a point of\r\n\r\nclarification,  it is quite well  laid  here  that\r\n\r\nthere  shall  be  no  surrender  or  transfer   of\r\n\r\nsovereignty unless two-thirds of the people are in\r\n\r\nfavour of that move. But Article 52K provides  for\r\n\r\nparticipation  or  co-operation  in  any   scheme,\r\n\r\nventure,  project,  etc., and  entering  into  any\r\n\r\ntreaty, agreement, or any other arrangement  which\r\n\r\nis  beneficial  or advantageous  to  Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the government can enter into  any\r\n\r\nof  these  arrangements. The problem  then  surely\r\n\r\nmust  be this: that if you have a government  that\r\n\r\nintends  to sell out the interests of the  people,\r\n\r\nthey  can  cloak the sell-out of our  sovereignty,\r\n\r\nsurrender or transfer, by any name - call it  \"co-operation\",  \"treaty\", \"agreement\" or  \"contract\".\r\n\r\nTo  my  mind,  the interpretation of that  action,\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  it amounts to a surrender  or  a\r\n\r\ntransfer of sovereignty, is most important. If one\r\n\r\ncould interpret whether that action is a surrender\r\n\r\nor  a  transfer of sovereignty, then  Article  52J\r\n\r\napplies. Otherwise, the government in selling  out\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the people could well  interpret\r\n\r\nthat their action is beneficial or advantageous to\r\n\r\nSingapore and could proceed to do so under Article\r\n\r\n52K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister: who\r\n\r\ndoes  the  interpretation of  that  action  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  that act of entering  into  some\r\n\r\ntreaty or contract with another power could amount\r\n\r\nto a sell-out of Singapore's interests and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  surrender  of  sovereignty?

Surely  not  the\r\n\r\npurpose of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to guarantee that at\r\n\r\nour  sovereignty and independence remain with  us,\r\n\r\nand  should  we  want to join up with  some  other\r\n\r\ncountry, as we did with Malaysia before, we should\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  people - hold a referendum  and  two-thirds  of those casting votes must be in  favour.\r\n\r\nUnless  we hive this exception in Article 52K,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  precluded from even joining  any  other\r\n\r\nventure.

It was committed to the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee after its Second Reading on 28th  March,\r\n\r\n1972.   The   Bill  now  before  the   House   is\r\n\r\nessentially the same as the earlier version except\r\n\r\nfor a few additional amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are very concerned with the trend of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents which have  been  increasing\r\n\r\nannually  since 1967. Despite the efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to inculcate safety consciousness among\r\n\r\nthe  workers and management and in spite  of  more\r\n\r\nstringent enforcement of the Factories Act  by  an\r\n\r\nexpanded  Factory  Inspectorate,  the  number   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents is still  increasing.  There\r\n\r\nwere  2,220 industrial accidents in the first nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of this year compared with 1,374  for  the\r\n\r\nsame period last year, an increase of 62 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are well aware of the social and economic\r\n\r\ncost   of  every  industrial  accident.  The  most\r\n\r\npainful  aspect, however, is the human  suffering,\r\n\r\nanguish and misery caused by the loss of life  and\r\n\r\nhealth.  The  loss of a father, a  husband,  or  a\r\n\r\nloved  one can never be fully compensated whatever\r\n\r\nthe  quantum of monetary compensation may be.  For\r\n\r\nthis reason alone, our conscience dictates that we\r\n\r\nmust   do  everything  possible  to  prevent   the\r\n\r\noccurrence of any industrial accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware of the fact that we cannot hope\r\n\r\nto eliminate or reduce the incidence of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents  through legislation alone.  However,  a\r\n\r\npiece  of  legislation as archaic as the Factories\r\n\r\nAct  enacted in vastly different circumstances  14\r\n\r\nyears ago will not make our task any easier. There\r\n\r\nhave  been  times when we felt utterly  frustrated\r\n\r\nsimply because our powers were inadequate to  deal\r\n\r\nmore  effectively with certain heartless employers\r\n\r\nwho  had  no  regard whatsoever for  the  welfare,\r\n\r\nhealth  and safety of their employees.  It  is  no\r\n\r\nconsolation to us that there are not many of  such\r\n\r\nemployers. The greatest asset of Singapore is  its\r\n\r\nhuman resources. We, therefore, value the life and\r\n\r\nhealth of each\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  every one of our workers. We cannot and  will\r\n\r\nnot  tolerate such callousness especially when our\r\n\r\nhuman  resources are being fully stretched by  the\r\n\r\nburgeoning  industries. The Bill  now  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  seeks  to  remove the inadequacies  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Factories Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to repeal and reenact with\r\n\r\namendments the Factories Act (Chapter 123 of the 1970 Revised\r\n\r\nEdition) with a view to improving the\r\n\r\nhealth   and  safety  measures  and  the   welfare\r\n\r\nfacilities  of persons employed in factories;  and\r\n\r\nensuring a more stringent observance of the safety\r\n\r\nprovisions  so as to reduce the rate of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents.  The  more significant changes  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting   legislation  are   described   in   the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, however, to comment on some of the\r\n\r\nmore  important  changes. Clause 94  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nempowers  the  Minister  to  appoint  an  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil   for   Industrial  Health   and   Safety.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  there was no institutional  arrangement\r\n\r\nthrough  which advice could be sought  on  matters\r\n\r\npertaining  to industrial health and  safety.  The\r\n\r\nproposed     Advisory    Council     will     have\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from, management, trade unions and\r\n\r\nprofessional bodies and will, therefore,  be  able\r\n\r\nto  collectively  advise the Minister  on  matters\r\n\r\naffecting safety, health and welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important innovation introduced by the\r\n\r\nBill is the appointment of safety officers. Clause\r\n\r\n64  of  the  Bill  requires certain  factories  to\r\n\r\nappoint safety officers solely for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nexercising  general  safety  supervision  and  for\r\n\r\npromoting the safe conduct of work. With the rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth of the number of factories in Singapore, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  physically impossible for  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate   to   make  regular   and   periodic\r\n\r\ninspections  on  all  these  factories.  It  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  be necessary to require that management\r\n\r\npolice  their own factories and ensure  that  they\r\n\r\nare  safe. In addition, factories employing 50  or\r\n\r\nmore  persons  will be required to set  up  safety\r\n\r\ncommittees  to promote health, safety and  welfare\r\n\r\nin their establishments. The rationale behind this\r\n\r\nrequirement,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is set out in clause 65 of the Bill, is that\r\n\r\nboth   management  and  labour,  which   will   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  on the safety committee, can  jointly\r\n\r\ncontribute  and  participate in the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nindustrial safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the Government's antipollution\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the  occupier of  a  factory  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired   to  take  special  preventive  measures\r\n\r\nagainst the emission of harmful substances in  the\r\n\r\natmosphere.  He  will  also be  asked  to  provide\r\n\r\nappropriate  protection for employees  engaged  in\r\n\r\nhazardous  processes. Clause 59 of the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nrequire   the  occupier  to  substitute,  wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  less harmful substances,  processes  or\r\n\r\ntechniques for their more harmful counterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also pays greater attention to workers\r\n\r\nengaged in occupations involving special risks  to\r\n\r\nhealth. Under clause 62 of the Bill, the Minister\r\n\r\ncan    make   regulations   to   require   medical\r\n\r\nsupervision and examination of persons employed in\r\n\r\noccupations  specified in the Seventh Schedule  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Act, certain provisions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the safety of an employee  are  made\r\n\r\napplicable to work carried out in a harbour or wet\r\n\r\ndock  in constructing, re-constructing, repairing,\r\n\r\nrefitting, painting, finishing, or breaking  up  a\r\n\r\nship,  or in scaling, surfing or cleaning  boilers\r\n\r\nin  a ship, or in cleaning any tank or holds in  a\r\n\r\nship.  In  view of the growing importance  of  our\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and repairing industry and the  rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion  of our port and harbour facilities,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to make further provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nhealth and safety of those workers who are engaged\r\n\r\nin  the shipyards, the port and the harbour. These\r\n\r\nwill be provided for in clause 68 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that about 65 per cent of the\r\n\r\naccidents  have been caused by the  negligence  or\r\n\r\nrefusal  on  the part of the worker to use  safety\r\n\r\nappliances  provided  and  observe  the   measures\r\n\r\nstipulated.  Clause  73  of  the  Bill  makes   it\r\n\r\nmandatory  for employed persons to use the  safety\r\n\r\nappliances  provided.  In order,  therefore,  that\r\n\r\nthis   provision  is  strictly  observed,  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary that the culprits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   brought  to  book  quickly  and  dealt  with\r\n\r\neffectively.  Clause  81 of the  Bill,  therefore,\r\n\r\nprovides  that  any authorised police  officer  or\r\n\r\nInspector  of  Factories may  arrest  without  any\r\n\r\nwarrant  any  employed person who has  contravened\r\n\r\nclause  73  of the Bill and produce him  before  a\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court.  Alternatively,  the   police\r\n\r\nofficer  or  Inspector  can straightaway  serve  a\r\n\r\n\"ticket\"  on  the  offender  to  attend   at   the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court  to  answer  the  charge.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  clause  78  empowers  an  Inspector  of\r\n\r\nFactories  to  require any person acquainted  with\r\n\r\nthe  facts and circumstances of an accident  or  a\r\n\r\ndangerous occurrence taking place in a factory  to\r\n\r\nattend  before him and state truly the  facts  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances with which such person is acquainted\r\n\r\nconcerning the accident or dangerous occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for an increase in the\r\n\r\nquantum  of fines or term of imprisonment  imposed\r\n\r\nfor infringements of the Bill. For instance, under\r\n\r\nthe  did  Factories Act, the penalty for operating\r\n\r\nan  unregistered factory was a fine not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$1,000  or  a  term of imprisonment not  exceeding\r\n\r\nthree  months. Under this Bill, both the fine  and\r\n\r\nterm of imprisonment have been increased to $5,000\r\n\r\nand  six months respectively. Similarly, under the\r\n\r\nFactories Act, the penalty for an employed  person\r\n\r\nfound  infringing the provisions of the  Act  s  a\r\n\r\nfine  not exceeding $500 or a term of imprisonment\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  three months. This  Bill  has  now\r\n\r\nincreased  the fine payable to a sum not exceeding\r\n\r\n$2,000.  Such  stiffening  of  the  penalties  for\r\n\r\ninfringements  of  the law is  clearly  needed  to\r\n\r\nbring   home  the  urgency  of  the  problem,   if\r\n\r\nemployers  and  workers are to  be  deterred  from\r\n\r\ncontravening the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the importance of this Bill and\r\n\r\nthe extensive amendments being made to the present\r\n\r\nAct,  I  propose to commit the Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Factories Bill be committed to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and\r\n\r\nseven Members to be nominated by the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSelection.\"- [Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EMPLOYMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall that  the  Employment\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  was  introduced  in  the   last\r\n\r\nsession  of  Parliament. It was committed  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee after its Second Reading on  2nd\r\n\r\nJune,  1972. In my Second Reading speech  then,  I\r\n\r\nhave  explained the events leading to the Bill.  I\r\n\r\nhave  also  drawn attention to the more  important\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill which, together  with  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Relations   (Amendment)   Bill,   are\r\n\r\ndesigned to give effect to the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe   National  Wages  Council  which  have   been\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Government.  However,  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  new  Members of the  House,  I  shall\r\n\r\nrecapitulate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in April this year, the National\r\n\r\nWages   Council,  a  tripartite  body   comprising\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from labour, management  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  made certain recommendations  on  wage\r\n\r\nincreases   and   bonuses.   In   announcing   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's acceptance at the NTUC May Day  Rally\r\n\r\nthis  year,  I emphasised that the recommendations\r\n\r\nshould   remain  as  guidelines  for  negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween  employers and their employees,  or  trade\r\n\r\nunions representing the employees. We cannot  make\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations mandatory because  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  employers who are genuinely unable to  grant\r\n\r\nthe  increases  recommended  by  the  Council.  To\r\n\r\ncompel  them to do so would tantamount to forcing\r\n\r\nthem out of business. However, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  amend  those  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act and the Industrial  Relations  Act\r\n\r\nwhich    would   otherwise   prevent   the    full\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the National  Wages  Council's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  particularly in regard  to  bonus\r\n\r\nwhich, under the present Act, is negotiable up  to\r\n\r\na maximum of one month's wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 23rd May, the National Wages Council and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  Chambers  of   Commerce,\r\n\r\nSingapore Employers Federation, National Employers\r\n\r\nCouncil,  Singapore Manufacturers Association  and\r\n\r\nthe  National Trades Union Congress, met the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and myself, to discuss ways in which  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  National  Wages  Council\r\n\r\ncould  be  given  effect.  The  parties  concerned\r\n\r\nunanimously agreed that the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council should not be approached in\r\n\r\na  legalistic  way. However,  in  so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  were  contrary  to  any  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation, such legislation should be amended to\r\n\r\nremove  any legal impediment to the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  recommendations. Further  where  enabling\r\n\r\nprovisions were necessary, for example, to make it\r\n\r\npossible  for  an employer to opt for  either  the\r\n\r\n13th  month  payment and a bonus,  or  13th  month\r\n\r\npayment and an annual wage revision, such enabling\r\n\r\nlegislation should be passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties also agreed that where in any\r\n\r\nparticular  case  no agreement  could  be  reached\r\n\r\nbetween  employer  and union  and  a  dispute  was\r\n\r\nreferred to the Industrial Arbitration Court,  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court  should  take  into\r\n\r\naccount the recommendations of the National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the  special circumstances  of  that\r\n\r\nparticular employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment (Amendment) Bill now before the\r\n\r\nHouse   was   drafted  in  the  light   of   the3e\r\n\r\nagreements.

It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  necessary for the  Act  to  come  into\r\n\r\nforce from this date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sustain and accelerate our present pace\r\n\r\nof  economic  development,  we  must  continue  to\r\n\r\npursue   the  policy  of  industrial  peace   with\r\n\r\njustice. This calls for closer co-operation and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater  understanding between labour,  management\r\n\r\nand  Government. It also calls for an orderly  and\r\n\r\nequitable  distribution of the  additional  wealth\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  joint efforts of the  tripartite\r\n\r\npartners.  So long as the employers are  fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  the  trade  unions  do  not  make\r\n\r\nirresponsible and excessive demands,  the  outlook\r\n\r\nof our future will always be bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\nthree  important Bills tabled for Second and Third\r\n\r\nReadings  today.  The Employment (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nand the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill are,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion,  very important  legislations  on\r\n\r\nemployment,  which  should be implemented  in  the\r\n\r\nspirit  in which they are passed. We are all  well\r\n\r\naware  of  the  need for the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act in 1968. The trade unions have  co-operated  fully  to make the Bill workable.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of the Employment  Act,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been so much talk of tripartism in industries\r\n\r\nand  we  have made all efforts to make  tripartism\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Addendum to the President's speech, a\r\n\r\ncall  has been made to unions, employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  work  together  for  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest. Greater emphasis is to be given  to  the\r\n\r\nprevention  or  elimination of, and  I  quote  the\r\n\r\nAddendum,  \"nascent  points  of  friction  between\r\n\r\nlabour  and management before they assume  ominous\r\n\r\nproportions\".  Similarly, in  an  address  at  the\r\n\r\nannual   dinner   of   the  Singapore   Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation,  the Minister for Labour  has  soundly\r\n\r\nrebuked  those  employers  whose  sluggishness  in\r\n\r\nnegotiations   is  not  conducive  to   harmonious\r\n\r\nindustrial relations with their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these references which I have just\r\n\r\nmade  is  to  remind Members of  the  House  that,\r\n\r\ndespite   the   countless  exhortations   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  both employers and unions  to  co-operate  with one another in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic, there are still employers or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  managerial representatives who regard trade\r\n\r\nunions  as  necessary nuisances  to  be  tolerated\r\n\r\nrather  than  desirable partners to be co-operated\r\n\r\nwith.  I  wish  to bring to the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse   a   regrettable  but  nevertheless   true,\r\n\r\ninstance   of  the  medieval  attitude   of   some\r\n\r\nemployers  or  professional  managements   towards\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. One well-established and  otherwise\r\n\r\nreputable employer in Singapore, whose workers are\r\n\r\nrepresented by an affiliate of the NTUC,  recently\r\n\r\ndecided  in  a  mood  of paternal  benevolence  to\r\n\r\nrevise  slightly  upwards the  salaries  of  their\r\n\r\nemployees.  But without previously  consulting  or\r\n\r\neven  notifying  the  trade union  concerned,  the\r\n\r\nemployer informed their employees on 20th  October\r\n\r\nof  this  year  that  their salaries  were  to  be\r\n\r\nrevised   with  retrospective  effect   from   1st\r\n\r\nOctober.  Members  of  this House  may  very  well\r\n\r\nwonder what my grievance is, or rather what is the\r\n\r\ngrievance of the trade union concerned, since  the\r\n\r\nworkers have been given a slight increase  in  pay\r\n\r\nby  their  employer. The matter, however,  is  not\r\n\r\nsimply  a question of pay increase. In the process\r\n\r\nof  revising upwards the salaries of the  workers,\r\n\r\nthe  employers have also changed the salary scales\r\n\r\nof  the employees concerned, resulting in the need\r\n\r\nfor  a  conversion  exercise in the  placement  of\r\n\r\nemployees  from the old salary scales to  the  new\r\n\r\nsalary  scales. It is natural that with  employees\r\n\r\npreviously receiving different salaries under  the\r\n\r\nold  scales  being grouped together  on  the  same\r\n\r\nincremental  point in the new salary scales,  some\r\n\r\nemployees   receive   disproportionately   greater\r\n\r\nincreases  than others. The trade union  concerned\r\n\r\nhas informed the employer that its members are not\r\n\r\nhappy  over  the basis of conversion in  that  the\r\n\r\nincreases  in  salaries  have  been  unnecessarily\r\n\r\ndisproportionate and inequitable from an objective\r\n\r\npoint  of  view, and that the conversion has  been\r\n\r\nimplemented  without prior consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nunion.   The  new  scheme  also  does  away   with\r\n\r\npromotion grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The managerial representative to whom the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction was conveyed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever,  replied that the revision of the  salary\r\n\r\nscales was approved and sanctioned by the relevant\r\n\r\nperson in charge of finance, who had not given any\r\n\r\ninstruction or indication that the revised  salary\r\n\r\nscales were to be implemented in consultation with\r\n\r\nthe  trade union representing the workers. In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   the   managerial   representative\r\n\r\nbluntly  informed  the union  that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of  any discussion as to an  alternative\r\n\r\nand  fairer  basis  for conversion  from  the  old\r\n\r\nsalary   scales  to  the  revised  salary  scales.\r\n\r\nAnother  managerial representative, a very  senior\r\n\r\nofficial  of  the establishment, also  added  that\r\n\r\nnone  of  the  workers  had  directly  voiced  any\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction with the revised salary scales and\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  the  \"damn trade union\"  which  was\r\n\r\nseeking  to  create a dispute between the  workers\r\n\r\nand their employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident which I have just related may seem\r\n\r\nto  be  the  kind to be expected of  an  unusually\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  employer in the  private  sector  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I think Members of this House would  be\r\n\r\nI   surprised  to  learn  that  the  trade   union\r\n\r\nconcerned  is  the  Amalgamated  Union  of  Public\r\n\r\nEmployees  (AUPE)  and that the employer  is  none\r\n\r\nother  than  the Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nand  the Ministry of Finance of the Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Members  of the House  would  be  also\r\n\r\ninterested to learn that the trade union concerned\r\n\r\nhas  served a notice, in writing, as far  back  as\r\n\r\nOctober  1962, to the Government to negotiate  for\r\n\r\nbetter  terms  and  conditions  of  service.   The\r\n\r\nofficial  side,  in  accepting the  invitation  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate,  had  stated that such  acceptance  was\r\n\r\n\"intended   to   promote   goodwill    and    good\r\n\r\nrelationship   between   your   union   and   this\r\n\r\nMinistry\". During the intervening 10 years between\r\n\r\n1962 and 1972, the Ministry has never revoked  the\r\n\r\nrecognition accorded to the union to represent the\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the Ministry. It is,  therefore,  a\r\n\r\ngross  violation of all accepted  norms  of  sound\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations practice  for  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nunilaterally and arbitrarily to revise the  salary\r\n\r\nscales and conditions of service and to proceed to\r\n\r\nimplement such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevised  salary scales and conditions  of  service\r\n\r\nwithout   prior   consultation   with,   or   even\r\n\r\nnotification to, the trade union concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retort of the Ministry, in response to the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  by  the  union  of  such  improper  and\r\n\r\narbitrary  change in the terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice,  to  the  effect that no  employees  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  any dissatisfaction was irrelevant  and\r\n\r\nmischievous. In the first place, no employee would\r\n\r\nhimself  wish  to be singled out for  the  dubious\r\n\r\nattention of his supervisors or superior  officers\r\n\r\nby  voicing his dissatisfaction with the  increase\r\n\r\nof  pay  accorded to him, when the  same  superior\r\n\r\nofficer  obviously considers such an  increase  in\r\n\r\npay  as  a generous gesture on their own part.  In\r\n\r\nthe  second place, since the employees are members\r\n\r\nof   a  registered  trade  union  which  has  been\r\n\r\naccorded  recognition  by their  employer,  it  is\r\n\r\nnatural   for   the  employees  to   voice   their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  to the union in  the  expectation\r\n\r\nthat  the union would take up their grievance with\r\n\r\ntheir employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point that should be remembered by Members of\r\n\r\nthe  House is that the Government has accorded  to\r\n\r\ncivil  servants and other public employees, except\r\n\r\nthose  in  the Singapore Police Force and  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces, the right to organise  and\r\n\r\nbargain  collectively.  Such  civil  servants  and\r\n\r\npublic employees may or may not have the right  to\r\n\r\nbring   their   disputes  before  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court,  but  there  is  no   law   in\r\n\r\nSingapore to preclude or to prohibit trade  unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting  civil servants or  public  employees\r\n\r\nfrom   entering   into   negotiations   with   the\r\n\r\nrespective ministries and departments on the terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions of service of their members.  Once\r\n\r\nrecognition has been accorded to a trade union  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  a  particular group of employees  the\r\n\r\nemployer, whether it be a Government department or\r\n\r\na private company, is expected to treat such union\r\n\r\nwith  some  courtesy and respect  as  befitting  a\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining agent on behalf of such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup  of  employees. Where the employer seeks  to\r\n\r\nvary or change the terms and conditions of service\r\n\r\nof  the  employees,  it is only  proper  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer  secures the agreement of a  trade  union\r\n\r\nrepresenting   such   employees   to   avoid   any\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and friction. In  the  particular\r\n\r\nincident which I have related earlier, the revised\r\n\r\nsalary  scales may be beneficial to  some  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees concerned, but the conversion  from  the\r\n\r\nold  salary scales to the new salary scales  is  a\r\n\r\nhighly  controversial  matter  and  the  immediate\r\n\r\npromotional  prospects have  been  altered.  These\r\n\r\nshould  have  been  referred to  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nconcerned  for  their  views before  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nproceeds to implement such a proposal on the basis\r\n\r\nit arbitrarily decides upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not doubt or question the integrity of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  officials concerned. But even  with  the\r\n\r\nbest  of intentions, any individual person  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  expected to be infallible in any matter or  in\r\n\r\nevery matter. Otherwise, there would have been  no\r\n\r\nneed  for the tripartite basis of consultation  so\r\n\r\nfervently   advocated  by   the   Government   and\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  relation to  the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil, and there would have been no need  for  a\r\n\r\ntrade union movement in Singapore at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nEmployment (Amendment) Bill before this House is a\r\n\r\nlogical   consequence  to  the  setting   up   and\r\n\r\noperation of the National Wages Council. It is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  enabling  provisions  in  the  employment\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  give effect to the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a legal loophole in this\r\n\r\nexercise  whereby some mischievous  employers  may\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of by denying their employees  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the recommendations of  the  National\r\n\r\nWages   Council  on  the  ground  that  they   are\r\n\r\ntechnically  not  covered by the  Employment  Act.\r\n\r\nRecently,  three  NTUC affiliated unions  received\r\n\r\nnegative response from the employers to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir invitation to negotiate wage increases along\r\n\r\nthe  national  guidelines of  the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  in  respect  of  their  members  who  are\r\n\r\ndrawing  monthly  salaries  exceeding  $750.   The\r\n\r\nimmediate  reply  from these  employers  was  that\r\n\r\nthose  drawing $750 and above do not  come  within\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of the Employment Act, and  therefore,\r\n\r\nare  not entitled to receive any increments on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  the 1972 national wage guidelines  laid\r\n\r\ndown by the National Wages Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general understanding, when the National\r\n\r\nWages   Council   was  set   up   and   when   its\r\n\r\nrecommendations were made this year, was that  the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council's  recommendations  would\r\n\r\napply  to all workers, whether they are paid  more\r\n\r\nor  less than $750 per month. It will not lead  to\r\n\r\nharmonious  industrial relations if employers  are\r\n\r\nto  deny  some of their employees the benefits  of\r\n\r\nthe recommendations of the National Wages Council,\r\n\r\nsimply  because their employees are  drawing  more\r\n\r\nthan  $750.  You will be surprised, Sir,  that  in\r\n\r\nmodern  Singapore, we still have a  few  employers\r\n\r\nadopting   a   medieval  approach  to   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.

Even\r\n\r\nthough  the Employment Act does not cover  workers\r\n\r\ndrawing more than $750 salary per month, there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  in the Act or in any other law to prevent\r\n\r\nemployers from granting salary increases  to  such\r\n\r\nworkers, in accordance with the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe  National  Wages Council. The main  constraint\r\n\r\nwill be the maintenance of good employer/ employee\r\n\r\nrelations, as it affects the productivity  of  the\r\n\r\nfirm and the ability of such employers to med  the\r\n\r\nincreased  cost, without seriously  affecting  the\r\n\r\nfirm's  competitive position. The good offices  of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Ministry is always at the disposal  of\r\n\r\nboth   unions  and  employers.

In the past the Government has spared no\r\n\r\neffort  in promoting economic development, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  achieved some brilliant success. An eloquent\r\n\r\ntestimony  to  this  can be  found  in  the  acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of labour in Jurong. The achievement  is\r\n\r\nall  the  more remarkable when we compare it  with\r\n\r\nwhat  we  had a few years ago before independence.\r\n\r\nThe  present  situation  augurs  well  for  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.  The people of Singapore are well  aware\r\n\r\nthat  as  we  have  laid  a sound  foundation  for\r\n\r\nindustrial development in recent years we have  to\r\n\r\nadjust our pace of progress in order to adapt to a\r\n\r\nnew  environment  and to create  a  new  model  of\r\n\r\nsociety  so as to establish harmonious  and  happy\r\n\r\nrelationship among our people. As to when we  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to succeed in our task, this will  depend\r\n\r\non  the  amount of effort put in by the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to cite a very well-known\r\n\r\nexample.  With the rapid progress in our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, there have been great changes in  the\r\n\r\nmethod  of  production  and business  organisation\r\n\r\nwhich  hitherto  have been based  on  the  family-kinship  system. Under such a system the employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship was poor. The workers  were\r\n\r\npoorly paid for their loyal service. In the  light\r\n\r\nof    present   day   situation,   this   abnormal\r\n\r\nexploitation  of man by man has become  ever  more\r\n\r\nevident.  Such a family business organisation  and\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  industrial relationship  have,  in\r\n\r\nfact, become out-dated as well as a stumbling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblock  to  our economic development. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  great influx of foreign investors  not\r\n\r\nonly  brings  with it a great deal of  investments\r\n\r\nwhich are beneficial and very much needed, hut  it\r\n\r\nalso  brings  in  new and even unique  styles  of management techniques. In this new industrial era,\r\n\r\nif  we  are to maintain the pace of our industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment and the rate of economic growth and if\r\n\r\nwe  are  to improve the living conditions  of  the\r\n\r\ngreat masses of workers, it is of vital importance\r\n\r\nthat the National Wages Council should play a very\r\n\r\ndecisive role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from hoping that the National Wages Council\r\n\r\nwill  implement its policy effectively and firmly,\r\n\r\nI  would  also  like to request the Government  to\r\n\r\nembark  on  a  comprehensive  research  into   our\r\n\r\nindustrial management techniques to find out  what\r\n\r\nis suitable for local conditions, and to formulate\r\n\r\nnew  management techniques in order  to  encourage\r\n\r\nand popularise them as models for our society. For\r\n\r\nexample,  the management techniques  used  by  the\r\n\r\nAmerican  entrepreneurs  in  Singapore  are   very\r\n\r\nsuccessful. So are the management techniques  used\r\n\r\nby  the  Japanese  business concerns.  Both  these\r\n\r\ntechniques  are equally effective,  although  they\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  identical. There are both advantages\r\n\r\nand  disadvantages in these management techniques.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Government, the people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  learn from these techniques  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  short time and adapt it to local conditions.\r\n\r\nIt  will  then  become  a  driving  force  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic   development.  At  present,  among   the\r\n\r\nmultitude of industrial workers, apart from a  few\r\n\r\nwho  are satisfied with their lot, there is  great\r\n\r\nmobility among the majority of the workers where a\r\n\r\nlack of discipline and responsibility exists. Such\r\n\r\nworkers are opportunists. In other words,  such  a\r\n\r\nworker  works  in  a factory only  because  he  is\r\n\r\nbetter  paid there. If another factory offers  him\r\n\r\nhigher wages, he will not hesitate to leave for  a\r\n\r\nmore  lucrative  employment. It is  obvious  that,\r\n\r\nbefore  we  can formulate an ideal set of  working\r\n\r\nconditions,  the  people would  consider  monetary\r\n\r\nincome as the sole criterion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor employment. However, with the establishment of\r\n\r\nbetter working conditions, their concept will  not\r\n\r\nchange so easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nstress that although economy plays a decisive role\r\n\r\nin our nation building, it is not the only factor.\r\n\r\nCoupled  with the general guidelines laid down  by\r\n\r\nthe  National  Wages Council, if we can  evolve  a\r\n\r\ncertain  work  ethic  or  certain  principles   of\r\n\r\nemployment, such as to imbue oneself with  a  love\r\n\r\nfor  work, a love for their workplace, and a  love\r\n\r\nfor  their country, then we Singaporeans  will  be\r\n\r\nable to carve our destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought that\r\n\r\nthe  debate on the President's Speech is over  and\r\n\r\ndone with last week, and that there should not  be\r\n\r\nany further debates on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of\r\n\r\nmodernisation of management techniques is not  the\r\n\r\nsubject of debate.
