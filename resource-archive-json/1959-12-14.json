The\r\n\r\nSingapore  River, as you know, Mr Speaker,  passes\r\n\r\nthrough the densely populated area of the City  and\r\n\r\nthe  sanitary exits to most of the premises in this\r\n\r\narea are into the Singapore River. As far as I  can\r\n\r\nmake out, the Singapore River is not only an artery\r\n\r\nof  trade  but  it also provides an  exit  for  the\r\n\r\nsanitary  facilities of the City. Because of  this,\r\n\r\nthe  City health authorities were worried about the\r\n\r\nstate of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nSingapore  River. Several approaches had been  made\r\n\r\nto  Government  from  time  to  time  to  see  that\r\n\r\nsomething  should  be done to the Singapore  River.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am very glad, Mr Speaker, Sir, to see\r\n\r\nthat  some  provision has been made in next  year's\r\n\r\nestimates,  although I regret  to  find  under  the\r\n\r\nremarks column \"Subject to Treasury sanction\". This\r\n\r\nvery  often  means  that the scheme  might  not  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out.  I  would like the assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister that the scheme  is  sufficiently\r\n\r\nwell  in hand for it to be commenced next year and,\r\n\r\nshould  that  be the position, that  he  will  give\r\n\r\nsympathetic approval to this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Government's main  interest  in\r\n\r\nthis river project is, of course, from the point of\r\n\r\nview  of  trade. As the Member for Farrer Park  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  this proposal was first examined quite  some\r\n\r\ntime  ago. In fact, a Committee was formed in  1954\r\n\r\nto  investigate the condition of the river  and  to\r\n\r\nmake  recommendations  for  its  improvement.  That\r\n\r\nCommittee  went into some detail in the engineering\r\n\r\naspects  of  river improvement. Perhaps  I  may  be\r\n\r\npermitted   to   explain  briefly  what   are   the\r\n\r\nimprovements   envisaged,   and   what    is    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's attitude towards these improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is important because it is one of the\r\n\r\nprincipal  arteries  of our  entrepot  trade.  Many\r\n\r\npeople may not be aware of the fact that more cargo\r\n\r\nis  discharged through the river than  through  the\r\n\r\nwharves of the Singapore Harbour Board, that is  if\r\n\r\nwe  exclude bunker oil. The traffic up and down the\r\n\r\nriver  is impeded in two ways. First, part  of  the\r\n\r\nriver has been rather heavily silted up, so that at\r\n\r\nlow tide movement of lighters is not possible. Then\r\n\r\nagain  at high tide there is not sufficient headway\r\n\r\nunder the bridges, so that again lighter traffic is\r\n\r\nheld up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee proposed certain types of\r\n\r\nalteration. First, to repair or to reconstruct  the\r\n\r\nbridges so that there is sufficient headway at high\r\n\r\ntide.  Then  it  would  be necessary  to  dredge  a\r\n\r\nchannel  along the Singapore River so that  traffic\r\n\r\ncan proceed at low tide. Once dredging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperations  are  commenced, there is  every  danger\r\n\r\nthat   the   quays  of  the  river  may   collapse.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  before  the channel  of  the  river  is\r\n\r\ndeepened,  it  will be necessary to strengthen  the\r\n\r\nquays by means of sheet piling. This will be a most\r\n\r\ncostly  operation.  The  original  cost  is   $7\ufffd\r\n\r\nmillion  and  the latest estimate is that  it  will\r\n\r\nprobably  be nearer the region of $14 million.  The\r\n\r\nestimated original cost of $14 million has now been\r\n\r\nincreased  to some $23 million. Now, it is  obvious\r\n\r\nthat  there  are independent aspects of this  work,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  the reconstruction of  bridges  can\r\n\r\nproceed   quite  independently  of  the   work   of\r\n\r\ndeepening the channel of the river, while repair to\r\n\r\nthe  quay  side  (for instance,  attending  to  the\r\n\r\ndeplorable state of some of the private  quays)  is\r\n\r\nagain  quite  independent of any deepening  of  the\r\n\r\nchannel.  But  no attempt has so far been  made  to\r\n\r\nassess  the  benefit from each item of  this  total\r\n\r\nprogramme  against possible benefits; for instance,\r\n\r\nif  you  are to reconstruct the bridges,  how  many\r\n\r\nmore hours' traffic will that permit? What will  be\r\n\r\nthe gain to traders and shippers? And if you are to\r\n\r\nundertake  this  extremely  expensive  business  of\r\n\r\ndeepening  the  channel, how  much  more  will  the\r\n\r\nSingapore River be open to trade, and how fast will\r\n\r\nships be able to turn over the cargo and so on  and\r\n\r\nso forth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is now engaged in weighing the\r\n\r\nbenefits to be gained against the items of separate\r\n\r\ncost  so that we can be sure that, if we do  embark\r\n\r\non  this  most expensive project, we will get  good\r\n\r\nvalue  for  money. Now, if the channel were  to  be\r\n\r\ndeepened, the advice of the engineers is  that  the\r\n\r\nwaters of the Singapore River would flow at such  a\r\n\r\nrate that it would eliminate the present malodorous\r\n\r\nstate  of the river of which the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark has complained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation by the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Finance, may I be given leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,028,070 for Head D9 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D12 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Dl2 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular provision is a token vote\r\n\r\nfor  equipment for new post offices. But I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee  anywhere under this head any provision, be  it\r\n\r\ntoken  or  actual,  for the building  of  new  post\r\n\r\noffices.  If  there are no new post offices  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt,  is  there  any necessity to  have  a  token\r\n\r\nprovision  for the equipment for new  post  offices\r\n\r\nwhich are not to be built at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Postal Department has a programme  for\r\n\r\nthe   building  of  nine  new  post  offices.  This\r\n\r\nprogramme  is divided into three phases. Phase  (a)\r\n\r\nwas  the  building of post offices at Thomson  Road\r\n\r\nand   Serangoon  Garden  Estate.  This  phase   was\r\n\r\ncompleted in 1958, at the cost of $246,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase (b) involves the building of five further\r\n\r\npost  offices at Paya Lebar, the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,  Macpherson Road, Kampong Kapor and Killiney\r\n\r\nRoad.  Work on the Paya Lebar office was  begun  in\r\n\r\n1958,  and provision was made in the 1959 estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the  work to be completed. Because of  limited\r\n\r\nfinances  at that time, work on the remaining  four\r\n\r\nitems  of phase (b) was deferred. No provision  for\r\n\r\nthese  items was entered in the 1959 estimates  and\r\n\r\nin  those  estimates, the four items were relegated\r\n\r\nto  a schedule of Public Work projects deferred for\r\n\r\nconsideration  in  connection  with   future   loan\r\n\r\nprogrammes and the general availability of finance.\r\n\r\nSo  the  new  P.A.P. Government has inherited  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase (c) involves the building of two post\r\n\r\noffices  at  Simpang  Bedok  and  Farrer  Road.  In\r\n\r\npreparing  the 1960 estimates, the postal  services\r\n\r\nhope that money could be found for the construction\r\n\r\nof  some,  if  not  all, of the four  post  offices\r\n\r\nremaining in phase (b). An application was made for\r\n\r\nprovision   to   be  entered  in  the   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. Simultaneously, a proposal was made  for\r\n\r\n$3,400  to purchase equipment necessary to  furnish\r\n\r\nthe post offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view, however, of the uncertainty as to\r\n\r\nwhether  funds  would be provided and  whether  the\r\n\r\nwork could in fact be completed in 1960, only token\r\n\r\nprovision   for  the  purchase  of  equipment   was\r\n\r\nentered.  If  necessary and when the  need  arises,\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House will  be  assured  that  an\r\n\r\napplication  for  supplementary provision  will  be\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, Mr Speaker, that we in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  fortunate  that  we have an  excellent  postal\r\n\r\nservice  which can guarantee us that when a  letter\r\n\r\nis despatched it will be delivered, and when a man\r\n\r\ngoes to the post office to send a cable it will  be\r\n\r\npromptly transmitted.

As has been narrated by the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, there are three types of programmes\r\n\r\nand  they all cover only the City area. No  mention\r\n\r\nwas   made  of  programmes  covering  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands.   It  is  evident  that  I  have   already\r\n\r\nmentioned  many  matters  concerning  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands,  Mr Speaker, because I am of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  there  is room for improvement in the  postal\r\n\r\nservices in certain areas there. I find that one of\r\n\r\nthese  places  is Palau Bukom. On  the  main  Bukom\r\n\r\nIsland  there  are  no  postal  services.  I   feel\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  what has happened  previously.  I\r\n\r\nhave  received complaints and appeals to the effect\r\n\r\nthat the oil company at Pulau Bukom is prepared  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a building for a post office at the  place\r\n\r\nwhere  the  postal  staff  now  only  sell  stamps.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  however, until  today  I  have  not\r\n\r\nheard  of  any development regarding the  company's\r\n\r\noffer.   Therefore,  I  would  like  to  draw   the\r\n\r\nattention of the Government that it is only  proper\r\n\r\nthat a branch or a sub-post office be opened there,\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be of benefit to the residents  of  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands, the majority of whom are found on\r\n\r\nBukom   Island  and  to  provide  them  with   easy\r\n\r\ncommunication   with   the   Singapore    mainland.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  in  the absence of such facilities,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be very difficult for them when they  are  in\r\n\r\nneed of urgent communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I will certainly\r\n\r\npay  attention to what the Member for the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  has  brought  up  about  Pulau  Bukom.

At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  we know that the rate of population increase\r\n\r\nis  such  that,  in order to cope with  the  annual\r\n\r\nincrease, about 10,000 housing units a year  should\r\n\r\nbe  provided.

Unless  a\r\n\r\nfamily  has  at  least  five  points,  it  is   not\r\n\r\neligible.  So only large families are  eligible.  A\r\n\r\nnewly-married couple or a couple with one child  or\r\n\r\ntwo  children cannot apply for an S.I.T. house.

We found, when we opened\r\n\r\nthe  cash  till, that most of the money  which  the\r\n\r\npeople  had given to the care of the old Government\r\n\r\nhad  disappeared. As the Deputy Prime Minister said\r\n\r\none  day,  Christmas Island was sold;  luckily  the\r\n\r\npeople  opened their eyes, or otherwise this Island\r\n\r\nof Singapore would also be sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many problems to be solved by the new\r\n\r\nGovernment. Not only was there a shortage of money,\r\n\r\nnot  only  were  our reserves spent in  a  carefree\r\n\r\nmanner,  but  there were also other problems  which\r\n\r\nthe  other governments - the colonial government  and\r\n\r\nthe  Lim Yew Hock Government - had left to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  to solve: for instance, as  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin has said just now, a back-log of houses\r\n\r\nto  be built, a shortage of accommodation which for\r\n\r\nthe  past ten years the colonial administration had\r\n\r\nnever  tried to solve, and which had been entrusted\r\n\r\nto   us.   In  a  word,  Mr  Speaker,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has had to carry the baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do agree with the Member for Tanglin that, in\r\n\r\norder  to cope with the back-log which the colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment had left us to solve, we need  to  build\r\n\r\nan  average  of 17,500 units a year. We  understand\r\n\r\nthat   fact.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  present\r\n\r\neconomic position in Singapore, we cannot  do  much\r\n\r\nbetter than what our Minister for Finance has done,\r\n\r\nto allocate $25 million for housing. There are many\r\n\r\ncompeting   demands  on  the  restricted  financial\r\n\r\nresources   available  to  the  P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nSchools  have not been adequately supplied and,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Education mentioned  yesterday,\r\n\r\ndelinquency is high and many children have not been\r\n\r\nable  to  go  to  schools. There is a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nhospitals  for  the  needy; a  shortage  of  social\r\n\r\nservices  for  the sick and the needy.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthese  competing demands, the Government  has  done\r\n\r\nits  very best by allocating the sum of $25 million\r\n\r\nto one requirement alone, that is housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is the first year of the P.A.P. Government. In the first year of the Tun Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock Government, they only allocated $9 million for\r\n\r\nhousing. $9 million versus $25 million! Of  course,\r\n\r\nevery  sector of economic activity in  this  Island\r\n\r\nwants  more money. We want $50 million for schools,\r\n\r\n$50  million for hospitals, $50 million for  social\r\n\r\nservice,  etc, etc. But it is not possible  to  get\r\n\r\nall  the money and it is the task of the Government\r\n\r\nto  allocate  the money judiciously and  wisely  so\r\n\r\nthat we will do our best with the limited funds  at\r\n\r\nour disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are doing our very best as far as housing is concerned, with our limited funds. We\r\n\r\nhave  reorganised the S.I.T. almost completely.  We\r\n\r\nhave sacked or ousted the expatriate architects who\r\n\r\nhad  been guilty of irregularities. We forced  them\r\n\r\nto quit or else action would be taken against them.\r\n\r\nWe  did  not want to waste time by sending them  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court because, in some cases, it would be just\r\n\r\na waste of time. For instance, in the course of two\r\n\r\nweeks,  we found that more than 20 to 30  items  of\r\n\r\nirregularities   had  been  charged   against   one\r\n\r\narchitect. And to most of these items, he could not\r\n\r\ngive a satisfactory answer. There were six\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpatriate architects and we took action to replace\r\n\r\nthem with six local architects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are some people still at large in this country who have no confidence in the\r\n\r\nability  of our people to put up plans for housing,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  and  to  run  this  country.  But,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we have confidence in our own people  and\r\n\r\nin   our  own  professional  men.  As  soon  as  we\r\n\r\nreorganised the S.I.T. from August onwards and took\r\n\r\nover  full control, within the course of one month,\r\n\r\nwe terminated the services of 30 expatriates out of\r\n\r\n35, leaving a few engineers who have experience and\r\n\r\nwho  at  the moment are a bit difficult to replace.\r\n\r\nBut  for the other sectors - the administration,  the\r\n\r\nmanagement and the architects - we have replaced them\r\n\r\ncompletely   with  local  professional   men.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we  have 100 per cent confidence  in  our\r\n\r\nlocal people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with housing, we need to have a\r\n\r\ngood  Planning Committee in the S.I.T. because  the\r\n\r\ntwo    are   joined   up - housing   requires    good\r\n\r\nplanning - and it is important that there  should  be\r\n\r\nan  honest and efficient Planning Department in the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. both for public housing and, as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Tanglin   says,  for  private  housing.   The\r\n\r\ncorruption and filth in the Planning Department  in\r\n\r\nthe  old  S.I.T. has been mentioned many  times  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  As  soon as we took over  control  in\r\n\r\nAugust   and  as  soon  as  action  was  taken   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  the  Planning  Committee,   the   most\r\n\r\nimportant person against whom many allegations  had\r\n\r\nbeen made, scooted. As soon as he left the country,\r\n\r\nhe  submitted a letter of resignation. We have  now\r\n\r\nthoroughly   reorganised  the   Planning   Section.\r\n\r\nPreviously - and this is for the information of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin - local architectural firms  found\r\n\r\nit   very,  very  difficult  to  get  their   plans\r\n\r\nexpedited.  But European architectural firms  could\r\n\r\nbuild installations worth $10 million or even small\r\n\r\ninstallations, first, and then after  a  few  years\r\n\r\nsubmit  their plans for confirmation. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwe    have   rectified   all   these   abuses   and\r\n\r\nirregularities of the past. In the  case  of  local\r\n\r\nfirms,  we  now treat them fairly and on  an  equal\r\n\r\nfooting with foreign firms. We have even gone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  step  further.  And this is  for  the  further\r\n\r\ninformation  of the Member for Tanglin - one  of  the\r\n\r\nabuses  of the past was that the Planning Committee\r\n\r\ncould just reject a plan without giving reasons. In\r\n\r\nthe  new Planning Committee, what we have tried  to\r\n\r\ndo  is  that, if we feel that reasons can be given,\r\n\r\nwe ask the planners to call the architects and give\r\n\r\nthem the reasons and ask them to make the necessary\r\n\r\nslight adjustments, so that their plans can come in\r\n\r\nand  can be passed. Previously, what they tried  to\r\n\r\ndo was they just rejected and the architects or the\r\n\r\ncontractors  or the builders had to go and  contact\r\n\r\nthe  right  persons  in order to  get  their  plans\r\n\r\npassed. It is a pity though, Mr Speaker, that  the\r\n\r\npersons  who have scooted are not the real  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  responsible  for the  corruption  in  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Section of the S.I.T. The persons who  are\r\n\r\nreally corrupted in the Planning Section are  still\r\n\r\nat  large,  and it will take some time  before  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore can lay their hands  on  them.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Farrer Park has sat on the Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and  I  am sure he knows  that  if  the\r\n\r\nmembers  and the trustees who sat on the  Committee\r\n\r\ndid  not  agree  with  the  planning  experts,  the\r\n\r\nplanning experts could not just pass the plans.  It\r\n\r\nwas  the planning experts who suggested passing  or\r\n\r\napproving  the  plans,  but  it  was  left  to  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Committee composed previously of  a  group\r\n\r\nof  trustees who said \"yes\" or \"no\" to  the  plans,\r\n\r\nand  they  had  been given powers to say  \"yes\"  or\r\n\r\n\"no\".  Perhaps  a  Commission of Inquiry  into  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Planning  Committee  might  reveal   many\r\n\r\nmatters of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when we started reorganising the S.I.T. in August this year, we sacked the corrupt\r\n\r\nexpatriate officials, but at the same time we  went\r\n\r\none  step  further  and replaced  them  with  local\r\n\r\narchitects  and  engineers. We have  long-term  and\r\n\r\nshort-term  plans: the long-term plans are  not  in\r\n\r\ndetail but the short-term plans are. We have short-term  plans  to  build low-cost  housing.  The  old\r\n\r\ngovernment only talked about low-cost housing. They\r\n\r\nhad  been  talking about low-cost housing for  four\r\n\r\nyears.  But, Mr Speaker, Sir, to pay  $89  or  $99\r\n\r\nrent per month for a house is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlow-cost  housing. Neither is a one-room flat,  the\r\n\r\nrental  of  which is $25 per month  and  which  was\r\n\r\nsubsidised on the eve of the elections just to  get\r\n\r\nvotes-low-cost housing. The old Government built  a\r\n\r\nfew  thousand units in Kallang Estate just  on  the\r\n\r\neve   of  the  elections;  but  they,  knowing  the\r\n\r\nelections  were coming, said, \"O.K.,  we  subsidise\r\n\r\nthese  flats. The rent is $60 each per month. Never\r\n\r\nmind, we subsidise $20.\" The total electorate  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay out the money eventually to subsidise\r\n\r\nthese  flats. We believe in building real  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing without any hypocritical measures in hidden\r\n\r\nsubsidies.   Even  about  the  so-called   low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  in  Kallang  Estate,  when  I  went  there\r\n\r\nyesterday, I received so many complaints in respect\r\n\r\nof  the  construction; the rain  coming  in  during\r\n\r\nrainy  days;  the  rent which  the  tenants  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay.... When we say low-cost  housing,  we\r\n\r\nreally mean low-cost housing - a one-room flat  which\r\n\r\nwe have started, and which we will rent out at less\r\n\r\nthan  $20 a month. We will not announce the details\r\n\r\nof the rentals until the houses are completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there are 1,364 units of S.I.T. flats\r\n\r\nunder  construction. There are sites  available  on\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can build another 5,000 to  6,000  units\r\n\r\nstraightaway.  The  plans are ready,  most  of  the\r\n\r\nspecifications  are  ready,  and  as  soon  as  the\r\n\r\nTreasury are consulted, we will announce the  plans\r\n\r\npublicly,  and  for these units, construction  will\r\n\r\nstart straightaway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill asked just now when the\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority  is going  to  be  created.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the new Government not only works on form,\r\n\r\nbut  it  also  works on content. Not  only  are  we\r\n\r\nproceeding with our plans to build low-cost housing\r\n\r\nfor the poor and for those who cannot afford higher\r\n\r\nrent, but we are also proceeding very fast with the\r\n\r\ncreation of a new Housing Authority which  we  hope\r\n\r\nin January next year will be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked about the\r\n\r\nbuilding  cost  at  present. The  present  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding a one-room flat on the Kampong Tiong Bahru\r\n\r\nfire site, which does not include the price of land\r\n\r\nand roads, is $1,344.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparative figure in respect of a one-room\r\n\r\nflat  at  the  old Kallang Airport is  $2,986 - about\r\n\r\ndouble  the price. The cost of building a  two-room\r\n\r\nunit in Kampong Tiong Bahru is $2,206, and that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang  Estate is $4,159. Mr  Speaker,  some\r\n\r\npeople  might query - perhaps the house  will  break\r\n\r\ndown; it might have a beam without a ceiling; or it\r\n\r\nmight   have  a  ceiling  without  piling  in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction.  But that is not the  case.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to get these low-cost houses because  of\r\n\r\nmany   factors.  One  is  that  from  now  onwards,\r\n\r\nbuilding contractors will not have to pay the usual\r\n\r\npercentage  in  order to get the housing  contracts\r\n\r\nwhich may mean perhaps a saving of 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is that our local architects\r\n\r\nhave   experience  in  building  houses  for  local\r\n\r\npeople.  When I was in Kallang Estate yesterday,  a\r\n\r\nwoman  complainant  came  to  me  and  said,   \"The\r\n\r\nlavatory  is  broken.\"  I  asked  her  whether  her\r\n\r\nhusband was fat and she said that, on the contrary,\r\n\r\nhe  was as lean as myself. Then I said, \"It must be\r\n\r\nthat  your husband squatted on the lavatory instead\r\n\r\nof  sitting on it.\" Then she said, \"Mr Ong,  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry.  I am an Asian and I am not used to sitting.\r\n\r\nI  am  used  to  squatting on  the  lavatory.\"  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that  is  a  clear  example  of  European\r\n\r\narchitects  trying  to build low-cost  housing  for\r\n\r\nlocal  people;  they  do  not  understand  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing.  They  cannot get out of their  minds  the\r\n\r\nconveniences  to  which  they  are  accustomed   in\r\n\r\nEngland.  They do not have a system of urinals  and\r\n\r\nlavatories  where people squat and do not  sit.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, the difference is between  the  Asian\r\n\r\ntype  of  urinals and the English type of  urinals.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is  a common complaint from  all  S.I.T.\r\n\r\ntenants - most of the lavatories have cracked. There\r\n\r\nare  also complaints about cracks not only  in  one\r\n\r\npart  of the room but in most parts. There is  also\r\n\r\nnot  enough  ventilation,  because  the  expatriate\r\n\r\narchitects who plan the S.I.T. units do not have to\r\n\r\nlive  there. Albert House in Rochore Road - there  is\r\n\r\nno   cross   ventilation  and  when   the   tenants\r\n\r\ncook - chillies   and   blachan   and   brinjal   and\r\n\r\nonions - then the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccupants  of  the  whole  flat  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsuffocated for many hours. They have complained but\r\n\r\nwe cannot do very much. The only thing we can do is\r\n\r\nto  take down the whole house. A few months  ago  I\r\n\r\nwent  to  the Brickworks Estate where I heard  the\r\n\r\nstory  of a flying saucer - the whole roof of a  flat\r\n\r\nhad  flown away during a small thunderstorm! I  was\r\n\r\nshocked   to  see  the  construction - no   ceilings,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  architects  thought  that  our  local\r\n\r\npeople can live in those places just like cats  and\r\n\r\ndogs.  The Sembawang Research Station for pigs  and\r\n\r\nchicken  is better constructed - $1 million has  been\r\n\r\nspent on less than 50 pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the third factor whereby we have been able to reduce construction costs is that we\r\n\r\nchoose suitable sites where piling is not necessary\r\n\r\nor  less  necessary. We have better layout so  that\r\n\r\none  road can serve as many houses as possible.  We\r\n\r\nhave  better  layout  for the houses  so  that  one\r\n\r\nbuilding  can support as many square feet of  floor\r\n\r\nspace  as possible. We have better layout for water\r\n\r\nand electricity service so that we have to pay less\r\n\r\ncapital  costs. We even have better layout for  the\r\n\r\nroads.  Mr Speaker, because of all these  factors,\r\n\r\nwe  have  now  been able to reduce the construction\r\n\r\ncosts to a very low figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in Singapore, the people are\r\n\r\ngoing  to have really low-cost housing. Some people\r\n\r\nmight  ask,  \"Why did the previous  Government  not\r\n\r\nbuild  low-cost housing?\" In the first place,  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  have  the  architects to  build  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing.   They  believed  in  engaging  expatriate\r\n\r\narchitects because they were not confident of their\r\n\r\nown  local architects. Local architects - one or  two\r\n\r\nof   them  in  the  S.I.T. - were  allowed  to   swat\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  in  their  rooms.  Secondly,   low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  means less corruption. If a flat is  going\r\n\r\nto  be rented out at about $15 a month, the trishaw\r\n\r\nrider, the hawker, the poor worker who would be the\r\n\r\ntenants  would not be able to pay $200 as tea-money\r\n\r\nto  get  it. But with a 3-room flat, a little  more\r\n\r\nlavishly decorated and constructed, and rented  out\r\n\r\nat  $99  or  $89  per  month,  then,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\ndirectors  of firms, managers of trading companies,\r\n\r\nprofessional men doctors and engineers-could afford\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay  $1,000 or $750 tea-money and rent these S.I.T.\r\n\r\nflats,  subsidised by the public. We have rectified\r\n\r\nall  these.  We have allocated fiats on the  points\r\n\r\nsystem fairly and equitably. We have even gone  one\r\n\r\nstep  further by going down to the S.I.T.  Estates,\r\n\r\nand  listening  to the public complaints.  We  have\r\n\r\nsacked  those housing investigators who  were  paid\r\n\r\n$600 to $700 a month, and who did not really go  to\r\n\r\nwork, and if they really did, complaints inevitably\r\n\r\ncame, of rudeness and corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, Mr Speaker, we have reorganised the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the S.I.T. and we are embarking  on  real\r\n\r\nlow-cost  housing.  We  are also  taking  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure that private development programmes will  be\r\n\r\nexpedited so that the problems of housing  in  this\r\n\r\nisland  can be mitigated, if not solved.  For  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  we  wish  to compliment the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  on  his  ability to get  $25  million  for\r\n\r\nhousing in comparison with the $9 million which the\r\n\r\nTun  Lim Yew Hock Government had allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. in his first year of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  this budget has been going on  for  the\r\n\r\npast  few  days, the Opposition has come to  expect\r\n\r\nsuch  tirades from the Government benchers whenever\r\n\r\na  question  is asked in plain and simple  language\r\n\r\njust  for information. They seem to think that  the\r\n\r\nbest  way  to  show that they are  good  people  or\r\n\r\nclever  people is to try to say what  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  had done or had failed to  do.  Surely,\r\n\r\nSir,  they are not going to be judged by  what  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government did or failed to do? But  they\r\n\r\nare  going to be judged by what they are doing  and\r\n\r\nwill  continue to do. The Hon. Minister  said  that\r\n\r\nduring my time of office we only gave $9 million to\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T.  I am afraid he is wrong in his  facts.\r\n\r\nEven  this book produced by their own Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  disclosed that $9\ufffd million was  lent  to\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. in 1954, whereas in 1957  it  was  $30\r\n\r\nmillion. That is just to answer him, Sir. He  seems\r\n\r\nto think that in 1954 the Rendel Constitution  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncame  into being. It was not so.  It  was  in\r\n\r\nApril  1955. Therefore, Sir, if he wants to  attack\r\n\r\nthe  previous Government, may I ask him to be  more\r\n\r\nsure of his facts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister, Sir, also touched upon\r\n\r\nChristmas Island. I do not know what that  has  got\r\n\r\nto  do with this question. But since this has  also\r\n\r\nbeen brought up by the Deputy Prime Minister, may I\r\n\r\nsay  that  Christmas Island was never  Singapore's?\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore Government was only responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe   administration  of  Christmas   Island.   For\r\n\r\nadministering it, the Singapore Government was paid\r\n\r\na  fee, and also the royalty on the phosphates. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  benchers said that  we  sold  Christmas\r\n\r\nIsland. It was not ours to sell or not to sell.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  when  I  was  informed in  London  that  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  intended  to  transfer  Christmas\r\n\r\nIsland to Australia, I said, \"Now, it means a  loss\r\n\r\nof  $1\ufffd  million to Singapore.\" They  said,  \"All\r\n\r\nright,  we will try to get for you $20 million.  If\r\n\r\njudiciously  invested,  it  will  bring  you   that\r\n\r\namount.\"   So   if  $20  million  was   judiciously\r\n\r\ninvested, it would bring that amount for years  and\r\n\r\nyears  to  come,  and  not,  as  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  would have us believe, that for 38  years\r\n\r\nwe will be getting $1\ufffd million. But I say that we\r\n\r\nhave already got $20 million in hand and with $1\ufffd\r\n\r\nmillion  every year to come for many years if  that\r\n\r\nmoney is properly invested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Was it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Even their own Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  in  his  budget speech  called  it  a\r\n\r\nwindfall - a  windfall,  not a  sell-out.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nwindfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask just a simple question. When will the\r\n\r\nHousing Authority be constituted and how many units\r\n\r\nwill  be  built  with the $25 million?  I  did  not\r\n\r\ncriticise  that the $25 million was not enough.  It\r\n\r\nis  too small - not like we who gave $30 million, and\r\n\r\nwhy  did  you give only $25 million? I  never  said\r\n\r\nthat.  I  asked  how many housing  units  would  be\r\n\r\nbuilt. I had to sit and listen for about 25 minutes\r\n\r\nbefore  I got the answer - that it is about 5,000  or\r\n\r\n6,000  units.  I do not know also why the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  go to the extent of saying that it was  the\r\n\r\nLim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYew Hock Government which liked expatriate officers\r\n\r\nand  wanted them to remain and had no trust in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  officers. But it was the previous Government\r\n\r\nthat  introduced Malayanisation and gave the  local\r\n\r\nboys a real chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is really very difficult to get a\r\n\r\nsimple answer, Mr Speaker, to a simple question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A complicated lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If you want a complicated lie, says\r\n\r\nthe   Deputy  Prime  Minister,  put  a  complicated\r\n\r\nquestion.  But  apparently the Government  Benches,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  front  row,  are  incapable   of\r\n\r\nanswering a simple question. They try to  cloak  it\r\n\r\nin words hoping that the point of the question will\r\n\r\nbe  lost. But we do not intend to lose the point of\r\n\r\nthe  question. We will come back to it and  try  to\r\n\r\nget reasonable answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the first point I made was that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development, when the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nvisited  his  Ministry - I believe  it  was  on  that\r\n\r\nauspicious  occasion - came out  with  his  grandiose\r\n\r\nplans for housing. He announced most bravely to the\r\n\r\nPress that he was going to build over the next four\r\n\r\nand  a  half years, as the case may be, housing  to\r\n\r\nthe  value  of $415 million. That was a  very  good\r\n\r\nthing. Nobody can deny that. Housing is one of  the\r\n\r\nmost important factors in Singapore, and the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  were very pleased to hear  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was going to provide $415 million  worth\r\n\r\nof housing. Naturally when the Budget was placed in\r\n\r\nmy  hands, I was hoping there would possibly be  an\r\n\r\nallocation of at least $80 million for housing. But\r\n\r\nimagine  my  surprise when it was only $25  million\r\n\r\nworth of housing. However, I make bold to say  here\r\n\r\nand  now  to  the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nthat he will not achieve even this target, in spite\r\n\r\nof  his brave words. So I am not suggesting that it\r\n\r\nshould  be  $80  million. But  when  a  responsible\r\n\r\nMinister  says  that  he is  going  to  build  $415\r\n\r\nmillion worth of houses, he must mean what he says.\r\n\r\nHe is a Minister and not a back-bencher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what the Planning Committee has got to do\r\n\r\nwith  the Housing Authority, Mr Speaker, I do  not\r\n\r\nknow. But the Minister must necessarily drag in the\r\n\r\nPlanning Committee in the hope that he will drag me\r\n\r\ninto  it.  Certainly I was a member of the Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  a number of years. While  I  was  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Singapore Improvement Trust, I was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Planning Committee. If the  Minister\r\n\r\nis  suggesting that there was corruption so far  as\r\n\r\nthe   Trustees  of  the  Planning  Committee   were\r\n\r\nconcerned, I would certainly ask him to  appoint  a\r\n\r\nCommission.  He  should appoint his Commission  and\r\n\r\nlet  us,  once and for all, put to rest  all  these\r\n\r\nunnecessary aspersions about corruption, this, that\r\n\r\nand  the  other,  when there is no proof.  For  the\r\n\r\nfirst two or three months of the Government, it  is\r\n\r\nall  right  for Members to say this,  that  or  the\r\n\r\nother.  But  let us get away from all these  stunts\r\n\r\nand  proceed with the work of Government,  and  not\r\n\r\nwith  the work of accusing people when there is  no\r\n\r\nsubstantial  proof.  If the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment must speak about the Planning Committee\r\n\r\nto  this  House, I think he should give a  truthful\r\n\r\npicture and not a distorted view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been listening very\r\n\r\ncarefully  to  the words of the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark.

Therefore, I must ask the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  to  indicate whether he meant a lie has  been\r\n\r\nstated  in this House, or whether what the Minister\r\n\r\nhas said is not true.

It is not correct to\r\n\r\nsay   that  the  Planning  Committee  had  complete\r\n\r\ndelegated  authority to say \"Yea\" or \"Nay\"  to  any\r\n\r\nplan. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  say  \"yes\", Mr Speaker, and if it  did  say\r\n\r\n\"yes\"   then   the   plan  would   be   implemented\r\n\r\nstraightaway. But if it did say \"no\", that was  not\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the matter, because any \"no\" from  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Committee  went  to  the  full  Board  of\r\n\r\nTrustees. It was the Board of Trustees who  decided\r\n\r\nwhether  it should be \"no\" or \"yes\". In any  event,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  said  that  the  previous  Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee did not assist those people who wanted to\r\n\r\ndevelop.  The true position is this: in respect  of\r\n\r\nevery  application which was to be rejected  or  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Planning Committee were not quite  sure\r\n\r\nabout  giving approval, the developer  was  invited\r\n\r\ninto  the  Committee  room. He  came  in  with  his\r\n\r\narchitect,  and the reasons against  approval  were\r\n\r\ngiven to the person concerned. Where the answer was\r\n\r\n\"no\"  he  was  told  that if he and  his  architect\r\n\r\namended  their plan in a certain way, if  they  did\r\n\r\nthis  or  if  they  did  not  do  that,  then   the\r\n\r\npossibility  was that they would be given  planning\r\n\r\napproval. But, of course, where the plan inherently\r\n\r\nwas such that it could not be approved, then it was\r\n\r\nturned  down  and the developer was  told  that  no\r\n\r\namount  of trying would help; and he was told  that\r\n\r\nin  no  uncertain terms. Where it was  possible  to\r\n\r\nalter   the   plan  to  bring  about  an  approval,\r\n\r\ncertainly  the  developer and  his  architect  were\r\n\r\ngiven an indication of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister talked about low-cost Housing. He talked about the one-room flat. Does he mean, by a\r\n\r\none-room  flat,  Mr Speaker, that there  would  be\r\n\r\ncooking  facilities?  Was it an  entirely  separate\r\n\r\ndomestic unit? In other words, was it just  a  one-room dormitory which he thinks is low-cost housing,\r\n\r\nor  does he mean, by one-room flat, a one-room bed-room, a sitting room, a kitchen, a bath-room and  a\r\n\r\nlavatory? He did not make that quite clear.  If  it\r\n\r\nwas  just  one-room in a tenament house, where  the\r\n\r\ntenants  have to have common facilities for cooking\r\n\r\nand  bathing,  then  his $20 rental  per  month  is\r\n\r\nexorbitant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not told the House how many units he hopes\r\n\r\nto  build for the year; and how many units of  one-room flats and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  many units of two-room flats he hopes to build\r\n\r\nwith this money. So, if we could have these answers\r\n\r\nplainly  and simply without embarking on a  tirade,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members would be grateful  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis present Budget debate has been a field day for\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members.

It is in  fact  Opposition\r\n\r\ntime in every parliament in the world.

I do  not  think  that  is\r\n\r\nirrelevant.

There is no denying the fact that all the\r\n\r\npressing claims of the various Ministries have been\r\n\r\nassiduously checked and re-checked and  trimmed  so\r\n\r\nthat  we have now a budget which has been acclaimed\r\n\r\nby  all  the  people of Singapore, which  has  been\r\n\r\ncalled an expansion budget, and which has even been\r\n\r\ncalled  a Christmas present.

We\r\n\r\nhave dealt with that already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Excuse me, Sir, those were all\r\n\r\njust  prefacing remarks. As we know, the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  did  say something about $400 million  for\r\n\r\nhousing. But, Sir, the whole budget next year  only\r\n\r\namounts to about $260 million. Therefore we  should\r\n\r\nlook at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings  in their proper perspective. Since  housing\r\n\r\nis  only one part of Government expenditure, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  expected  that  all the  money  should  go  to\r\n\r\nhousing. It is through the diligent working of  our\r\n\r\nMinisters that we have, as the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas  previously  said,  a budget  that  is  equally\r\n\r\nproportioned in all ways and in every direction, so\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore can really be proud of  her  budget\r\n\r\nwhich can be called a Christmas present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards housing, they have been belabouring\r\n\r\nthe point, and that is that, at the present moment,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government has not the staff and the\r\n\r\ntechnical  skill  to carry out  its  programme.  We\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  remind them that  with  all  their\r\n\r\ntechnical skill and all their staff in the previous\r\n\r\nyears,  the  previous Government  managed  only  to\r\n\r\nproduce   reservoirs  that  cracked,  houses   with\r\n\r\nfoundations  that  were  loose  and  which  finally\r\n\r\ntilted - I come from Queenstown and I happen to  know\r\n\r\na little about what happened to those houses there.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  something must have  gone  wrong\r\n\r\nbetween  the drawing board and the actual building.\r\n\r\nAnd   for   that,   I   think,  true   and   honest\r\n\r\nadministrative skill will have to be required. That\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government has not as yet demonstrated\r\n\r\nto the Opposition as regards housing. But it is not\r\n\r\ntoo  late for the Opposition to criticise after  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  shown  that we are  also  not  as  good\r\n\r\nworkers as the previous Government were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Member for Cairnhill wants to know how\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to  carry out an efficient  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme.

We must know the wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  we  must  satisfy  them.  Since   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  took  office,  corruption  in  the  old\r\n\r\nS.I.T. has  been eradicated. We started  our  true\r\n\r\nwork  from  August this year. At the Kampong  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  fire  site, the Kampong Koo Chye fire  site,\r\n\r\nand  the  Jalan  Eunos  Malay Settlement,  we  have\r\n\r\ncompleted   1,364   units   of   low-cost   houses.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  at  Macpherson Road there  are  2,368\r\n\r\nunits  of  houses.  We have done piling  for  these\r\n\r\nhouses.  By  the  end of this year,  we  expect  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  3,732  low-cost houses. We  are  able  to\r\n\r\ncomplete, within this period of 4 months, more than\r\n\r\n3,000  units of houses. This can be said  to  be  a\r\n\r\nvery noteworthy effort. The old Government was  far\r\n\r\nbehind this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell Members of this House that in 1955\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. planned to build houses for  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople  in  Jalan Eunos. But from 1955 to  1958  we\r\n\r\nstill saw that the place was as bald as the head of\r\n\r\na  Buddhist monk! But during the past few months of\r\n\r\nour  office,  the S.I.T. under the new  Government,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the local engineers and  architects,\r\n\r\nhave  started to build 100 detached houses together\r\n\r\nwith  50  two-room and a hail houses and 50  three-room  and  a  hall houses on the two  sites - Kampong\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru and Kampong Koo Chye. These houses will\r\n\r\nbe  completed in January next year and we will then\r\n\r\nlet  the Opposition Members see them. We hope  they\r\n\r\nwill  go  there  and see and appreciate  our  great\r\n\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, everyone has heard that the Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government  at that time expressed  beautiful\r\n\r\nsentiments  in  the Press, that it was  unfortunate\r\n\r\nfor  the  poor  people to suffer from these  fires.\r\n\r\nThey  promised to complete the building  of  houses\r\n\r\nwithin  a  period of three months for the  victims.\r\n\r\nBut  after  three  months had elapsed,  the  people\r\n\r\nstill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  not have the houses until the present  time,\r\n\r\nwhen  the P.A.P. took over the Government.

Because I see they are very interested\r\n\r\nin  this subject, I therefore address them.  Excuse\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this short period of a few months, we have completed many houses. We did not\r\n\r\nhave a lot of money to have this reorganised S.I.T.\r\n\r\nauthority. We know that for 1959 the old Government\r\n\r\nappropriated  a sum of $7 million for  the  S.I.T.,\r\n\r\nbut  in  1958 the money was more than $21  million.\r\n\r\nThere  was therefore a great difference. From this,\r\n\r\nwe  know that the old Government did not take  care\r\n\r\nof  the housing problem of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  simply  played their tactics  to  gain  their\r\n\r\npolitical positions. They understood that when  the\r\n\r\nnew Government took office the new Government would\r\n\r\nbe  faced with difficulties in tackling the housing\r\n\r\nproblem  with the sum of $7 million for the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nIn  this short period we have made use of only one-fourth  of  this amount. The Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment said that this time we are catering for\r\n\r\nthe majority of the poor people in respect of their\r\n\r\nhousing problems. Therefore we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild  houses at a low cost in order to  cater  for\r\n\r\nthe majority of the poor people. We have confidence\r\n\r\nin  the ability of our local engineers and are able\r\n\r\nto  utilise their talents. At present, we  have  in\r\n\r\nmind many sites suitable for building purposes.  We\r\n\r\nare  now waiting for the consultations between  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance to take place. After this,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat   in   1960  we  will  have  more   surprising\r\n\r\nachievements, and I hope, at that time,  every  one\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition Members will admire  our  great\r\n\r\nachievements, which are a reflection of the ability\r\n\r\nof this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I have heard at length the\r\n\r\nspeeches  from  the Government, from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nright   down   to   the  Government  back-benchers.\r\n\r\nOriginally  the  debate arose from  two  questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, how many houses can be built? Secondly where\r\n\r\nare  the  houses  to be built? Only two  questions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the debate has gone astray,  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that I myself am confused as to whether  we\r\n\r\nare  today discussing matters concerning the budget\r\n\r\ngenerally,  or matters concerning the  policies  of\r\n\r\nthe  past  Government. However,  since  I  was  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Housing in the past Government, it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate  for me to clarify one or  two  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think otherwise might lead to  confusion.\r\n\r\nJust  now  - the  Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\ntold  us  that  in  the Tiong Bahru  area  low-cost\r\n\r\nhouses have been built, at $1,544 per unit, whereas\r\n\r\nunder  the previous Government, such a house  would\r\n\r\ncost $2,260. This may be so, but we must not forget\r\n\r\nthat  the  house costing $2,260, unlike that  which\r\n\r\nwas  built  at  Tiong  Bahru, required  piling  or\r\n\r\nfoundation. Therefore the cost naturally was higher\r\n\r\ncompared  with the houses mentioned by the Minister\r\n\r\njust  now.  Similarly the houses at  Kallang - $4,159\r\n\r\nfor  a  two-room house. The present Government  say\r\n\r\nthey  could  build a similar type of house  costing\r\n\r\nonly $2,986.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, here again, in Kallang as you know, the houses which were built\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired   piling  and  therefore  the  cost   was\r\n\r\nsometimes one-third or one-fourth or so more  than\r\n\r\nthat of the present houses. So there is no need to\r\n\r\ncompare   the  houses  erected  by  the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  at a higher cost and those erected  by\r\n\r\nthe  present Government at a lower cost.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, the Minister surely can see the houses\r\n\r\nat  Bukit  Panjang  where there was  a  Government\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  erecting 2,500 units  of  two-room\r\n\r\nhouses complete with modern sanitation. Their cost\r\n\r\nwas  low. The reason why it was possible to  build\r\n\r\nsuch  houses at a low cost was that there  was  no\r\n\r\nnecessity for piling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which he referred to just now is\r\n\r\nabout the so-called `flying saucer' type of house.\r\n\r\nThe  house  was built in 1954 before Tun  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock's  government came into power. It  was  built\r\n\r\nduring  the  Colonial  government.  Therefore  the\r\n\r\nblame  cannot be shifted on to us. Another  point;\r\n\r\none of the Government Members said that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  during  a space of  six  months,  has\r\n\r\nmanaged to build 1,664 houses. If that is true,  I\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Government. But in  my  opinion,\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to build these houses were  formulated\r\n\r\nby  the previous Government, in the same way as in\r\n\r\nApril  1955, when the Coalition Government assumed\r\n\r\noffice, we carried on with the work of the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Therefore, since 1955,  houses  which\r\n\r\nwere  erected then were not as a result  of  plans\r\n\r\nformulated by the Government of Mr David Marshall\r\n\r\nor Tun Lim Yew Hock. They were merely carried over\r\n\r\nfrom the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which was raised in the debate\r\n\r\nconcerned housing in the Malay Settlement at Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos.  This scheme, Mr Speaker, was from my  own\r\n\r\nplan.  The previous Government originally did  not\r\n\r\nagree to this scheme but because I pressed on with\r\n\r\nit,  not as a Minister but as a representative  of\r\n\r\nthe electorate there, the Government then accepted\r\n\r\nthe  scheme. Agreement was reached only  in  1958,\r\n\r\nnot  in  the early part of 1958, but in the latter\r\n\r\npart.  The site is on Crown land but we have  made\r\n\r\nprovision whereby we would put aside\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney to the amount of $384,000 for the purpose of\r\n\r\nbuilding  120  houses  to be  sold  to  successful\r\n\r\napplicants for Crown land in the Malay Settlement.\r\n\r\nSo  it  cannot be said that this matter  has  been\r\n\r\ndelayed.  We  have already prepared a  scheme  and\r\n\r\nmoney  has  been  allocated.  At  that  time   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was in negotiation with the applicants\r\n\r\nfor  land  in  the Malay Settlement.  But  because\r\n\r\nthese   approved  applicants  were  the   would-be\r\n\r\npurchasers of the houses, the negotiations between\r\n\r\nthe  Land Office and the applicants for land  were\r\n\r\nnecessarily  protracted for  some  time,  until  a\r\n\r\nMalay-house   type  of  plan  was   agreed   upon.\r\n\r\nAgreement  was  reached early this  year.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  the  elections  came  and  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment was obliged to proceed with the scheme.\r\n\r\nBut from what I hear it seems that the Govvernment\r\n\r\nhas  altered slightly the original scheme  from  a\r\n\r\nMalay-type of house to another type of house. This\r\n\r\nis the responsibility of this Government. I do not\r\n\r\nintend  to dwell at length on this subject  except\r\n\r\nto  say  that  the  housing scheme  in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nSettlement  was  originally  a  scheme  which   we\r\n\r\nformulated.  Mr Speaker, that briefly  is  all  I\r\n\r\nwish to comment on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the query from the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Member for Cairnhill, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, and the Member for Tanglin and  also\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Member for Geylang Serai, I am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that  this is a small and simple  matter.\r\n\r\nOur  Government  proposes to formulate  a  housing\r\n\r\nscheme with that $25 million, and we are sure that\r\n\r\nwe  can  carry  out  the programme.

The object of  building\r\n\r\nlow-cost  houses  in the Malay  Settlement  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  houses for the lower income  group,  say,\r\n\r\nfor those drawing less than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$400  a month. But if we examine carefully the list\r\n\r\nof successful applicants who received allocation of\r\n\r\nCrown  land  in the Malay Settlement we  will  find\r\n\r\nthat they were not the hawkers or taxi-drivers, but\r\n\r\nthey  were,  shall we say, people from the  middle-class group. There was no opportunity for the lower\r\n\r\nincome group. When this Government assumed office I\r\n\r\ndiscovered   that  the  previous   Government   had\r\n\r\nallocated  not $380,000 but $340,000 to build  low-cost  houses.  Among the applicants, I  found  some\r\n\r\nwho,  when the allocation for land was approved  in\r\n\r\nJune, had hurriedly built their houses without,  in\r\n\r\nthe  first place, submitting their plans or waiting\r\n\r\nfor  approval from the Land Office, as though  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to  avail themselves of the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nbuild  these houses before the old Government  went\r\n\r\nout  of  office.  We found that houses  were  built\r\n\r\nbefore   plans   were  submitted  to   the   proper\r\n\r\nauthorities.   Hence   there   was   a   delay   in\r\n\r\nimplementing the low-cost housing scheme. This  was\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the allocation of Crown land in the\r\n\r\nMalay  Settlement  was  not abused.  Now,  we  have\r\n\r\naltered  slightly  the  type  of  house  from   the\r\n\r\noriginal  type. If we adhere to the original  plan,\r\n\r\nwith  that  little amount of money  only  very  few\r\n\r\nhouses  could be erected. Therefore, with a  slight\r\n\r\namendment  to the former Malay-type of  house,  and\r\n\r\nwith the same amount of money, more houses could be\r\n\r\nbuilt,  which  means that more poor people  can  be\r\n\r\nhoused  in  the  Malay Settlement. On  this  scheme\r\n\r\ntenders  have been invited and accepted,  and  work\r\n\r\nhas already commenced, and I think, within the next\r\n\r\ntwo or three months, we will be able to see some of\r\n\r\nthe   down-trodden   masses  live   in   a   better\r\n\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I feel very strange to see  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  are nervous,  perhaps  because\r\n\r\nthey think they were accused by us, but they do not\r\n\r\nknow   that  our  Ministers  and  colleagues   have\r\n\r\nanswered them very correctly and fully. One of them\r\n\r\nhas asked where the places will be for building low-cost houses next year. But the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister has already explained it. They will be  in\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru,  Geylang, Aljunied.  Furthermore,  we\r\n\r\nhave said that the cost of a one-room flat, if I am\r\n\r\nnot  wrong, is $13,400, and of a two-room flat,  it\r\n\r\nis  $22,060.  Did the Opposition Members  not  hear\r\n\r\nthese  words,  or were they sleeping? Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\njust now our colleagues have said that we cater for\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the poorer people in respect of their\r\n\r\nhousing  problems.

As  my  colleague,  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai, has said, the question of  erecting\r\n\r\nMalay-type houses in the Malay Settlement was under\r\n\r\nhis   charge.  For  my  part,  I  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  today for looking after my constituency\r\n\r\nand  building houses; this matter is now well taken\r\n\r\ncare of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two points which I wish to\r\n\r\ndirect  to the Member for Bukit Timah, who is  also\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of  the  Malay Settlement  at  Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos, whether \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Bukit Timah is the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational Development, so he ought to be referred to\r\n\r\nas the Parliamentary Secretary of that Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

To  the   best   of   my\r\n\r\nknowledge,  I know that many people have registered\r\n\r\nfor  building  sites  for the purpose  of  building\r\n\r\nhouses,  with  Government help or  with  their  own\r\n\r\nmoney. Are these selections made in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  plans carried out by a committee which was set\r\n\r\nup previously, or how are the selections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade?  Another point - as far as I know, most of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  whether Malays, Chinese or  Indians,  need\r\n\r\nlow-cost houses so that they may be able to get the\r\n\r\nhelp  of  the Government, and at the same time  pay\r\n\r\nmonthly  instalments. Will the Government  increase\r\n\r\nthe number of houses which are being built in Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos, or will they go for a new type of house,  or\r\n\r\nis  the  Government scheme as cheap as  the  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich is carried out now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, can the Government clarify\r\n\r\nwhether   the   successful  applicants   can   make\r\n\r\napplication with a view to getting Government help?\r\n\r\nAre   such   applications  entertained?  Are   such\r\n\r\napplications  included  in  this  budget   of   $25\r\n\r\nmillion? I ask these questions because I know  many\r\n\r\nof the applicants coming from that constituency and\r\n\r\nI  know  their troubles. There are people who  made\r\n\r\napplications many years back, but owing to lack  of\r\n\r\nfunds  they  were forced to borrow  or  pawn  their\r\n\r\nbelongings. It is entirely up to them  now.  So  in\r\n\r\norder  to avoid the hardships they have experienced\r\n\r\nand  to  save them from getting into debt  in  that\r\n\r\nmanner,  can the Government be generous  enough  to\r\n\r\nloan them money?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But\r\n\r\nsince  you  have allowed that, I will  reply.  This\r\n\r\nmatter  does not come under the scope  of  the  $25\r\n\r\nmillion vote. Therefore, there is no need for me to\r\n\r\nreply  to  the  queries raised by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the item of\r\n\r\n$25  million  appearing as  loans  to  the  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority, the Minister for National Development in\r\n\r\nhis  speech to the Assembly just now said  that  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  rentals  are concerned (rentals  which  he\r\n\r\nproposes  to  charge),  there  will  be  no  hidden\r\n\r\nsubsidies.  Could  the Minister  therefore  in  his\r\n\r\nreply to us also inform the House, particularly  as\r\n\r\nthe item appears as loans to the Housing Authority,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government  proposes  to  charge  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority any interest, and  if  so,  what\r\n\r\ninterest;  whether  it is on an annuity  basis,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it is a loan which has to be paid back  to\r\n\r\nthe Government in 10 years, 20 years or 30 years in\r\n\r\nrespect of which the Housing Authority will set  up\r\n\r\na sinking fund?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will turn to pages 430\r\n\r\nand  432, the Singapore Improvement Trust, to  whom\r\n\r\nmoneys were lent under items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6,  7,\r\n\r\nand 8. These moneys were lent from time to time and\r\n\r\nthe  manner  of the repayments is set  out  on  the\r\n\r\nrespective opposite pages. The total amounts repaid\r\n\r\non  the  sums  already lent to the  Trust  come  to\r\n\r\nalmost $4.75 million. I raise this question  for  a\r\n\r\nspecific  purpose. In the rentals which  the  Trust\r\n\r\nhas fixed for these properties, there is an element\r\n\r\nfor  the repayment of interest to Government. There\r\n\r\nis  a  further  element in respect of  the  amounts\r\n\r\nwhich  are annually repayable to Government on  the\r\n\r\ncapital  account. For a number of years, the  Trust\r\n\r\nhad  been trying to persuade the Government  either\r\n\r\nto  give  these moneys as an outright gift  to  the\r\n\r\nTrust or, if the Government did not find itself  in\r\n\r\na  position to give it as a gift, at least  not  to\r\n\r\ncharge  interest. The reason for the  Trust  asking\r\n\r\nfor  that position to be achieved, Mr Speaker, was\r\n\r\nthis: that if the moneys were given to the Trust by\r\n\r\nway of a gift, then the Trust could reduce by about\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  cent  the rentals and, therefore,  the  public\r\n\r\nwould  enjoy  the benefit of these  reduced  rents.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is relevant for this House  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether this $25 million, which is about to be lent\r\n\r\nto  the Housing Authority by the Government,  is  a\r\n\r\nloan  by  way  of  interest, or whether  it  is  an\r\n\r\noutright  gift;  or if it is a loan, in  how  many\r\n\r\nyears would it be repayable, or whether there is to\r\n\r\nbe an annuity charge?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister would like to\r\n\r\nwind up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park is still thinking in terms of the  old\r\n\r\nS.I.T.,  when the S.I.T. fought with the Government\r\n\r\nfor  lower interest or no interest, or for  a  free\r\n\r\ngift,  on  their  loans for housing  purposes.  The\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party Government do not  think  on\r\n\r\nthe  same lines in finance. We do not like, as  the\r\n\r\nChinese  proverb says, \"To cut out the left  sleeve\r\n\r\nof  the  shirt in order to patch the right sleeve.\"\r\n\r\nThis is, after all, an inter-governmental item.  If\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. do not have to pay interest on the loan,\r\n\r\nit  means the Ministry of Finance has to incur  the\r\n\r\ncost  of borrowing the money from the public, which\r\n\r\nmight mean less hospitals and less schools. On  the\r\n\r\nsame  basis, if no interest is charged on loans  to\r\n\r\nother  boards  like the Telephone Board,  it  might\r\n\r\nmean  less  houses.  Mr  Speaker,  we  work  on  a\r\n\r\ndifferent system. The Government is a whole set-up,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  a  Ministry or a department  or  a\r\n\r\nstatutory corporation. The Ministry of Finance does\r\n\r\ncharge  interest on the loans, but the  details  of\r\n\r\nthe  loans, the rate of interest and the  repayment\r\n\r\nterms  have not been settled. They will be  settled\r\n\r\nin due course, but I wish to assure the House that,\r\n\r\nwhatever they are, it makes no difference at all to\r\n\r\nthe functions of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the S.I.T. was more or less\r\n\r\nindependent of Government control, subject only  to\r\n\r\nits  Yearly  Report to the Minister for  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing.  In  those circumstances, the persons  who\r\n\r\nran  the S.I.T., namely the Trustees, and the civil\r\n\r\nservants in the S.I.T., always thought in terms  of\r\n\r\ngetting more concessions for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves - less  interest  or,  if   possible,   an\r\n\r\noutright loan or getting an outright gift to  build\r\n\r\nhouses.  This would mean more money for the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nThis  would  also  mean more chances  of  receiving\r\n\r\ncorruption,   in  the  meantime   to   fulfil   its\r\n\r\nconstruction of so many units per year, at  rentals\r\n\r\nwith hidden subsidies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe in charging rentals by such\r\n\r\nmethods,  because  it is not a  real  reduction  of\r\n\r\ncosts.  A  real reduction of costs is  achieved  by\r\n\r\nchecking  corruption  and having  better  planning,\r\n\r\nlayout and sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the debate began on the budget, we have heard hon. Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition talking of nothing else on housing,  but\r\n\r\nthat  there are no plans, no units being built,  no\r\n\r\narchitects and engineers, and that nothing  can  be\r\n\r\ndone. Mr Speaker, this is not the first time  that\r\n\r\nI  have  heard these allegations. As  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,  I have heard them many months ago. There  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  certain  section of the  people  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  who believe that when the expatriates  are\r\n\r\nbeing  replaced by local people, what can the local\r\n\r\npeople  do?  This section could be the  expatriates\r\n\r\nwho  still  stay in this country, or  it  could  be\r\n\r\nthose  local people who have no faith  in  our  own\r\n\r\npeople running this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that in the next few months more of\r\n\r\nsuch  questions will come: no expatriate architects\r\n\r\nin  the  S.I.T. and the P.W.D.; no schools will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  because we have no expatriate engineers  and\r\n\r\narchitects; no houses will be completed; no  plans,\r\n\r\nno  specifications, no programmes, nothing at  all.\r\n\r\nWhat  can  our local people do? Just  now  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven complete proof that our local architects  and\r\n\r\nengineers and local management can do as  good  as,\r\n\r\nif  not  better than, the expatriates whom we  have\r\n\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the struggle against colonialism in this country still carries on, and this is a part\r\n\r\nof  the  struggle.  Some might  say  that  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  is divorced from politics, but I say  that\r\n\r\nin  the  matter  of  building  hospitals,  schools,\r\n\r\nhouses, politics comes in. Even in the case of  the\r\n\r\nRent Conciliation Board,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in the approving of plans. The hon.

The\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park was trying to play up  this\r\n\r\n$415  million programme which we have planned  out.\r\n\r\nThe   S.I.T. had  put  up  this  programme,   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  it leaked out and was  published  in\r\n\r\nthe  Press.  This  programme shows  the  organising\r\n\r\nability  of  the S.I.T. It does not  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will carry out the programme.  It  says\r\n\r\nthat the S.I.T. recognises the need for housing and\r\n\r\nthat it has the organisation ready to carry out the\r\n\r\nbuilding of so many houses. But, Mr Speaker, as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  lavish spending  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and even after the \"windfall\"  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  sale of Christmas Island for $20 million to  a\r\n\r\nforeign  government, we cannot do  better  than  to\r\n\r\nallocate $25 million for housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Cairnhill said that his\r\n\r\nGovernment  had allocated $30 million in  1957.

We  are\r\n\r\ncomparing what the Lim Yew Hock Government had done\r\n\r\nin  its  first year and what the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhas  done in its first year. In the 1955-6  Budget,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  the first Budget of the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment,  $9 million was allocated  to  housing;\r\n\r\nwhereas   in   the  first  Budget  of  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, $25 million has been allocated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  housing.

Government.  It  takes  nearly  a  year  to\r\n\r\ncomplete the framing of a budget. When we came into\r\n\r\noffice, the budget was more or less completed,  and\r\n\r\nwe  could  only make certain amendments, and  there\r\n\r\nwas  not enough time for each department to  submit\r\n\r\ndetailed  schemes of development. That is why,  you\r\n\r\nwill  notice, Mr Speaker, that in the  Development\r\n\r\nBudget  as well as in the Main Estimates for  1960,\r\n\r\nmost   of  the  items  have  a  qualifying  clause,\r\n\r\n\"Subject  to  Treasury sanction\".  There  are  many\r\n\r\nitems  for  the benefit of rural development.  But,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, until we have finalised  the  details\r\n\r\nwith  the Ministry of Finance, I am sorry we cannot\r\n\r\nrelease them. But we will do so as soon as we  have\r\n\r\nfinalised the details with the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is there something so very top secret\r\n\r\nabout these projects for 1960 that the House cannot\r\n\r\nknow what they are?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the field of rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment is entirely new. Despite the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe previous Chief Minister had the so-called Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment Commissioner's Office placed under  his\r\n\r\ndirect  charge,  what  had  the  Commission   done?\r\n\r\nPractically nothing at all. For the first  time  in\r\n\r\nthis  country, the Government is looking after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the farmers and those who live  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. The $800,000 allocated for 1960 would\r\n\r\nbe  mainly  devoted to the development of  projects\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of farmers and fishermen. In order\r\n\r\nto  be able to meet the demands of these 30,000  to\r\n\r\n40,000  families of farmers and fishermen who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  completely neglected in the past, we  require\r\n\r\nmany millions of dollars. As in the case of housing\r\n\r\nwhich we have debated just now, there is a shortage\r\n\r\nof  funds  in  the  Government.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has done his best to allocate $800,000  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of rural development.  This  $800,000\r\n\r\nwill not go a long way, but we have to be satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  what we can get at the moment. We have a long\r\n\r\nlist  of  things which we want to do; for instance,\r\n\r\nthe  Sungei  Poyang project, where it  is  intended\r\n\r\nthat  swamps  should be reclaimed in order  that  a\r\n\r\nsection  could  be  used for prawn  ponds,  another\r\n\r\nsection  could  be  used for the rearing  of  fresh\r\n\r\nwater  fish, and the upper reaches of the river  to\r\n\r\nbe  reclaimed  and  used  for  the  cultivation  of\r\n\r\nvegetables.  We  have  also in  mind  projects  for\r\n\r\nhelping  fishermen, by the construction of  jetties\r\n\r\nin  order  that they can land their fish much  more\r\n\r\neasily,  and other aids to fishermen. We have  also\r\n\r\nschemes  to  help the co-operatives;  how  to  grow\r\n\r\ntapioca  on a mass scale; investigations  into  the\r\n\r\nbreeding of chickens and pigs; investigations  into\r\n\r\nthe     scientific    growing    of     vegetables;\r\n\r\ninvestigations into the best conversion  ratio  for\r\n\r\npig-feed  and  chicken-feed, and  many  other  such\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has limited funds. We are faced with competing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemands on the limited amount of  money  at\r\n\r\nour  disposal. In the Department of Rural  Welfare,\r\n\r\nwe  are  also  faced  with the same  problem-  many\r\n\r\ncompeting  demands for the amount  of  money  which\r\n\r\nthis  Government can afford to give. When  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided  on the priorities in conjunction with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, Mr Speaker, we shall disclose\r\n\r\nthe  details  in full and there will be opportunity\r\n\r\nthen for the Member for Farrer Park to ask all  the\r\n\r\nquestions he wants to ask in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, it would appear that the\r\n\r\nMinister's  admission  is this:  that  although  he\r\n\r\nwould like to spend very much more than $800,000 on\r\n\r\nhis  rural development projects, he has been unable\r\n\r\nto  agree with the Minister for Finance as  to  the\r\n\r\nexact  projects which the Minister would allow  him\r\n\r\nto  carry  forward during the year 1960. I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish   to   embarrass  the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment at this juncture, but I would  like  to\r\n\r\nremind  him that once this House passes this  vote,\r\n\r\nit  has no further control over the spending of the\r\n\r\nmoney, except for the Minister for Finance in whose\r\n\r\nsafe  hands we can commit it to.

The  Member for Farrer Park has no  confidence\r\n\r\nbecause  he  thinks the expatriate  engineers  have\r\n\r\nscooted  from  the P.W.D. The construction  of  the\r\n\r\nlink  road, Jurong Road/Chua Chu Kang Road, is  now\r\n\r\nin  progress and by the end of 1959, $200,000  will\r\n\r\nhave  been spent. An additional amount of  $213,000\r\n\r\nis  needed in order to complete the whole length of\r\n\r\nthe   road,   which  is  about  2\ufffd   miles.   The\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   the  link  road,   West   Coast\r\n\r\nRoad/Jurong  Road, is an extension  of  the  former\r\n\r\nroad,  so  that we can link up West Coast  Road  to\r\n\r\nChua  Chu  Kang/Lim Chu Kang area.  In  the  normal\r\n\r\nprocess,  this road would take about two  years  to\r\n\r\ncomplete.  The total cost is $350,000. $200,000  is\r\n\r\nbeing  earmarked  for the first  year  and  another\r\n\r\n$150,000 is required in 1961 to complete the  work.\r\n\r\nThe  construction  of a third road,  a  link  road,\r\n\r\nSerangoon Garden Estate/Braddell Road, and  another\r\n\r\nnew  road, Boundary Road/Jalan Teck Kee,  have  not\r\n\r\nyet been started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under the old government and for that matter under the old City Council, there were\r\n\r\nalways  items  of  capital expenditure  which  were\r\n\r\npassed  from  year to year. The Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark is so used to such a habit that he thinks that\r\n\r\nother   governments  would  also   like   to   pass\r\n\r\nexpenditure from year to year.

In such cases, they would be in greater need\r\n\r\nof   work  than  those  young  people  without  any\r\n\r\ndependants.

We  are  going to  start  afresh.  The\r\n\r\nprevious   Government,  when  the  elections   were\r\n\r\ndrawing  very near, started to think  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nrelief  work  for the unemployed. On 1st  December,\r\n\r\n1958, they started planning for unemployment relief\r\n\r\nwith  a  view to building up to a maximum of  about\r\n\r\n850  by  the 16th of January. Circulars  that  were\r\n\r\nissued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprove all this. They also appointed a committee  on\r\n\r\n23rd  December, 1958, with the following  terms  or\r\n\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To investigate the existing conditions of the\r\n\r\nunemployment and the under-employment situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and to make their report thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To consider the existing categories and\r\n\r\ngrades  of  skills  and  to recommend  priority  as\r\n\r\nregards  training for such skills and  others  that\r\n\r\nmay  be  envisaged and the educational  requirement\r\n\r\nthere-for, and to make recommendations for  a  full\r\n\r\nemployment policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That committee was appointed on 23rd December,\r\n\r\n1958,  with  those terms of reference.  I  had  the\r\n\r\npleasure  of winding it up because we have  got  to\r\n\r\nget  down  to  the  task of finding  work  for  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  and not appointing committees  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  reasons  why there  is  unemployment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the purpose of our plans and the object in view was adequately explained by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance in this House  on  the  25th\r\n\r\nNovember,  and I do not propose to repeat  what  he\r\n\r\nalready said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question of the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  I  would say that  it  is  proposed  to\r\n\r\nrecruit through the unemployment register,  but  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of age and need. We do not disregard the\r\n\r\nclaims  of those who are already working under  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government's unemployment scheme. They are\r\n\r\na  mixed  bag,  as  I have said  so  publicly  once\r\n\r\nbefore.  Some  of  them are well  reported  on  but\r\n\r\nothers have bad reports. So it is our intention not\r\n\r\nto discriminate against those people and, as far as\r\n\r\npossible,  to  employ  those  who  have  been  well\r\n\r\nreported on in our scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to organise young people on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of age and need into work brigades,  and  we\r\n\r\npropose  to  have a separate brigade for  women.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Member  for  Mountbatten  will  interest\r\n\r\nherself  in these work brigades. We will  make  her\r\n\r\nthe brigade commander too, if she wants to!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a report from the officials who have\r\n\r\nlooked  into the previous Government's unemployment\r\n\r\nrelief  scheme. They said the scheme has not worked\r\n\r\nwell, because many of the labourers who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  recruited  were unemployable on  the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat  since they were unemployed for so many  years\r\n\r\nthey were not amenable to discipline. Also, many of\r\n\r\nthem  were  employed from the areas in  which  they\r\n\r\nlived.  We do not propose to recruit on that basis.\r\n\r\nWe  propose to recruit through the register, and we\r\n\r\ndo  not  restrict the recruitment to any particular\r\n\r\nlocality. The recruitment will be done on the basis\r\n\r\nof  age  and need and according to suitability  for\r\n\r\nthe job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that we are now\r\n\r\nmaking  detailed  plans and  are  processing  these\r\n\r\nplans  with the various departments concerned.  One\r\n\r\nof  our first duties would be to recruit and  train\r\n\r\nthe  leaders that we shall need for these projects.\r\n\r\nOnly those with a sense of dedication and duty will\r\n\r\nbe  specifically picked for this work, for  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House must realise that masses of  workmen\r\n\r\nwho  are employed on projects and who are not  well\r\n\r\nselected  or badly supervised and under  inadequate\r\n\r\nleadership   could   easily   degenerate   into   a\r\n\r\ndisorganised  rabble,  and  thereby  frustrate  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention. However, every  precaution\r\n\r\nwill  be taken to ensure that this does not happen,\r\n\r\nand advance information will be given to the people\r\n\r\nas and when works on these projects are undertaken.\r\n\r\nThat is all I propose to say at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   concerning   the   subject   under\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  this  House has just  heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law as to how he is  going\r\n\r\nto  carry  out his programme, that is,  how  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing to spend this vote on the unemployed. As  has\r\n\r\nbeen  clarified, one of the schemes is to form work\r\n\r\nbrigades  comprising youths who are considered  fit\r\n\r\nand  suitable  to  be  engaged in  any  development\r\n\r\nprojects for Singapore. Here, Mr Speaker,  I  wish\r\n\r\nto  give a little criticism because the problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment is indeed the same problem everywhere.\r\n\r\nIt  exists in every country. It is indeed a problem\r\n\r\nwhich  cannot altogether be overcome. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law, with his specific\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to solve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunemployment problem, must necessarily  concentrate\r\n\r\non  giving employment to the unemployed,  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  register  of  the unemployed,  who  have  been\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  a considerable length of time.  These\r\n\r\nregistered  unemployed persons  have  been  waiting\r\n\r\nanxiously  as  to  when they  can  get  employment.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  they  have  responsibilities  to   their\r\n\r\ndependants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think it is more appropriate that, in\r\n\r\ngiving  employment to the youth, or if we wish  the\r\n\r\nyouth to work with the object of building the State\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  this  should  be  done  through  the\r\n\r\nsponsorship of bodies or community centres which we\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Minister  himself  is  trying   to\r\n\r\ndevelop.  Therefore, I fail to see if there  is  an\r\n\r\nalternative  way in order to instil the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nawareness  among the youth. If we  do  not  recruit\r\n\r\nfrom  the unemployed persons who have been  on  the\r\n\r\nregister for a considerable length of time, and  if\r\n\r\nthe  jobs  are  given  to the youths  who  have  no\r\n\r\ndependants,  then it is not fair to the  unemployed\r\n\r\nwith dependants, who have at least two or three  or\r\n\r\nfour  or  five children, aged mothers, and likewise\r\n\r\naged  fathers, who are unable to work  any  longer.\r\n\r\nThat  is  my only criticism. I think, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthis  scheme  should not be used by the  Government\r\n\r\nmerely  to  recruit youths. But priority should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  those who have been on the waiting  list\r\n\r\nfor  a long time. By so doing, we are helping  also\r\n\r\nthe dependants of the unemployed persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I would remind the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  the Southern Islands of the  good  old\r\n\r\nproverb: \"While ignorance is bliss, it is folly  to\r\n\r\nbe  wise.\" If he understood anything of the way  we\r\n\r\nregister  the unemployed, he would understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  registration means very little  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nNow,  people register and re-register for jobs.  If\r\n\r\nyou  fail  to re-register - you might have registered\r\n\r\nin  1949  or 1954 - you are still treated  as  a  new\r\n\r\nregistrant.  The  whole  register  system  is   one\r\n\r\ncomplete  shambles.  We have tried  to  bring  some\r\n\r\norder  into  the present chaos. Since becoming  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, we have asked the unemployed, who  have\r\n\r\npreviously  registered to reregister  their  names,\r\n\r\nand, as a result, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave today a new register of about 25,000 people on\r\n\r\nwhom  we can draw for our needs for this new labour\r\n\r\nforce.

Such  a  thing   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely and entirely stupid, and you can  depend\r\n\r\non  it  that this Government does the right  thing,\r\n\r\nand does not indulge in complete crass stupidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

They were found completely  unsuitable\r\n\r\nfor the type of work they were required to do under\r\n\r\nvarious capital development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme that the previous Government\r\n\r\nintroduced  was  to  give first preference  to  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  on  our public  assistance  relief\r\n\r\nregister.  Those who are on public  assistance  get\r\n\r\nthe first preference because, if you get them a job\r\n\r\non  this  project, that means you pay out  less  on\r\n\r\npublic  assistance. That is a thing  that  we  must\r\n\r\nlook  at also. We must also look at the suitability\r\n\r\nof  the  people for this job. We must also look  at\r\n\r\ntheir  age;  we  must also look at their  need.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  have, as I pointed out to  Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House yesterday, already increased the public\r\n\r\nassistance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvote   considerably  since   we   have   been   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  When  we came in, we  found  that  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  had voted  $5.5  million  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance. We immediately  increased  that\r\n\r\nfigure  to  $6.7 million and we have  taken  it  up\r\n\r\nfurther  to  $7.5 million for next  year,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are cases of real need they  will  be\r\n\r\ncatered for under our public assistance scheme. But\r\n\r\nwe  will  try to reduce the pressure on our  public\r\n\r\nassistance scheme as much as possible. If there are\r\n\r\npeople  who  are on public assistance and  who  are\r\n\r\nsuitable  for these jobs, we will give  them  these\r\n\r\njobs  so  that  we  can use the  public  assistance\r\n\r\nscheme   to  its  best  advantage,  i.e. for   the\r\n\r\nassistance of those who are really in need. That is\r\n\r\nhow we propose to work this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it\r\n\r\nseems  that  the Minister for Labour  and  Law  has\r\n\r\ndifferent  views from those that I have  expressed.\r\n\r\nOf course, on the question of administration, as to\r\n\r\nhow   he  is  going  to  give  employment  to   the\r\n\r\nunemployed  by  introducing a new system,  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  his  opinion. I know the position well,  that\r\n\r\nall the unemployed are required to reregister. What\r\n\r\nI intend to convey actually is, how are we going to\r\n\r\nsolve   the  unemployment  problem?  Some  of   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  for employment should  be  given  to\r\n\r\nthose youths whose responsibilities are lesser than\r\n\r\nthose  of  the unemployed who have more dependants.\r\n\r\nUnemployment  relief can be made through  community\r\n\r\ncentres  and an appropriate allowance can be  given\r\n\r\naccording to the days and number of hours worked on\r\n\r\na  certain  project. If, however, we are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  permanent work brigades, I think  this  is  a\r\n\r\nsystem  which is already outside the scope  of  our\r\n\r\nobject of giving relief to unemployed persons  with\r\n\r\nmany  dependants - wife  and  children.  I  give   an\r\n\r\nexample. We should not encourage the people so that\r\n\r\nthey make it a habit of asking for relief from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. This will weaken the spirit,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill get used to merely asking for relief from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In the case of a person  who  receives\r\n\r\npublic   assistance,  we  know  that  it   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficient for his livelihood and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat of his family - that it is not enough especially\r\n\r\nif  he  has children who are still in school. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom   their  clothing,  they  require  money   for\r\n\r\ntextbooks,  etc. With these necessary expenses,  if\r\n\r\nthe  father  receives aid from the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment,  it will be a problem for him  to  find\r\n\r\nextra money to spend on books and things like that.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Government provides free  textbooks,\r\n\r\nexercise books have to be paid for, as also  sports\r\n\r\nfees  and  other  miscellaneous things.  These  all\r\n\r\nrequire  to be paid for. Hence I am of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  as  regards  this scheme of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law,  part  of the  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nemployment should be opened to the unemployed  with\r\n\r\ndependants. For the unemployed youth, we  can  find\r\n\r\nalternative  ways  to  give  them  jobs,  say,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, voluntary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I have already made the\r\n\r\nposition  clear,  that  it  is  our  intention,  to\r\n\r\nrecruit into these work brigades those who  are  at\r\n\r\npresent  employed  under the previous  Government's\r\n\r\nrelief  scheme,  and  most of them  are  not  young\r\n\r\npeople.  Most  of them are people who  are  married\r\n\r\nwith families. Those who have got good reports will\r\n\r\nbe  readily  accepted  in our  scheme.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nintended that the scheme should be restricted  only\r\n\r\nto  the  young  people -  the pemuda  and  pemudi - as\r\n\r\nreferred to by the Member for the Southern Islands.\r\n\r\nBut  they  would  be a fairly representative  group\r\n\r\ntaken from a cross-section of our unemployed people\r\n\r\nin the State.

As  a  result  of this conference,  certain\r\n\r\nagreements were made and these agreements have been\r\n\r\nincluded in the United Kingdom Shipping Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, being a free port for the ships of the\r\n\r\nworld,   should   rightly  have  uniform   shipping\r\n\r\nlegislation  in harmony with those countries  which\r\n\r\nsend their ships to our port. It is the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill to include certain provisions which have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  in  the  international  convention   at\r\n\r\nBrussels of 1957. The objects of this Bill  briefly\r\n\r\nare twofold:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To extend the limits of the scope of\r\n\r\nliability;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To increase the quantum of liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present under section 340 (1) (c) and (d) of the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Ordinance, the liability of  ship-owners\r\n\r\nin  cases of loss of life, personal injury and loss\r\n\r\nof  property to a person in another vessel  extends\r\n\r\nonly   to   occurrences  by  reason   of   improper\r\n\r\nnavigation  or management of a ship. A new  section\r\n\r\n340  in clause 4 of the Bill extends this liability\r\n\r\nto  include  the  infringement  of  any  right  and\r\n\r\nextends its application to acts or omissions by any\r\n\r\npersons  (whether aboard the ship or  not)  in  the\r\n\r\nnavigation  or  management of the ship  or  in  its\r\n\r\ncargo  handling,  or passenger movements.  The  new\r\n\r\nsection  340 also extends application of  liability\r\n\r\nto  any other acts or omission of persons aboard  a\r\n\r\nship. The new section 340, clause 1 paragraphs  (i)\r\n\r\nand  (ii),  changes  the limits of  a  ship-owner's\r\n\r\nliability in the cases I have mentioned earlier. In\r\n\r\ncases of death or injury, either alone or together,\r\n\r\nwith any loss or damage to property or infringement\r\n\r\nof  any right, the existing limit of \ufffd15 per ton of\r\n\r\nthe ship's tonnage is replaced by 3,100 gold francs\r\n\r\nper  ton  of  the ship's tonnage. This  is  roughly\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  Malayan  $634  per  ton  of  ship's\r\n\r\ntonnage.  For  loss of or damage to  property,  the\r\n\r\npresent  limit is \ufffd8, or roughly Malayan  $68,  per\r\n\r\nton  of  the  ships tonnage. The new limit  is  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  in  Singapore currency  of  1,000  gold\r\n\r\nfrancs which approximates to Malayan $205.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (4) of the new section 340 extends\r\n\r\nliability  under subsection (1) to  occurrences  in\r\n\r\nconnection with disposal of wrecks. Subsection  (8)\r\n\r\nenables   the  Minister  to  set  up  a  fund   for\r\n\r\ncompensating  the harbour or conservancy  authority\r\n\r\nin respect of any reduction in the sums recoverable\r\n\r\nby  the  authority resulting from the operating  of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (4).

Because  ships\r\n\r\nsail  along international highways of the  sea  and\r\n\r\ncall  at foreign ports in which the law of the land\r\n\r\nmight differ considerably from the law of their own\r\n\r\nnative   land.   It   is  easy  to   imagine   what\r\n\r\ndifficulties could arise if ships sharing the  same\r\n\r\nsea routes adopted different navigational rules and\r\n\r\npractices.  Or if a ship was subject  to  different\r\n\r\nlaws  and  rules and regulations at each  different\r\n\r\nport   at   which  she  calls.  So  the  need   for\r\n\r\ninternational agreement and co-operation  has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised. And to this end, there were  held  from\r\n\r\ntime  to time international conferences from  which\r\n\r\nemerged  international  agreement  on  matters   of\r\n\r\ncommon interest and concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House, Sir, deals with the\r\n\r\nliability  of  shipowners to make good  losses  and\r\n\r\ndamage  which  occur in or in connection  with  the\r\n\r\noperation of their ships. In this particular field,\r\n\r\nSir, it has for centuries been accepted by maritime\r\n\r\ncountries  of the world that ship-owners should  be\r\n\r\nentitled to limit their liability for damages.  But\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances in which limitation of liability\r\n\r\nmight  be claimed and the manner in which the limit\r\n\r\nitself is to be calculated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  varied considerably from country to  country.\r\n\r\nFor some 50 years, Sir, attempts have been made  to\r\n\r\nestablish uniformity in this field till at last  in\r\n\r\n1957,  after a conference in Brussels, a Convention\r\n\r\nemerged  which represents a substantial measure  of\r\n\r\nagreement between the maritime nations of the world\r\n\r\nas to the liability of owners of seagoing ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, even before the Convention, there was\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom legislation in the Merchant Shipping\r\n\r\nAct.  But  even  in  the U.K., it  had  long  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  that the legislation was  out-dated  in\r\n\r\nmany  respects. Not least that the limit  of  their\r\n\r\nliability was too low. The sums were, in fact,  \ufffd15\r\n\r\nper  ton for personal injury claims and \ufffd8 per  ton\r\n\r\nfor   property  claims.  The  Brussels  Convention,\r\n\r\ntherefore, provided an excellent opportunity  which\r\n\r\nwas readily taken to bring the U.K. legislation  up\r\n\r\nto  date  and  to  bring  it  into  line  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Convention. The result, Sir,  was\r\n\r\nthe U.K. Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners\r\n\r\nand Others) Act, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It amends various provisions of the U.K. Merchant\r\n\r\nShipping  Act  which deals with this liability.  At\r\n\r\nthis  point,  I  should explain that the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  agreed  that  the  Brussels  Convention\r\n\r\nshould  be extended to Singapore. It is, therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  necessary that the provisions in our Merchant\r\n\r\nShipping Ordinance which deal with the liability of\r\n\r\nshipowners should be amended and brought into  line\r\n\r\nwith  the  provisions of the Convention,  in  order\r\n\r\nthat such extension may be formally effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this, Sir, is precisely the aim and object and\r\n\r\nthe scope of the Bill which is now before the House\r\n\r\nfor its Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might, before I close, Sir, mention that the\r\n\r\nrepresentative   associations  of   shipowners   in\r\n\r\nSingapore are agreeable to the application  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Convention to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a typographical emendation\r\n\r\nat  page  4,  line  22,  \"millisimal\"  should  read\r\n\r\n\"millesimal\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read the Third\r\n\r\ntime and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOTOR VEHICLES (THIRD-PARTY RISKS AND COMPENSATION)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

The difference in the wording has arisen out\r\n\r\nof certain amendments which are made to section 22,\r\n\r\nsubsection   (1)   of  the  Singapore   Improvement\r\n\r\nOrdinance in connection with the reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nlocal   government   undertaken   by   the   former\r\n\r\ngovernment. In the reorganisation, certain areas in\r\n\r\nthe  Island  were transferred from the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof the City Council to that of the Rural Board, and\r\n\r\nvice  versa,  with the result that the boundary  of\r\n\r\nthe  City  area  is  altered. The  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\namendments  to the Singapore Improvement  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas to enable the Improvement Rate to be applied to\r\n\r\nSingapore as a whole and, by means of orders to  be\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Minister,  for  properties  situated\r\n\r\noutside  the  former City area to be exempted  from\r\n\r\nthe  levy of the rate as hitherto.

(New Series) 25 of 1959, be\r\n\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time Courts of Investigation are\r\n\r\nappointed under the Merchant Shipping Ordinance  to\r\n\r\ninquire  into  shipwrecks, shipping casualties,  or\r\n\r\ninto  the  conduct or competency  of  the  officers\r\n\r\nserving on the ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessors appointed to these Courts are paid $30\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  day of hearing and  $20  for  each\r\n\r\nsubsequent  day  or part thereof. These  sums  have\r\n\r\nremained  unchanged since they were fixed in  1911,\r\n\r\nand recently their inadequacy at present-day values\r\n\r\nwas  brought to my notice. While I have  taken  due\r\n\r\nnotice  of the need to increase these fees, I  have\r\n\r\nalso borne in mind the fact that remuneration for a\r\n\r\ncivic  service of this nature should not  be  based\r\n\r\nentirely  on the present-day value of the  services\r\n\r\nperformed.  An  equitable remuneration,  therefore,\r\n\r\nwill  be to revise upwards the fees for the  second\r\n\r\nand subsequent days of hearing, since the financial\r\n\r\nloss  incurred by each assessor is in no  way  less\r\n\r\nthan the loss incurred in the first day of hearing.\r\n\r\nI  have, therefore, made an amendment to the Rules,\r\n\r\nwhich  are the subject to this motion, to permit  a\r\n\r\nsum of $30 to be paid to each assessor for each day\r\n\r\nof hearing, thus removing the existing differential\r\n\r\nrates  between the first and subsequent days.  This\r\n\r\nwill  mean  an  increase of $10 in assessor's  fees\r\n\r\nwhen the Court sits for more than one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members will agree that this\r\n\r\nrevision is sufficient and adequate in view of  the\r\n\r\nconsiderations I have mentioned.
