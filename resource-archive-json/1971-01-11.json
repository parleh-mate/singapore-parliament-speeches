This   Convention   prohibits    the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  oil from ships and  tankers  except\r\n\r\nunder   certain   well-defined   conditions.

If oil is\r\n\r\ndischarged  from a place on land, the occupier  of\r\n\r\nthat  place  shall be guilty of an  offence,  and,\r\n\r\nsimilarly, if oil is discharged from any apparatus\r\n\r\nused  for transferring oil from or to a ship,  the\r\n\r\nperson  in charge of the apparatus shall be guilty\r\n\r\nof an offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7 of the Bill, any person who\r\n\r\nthrows  refuse,  garbage or  trade  effluent  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  waters shall be guilty of  an  offence.\r\n\r\nVery  stiff  penalties are being provided  in  the\r\n\r\nBill, e.g., a person contravening clause 7 will be\r\n\r\n\"liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding  ten\r\n\r\nthousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not\r\n\r\nexceeding  two  years or to  both  such  fine  and\r\n\r\nimprisonment\".  Members of this  House  will  note\r\n\r\nthat under clause 5 special defences are provided,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  when  a person is charged, it  shall  be  a\r\n\r\ndefence  to prove that the oil was discharged  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of securing the safety of  the  ship,\r\n\r\ncargo  or life or that the escape of oil  was  not\r\n\r\ndue to want of reasonable care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1954 Convention recommended that governments\r\n\r\nshould   encourage   the  establishment   of   oil\r\n\r\nreception  facilities  for ships.  This  is  given\r\n\r\neffect in Part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII  of  the  Bill  which  empowers  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority to provide  such  facilities.\r\n\r\nThe Minister is also empowered to make regulations\r\n\r\nto  require  ships to be fitted with equipment  to\r\n\r\nprevent  or reduce the discharge of oil  into  the\r\n\r\nsea.  Regulations may also be enacted  to  require\r\n\r\nmasters  of  ships  to  keep  records  or  matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to oil. Restrictions are placed  on  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of oil from or to a vessel at night.  It\r\n\r\nshall be the duty of the owner, master or agent of\r\n\r\na vessel or occupier of a place on land, to report\r\n\r\nany escape of oil into Singapore waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions\r\n\r\nincluding  power to detain a vessel  suspected  of\r\n\r\ndischarging  oil or garbage, etc., into  Singapore\r\n\r\nwaters.  The  Minister is generally  empowered  to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations for preventing the pollution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore waters, including requirements  for  oil\r\n\r\nrefineries  to store detergents and  equipment  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  any  pollution of our waters,  Persons\r\n\r\nresponsible for polluting our waters are liable to\r\n\r\npay  for  the cost of removing or eliminating  the\r\n\r\npollutant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the provisions of this Bill appear to be severe, it is because we regard the problem of pollution of the sea as a major problem for us and strong measures are necessary to provide effective control of a difficult subject. By and large, ship-owners and other operators have\r\n\r\nshown a reasonable sense of responsibility in  the\r\n\r\nmatter, but, unfortunately, there are some parties\r\n\r\nfor  whom only strict application of the law would\r\n\r\nappear  to be the means for ensuring some form  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline.   I  appeal  to  the  whole   shipping\r\n\r\ncommunity to make a concerted effort to co-operate\r\n\r\nwith us in keeping our seas and marine environment\r\n\r\nclean and pollution-free. For those who choose  to\r\n\r\nbe  recalcitrant, may I sound a note  of  warning,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  this - that we will not  hesitate  to\r\n\r\napply  the  full force of the law  to  any  person\r\n\r\nfound  contravening the provisions of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  the power to detain suspected vessels  will\r\n\r\nbe exercised without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister on introducing this Bill. At the  moment,\r\n\r\nalthough the problem of pollution of our  seas  is\r\n\r\nnot  serious, there are already signs that it will\r\n\r\nbe.  Therefore,  the fact that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nready  to introduce this Bill in order to be  able\r\n\r\nto   take   positive  steps  to  prevent   further\r\n\r\ndeterioration is a far-sighted policy.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  countries  which are already facing  serious\r\n\r\nproblems  of sea pollution. For example, in  Tokyo\r\n\r\nthe  pollution of the sea is so serious  that  the\r\n\r\nfish  die. So we can say that this Bill is a  far-sighted policy to maintain a pollution-free port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are taking positive steps to make Singapore a\r\n\r\nclean garden city. On the one hand, we bring about\r\n\r\nbetter  living conditions for our people, and,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, we attract more tourists  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry. As we have spent a great deal of time and\r\n\r\neffort  to  keep our roads clean, we  should  also\r\n\r\ntake  steps  to  keep our Singapore waters  clean,\r\n\r\notherwise our livelihood will be affected by their\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that we are a port. At the moment, we\r\n\r\nare  the fourth biggest port in the world, and  we\r\n\r\nare  improving and expanding in size. One  day  we\r\n\r\nmay  become the third greatest port in the  world,\r\n\r\nor  even  the second. So any steps taken  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection  are necessary. I believe the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  support the  Bill  and  keep  our\r\n\r\nwaters  and  our  port  clean.  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nadministrators  in the departments concerned  will\r\n\r\ncarry out the policy effectively so that we have a\r\n\r\nbeautiful and clean port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\njust  like to ask a small point.

Experience  since\r\n\r\nthen  has  revealed a number of  difficulties  and\r\n\r\ninadequacies in the law. The Bill now  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse  seeks to rectify this situation  by  making\r\n\r\nappropriate  amendments to the Ordinance  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Authority  can  operate  and  carry  out  its\r\n\r\nfunctions more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill enables the Authority to\r\n\r\ndispose  of  goods  which  have  remained  in  its\r\n\r\ncustody longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  the stipulated time, in any manner it thinks\r\n\r\nfit, instead of by auction only, which is the case\r\n\r\nunder  the  existing section.  This  amendment  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to ensure that the much needed space  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.S.A.'s godowns are put to proper  use,  and\r\n\r\nalso to provide for operational flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 specifically empowers the Authority to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations  relating to the  towage  of  or\r\n\r\nassistance  to  vessels, the sale  and  supply  of\r\n\r\nwater  in  the  port,  as  well  as  the  use  and\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  harbour  craft.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  can exclude or limit its liability  for\r\n\r\nanything done under any such regulations made.  To\r\n\r\ndiscourage   contravention  of  regulations,   the\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalties  have  been  increased.   These\r\n\r\namendments  are intended to control the activities\r\n\r\nof  marine  craft within port limits, to  minimise\r\n\r\npollution  and  to  ensure that  the  fresh  water\r\n\r\nsupplied is not contaminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 4, the Authority is empowered to\r\n\r\nrecover costs for the the removal of any vessel or\r\n\r\naircraft  sunk, or any other obstruction  stranded\r\n\r\nor abandoned in the port or in any approach to the\r\n\r\nport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to amend section 88 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, which is somewhat obscure.

Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe  Authority  will not be liable  for  any  act,\r\n\r\nomission  or default of any stevedore  or  workman\r\n\r\nemployed by the Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 allows the Authority to own and\r\n\r\noperate  vessels for providing any of the services\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Authority is required or empowered  to\r\n\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nmake  a few observations on the Bill. Under clause\r\n\r\n4, with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduction of a new Part Villa, the Authority is\r\n\r\nempowered  to  raise  and  remove  any  vessel  or\r\n\r\naircraft sunk. This, to my mind, is very necessary\r\n\r\nin  view of the fact that over the last two  years\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  quite a  number  of  collisions\r\n\r\nwithin  the  harbour  limits.  On  at  least   one\r\n\r\noccasion  I think the salvage operations proceeded\r\n\r\nvery  slowly. Members of the House may recall that\r\n\r\non 19th March, 1969, a vessel by the name of Kuala\r\n\r\nKangsar  sank  within the harbour limits.  Despite\r\n\r\nconsiderable efforts made, the ship was not raised\r\n\r\nuntil 2nd September, 1970, a delay of a year and a\r\n\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new provision I presume that the\r\n\r\nP.S.A, will now take a rather more active part  in\r\n\r\nall  salvage operations, such as the one  which  I\r\n\r\nhave quoted. The one aspect which occurs to me  is\r\n\r\nthat  our existing facilities for salvage  do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to be very adequate in Singapore. Is it  the\r\n\r\nintention of the P.S.A, to set up a salvage corps?\r\n\r\nOr  is it the intention that a salvage association\r\n\r\nbe formed, as is the practice in some other ports?\r\n\r\nI shall appreciate the Minister's clarification on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Looking at the Bill as\r\n\r\na  layman,  it  does  seem to me  that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain   ambiguities.  The  Bill  mentions   only\r\n\r\n\"vessel  or aircraft sunk\". What about the cargoes\r\n\r\nin  the  vessels? Will the Authority be authorised\r\n\r\nto raise and remove the cargoes from the vessels?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan Kayu has raised a good point, with  his\r\n\r\ninsurance  expertise! I can assure  him  that  the\r\n\r\nreason why this Amendment Bill has been introduced\r\n\r\nis  to  give added powers to the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority to ensure that cases like the sinking of\r\n\r\nthe  Kuala Kangsar will not be allowed to  lie  on\r\n\r\nthe  bed  of the harbour for too long a time,  and\r\n\r\nthat greater efforts will be made by the P.S.A, to\r\n\r\nget things moving. It is more than likely that the\r\n\r\nP.S.A, will have its own salvage unit.

The Singapore Traction\r\n\r\nCompany of 1925 was then the only large public bus\r\n\r\ncompany with the ability and resources to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the bus travelling public. However,  as\r\n\r\nthe  demand for better and more efficient services\r\n\r\nbecame  evident  over  the years,  the  relatively\r\n\r\nsmall private Chinese bus companies, who were once\r\n\r\ncontent  with  operating  only  a  \"mosquito\"  bus\r\n\r\nservice  over the rural routes, began  to  show  a\r\n\r\ngreater  interest in this field, as  evidenced  by\r\n\r\ntheir  growing investments, firstly, in new buses,\r\n\r\nand  later, their applications for new  routes  in\r\n\r\nareas  where  the S.T.C, services were  unable  to\r\n\r\nprovide such services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst desiring to provide the public with a more\r\n\r\nadequate  and better public bus transport service,\r\n\r\nthe  Authority  (O.S.L.A.) was,  however,  greatly\r\n\r\nhampered by the provisions of the existing Omnibus\r\n\r\nServices  Licensing  Authority  Ordinance,   1956,\r\n\r\nwhich,  inter  alia,  imposes  upon  O.S.L.A, the\r\n\r\nobligation to consider the interests of the S.T.C.\r\n\r\nwhen  granting new routes, including those  within\r\n\r\nthe  city central area.

In\r\n\r\nits place, the S.T.C, pays to Government a royalty\r\n\r\nof   5   per  cent  of  its  gross  receipts   and\r\n\r\ncontributions of two cents per car mile run, which\r\n\r\nworks out quantitatively to be far less than  what\r\n\r\nis  being  paid  by the Chinese bus  companies  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  their licensed buses. The  S.T.C, is\r\n\r\nalso  empowered  to license its  own  drivers  and\r\n\r\nconductors so that even the Registrar of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nhas no authority whatsoever to withdraw or suspend\r\n\r\ntheir  vocational  licences  for  any  breach   of\r\n\r\nconduct.  Government  has also  lost  considerable\r\n\r\nrevenue  over  the  years because  the  S.T.C, is\r\n\r\nexempted from paying the usual customs import duty\r\n\r\nand   additional  registration   fee   which   are\r\n\r\napplicable to the other bus companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large crowds waiting helplessly at bus stops\r\n\r\nduring  peak  periods in the  city  central  area,\r\n\r\nwhich  are mainly served by the S.T.C., is a clear\r\n\r\nindication that the S.T.C, has failed in its  task\r\n\r\nto  provide  an adequate public bus service.  This\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs is not of recent origin but  has\r\n\r\nbeen prevalent over a long period of years. It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, no wonder that the `pirate' taxis  have\r\n\r\nemerged  to  fill the need, having regard  to  the\r\n\r\nexistence of an unsatisfactory public bus  service\r\n\r\nin Singapore for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the publication of the White Paper in the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  last year aimed at the eradication  of\r\n\r\nthe  `pirate' taxis, and the repeal  of  both  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Ordinance (Cap. 111)  and  the\r\n\r\nexisting   Omnibus  Services  Licensing  Authority\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   the   new   Bus  Services   Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority  should then function as a  proper  Road\r\n\r\nTransport Authority.

As\r\n\r\nat  30th April last year, out of a total of  1,087\r\n\r\noperating  buses, the S.T.C, had 404 or less  than\r\n\r\n40  per  cent of the total bus fleet of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhilst  the Chinese bus companies had 683 or  more\r\n\r\nthan 60 per cent of the fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent for me to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthis House that over the last eight months, whilst\r\n\r\nthe  size of the S.T.C.'s operating fleet remained\r\n\r\nstatic,    the   Chinese   bus   companies    have\r\n\r\nsubstantially increased their bus fleets, so  much\r\n\r\nso  that  the S.T.C.'s fleet as at 31st  December,\r\n\r\n1970,  stood at less than 30 per cent of the total\r\n\r\nbus fleet - a drop of ten per cent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform Members of this House that,\r\n\r\nsubsequent to the publication of the White  Paper,\r\n\r\nI called up a delegation of three Directors of the\r\n\r\nS.T.C.  (which  included  its  Chairman)  on  15th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1970,  and  drew  their  attention  to\r\n\r\nparagraph 4.15 of the White Paper which stated  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`4.15 STC to be reorganised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bus services are a public utility, it is cleat\r\n\r\nthat  unless STC takes strong steps to  reorganise\r\n\r\nitself,    the    Ministry   [the   Ministry    of\r\n\r\nCommunications] will have no alternative,  but  to\r\n\r\nintervene. If Chinese Bus Companies (which on  the\r\n\r\nwhole are showing profitable results) are required\r\n\r\nto  reorganise  themselves  through  amalgamation,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason why SIC should be allowed  to\r\n\r\ndrag its feet, when bus commuters are so vocal and\r\n\r\ncritical  of  the  performance of  STC,  for  many\r\n\r\nyears.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also made clear to the S.T.C. Directors\r\n\r\nthat  with  the  proposed  reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\npublic bus system with uniform legislation and bus\r\n\r\nfare  structure, the S.T.C, would lose its present\r\n\r\nprivileged position and be treated as just one  of\r\n\r\nfour  bus  companies, after  the  10  Chinese  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  have amalgamated themselves into  three\r\n\r\nlarger groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, it is also proposed to increase the\r\n\r\nmembership of the Authority from three to six, and\r\n\r\nmembership is also not to be restricted to  public\r\n\r\nservants,  vide  clause 3.  Under  clause  5,  bus\r\n\r\nlicences are to be made renewable for a period  of\r\n\r\nthree years instead of one year, as at present. As\r\n\r\nthe  present practice of bus companies working out\r\n\r\ntheir  own routes and applying for same  has  been\r\n\r\nfound to be unsatisfactory, provision is now  made\r\n\r\nfor  the new Authority to determine the routes and\r\n\r\nto  invite  applications from  the  bus  companies\r\n\r\nconcerned. The cost of such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvertisements and expenses involved will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  borne  by the successful applicant.

This comes under clause 9. Offences in\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  breach  of  conditions  are  also\r\n\r\npunishable by increased fines, vide clause 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the opportune moment for mc to inform\r\n\r\nthe  House that the study on the co-ordination and\r\n\r\nrationalisation  of  the  then  existing  117  bus\r\n\r\nroutes,   to   be  undertaken  by  the   Transport\r\n\r\nConsultant, Mr R. P.

When\r\n\r\nmaking copies of the Wilson Study available to the\r\n\r\nbus  companies on 15th December, 1970, I indicated\r\n\r\nto  them that before Government proceeds with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the Wilson recommendations  on\r\n\r\n11th  April, 1971, we would, however, like to have\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  their views  for  consideration.\r\n\r\nThese  should  be  submitted not later  than  15th\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1971, i.e., within this week. It  is  our\r\n\r\nintention  to  release the Wilson Study,  together\r\n\r\nwith full details of the implementation, not later\r\n\r\nthan  the  middle  of February, so  that  the  bus\r\n\r\ncommuting  public would have two  months'  advance\r\n\r\nnotice of the proposed major reorganisation of the\r\n\r\nbus services before it comes into effect early  in\r\n\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, the Bill now before this\r\n\r\nHouse can be regarded as not only being timely but\r\n\r\nmost  appropriate,  so that  my  Ministry  may  be\r\n\r\ngiver!  The  necessary  legislative  backing   and\r\n\r\n\"teeth\"  to carry out its onerous task of  a  long\r\n\r\noverdue major overhaul of our public bus transport\r\n\r\nservice, and to usher in the dawn of a new era for\r\n\r\na more rational, adequate and effective public bus\r\n\r\nservice for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to make a few observations  on\r\n\r\nclause  8  of the Bill. Will the Minister consider\r\n\r\nmaking it an offence for bus drivers to stop their\r\n\r\nvehicles   along  the  route  without   reasonable\r\n\r\ngrounds,   thus  causing  inconvenience   to   the\r\n\r\ntravelling public? There are some instances  where\r\n\r\nbus  drivers in certain Chinese bus companies make\r\n\r\nit a habit of stopping their buses along the route\r\n\r\nwhen  one  of  their  buses  is  involved  in   an\r\n\r\naccident, whether it is a minor or a serious  one,\r\n\r\nand  to  lend  moral or physical  support  to  the\r\n\r\ndriver  involved in the accident. We have recently\r\n\r\nheard about the skirmishes that took place in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  when buses from two companies stopped their\r\n\r\nservices  for  a period of more than  four  hours,\r\n\r\nthus   causing   serious  inconvenience   to   the\r\n\r\ntravelling public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have  a  small point to inquire of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications. I cannot agree more with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  when he said that it is high  time  that\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Traction   Company   should   be\r\n\r\nreorganised.   Usually   in   the    process    of\r\n\r\nreorganisation,  the workers are mainly  affected.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, reorganisation is going to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  employees. I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister can assure this House that in the process\r\n\r\nof reorganisation, the employees of the S.T.C, can\r\n\r\nbe  assured their job security. We should not make\r\n\r\nthem  suffer  because of the inefficiency  of  the\r\n\r\noperations  of  the  S.T.C, throughout  all  these\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree\r\n\r\nwith what the Member for Toa Payoh has said on the\r\n\r\nregrettable  incident which took place  in  Lorong\r\n\r\nOne  a  few days ago. I believe for some time  now\r\n\r\nthe  residents  of Toa Payoh have  been  grumbling\r\n\r\nabout  the  inadequacy of bus  services.  I  think\r\n\r\nthere   are  now  more  than  one  hundred   buses\r\n\r\noperating  in  Toa Payoh since the  reorganisation\r\n\r\ntook place last year. Before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI can comment further on the Member's  query\r\n\r\non  whether steps can be taken against bus workers\r\n\r\nwho   fail   to  man  the  buses  and  provide   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory service, perhaps it would  be  better\r\n\r\nto  wait  until the Wilson Study is published  and\r\n\r\ncertain  recommendations  will  then  have  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  - it is only a month - and that  would\r\n\r\nbe  the  appropriate time for  me  to  answer  his\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the plea from the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  that  we give an assurance that,  when  the\r\n\r\nS.T.C, is  reorganised, the workers will  not  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  suffer for lack of job security.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him  that that will be one of our  primary\r\n\r\ntasks. In the course of reorganisation, one should\r\n\r\nsee  to  it that the S.T.C, workers do not suffer.\r\n\r\nBut  I  must  add to that a warning. A bad  worker\r\n\r\ncannot  take  cover behind that  sort  of  shield.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  if  he  fails to  improve  after  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation, I think the axe will have to  fall\r\n\r\non  him. But at the first stage of reorganisation,\r\n\r\nI  think  it  would be fair to say  that  we  will\r\n\r\nensure  that everyone who is working will  have  a\r\n\r\njob.

Such  a\r\n\r\nsystem  provided under clause 5 of the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nreduce  the enormous volume of paper work involved\r\n\r\nunder  the  present  procedure of  processing  all\r\n\r\nreports  of  traffic offences at a central  office\r\n\r\nand then issuing offers of composition in cases of\r\n\r\ncompoundable offences which form the vast majority\r\n\r\nof  reported  offences.

These  amendments\r\n\r\nare in addition to those which were introduced, as\r\n\r\na   matter  of  urgency,  under  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  (Amendment) Act, 1970,  in  September\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill sets the 4th day of\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1970,  as  the  date  of  coming  into\r\n\r\noperation of the 1970 Amendment Act. Members  will\r\n\r\nrecall  that the 1970 Amendment Act empowered  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Town Corporation, among other  things,  to\r\n\r\nraise  loans  from  outside sources.  The  present\r\n\r\namendment before this House is necessary  to  give\r\n\r\nlegal   validity  to  the  signing  of  the   Loan\r\n\r\nAgreement between the Jurong Town Corporation  and\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  Development Bank on the 5th September,\r\n\r\n1970.  The  Bank agreed to lend the Corporation  a\r\n\r\nsum of US $8.3 million to finance the expansion of\r\n\r\nJurong wharves. It is proposed to set the 4th  day\r\n\r\nof September, 1970 - the day immediately preceding\r\n\r\nthe date of signature of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoan  Agreement  -  as  the date  of  coming  into\r\n\r\noperation   of   the   Jurong   Town   Corporation\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Act, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 13 of the principal Act\r\n\r\nwhich  lays  down  the duties and  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nCorporation.  Paragraphs  (a) ,  (b)  and  (c)  are\r\n\r\ndrafting  amendments. Paragraph (d)  empowers  the\r\n\r\nCorporation  to  sell or lease  flats,  houses  or\r\n\r\nother  living accommodation. This is necessary  to\r\n\r\nenable the Corporation to undertake the housing of\r\n\r\nworkers in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are references, in sections 17, 21, 23, 24\r\n\r\nand  25  of  the principal Act, to a \"Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  Fund\". It is proposed, under  clauses\r\n\r\n4,  5,  6,  7  and 8 of the Bill, to delete  these\r\n\r\nreferences  and  substitute  references   to   the\r\n\r\nCorporation itself, as the principal Act does  not\r\n\r\nactually  provide for the setting up of  a  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown Corporation Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 alters the manner of appointment of the\r\n\r\nCorporation's auditor. Section 21 of the principal\r\n\r\nAct  provides that the Minister shall nominate for\r\n\r\nevery   year   an  auditor  of  the  Corporation's\r\n\r\naccounts. It is proposed that, as in the  case  of\r\n\r\nother  statutory bodies, the Corporation's auditor\r\n\r\nshould  be appointed, not by the Minister  but  by\r\n\r\nthe Corporation itself with the concurrence of the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 23 of the principal Act\r\n\r\nso  that  the Corporation will now be required  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  its  annual statement of accounts  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  auditor will  be  required  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  separately his report on the statement  of\r\n\r\naccounts. Both the statement of accounts  and  the\r\n\r\nauditor's report thereon shall be published in the\r\n\r\nGazette.  This  introduces  a  measure  of  public\r\n\r\naccountability  and  is  an  improvement  on   the\r\n\r\nexisting provision which only requires the auditor\r\n\r\nto   certify   the  Corporation's   statement   of\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 24 of the principal Act\r\n\r\nto  make  it clear that the accounting records  of\r\n\r\nthe   Corporation   should   distinguish   capital\r\n\r\ntransactions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom revenue transactions and that moneys received\r\n\r\nby  way  of loans should be shown separately.

This\r\n\r\nprovision   is  unduly  restrictive  and   it   is\r\n\r\nproposed,   under   clause   9,   to   allow   the\r\n\r\nCorporation, with the approval of the Minister, to\r\n\r\ninvest in shares of any private or public company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10, which introduces a new section 27A in\r\n\r\nthe  principal Act, allows the Corporation to form\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  companies for the purpose of  carrying\r\n\r\nout  any  of the functions of the Corporation.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be  desirable  in certain circumstances,  not\r\n\r\nonly  in the interests of flexibility of operation\r\n\r\nbut  also of financial accountability, to separate\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  Corporation's  functions  from  the\r\n\r\nothers  and to entrust them to companies in  which\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation  would have a majority  interest.\r\n\r\nMembers will notice that, under subsection (3)  of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  new section 27A, the operations  of\r\n\r\nsuch   companies  would  be  subject  to  detailed\r\n\r\nsupervision by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12, which introduce another new\r\n\r\nsection  in  the  principal  Act,  confer  on  the\r\n\r\nCorporation the exclusive right to the use of  the\r\n\r\nsymbol  which is set out in the proposed  Schedule\r\n\r\nto the principal Act.

It  therefore  now  becomes\r\n\r\npossible   to   grant  a  pension  to   the   late\r\n\r\nPresident's  widow  as well as  to  his  surviving\r\n\r\nchildren of such amount or amounts and subject  to\r\n\r\nsuch  terms  as Parliament may, by its resolution,\r\n\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (1)\r\n\r\nof  section 10A of the Civil List and Pension Act,\r\n\r\n1970 (Act 10 of 1970), resolves that there be paid\r\n\r\nto the widow and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  two  undermentioned children of the  late\r\n\r\nPresident Yusof bin Ishak, with effect from  the\r\n\r\n23rd   day  of  November,  1970,  the  following\r\n\r\namounts  of  pension  appearing  against   their\r\n\r\nrespective names:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Che Puan Noor Aisha, the sum of $24,000. -\r\n\r\n(Dollars   twenty-four  thousand)   per   annum,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  subsection  (3)  of  the  aforesaid\r\n\r\nsection; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Che lmran bin Yusof (born on 26th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1950)  and  Che Zuriana  Yusof  Ishak\r\n\r\n(born on 6th February, 1953), jointly the sum of\r\n\r\n$6,000.-(Dollars six thousand) per annum,  which\r\n\r\nsum  shall  cease to be paid to  them  upon  Che\r\n\r\nZuriana Yusof Ishak attaining the age of twenty-one years or upon her marrying, whichever is the\r\n\r\nearlier:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that should Che Zuriana Yusof Ishak\r\n\r\nmarry  before  attaining the age  of  twenty-one\r\n\r\nyears,  the whole of the sum of $6,000.-(Dollars\r\n\r\nsix  thousand) per annum shall be  paid  to  Che\r\n\r\nImran  bin  Yusof until he attains  the  age  of\r\n\r\ntwenty-one years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed.\"-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twelve minutes to Four o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
