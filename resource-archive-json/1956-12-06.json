Sir,\r\n\r\nin  rising to move, \"That the Bill be now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time,\" I want to stress, first of all, that\r\n\r\nit is not normal government practice to compensate\r\n\r\nits  officers  for loss of expectation  of  career\r\n\r\nwhere such officers are prematurely retired. It is\r\n\r\ncommon knowledge that all Government officers hold\r\n\r\noffice  at  pleasure, and so long as the requisite\r\n\r\nnotice  is  given for termination of service,  the\r\n\r\nperson can have no claim on the Crown. This  Bill,\r\n\r\nSir, to compensate expatriate officers for loss of\r\n\r\ncareer as a result of Malayanisation of the public\r\n\r\nservice, is therefore an unusual measure  to  meet\r\n\r\nchanges    brought    about   by    constitutional\r\n\r\nadvancement in Singapore. Up to now, the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State  has been responsible for the expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers  who  came  out  here  expecting  a  full\r\n\r\ncareer,  that is to say, a career in  the  service\r\n\r\nuntil  the  normal  retiring  age.  Constitutional\r\n\r\nchanges  have brought about a frustration of  this\r\n\r\nexpectation  of  a full career,  for  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfundamental rights of a self-governing country  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  must have control of its public  service\r\n\r\nand no outside authority must be in a position  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  appointments, promotions and discipline\r\n\r\nin  respect  of the civil service. The  Government\r\n\r\nnot  only cherishes this right of determining  its\r\n\r\nown  civil  service matters, but is  of  the  firm\r\n\r\nconviction  that true self-government means  that\r\n\r\nthe  entire  control  of the government  machinery\r\n\r\nmust  vest in the local people. The people of  the\r\n\r\ncountry   must   solve  their  own  problems   and\r\n\r\ndetermine  what is best for them. A civil  service\r\n\r\nstaffed and dominated by expatriate officers  will\r\n\r\nmake  self-government a mockery.  We  are  on  the\r\n\r\nthreshold  of  self-government and it  is  of  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  urgency that we must prepare  to  govern\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said yesterday, in moving the adoption of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy on Malayanisation, that it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  firm view  that  the  principal\r\n\r\ncivil  service advisers of Ministers must be local\r\n\r\nmen. The most effective way of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nachieving  the  objective in the determination  of\r\n\r\nour  own  civil  service is  to  remove  from  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State  and the Governor  the  final\r\n\r\ncontrol over those officers who were appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State, and this is brought about\r\n\r\nby   the   establishment  of  a   Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission  with  executive powers.  Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill hear from the Hon. the Chief Secretary in due\r\n\r\ncourse how the new Public Service Commission  will\r\n\r\nwork  before our present constitution is  amended.\r\n\r\nTo  all  intents  and  purposes,  the  new  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission will be executive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures, Sir, have brought about a\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  conditions  of  service  of   the\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers, and it is for these  reasons\r\n\r\nthat a compensation scheme has been negotiated and\r\n\r\nagreed  with  the Staff Associations  representing\r\n\r\nthem.  During the negotiations we were in constant\r\n\r\ntouch  with  the Federation Government  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat their scheme and ours were as nearly the same\r\n\r\nas  possible. The only material difference  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling of the compensation, and this is  due\r\n\r\nto  the  generally  higher  emoluments  ruling  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is urgency in bringing this scheme into\r\n\r\noperation  as  soon as possible,  for  without  it\r\n\r\nplanned Malayanisation cannot proceed, and  we  do\r\n\r\nwant  early  Malayanisation of the public  service\r\n\r\nwhich,  as I have pointed out, is both a political\r\n\r\nand  an  administrative necessity. I do urge  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to  view the need of this  Bill  in  this\r\n\r\nsetting,  and  not to make it more  difficult  for\r\n\r\nofficers whose careers are already frustrated as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  constitutional progress in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not look back into the past, but  let  us\r\n\r\nlook  forward to the future to see how we can make\r\n\r\nthese   expatriate  officers  go   willingly   and\r\n\r\ncheerfully.  Our task will be made  all  the  less\r\n\r\ndifficult if during the interim period both  local\r\n\r\nand  expatriate officers will co-operate  fully  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  change-over as smooth as  possible  and\r\n\r\nwith  the least friction. I have said that we must\r\n\r\nlook  forward to the future to see how we can make\r\n\r\nthese   expatriate  officers  go   willingly   and\r\n\r\ncheerfully. I should have also said, Sir, that  we\r\n\r\nshould  also look to the future to see how we  can\r\n\r\nmake these expatriate officers remain willingly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  cheerfully where we need them. I said  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  yesterday, in introducing the White  Paper\r\n\r\non the Government's Malayanisation policy, that it\r\n\r\nis better to be without an officer than to have an\r\n\r\nunwilling one. An officer who is retained  in  the\r\n\r\nservice  against his wish is not only  useless  to\r\n\r\nthe  service,  but is a potential  danger  to  the\r\n\r\nservice. I fully appreciate that there is always a\r\n\r\ndanger of a mass exodus of expatriate officers and\r\n\r\nthat  it  might  have a deterrent  effect  if  the\r\n\r\nscheme   now   before  the  House  provides   half\r\n\r\ncompensation instead of full compensation to those\r\n\r\nofficers   who   wish   to   leave   without   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  permission. This principle  of  half\r\n\r\ncompensation was recommended by the Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission  and  was supported by a  statement  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  in June this year by the  then  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  the Member for Cairnhill.  Since  June,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have given further careful consideration\r\n\r\nto  this  question of half compensation  and  have\r\n\r\ncome to the conclusion that although it may have a\r\n\r\ndeterrent effect on officers going without  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's permission, the result  may  well  be\r\n\r\nthat we have a service staffed with a large number\r\n\r\nof  discontented officers. Discontentment added to\r\n\r\nfrustration of a full career may well be  the  end\r\n\r\nof  efficiency in the government machinery. It  is\r\n\r\nalso clear that any half compensation scheme would\r\n\r\nhave  met  with firm resistance from the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State.  In  view of Her Majesty's Government's\r\n\r\ndeclared  policy  that once  an  executive  Public\r\n\r\nService   Commission  has  been   introduced   and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service have been changed  by  the\r\n\r\nremoval of ultimate control from the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState, officers will receive compensation for loss\r\n\r\nof  career. Also, Sir, other colonial governments,\r\n\r\nseeking  to introduce a compensation scheme,  have\r\n\r\naccepted   the   principle   that   no   clear-cut\r\n\r\ndistinction  can  be  drawn  between  the   actual\r\n\r\ntermination   of  a  career,  through   compulsory\r\n\r\nretirement,  and an officer's right  to  terminate\r\n\r\nhis own career once his conditions of service have\r\n\r\nbeen  materially  altered.  The  career  of  every\r\n\r\nofficer  in  the  service, even if the  Government\r\n\r\nwishes  to  retain  him  for  several  years,   is\r\n\r\nautomatically  prejudiced  from  the  moment   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis made known. There can be no guarantee that he\r\n\r\nwill be able to get the job if he stays for as\r\n\r\nlong as the Government wants his service, and he\r\n\r\nmust have the right to go after giving reasonable\r\n\r\nnotice at the time most convenient to him. A more\r\n\r\nsatisfactory result is likely to be achieved under\r\n\r\nthe present scheme which I consider gives every\r\n\r\nexpatriate officer a fair deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated earlier, Sir, that there have been\r\n\r\nvery   close  consultations  with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  A  similar scheme  has  already  been\r\n\r\napproved by the Federation Legislative Council. We\r\n\r\nare  now on the threshold of self-government.  Let\r\n\r\nus  show the world that in our attainment of self-determination  the  people of Singapore  can show\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and appreciation  of  the  services\r\n\r\nrendered  to Singapore by expatriate officers  who\r\n\r\nwill  suffer a loss of career resultant  upon  our\r\n\r\ngain towards nationhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hon. Members will like to know how we\r\n\r\narrived  at those figures shown in the  tables  at\r\n\r\nthe end of the Bill. On this, I would like to draw\r\n\r\nthe    attention   of   hon.   Members   to    the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Commission's  recommendation  that\r\n\r\nthe  services of an actuary should be enlisted  to\r\n\r\ncompute  the amount of compensation and  that  the\r\n\r\nmain basis should be the capital value of loss  in\r\n\r\nrespect of future salary and pension less that  of\r\n\r\nprospective future employment. The calculations by\r\n\r\nactuaries,  both  those  briefed  by   the   Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations and by the Government, indicate  that\r\n\r\nany  scheme  based on a pure actuarial calculation\r\n\r\nof  loss will be completely out of line with other\r\n\r\nschemes and would produce compensation at  a  rate\r\n\r\nvery   much   in  excess  of  that  now  proposed:\r\n\r\nsomething like a factor of seven at the  peak  age\r\n\r\nof  loss  compared with 4.96 that has been  agreed\r\n\r\nwith the Staff Associations. The figures, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nTable B of the Second Schedule to the Bill are the\r\n\r\nresult   of   hard  bargaining  with   the   Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations.

By the premature retirement,  the\r\n\r\ntotal pension bill will, in fact, be reduced.  If,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we now strike a quick balance, we  will\r\n\r\nhave an expenditure of $21.4 million spread over a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  years against savings of $5 million  a\r\n\r\nyear plus a smaller pension bill, and I am sure in\r\n\r\nthe  end we will not be badly off.

Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I am conscious of some  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the Government in negotiating this\r\n\r\ncompensation scale, and I would like to say that I\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  statement of the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen   he  spoke  of  hard  bargaining.   I   also\r\n\r\nappreciate the fact that in the ultimate there was\r\n\r\na   pistol  held  to  our  head  by  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefusing  merdeka unless the civil  servants  were\r\n\r\nsatisfied.   And   because   I   appreciate    the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the Government and because  I  ask\r\n\r\nthis House to recognise the fact that they have no\r\n\r\nalternative, I fully support, without reservation,\r\n\r\nthe Bill before us. But I think the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nand  his  colleagues will be at  one  with  me  in\r\n\r\nunderstanding  the cry of pain of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  what many deem to  be  extortionate\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that the basis of this\r\n\r\ncompensation is for termination of the expectation\r\n\r\nof  a full career by the civil servants. Sir, most\r\n\r\nof  these  500  civil  servants  who  are  sharing\r\n\r\nbetween  them the $21.4 million, averaging $43,000\r\n\r\nper  person - a  sum, Sir, which not  many  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  can  save  in a lifetime - $43,000  without\r\n\r\nincome  tax plus pension - I say that many of  those\r\n\r\nwho are sharing this have been appointed since the\r\n\r\nliberation.  It  is  my  impression,  Sir  - I   am\r\n\r\nprepared to be corrected by the Chief Secretary if\r\n\r\nhe  can - that Her Majesty's Government, through her\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State for the Colonies  and  through\r\n\r\nher Prime Minister, have repeatedly indicated that\r\n\r\nit is the intention of Her Majesty's Government to\r\n\r\nsee  that the Federation and Singapore should soon\r\n\r\nachieve self-determination. Consequently, if it is\r\n\r\nsuggested  that cadets of the ages  of  20  to  23\r\n\r\nappointed around 1946 to 1956 were told that  they\r\n\r\ncould  expect a full career in Singapore, it would\r\n\r\nmean  that  there  has been a fraud  perpetrated - a\r\n\r\nfraud  perpetrated either on them by the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  which,  if  it  intended  to  fulfill  the\r\n\r\nundertaking of Her Majesty's Government  to  grant\r\n\r\nself-government, must have known  full  well  that\r\n\r\nnone  of these officers could expect a full career\r\n\r\nin  the  colonies, or a fraud perpetrated on  this\r\n\r\nterritory - the fraud being, Sir, that they  led  us\r\n\r\nto  believe  that  it was the intention  to  grant\r\n\r\nearly  self-determination when there was, in fact,\r\n\r\nno  such  intention at all and in practice.  Civil\r\n\r\nservants             were             continuously\r\n\r\nrecruited - youngsters - and  told  that  they   could\r\n\r\nexpect  a  full career of more than 40  years.  In\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances, Sir, on whoever  it  may  be\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe fraud has been perpetrated, it is obvious that\r\n\r\nthe  fraud is at the door of the Colonial  Office,\r\n\r\nand  I ask the Government of Singapore to consider\r\n\r\nsending this bill to Her Majesty's Government  for\r\n\r\npayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have but one other comment to make, Sir. As I\r\n\r\nsay, though the sum is large, the conditions under\r\n\r\nwhich  we are compelled to fork out are such  that\r\n\r\nwe  might even consider ourselves lucky that it is\r\n\r\nonly $21.4 million. I would also draw attention to\r\n\r\nthe fact that those whose careers are supposed  to\r\n\r\nbe  terminated are in some instances granted  back\r\n\r\ntheir careers of more than five years and in  some\r\n\r\ncases  ten years. Therefore, Sir, they are  really\r\n\r\ngetting double payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask whether it is possible to reconsider\r\n\r\nthe  question of limiting payments in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthose  who seek to leave the territory when it  is\r\n\r\nnot  convenient  to Government's phasing  plan.  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask Government, even though it may be late,\r\n\r\nto  consider this aspect, because otherwise it may\r\n\r\nmean  that not only do we spend $21.4 million  but\r\n\r\nwe  may  have to spend a great deal more in short-term  contracts,  which are never  attractive,  to\r\n\r\nbring  out specialists to fill the technical posts\r\n\r\nwhich I have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that there will be criticism of this\r\n\r\nmeasure,  but  I  do ask Members on  the  opposite\r\n\r\nside,  when  they consider it, to  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nacute  difficulties  in which the  Government  has\r\n\r\nfound   itself  and  of  which  they  have   ample\r\n\r\nindication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.32 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  Bill  has been termed the  \"Retirement\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Public Service (Compensation) Bill\".  I\r\n\r\nthink it would be more appropriate to call it  the\r\n\r\n\"Public Service (Sweepstake) Bill\". Judging by the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the give-away prizes, I  should  think\r\n\r\nthere are now three ways in which an Englishman in\r\n\r\ntax-ridden Britain can get rich:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Win a football pool;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Be a barrow boy and not pay income tax;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Go to the colonies and be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  were told, when we wanted these men - or  rather\r\n\r\nwhen our masters wanted these men to come - that  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  pay  the price for them, to  attract  and\r\n\r\nretain  their rare qualities. Now that we have  to\r\n\r\nget rid of them for the excellent reasons given by\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister, we are told that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to pay through our noses to get them out  of\r\n\r\nthe  place. We could wax quite eloquent and bitter\r\n\r\nabout  this  if we went on and recounted  all  the\r\n\r\ndirty  tricks that have been going on in the past,\r\n\r\nall  the  machinations,  all  the  fictitious  and\r\n\r\nfabulous  reasons why we should have  these  white\r\n\r\nmen  rule  us. But it was not really the fault  of\r\n\r\nthis   handful  of  white  men.  They  just   took\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the  situation.  They  were   human\r\n\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what does trouble us is, who is going to pay\r\n\r\nfor  this?  The  Chief Minister gave  us  logical,\r\n\r\ncoherent  reasons why we are, in  fact,  going  to\r\n\r\nsave, and why, by implication, we have been losing\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars every year. But let me compute\r\n\r\nthe figures in a way which the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill understand better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$21.4 million - what can that money buy for the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore?  We  were  told,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was putting up their housing  schemes,\r\n\r\nthat  one  housing unit would cost $4,000.  Divide\r\n\r\n$21.4  million  by  $4,000 and  we  get  somewhere\r\n\r\naround 7,100 housing units. Seven people at  least\r\n\r\ncan  be  housed  in one housing unit.  That  means\r\n\r\n50,000  people  could be housed with  this  money.\r\n\r\nThose  are  the  terms in cost to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  white man's  burden  is  becoming\r\n\r\nsomewhat heavy for the black taxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present Chief Minister is a much more\r\n\r\nmodest  man  than his predecessor. His predecessor\r\n\r\nalways  went gallantly out in front and got  shot!\r\n\r\nThe  present Chief Minister carefully chose to  go\r\n\r\nbehind  the  Tunku's sarong! First,  he  gets  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government to say that $74 million  is\r\n\r\nthe price for freedom. I wish I could believe that\r\n\r\n$74 million is the only price for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, that having become a fait accompli, he comes\r\n\r\nbefore  this  Assembly  to  tell  us  how  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration,  careful co-ordination  and  careful\r\n\r\nhusbandry has produced these fantastic figures  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  table.  He  says  he  willingly\r\n\r\nundertakes the burden because he wants  the  white\r\n\r\nmen  to go willingly and cheerfully and hope  that\r\n\r\nthose   who  remain  behind  will  remain   behind\r\n\r\nwillingly  and  cheerfully. We  like  willing  and\r\n\r\ncheerful people, but not at this expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is going to pay for this? We are told that it\r\n\r\nis  going  to be a phased programme and  that  the\r\n\r\ncost will be spread over many years. Be that as it\r\n\r\nmay,   someone  must  find  the  money.  If   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to show the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  it is not throwing away the people's  money,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  acting like  company  directors\r\n\r\ngiving  large bonuses to themselves and all  their\r\n\r\nfriends  at the shareholders' expense, they  might\r\n\r\nconsider  a  capital levy on white  enterprise  in\r\n\r\nthis  country to pay for this. I do not think  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  the Member for Cairnhill  that  we\r\n\r\nshould present the bill to the Secretary of  State\r\n\r\nfor the Colonies would be a practical proposition.\r\n\r\nBritain, on the verge of economic bankruptcy after\r\n\r\na  gamble on the Suez Canal, is not likely  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to  afford anything like the  fabulous  sums\r\n\r\ntheir  white  agents require. But  we  have  white\r\n\r\nvested  interests in this country subject  to  our\r\n\r\nfiscal laws and I am all in favour of their paying\r\n\r\noff  this  handful of European civil servants  who\r\n\r\nhave  held  the  ring for this group  of  European\r\n\r\nenterprising businessmen to make money out of this\r\n\r\ncountry.  I think it is only fair and decent  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  share their spoils  with  all  these\r\n\r\nhonourable,  hardworking, efficient administrators\r\n\r\nwho  have kept the shop going while their  friends\r\n\r\ndo  business.  I  have looked up  the  income  tax\r\n\r\nfigures  on public limited companies. I think  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  public  limited  companies,  as\r\n\r\nopposed   to   private  limited   companies,   are\r\n\r\nEuropean.  The  Chinese, and I think  the  Indians\r\n\r\ntoo,  prefer  not to publish their accounts  every\r\n\r\nyear.  They prefer to form little family concerns.\r\n\r\nThe returns of a straight levy of 20 per cent just\r\n\r\nfor one year on profits would produce the required\r\n\r\nsum. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary will correct me if I am  wrong\r\n\r\nand  give  us  the correct figure. My  computation\r\n\r\nshows  that  a  straight levy of 20  per  cent  on\r\n\r\nprofits  for  one  year would produce  this  $21.4\r\n\r\nmillion  which  will keep all the  European  civil\r\n\r\nservants  happy. We also will be happy, and  those\r\n\r\nwho  are unhappy we can afford to ignore. That,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  is the spirit in which we should  approach\r\n\r\nthis problem. We do not really want to take it out\r\n\r\nof  this hard-working group of guardians who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  looking after our interests. We wish them  a\r\n\r\nhappy  retirement. We hope they will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nfind  their  way to some other colonial  territory\r\n\r\nfrom  which  they will be abolished at some  later\r\n\r\ndate,  so  that they will again have  another  big\r\n\r\nsweepstake with which to buy a little house in the\r\n\r\nsouth  downs  of  England and  live  happily  ever\r\n\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

It is possible that most of the\r\n\r\nMembers  on the Government Benches may  not  stand\r\n\r\nfor  the next election. This may be the reason why\r\n\r\nthey   are   putting  before  us   such   a   huge\r\n\r\ncompensation Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister said that we must satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  frustrated men. I do agree with him that  the\r\n\r\nlocal  men  should get their rightful  place.  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister also said that we do not  want  an\r\n\r\nunwilling civil servant to work for us. The remedy\r\n\r\nis   to  dismiss  him  if  he  is  unwilling   and\r\n\r\ndiscontented.  The  third  thing  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister said was that he thought there might be a\r\n\r\nmass  exodus. Why? After all, the expatriates  are\r\n\r\npaid  to serve us. It is for us to say who are  to\r\n\r\nleave and who are to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the compensation that we are\r\n\r\nproposing to pay to those who would like to leave?\r\n\r\nIs  there  any  comparison?  Have  we  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the terms of compensation to be paid\r\n\r\nin the other British colonies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand Nigeria paid \u00a35,000 or something like\r\n\r\nthat  to  each  expatriate.  As  far  as  we   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,   I   believe  we   are   copying   the\r\n\r\nFederation's  scheme. Even then  I  think  we  are\r\n\r\npaying  more than what the Federation pays.  I  do\r\n\r\nagree  in  principle that when we do not  want  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate, we must give him abolition terms which\r\n\r\nare  reasonable; but if we go beyond that, I think\r\n\r\nwe  will  only be hurting ourselves as we have  to\r\n\r\npay out from the taxpayers' money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has touched the right\r\n\r\nnote   in   his   speech   when   he   said   that\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  was  coming.  Sir,  the   Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  knew  very  well that  Malayanisation  was\r\n\r\ncoming.  In  1952  when  the previous  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil  passed  my motion on Malayanisation,  the\r\n\r\nexpatriates knew that in a short time  they  would\r\n\r\nbe  going out. How many have been brought in since\r\n\r\nthen  and joined the service as newcomers?  Should\r\n\r\nthey  get  such  a big sum - as my good  friend  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar has said - a sweepstake  or\r\n\r\na lottery?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do say, \"Let bygones be bygones.\" But we\r\n\r\nhave to look to the future because we have to  put\r\n\r\nup   the  money.  In  this  connection  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has said that he has done a lot  of  hard\r\n\r\nbargaining  with  the  expatriates.  Is  it   hard\r\n\r\nbargaining  when we are paying the most  that  any\r\n\r\nBritish  colony has ever paid to the  expatriates?\r\n\r\nSir, after gaining a lump sum in compensation, the\r\n\r\nexpatriate   who   leaves  will  certainly   serve\r\n\r\nsomewhere   else.   Has  that  been   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration? Has the Government also  considered\r\n\r\nthe fact that these expatriates will still be able\r\n\r\nto  serve in other places for many years? I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government has considered the  points\r\n\r\nwhich I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.47 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in the old days the colonial  rulers\r\n\r\nhad  a  theory to explain why it was necessary  to\r\n\r\npay  higher  and  fatter  salaries  to  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers. It was claimed that expatriate officers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  to be paid more because that was the only way\r\n\r\nto  attract and retain them in service. They  were\r\n\r\nhard  to  come  by. It was therefore necessary  to\r\n\r\ncompensate them for self-exile in the outposts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Empire  by  rewarding them with  expatriation\r\n\r\npay,  better conditions of service and  so  forth.\r\n\r\nThat was the theory before Malayanisation. We  had\r\n\r\nto attract and retain expatriate officers who were\r\n\r\nmost reluctant to bear the white man's burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a new theory. Now that Malayanisation\r\n\r\nis  on  the  cards, the theory is that  they  need\r\n\r\ninducements  to leave this attractive country.  To\r\n\r\njudge by the abolition terms now being offered, it\r\n\r\nappears  that it is more expensive to get them  to\r\n\r\nleave their jobs than it was to attract and retain\r\n\r\nthem. We must pay them handsomely to take jobs  in\r\n\r\nthe  colony. We must pay through our noses to  get\r\n\r\nthem to give up their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of compensation being offered by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  is  far  higher  than  that\r\n\r\noffered  by  any  other country so far,  including\r\n\r\nIndia.  Let  us  be clear about the  right  of  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate officer to abolition terms. It is not a\r\n\r\nlegal  right.  An employer does not  guarantee  an\r\n\r\nemployee a job for life. No firm in Singapore, not\r\n\r\neven   European  firms,  can  guarantee   that   a\r\n\r\ndischarged employee must be compensated  for  loss\r\n\r\nof  a  career. I cannot understand why this  vague\r\n\r\nmoral  claim  should  be  made  an  occasion   for\r\n\r\noutright   plunder  of  the  taxpayer.  Generosity\r\n\r\ntowards  its  employees  has  not  been  a  marked\r\n\r\nfeature of Government. Certainly when postmen  and\r\n\r\ndaily-rated workers of the Government asked for  a\r\n\r\nmiserable  addition  of  one  dollar  a  day,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  never failed to beat  its  breast  and\r\n\r\nmourn  about impending bankruptcy. But $21 million\r\n\r\nis being gladly given away to highly-paid European\r\n\r\nofficers. I cannot be a party to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A.

On this Commission were the representatives\r\n\r\nof various political Parties. Although they sat on\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  not as representatives  of  their\r\n\r\nParties,  they  were  and  still  are  members  of\r\n\r\nParties represented in this Assembly and each  and\r\n\r\nevery one of them did say in this Report that,  in\r\n\r\nfairness  to the people who have served  us,  they\r\n\r\nshould be paid some measure of compensation.  They\r\n\r\ndid even recommend that the services of an actuary\r\n\r\nshould be obtained, and I did say earlier in  this\r\n\r\ndebate  that the Government as well as  the  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation had briefed actuaries to work out  the\r\n\r\nfactor on the basis recommended in this Bible, and\r\n\r\nthe actuaries, on that basis, recommended a factor\r\n\r\nof seven; and here this Government negotiated with\r\n\r\nthe Staff Associations representing people who are\r\n\r\nnow going to lose their careers in the service  of\r\n\r\nthis Govern-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nment, and both of us agreed that a factor of  4.96\r\n\r\nwould  be  fair  to the people of  Singapore.

They felt that they had to play the  game\r\n\r\nright to the end to the people of Singapore.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  two Members in this House who  claim  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  the workers of Singapore. Yesterday  we\r\n\r\nheard the Member for Tanjong Pagar raise a hue and\r\n\r\ncry  because  the  workers,  he  felt,  are  being\r\n\r\nintimidated  and exploited by the employers.

On the one hand, there should  be\r\n\r\nproper  justice  to people who are represented  by\r\n\r\nhim,  and  on  the other hand there should  be  no\r\n\r\njustice to those people because they happen not to\r\n\r\nbe represented by him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members, I feel, have not made a proper study of the scheme.

The Bill, in the main, Sir, incorporates\r\n\r\nthe   recommendations  on  the   Public   Services\r\n\r\nCommission  which were made by the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission  in Part VI of its Majority Report.  As\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will no doubt recall, there were,  I\r\n\r\nthink, two main recommendations which were made by\r\n\r\nthe    Malayanisation   Commission.   The    first\r\n\r\nrecommendation was that the Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nServices Commission should have executive  control\r\n\r\nover appointments, promotions, dismissals, and the\r\n\r\ndiscipline  of government officers in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice.  That, as I will explain in a moment,  we\r\n\r\nseek to achieve through this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major recommendation was that the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  the  Public  Services  Commission\r\n\r\nshould be changed in that the Chairman should be a\r\n\r\nMalayan  and that the membership of the Commission\r\n\r\nshould be enlarged from two to five members. As  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  Sir,  with some few exceptions,  this\r\n\r\nBill incorporates the recommendations made on  the\r\n\r\nPublic Services Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one very obvious peculiarity\r\n\r\nabout  this Bill, and that is, although as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  it  seeks  to  establish  a  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  with executive control, in fact,  that\r\n\r\nis  the one thing which is missing from the  Bill.\r\n\r\nClauses 13 and 14 of the Bill, which lay down  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the Commission, prescribe  that  the\r\n\r\nCommission  shall  only advise the  Governor.  The\r\n\r\nreason for this apparent contradiction is that  at\r\n\r\nthe  present stage, when we are still governed  by\r\n\r\nthe present Singapore Colony Order in Council,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not be proper by legislation here to  over-rule the provisions of section 11 of the Singapore\r\n\r\nColony Order in Council; but, as was explained  in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper on Malayanisation, the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State has agreed that, save as regards  a  few\r\n\r\nspecified appointments, the Governor shall act  on\r\n\r\nthe   advice  of  the  Public  Service  Commission\r\n\r\nsubject   only   to   the   right   to   refer   a\r\n\r\nrecommendation  back to the Commission  once,  and\r\n\r\nonce  only. The Secretary of State has agreed  and\r\n\r\nthat  agreement  will be embodied in  Instructions\r\n\r\nsent  from the Secretary of State to the Governor;\r\n\r\nand  in  due  course we expect that a  new  Colony\r\n\r\nOrder  in Council will be made, and when  that  is\r\n\r\nmade,  then  it will provide formally and  finally\r\n\r\nfor   the   Public  Service  Commission  to   have\r\n\r\nexecutive authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Commission, as set out in\r\n\r\nclauses  12, 13 and 14 of the Bill, can be divided\r\n\r\ninto  two  types. There is, first, those functions\r\n\r\nin which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Commission's advice will be accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor.  Those  are the functions  specified  in\r\n\r\nclause   13,   namely,  appointments,  promotions,\r\n\r\ntransfers,   dismissals  and   discipline.   Other\r\n\r\nmatters such as schemes of service, qualifications\r\n\r\nfor  appointment, which are dealt with in  clauses\r\n\r\n12  and  14, will  not be matters  for  executive\r\n\r\ndecision by the Commission. I think the reason for\r\n\r\nthis  should  be  apparent in that,  for  example,\r\n\r\nwhile   it   is  proper  that  a  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission  should apply a code of  discipline  to\r\n\r\nindividual   officers  and  that  it   should   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for enforcing that code, it should not\r\n\r\nbe responsible for drawing up the code itself. The\r\n\r\ncode  itself  is  at  present  prescribed  in  our\r\n\r\nvarious  Government  regulations  and  that   code\r\n\r\nshould   be  subject  to  the  decision   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  not  to  the  decision   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another field in which also it would not\r\n\r\nbe right that the Public Service Commission should\r\n\r\nhave  the  final  word. I refer, Sir,  to  matters\r\n\r\nwhich are the subject of negotiation between Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations and the Government: such matters, for\r\n\r\nexample,  as  rates  of  pay  where  we  have  now\r\n\r\nestablished   a   machinery   for   the   officers\r\n\r\nconcerned,  through their Staff  Associations,  to\r\n\r\nmake  their claims and do their negotiating direct\r\n\r\nwith the Government. It would not, in the view  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  Sir, be  right  that  the  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations  should in any  way  be  deprived  of\r\n\r\ntheir   right   to  negotiate  direct   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment on matters such as pay, and indeed  the\r\n\r\nStaff  Associations have already got the  ultimate\r\n\r\nright to go to arbitration on those issues. It  is\r\n\r\ntrue   that   certainly  in  one  other   country,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  the Public Service Commission  or  its\r\n\r\nequivalent  has  been  given  authority   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  fix rates of pay, but  we  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  we  should, at least at  this  stage,\r\n\r\nadopt that procedure here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matters which are the proper field for\r\n\r\nnegotiation between the Staff Associations and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  been defined in  the  agreements\r\n\r\nwhich  now  exist between the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nStaff Associations covering the Civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nService Joint Council and covering the arbitration\r\n\r\nagreement,  and  I  would like to  make  it  quite\r\n\r\nclear,  Sir, that nothing in this Bill will affect\r\n\r\nthe  existing  rights and procedure of  the  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociations in those matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should perhaps draw the attention of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   to  the  fact  that  the  judiciary   is\r\n\r\ndeliberately excluded from the operation  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  As  was  explained by  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday,   the  question  of  appointments   and\r\n\r\ndismissals   of   Judges  is  a   matter   to   be\r\n\r\nincorporated in constitutional arrangements and it\r\n\r\nis  a  matter which will be for discussion at  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  conference  in  London,  and   the\r\n\r\nresults  of  that  discussion  will  no  doubt  be\r\n\r\nincorporated  in  a new Order in  Council  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.   So   it   is  that  the   judiciary   is\r\n\r\ndeliberately  excluded from the field  covered  by\r\n\r\nthis  Bill and it may be that a separate  Judicial\r\n\r\nService Commission will ultimately be agreed upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is any other particular\r\n\r\npoint  that I need mention at this stage,  Sir. I\r\n\r\nwould,  in conclusion, repeat that this  Bill  re-enacts   the  provisions  of  the  present  Public\r\n\r\nServices  Commission Ordinance with the amendments\r\n\r\nwhich  follow  from  the  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission. The reasons for  asking\r\n\r\nthat   the  Bill  should  be  put  through  on   a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of Urgency are, of course,  that,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  will have seen from the White  Paper,  we\r\n\r\nwish to start Malayanisation if possible from  the\r\n\r\n1st  of  January next year and we wish to get  the\r\n\r\nnew  Public Service Commission established so that\r\n\r\nit  can  start its task at the beginning  of  next\r\n\r\nyear by selecting the first local officers to take\r\n\r\nover the nine posts of Permanent Secretary grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one further point which I think I should\r\n\r\nmention,  and that is that it is the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe Government that the contents of this Bill will\r\n\r\nbe  included  in the new Colony Order  in  Council\r\n\r\nwhich  the Chief Minister hopes to obtain  in  the\r\n\r\nnear  future.  There again, that is in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  recommendations of  the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission   which   was   emphatic    that    the\r\n\r\ncomposition, establishment and the working\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the  Public  Service  Commission  should   be\r\n\r\nenshrined  in  an  Order in Council  so  that  the\r\n\r\nCommission  is shielded from day-to-day  decisions\r\n\r\nin the Legislative Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.14 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, we support the\r\n\r\nprinciple of the Bill. The proposed Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission differs from the previous one  in  that\r\n\r\nit  will  serve  different ends and  work  towards\r\n\r\ndifferent goals. The old Commission was  a  purely\r\n\r\nadvisory  body  and unless the Governor  chose  to\r\n\r\naccept its recommendations, its deliberations  and\r\n\r\ndecisions would come to nought. Now for the  first\r\n\r\ntime  we  shall have a Commission whose  conscious\r\n\r\naim  would  be  to  select men  of  integrity  and\r\n\r\nability  to  work the apparatus of state,  men  on\r\n\r\nwhose  integrity and ability the future  efficient\r\n\r\nadministration of this country depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst we are all in agreement with the\r\n\r\nmachinery which this Bill proposes to set  up,  we\r\n\r\nhave very grave doubts as to the intentions of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, or perhaps it may be of the  Governor,\r\n\r\nwith  respect to the men to be chosen to fill this\r\n\r\nCommission.  Singapore is a small  place  and  one\r\n\r\nhears  all  kinds of curious goings-on. There  are\r\n\r\neven  rumours that a distinguished record  in  the\r\n\r\nfield of sports might win somebody a seat on  this\r\n\r\nCommission. There are also rumours that an  office\r\n\r\nin  some established church might entitle a person\r\n\r\nto   a   seat   on  this  Commission.   There   is\r\n\r\nconsiderable dissatisfaction over the  person  who\r\n\r\nis   unofficially  the  Chairman-elect   of   this\r\n\r\nCommission. Sir, if this group of five men are not\r\n\r\npeople  with  imagination, ability  and  learning,\r\n\r\nthey  will  not be able correctly to appraise  the\r\n\r\ncandidates  and choose the men who  will  run  the\r\n\r\ngovernment machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely vital that the features which\r\n\r\nhave  marked the old Commission - feeble and  flabby\r\n\r\nmen  chosen  to sit on the Commission  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir   docility  and  servility  to  a   colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment, men who dare not take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  the chairmanship of the Commission  until  a\r\n\r\nwhite  man  has shown them how to do it - should  be\r\n\r\nwiped out. In the proposed Commission we must  put\r\n\r\nmen who are going to choose the future workers  of\r\n\r\nthe  State  on  the  basis of ability,  integrity,\r\n\r\ndrive  and a spirit of independence, not a  spirit\r\n\r\nof servility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the service today is filled by the English-educated elite. Most of the people in the service\r\n\r\nare either our friends, our neighbours or were our\r\n\r\nclass or college mates; and we know the gibes that\r\n\r\nare going on amongst the student generation - if you\r\n\r\nwant a good cushy job in the service, then be nice\r\n\r\nto  your  professor, be nice to your  master,  and\r\n\r\nkeep  clear  of  politics and other dangerous  and\r\n\r\ncontroversial issues. The result is that  we  will\r\n\r\nhave,  at  best,  an able but a docile  instrument\r\n\r\nwith no imagination and no guts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another type of students, those who have\r\n\r\nrebelled  against the system, those with  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of drive, impatient and exasperated with  the\r\n\r\nexisting system, so much so as to want to go  over\r\n\r\nto  the  other  extreme and to destroy  the  whole\r\n\r\nmachinery of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nwas  one of the issues which divided the political\r\n\r\nParties  when they went to London. We stated  then\r\n\r\nand we say it now that we will not be bound unless\r\n\r\nit is done with scrupulous honesty. We will not be\r\n\r\nbound  by the men whom the Governor may choose  to\r\n\r\nput  on  this Commission. If we are going to  have\r\n\r\npeople   who  have  distinguished  themselves   by\r\n\r\nlooking after the sporting interests of the Colony\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to sit on this Commission, then  let\r\n\r\nus scrap the whole thing. Let us have the boldness\r\n\r\nand  courage to choose men who, whether  we  agree\r\n\r\nwith  their political views or not, are men  whose\r\n\r\nspirited opposition to colonialism, whose  fervent\r\n\r\ndesire  to see an independent and vigorous country\r\n\r\nfree  and absolutely divorced from all those evils\r\n\r\nof  colonialism, will be able to choose other  men\r\n\r\nwho  will  be as equally spirited and  as  equally\r\n\r\ndetermined to build this independent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState.

Member, Sir, is correct that\r\n\r\nthe  old  Ordinance  included section  11(1)   (e) ,\r\n\r\nwhich  meant that any body of officers could  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Public Services  Commission\r\n\r\non  any  matter, and we have been in  consultation\r\n\r\nwith the representatives of the Staff Side on  the\r\n\r\nWhitley  Council over the appropriate  wording  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. I think I can say with confidence that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  divergence  of  views  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Side and the Staff Side in this matter.\r\n\r\nWe  are  agreed  that there are certain  important\r\n\r\nmatters  which now should not go to  an  executive\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission,  as  I  indicated  in\r\n\r\nmoving  my  motion. We are also agreed that  there\r\n\r\nare  other matters, such as representations on the\r\n\r\ngeneral  principles of promotion, over  which  the\r\n\r\nStaff  Side  should still have the right  to  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to  an executive  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government came to the conclusion that\r\n\r\nthey  could  not incorporate in the new  Bill  the\r\n\r\nvery  wide wording which appears in section  11(1) \r\n\r\n(e)   of the existing Ordinance, because that would\r\n\r\nlay  open the possibility at least that the Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission would infringe on  this  field\r\n\r\nwith  executive decisions where we and  the  Staff\r\n\r\nSide  are  agreed that they should  not  infringe,\r\n\r\nnamely, matters for direct negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would not be improper for me to add\r\n\r\nthat  we did attempt a new wording to go into this\r\n\r\nclause  of  the  Bill,  to try  and  define  those\r\n\r\nmatters on which it is quite proper that the Staff\r\n\r\nSide  should  make representations to  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission and those matters which  should\r\n\r\nbe excluded. We have not, unfortunately, been able\r\n\r\nto  arrive  at  a definition which is satisfactory\r\n\r\nand we have therefore not attempted any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinition  at  all.  I have tried  to  cover  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to some extent in speaking on the Bill.  I\r\n\r\nwould   just   add  that  if  we  could   find   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  definition, working in  consultation\r\n\r\nwith the Staff Side and indeed with any assistance\r\n\r\nwhich  the hon.

It seems to me that there is very little\r\n\r\ndifference  in the actual meaning of  the  phrase,\r\n\r\nbut  some  difference in meaning  must  have  been\r\n\r\nintended before the phrase was altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> To me, Sir, as a government officer,\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  essential  difference  between  the\r\n\r\nphrase   \"schemes  of  service\"  and   \"terms   of\r\n\r\nservice\". \"Terms of service\" primarily mean things\r\n\r\nlike  rates of pay. \"Schemes of service\" primarily\r\n\r\nmean  things like the qualifications required  for\r\n\r\nentering a particular service, the length of  time\r\n\r\nyou  will have to be in it, the opportunities  for\r\n\r\npromotion, the pyramid from the number of posts at\r\n\r\nthe  bottom up to the top and so on. They are,  to\r\n\r\nme  at  any rate and I think to the public service\r\n\r\ngenerally,  quite  different.

This  is  solely  a\r\n\r\nprecautionary  measure  and  it  does  not  mean - I\r\n\r\nrepeat,   Sir,   it   does  not   mean - that   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of rationing in the immediate  future\r\n\r\nis   contemplated.  Before  rationing   could   be\r\n\r\nintroduced,  it would still be necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  to  bring the Ordinance  into  force  by\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to clause 4 under which the Minister  has\r\n\r\nthe power to apply, by order, such sections of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance as might be necessary. This would  mean,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the Minister, if and when he considers\r\n\r\nit  necessary that rationing should be introduced,\r\n\r\nwould make such an order applicable to any of  the\r\n\r\nitems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor all of the items stated in the Schedule to this\r\n\r\nBill.

I repeat,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the presentation of this Bill does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  there is any present intention to  introduce\r\n\r\nrationing.

If ever anybody doubted that we  are\r\n\r\ntied up with the destinies and the misfortunes  of\r\n\r\nthe  British  and their Empire,  this  Bill  is  a\r\n\r\ntimely reminder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had in the past few weeks a stream of\r\n\r\nreassuring   statements  as  to  the   supply   of\r\n\r\npetroleum  from  all  the  distributors   of   oil\r\n\r\nproducts.  We  were, in fact,  reminded  that  our\r\n\r\nsource  of petroleum comes from the East  and  not\r\n\r\nfrom  the Middle East. But it was pointed  out  by\r\n\r\nsome  Government  spokesmen that it  might  become\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  divert the supplies available  from\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian islands to Britain, because Britain\r\n\r\nmight  be short. As far as I know, neither  Ceylon\r\n\r\nnor  India  nor  Pakistan nor Indonesia  has  been\r\n\r\naffected by what has been termed \"Eden's war\".  As\r\n\r\na  gesture  of protest, we will vote against  this\r\n\r\nBill.  We are against British imperialism. We  are\r\n\r\nagainst British militarism. We are against Britain\r\n\r\nanywhere in the world where she tries to subjugate\r\n\r\nother people, let alone try to re-subjugate a once\r\n\r\nsubject people who have become free. We will  not,\r\n\r\nI  repeat not, share their misfortunes as a result\r\n\r\nof  their  stupid and brutal acts  in  the  Middle\r\n\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Languages No. 3 annexed  to  the\r\n\r\nReport   should   be  referred  to   that   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. The purpose of this motion, Sir, is  to\r\n\r\ngive effect to this recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, enough has been said on the need\r\n\r\nfor  multi-lingualism in an Assembly  in  a  place\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore.  Certain objections  were  voiced\r\n\r\nduring  the debate in February this year,  one  of\r\n\r\nwhich   was   that  the  introduction  of   multi-lingualism   would   tend  to   encourage   racial\r\n\r\nconsciousness and racial antagonisms.  I  consider\r\n\r\nthat objection to be a very dangerous one, putting\r\n\r\nideas into people's heads. After all, language  is\r\n\r\na  means of communication of ideas and to say that\r\n\r\nit will tend to encourage racial consciousness and\r\n\r\nracial  antagonisms is deliberately putting  ideas\r\n\r\ninto  people's heads. Is multi-lingualism  not  in\r\n\r\nuse  in  our everyday lives, since the  people  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races came to live in Singapore? I speak\r\n\r\nat  least  three  languages  with  members  of  my\r\n\r\nfamily, with my friends and with my staff  in  the\r\n\r\noffice, and I am sure other Members of this  House\r\n\r\nalso  do  the same, and indeed, some may be  using\r\n\r\nmore  than three languages in their everyday life.\r\n\r\nIt  is grossly unfair that a man born in Singapore\r\n\r\nwith all his birthrights or is otherwise qualified\r\n\r\ncannot  sit  in this House and help  in  governing\r\n\r\nthis  country simply because he is unable to speak\r\n\r\nEnglish. Let us all not pretend in this House that\r\n\r\nit  is  only  through English that we can  express\r\n\r\nourselves  clearly and forcefully. I am sure  that\r\n\r\nat moments some of us feel that if multilingualism\r\n\r\nwere in use we would have put more force into  our\r\n\r\narguments and with a firmer conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the day will not be\r\n\r\nfar away when every person born in Singapore or is\r\n\r\notherwise qualified will be enabled to sit in this\r\n\r\nAssembly irrespective of the language in which  he\r\n\r\nwas  educated.  It is also my fervent  hope,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Select Committee to he appointed  under\r\n\r\nthis motion today\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  deal with this matter expeditiously so  that\r\n\r\nmulti-lingualism  will become a  reality  and  not\r\n\r\nremain  as an academic discussion.

While I do share the feelings of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill for the welfare of young hawkers and\r\n\r\nwhile I do agree with him that the City Magistrate\r\n\r\nis  in  a  position  to assist the  Government  in\r\n\r\nlooking  after their welfare, I find it  difficult\r\n\r\nto   see  how  his  membership  on  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nManagement  of a sports centre can be of  help  to\r\n\r\nthe  persons  whom he has expressed  a  desire  to\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the welfare of youthful hawkers is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I have taken note of all that the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember has said and will direct the Department  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  to  make a  close  study  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem and put up suggestions for the improvement\r\n\r\nof these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the Report of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee be adopted,\" put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Third Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

In my opinion, Sir, there is  no\r\n\r\nconnection between a language qualification and  a\r\n\r\ndriving  licence. As long as the applicant  for  a\r\n\r\ndriving  licence is competent to drive  a  vehicle\r\n\r\nwithout  jeopardising the lives of the public  and\r\n\r\nhe has some knowledge of the Highway Code, I think\r\n\r\nhe   should  be  given  a  licence.  Sir,  if  the\r\n\r\napplicant  is  going for a job  where  he  has  to\r\n\r\ncontrol labour, speaking either English or  Malay,\r\n\r\nthen he has to have a knowledge of these languages\r\n\r\nin  order to make himself understood. Or if a  man\r\n\r\nis  applying for a special language appointment in\r\n\r\nan academy, then I have no reason to disagree with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that that language qualification  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  But in this instance, it  is  entirely\r\n\r\nnonsense   to  enforce  a  law  where  a  language\r\n\r\nqualification is necessary for a driving licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if in the opinion of the Minister a\r\n\r\nlanguage qualification is necessary, why should it\r\n\r\nbe  in English and Malay only? What is wrong  with\r\n\r\nthe Chinese language? What is wrong with the Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage?  As the Minister has said,  we  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  speak  so many languages.  So  what  is\r\n\r\nwrong with languages other than Malay and English?\r\n\r\nBy  this, I hope the Malays will not misunderstand\r\n\r\nme  or that I am casting any reflection on them or\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguage. What I am trying to point out,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthe  language  concerned which an  applicant  must\r\n\r\nknow  before he can qualify for a driving licence.\r\n\r\nAs  we  all know, Singapore is a place where there\r\n\r\nare  many  nationalities - the English, the  Malays,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese, the Tamils, the Eurasians and so on.\r\n\r\nIf  Singapore  has  a  state  language,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, we have to speak that language. I remember\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Secretary  at  one  time  said   that\r\n\r\nSingapore has no state religion. So if we have  no\r\n\r\nstate  religion and no state language, why  should\r\n\r\nMalay be a compulsory language qualification for a\r\n\r\ndriving licence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the local district councils come into\r\n\r\nbeing,  there  will  be  four  languages  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of oral debate. In this Assembly we  have\r\n\r\njust  appointed a Select Committee to go into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  languages for the  purpose  of  oral\r\n\r\ndebate.  The Chief Minister has just said that  he\r\n\r\nhopes  the  day will not be far off  when  several\r\n\r\nlanguages  will be used in this Assembly  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  oral  debate so  that  we  could  all\r\n\r\nexpress our views in a more forceful way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that the present Road Traffic\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  out  of  date.  This  Ordinance,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose,  was framed by the colonial officers  and\r\n\r\nnot  by an elected government. Now, sitting on the\r\n\r\nFront  Benches, we have a row of elected Ministers\r\n\r\nwith  the  exception  of  three  ex-officios;  and\r\n\r\nunfortunately, Sir, the Minister who is in  charge\r\n\r\nof  this matter is a Nominated Minister and not an\r\n\r\nelected  one.  I think that is the reason  why  he\r\n\r\ncannot understand the views of the general public.\r\n\r\nHe  has his own views as a Nominated Minister,  so\r\n\r\nhe can have his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may put forward one reason for this insistence on Malay as a language qualification, and that is, most of the police constables are Malays, and as such applicants for a driving licence should be able at least to speak Malay. If that is so, then I think it is entirely wrong,\r\n\r\nSir. In the Courts, we have Court interpreters and\r\n\r\nin   some   offices  I  think   there   are   also\r\n\r\ninterpreters  who  are  engaged  for  the  job  of\r\n\r\ninterpreting for the benefit of the public. Can we\r\n\r\nnot have Chinese or Indian testers, instead of confining ourselves to Malay and English\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntesters?  The Government should try  to  help  the\r\n\r\napplicant who comes to apply for a driving licence\r\n\r\nand  try  to  understand his  language.  Even  the\r\n\r\n\"Safety First\" literature issued by the Government\r\n\r\nis  printed in four languages! So why should there\r\n\r\nbe this insistence that an applicant for a driving\r\n\r\nlicence  must be able to speak either  English  or\r\n\r\nMalay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more comment I want to make on the\r\n\r\nTraffic Department, and that is an application for\r\n\r\na  date  for a driving test. I have here,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nlicence  which  was issued on 14th January,  1956,\r\n\r\nand  the  learner in question applied for  a  test\r\n\r\nyesterday,   i.e.   5th   December.   On   it   is\r\n\r\nendorsed - \"Test booked for 17th May, 1957\".  So  it\r\n\r\ntakes  the Department five months and twelve  days\r\n\r\nbefore  it  can test the applicant. Is that  fair,\r\n\r\nSir?  A provisional licence is only valid for  six\r\n\r\nmonths  and  it  costs  the applicant  $10.  After\r\n\r\napplying  for a provisional licence,  the  learner\r\n\r\nwill  have to take up a course of driving under  a\r\n\r\ntutor. It does not mean that by just applying  for\r\n\r\na  licence he is fixed for a test. When  he  feels\r\n\r\nthat he is ready for a test, which may be in three\r\n\r\nmonths'  time,  he goes to the Traffic  Department\r\n\r\nand  applies for a date for a test. This will take\r\n\r\nanother five months and twelve days plus the three\r\n\r\nmonths  during which he is learning how to  drive,\r\n\r\nwhich  makes  it  eight months  and  twelve  days,\r\n\r\nbefore he could sit for a test. By that time, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  licence has already expired and the applicant\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  pay  another $10  to  get  another\r\n\r\nprovisional  licence. If he is  fortunate  enough,\r\n\r\nSir,  within  that eight months he  may  pass  the\r\n\r\ntest; but if he is unfortunate because of language\r\n\r\ndisqualification,  he  may  fail  the  test,   and\r\n\r\nbecause  he has failed, he will have to  wait  for\r\n\r\nanother month before he can apply for a date. Then\r\n\r\nagain  he will have to wait for another six months\r\n\r\nbefore  he can have the actual test. All  in  all.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  may take 16 months before a learner  can\r\n\r\nqualify for a test: three months learning  how  to\r\n\r\ndrive a vehicle; six months for the first booking:\r\n\r\na wait of one month because of his failure to pass\r\n\r\nthe  test  the  first time; and then  another  six\r\n\r\nmonths  before  he goes for his second  test.  And\r\n\r\nhaving to wait all this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime,  I am afraid he will have forgotten  how  to\r\n\r\ndrive!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from all this, Sir, there is the question\r\n\r\nof  cost  to the learner. As I have said,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nprovisional licence is valid for only six  months,\r\n\r\nand  in  this  16  months the  licence  will  have\r\n\r\nexpired  three times. All in all, he will have  to\r\n\r\npay  $30 for the licence. On top of that, when  he\r\n\r\napplies for a test, he will have to pay $5 for it,\r\n\r\nand if he takes two tests to pass, he will have to\r\n\r\npay $10. So the total cost will come to $40 for  a\r\n\r\nprovisional  licence, and all this is  apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  fee that he has to pay his driving tutor  and\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of petrol while he is learning  how  to\r\n\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Sir, that all bookings for a\r\n\r\ndriving test be cancelled immediately and that  as\r\n\r\nmany  applicants  as  possible  who  come  to  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  be tested. In the morning  they  could\r\n\r\nregister those who have come to register and  test\r\n\r\nthem  and  those who have not been tested  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning  could  be  tested in the  afternoon,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  have not been tested in the  afternoon\r\n\r\nshould get priority for a test the next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason that the Minister may give to\r\n\r\naccount  for  the applicant for a driving  licence\r\n\r\nhaving  to wait such a long time before he can  be\r\n\r\ntested  is that there is a big backlog of work  in\r\n\r\nthe Department. I think it is all wrong. It is the\r\n\r\ninefficiency  of  the Department rather  than  the\r\n\r\nbacklog that is at the root of all this delay. The\r\n\r\nbacklog  is caused by bookings because a  learner,\r\n\r\nas  soon as he gets a provisional driving licence,\r\n\r\nbooks for a date irrespective of whether or not he\r\n\r\nis  ready  to  go for a test. The reason  for  his\r\n\r\nimmediate booking is that he wants to catch up  on\r\n\r\nthe  time that he is forced to wait before  he  is\r\n\r\ntested.  Unless he books immediately, he may  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  $40  or $50 before he finally passes  his\r\n\r\ntest.  Now after booking that date for a test,  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  that when the time comes he is not  ready\r\n\r\nand  he consequently fails to pass the test.  Then\r\n\r\nanother  booking  date  is  given.  So  if   these\r\n\r\nbookings are allowed to carry on and on, it is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment which is creating a backlog and not the\r\n\r\npublic. The public are forced into it. So  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could  arrange for all  bookings  to  be\r\n\r\ncancelled  and the applicants tested  as  soon  as\r\n\r\nthey  come  to the Department, I think that  would\r\n\r\nhelp to clear the backlog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one other comment to make, Sir. If a\r\n\r\nlearner fails a test, I think he has the right  to\r\n\r\ndemand  why he has failed the test or how  he  has\r\n\r\nfailed the test. Sir, there is a printed statement\r\n\r\nto  the  effect that testers are not  required  to\r\n\r\ngive  reasons for failing an applicant.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwho    has   given   that   authority    to    the\r\n\r\nDepartment - that testers are not required  to  give\r\n\r\nreasons  for  failing an applicant?  When  I  went\r\n\r\nthrough  the Road Traffic Ordinance, I  could  not\r\n\r\nfind anything at all to indicate that that is  so.\r\n\r\nHow  come  then that this statement  is  there?  I\r\n\r\ncannot understand. Is it on the initiative of  the\r\n\r\nofficer in charge, or is it with the permission of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  or  the  Minister  himself?  As  a\r\n\r\nlearner who has failed his driving test, he should\r\n\r\nbe told where and how he has gone wrong so that he\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to correct himself,  and  when  he\r\n\r\nappears for the next test he will be able to guard\r\n\r\nagainst his faults and drive properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Sir, I feel that the applicant's\r\n\r\ntutor  should  accompany him when he  goes  for  a\r\n\r\ntest,  because the tutor should also know how  his\r\n\r\npupil  failed. According to law, only two  persons\r\n\r\nare  allowed in the vehicle, that is,  the  driver\r\n\r\n(in this case, the learner) and the tester. But  I\r\n\r\nhave  seen many cases, Sir, where the tester takes\r\n\r\nthe learner out in his vehicle and he brings along\r\n\r\na police officer or another tester who sits at the\r\n\r\nback  of  the car. If the law only says  two,  why\r\n\r\nthen allow four where the police are concerned? So\r\n\r\nI  would suggest, Sir, that the next time  that  a\r\n\r\nlearner   goes  for  a  test,  his  tutor   should\r\n\r\naccompany  him and so would be able  to  know  the\r\n\r\nfaults of his pupil and then correct him later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is high time that the Road Traffic\r\n\r\nOrdinance  be  revised. Whether  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nnominated  or  elected, I think he should  consult\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues  who are mostly elected  Ministers\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevise  the Ordinance which should suit the people\r\n\r\nand not the Minister himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to round\r\n\r\noff  the  many  points raised by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown in his speech, perhaps the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nhas  forgotten  to mention that if he  wants  this\r\n\r\ndriving  test  in all the various languages,  then\r\n\r\nall the traffic signs should be multilingual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think I have pointed out before in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Members  of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition are advised not to get heated until\r\n\r\nthey  find out what the facts of the case are.  We\r\n\r\nhave  heard  stirring claims from the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  about  inefficiency  and  backlog  and\r\n\r\nscrap  this  and  destroy that.  He  has  drawn  a\r\n\r\npainful picture of a man who has bought a car  and\r\n\r\nhas obtained a provisional driving licence and has\r\n\r\nstarted  practising. After three months  he  says,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  I can go ahead now and apply for a  test.\"\r\n\r\nAfter  six months he goes for a test and he fails,\r\n\r\nof  course, because he has only had nine months of\r\n\r\npractice  and  does not feel confident.  He  tries\r\n\r\nagain but keeps failing. All that takes 16 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is that\r\n\r\nthe  Department  is  working to  capacity  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  basis. There were six testers  in  1955\r\n\r\nand  the number was increased to 12 at the end  of\r\n\r\n1955 and to 18 in June of this year. The number is\r\n\r\nnow  120 persons tested a day and the testers  are\r\n\r\nworking to capacity. If you want to put your  name\r\n\r\ndown for a booking, you will get it about 165 days\r\n\r\nahead.  I  am advised that that is the approximate\r\n\r\ndate  at the moment. But what the hon. Member  has\r\n\r\noverlooked and what he could find out if  he  made\r\n\r\nenquiries either from the Traffic Branch  or  from\r\n\r\nme  is  that, in fact, about 50 per cent of  those\r\n\r\nwho  put their names down for bookings do not make\r\n\r\nuse  of  them.  The booking is primarily  a  thing\r\n\r\nwhich  serves the needs of the person who is going\r\n\r\nto  buy  a  car and who has a provisional  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  and who goes to a school of motoring  and\r\n\r\nsays,  \"I will take a six-month course and then  I\r\n\r\nwill  go for my test.\" At the same time as he gets\r\n\r\na licence he puts his name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  for a test, and he knows what date  he  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be ready for and then he goes along  and\r\n\r\ntakes  it. If he has any doubts about his driving,\r\n\r\nhe  will  write  in and say, \"I will  postpone  my\r\n\r\ndriving test because I do not feel quite ready for\r\n\r\nit  yet.\" Consequently the booking of tests  is  a\r\n\r\nreal convenience to the public. But if you want to\r\n\r\nget a test in a hurry, I am assured by the Traffic\r\n\r\nBranch  that you can get one at very short notice,\r\n\r\ncertainly within one week. So if the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nfriend,  who  has  applied  and  got  it  on   5th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1956, and got a date for a test on  17th\r\n\r\nMay,  1957, feels in a hurry, he can go  along  to\r\n\r\nthe Traffic Branch and try to get a booking. If he\r\n\r\ndoes not get one in a reasonable space of time, he\r\n\r\ncan   go  to  a  Licensing  Officer,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nLicensing  Officer does not give him satisfaction,\r\n\r\nhe  can  go to the hon. Member and the hon. Member\r\n\r\ncan  speak to me about it and we will see what  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  about it. In short, I do not  think  this\r\n\r\nbacklog  is  a  thing which matters in  the  least\r\n\r\nbecause, as I say, as things are going at present,\r\n\r\nthere  is every possibility that a man will get  a\r\n\r\ntest  within two or three days, at the most within\r\n\r\none  week.  If there was any question of priority,\r\n\r\nof  course priority would be given to those  whose\r\n\r\nneeds are obviously greatest, such as the man  who\r\n\r\nhas  got a car, or who wants to buy a car for  his\r\n\r\nbusiness, or a man whose livelihood depends on it,\r\n\r\nthat  is, a professional syce driver, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThere  may be a few cases where there is  hardship\r\n\r\nof  some sort or another. That is inevitable  when\r\n\r\nyou  are dealing with an enormous number of people\r\n\r\nwho are not subject to orders and you have got  to\r\n\r\nget  them through as quickly as you can. If a  man\r\n\r\nfeels  that  he  has hardship,  he  should  see  a\r\n\r\nLicensing Officer, and if he still feels  that  he\r\n\r\nis having hardship, he can of course go higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this question of testing, I might mention\r\n\r\nthat   representatives   of   important   motoring\r\n\r\norganisations  with a large Asian membership  were\r\n\r\ninvited  not so long ago to watch the testing  and\r\n\r\nto   express  their  views,  and  they  were  very\r\n\r\nfavourably impressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main question was the question of\r\n\r\nmultilingualism.  I  will  first  take  the  point\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTanjong   Pagar  about  traffic  signs   in   four\r\n\r\nlanguages. The object of a driving sign is that it\r\n\r\nshould be something which can be quickly seen  and\r\n\r\ninterpreted by a person who is moving in a vehicle\r\n\r\nwhich  is  perhaps going of 20, 25 or 30 miles  an\r\n\r\nhour, and he cannot stop and linger and study  the\r\n\r\nthing in the way that a pedestrian can. If you are\r\n\r\ngoing to have a notice board with traffic signs in\r\n\r\nfour  languages, it will have to be a  very  large\r\n\r\nboard to get the writing big enough to be seen and\r\n\r\neven  then it might be confusing because one  goes\r\n\r\nup  and  down, one goes across, and one  goes  the\r\n\r\nother way. Then, of course, if you do not have  it\r\n\r\nbig  enough,  it  will  be illegible  for  anybody\r\n\r\nexcept  a pedestrian who goes and stands in  front\r\n\r\nof it. The answer to that, I think, is that as far\r\n\r\nas  possible all signs should be symbols which can\r\n\r\nbe  understood by anybody, regardless of language.\r\n\r\nIt  is not always possible to provide satisfactory\r\n\r\nsymbols,  but we are frequently making changes  to\r\n\r\nthem and trying to improve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is the question of a language\r\n\r\nqualification.   I  stated  yesterday   that   the\r\n\r\napplicant  for a test has to have a  knowledge  of\r\n\r\neither  English  or  colloquial  Malay.  That,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is not, to my nominated mind, a brilliant\r\n\r\nidea  but it is in the 1948 Rules. I cannot accept\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  drafting this  qualification,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am  prepared to accept responsibility  for\r\n\r\nchanging  it.  I  should like  to  clear  up  what\r\n\r\nperhaps  is a misapprehension in the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nmind   that  many  people  fail  because  of  this\r\n\r\nlanguage qualification. The qualification is there\r\n\r\nbecause you must have some means of communication.\r\n\r\nYou  must  have  some means of  understanding  the\r\n\r\nlanguage between the driver and the tester and, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the traffic police, I am assured, interpret\r\n\r\nit very generously and as long as they are able to\r\n\r\nunderstand each other, that is about all  that  is\r\n\r\nrequired. They tell me that, although they do  not\r\n\r\nkeep  figures  of the people who fail specifically\r\n\r\non  the grounds of language - because the number  is\r\n\r\ntoo small to be worth recording - they do, in fact,\r\n\r\nkeep figures of the reasons for failure. As far as\r\n\r\nthey can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreak  down the figures, they do not think  it  is\r\n\r\nmore than one or two persons out of 3,000 tested a\r\n\r\nmonth  who  fail because of language difficulties.\r\n\r\nThat is a very minute proportion and even that  is\r\n\r\na  guesswork figure. The causes of failure are, of\r\n\r\ncourse,    inability   to   perform    the    road\r\n\r\ntest - starting and parking and turning and all  the\r\n\r\nother  things that you have to do in a road  test.\r\n\r\nWhen   a   question  is  asked  of  an  applicant,\r\n\r\nallowance  is made for the fact that  he  may  not\r\n\r\nspeak good English or Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of language, there is also the\r\n\r\npoint   which  the  hon.  Member  mentioned   that\r\n\r\nmotorists  on the road should desirably have  some\r\n\r\nlanguage of communication in case a driver  has  a\r\n\r\nminor  accident  or in case he  has  to  be  given\r\n\r\ndirections  in  case of an emergency,  and  if  he\r\n\r\ncannot understand the term \"Turn right\" or \"Pusing\r\n\r\nkanan\",  or  whatever the policeman says  to  him,\r\n\r\nwell,  he  is going to be in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is an insignificant point because most\r\n\r\nmotorists do not get into emergencies and  do  not\r\n\r\nhave to be given instructions by the police. It is\r\n\r\nnot   that   which   lies  behind   the   language\r\n\r\nqualification.   It   is  really   a   matter   of\r\n\r\nadministrative efficiency. The system  of  testing\r\n\r\nis  that  every  one of the 18 testers  can  speak\r\n\r\nEnglish  and Malay and consequently can  take  any\r\n\r\napplicant for a driving licence. The applicants do\r\n\r\nnot know beforehand who is going to test them.  If\r\n\r\nyou  are  going  to  introduce  a  Hokchew  or   a\r\n\r\nCantonese  tester, or whatever  tester  you  like,\r\n\r\nthen  everyone  who is going for a  test  in  that\r\n\r\nlanguage will know that Mr So-and-so is  the  man\r\n\r\nwho  is  going  to test him and nobody  else.  The\r\n\r\neffect  of  that  would be that they  would,  from\r\n\r\nexperience in the past, put very great pressure on\r\n\r\nhim  or temptation in his way so that he will pass\r\n\r\nthem  through  the  test.  That  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nexperience.  I  do not remember any allegation  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  that there had been corruption  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  testers. I am happy to say that I am  assured\r\n\r\nagain  that  there is no question at  all  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplete  honesty of the testers now,  and  in  my\r\n\r\nview  it  is  very important that public  servants\r\n\r\ndoing this difficult job should be protected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom any allegation that they have been corrupt in\r\n\r\ntheir  contact with the \"testee\". If  you  put  it\r\n\r\ndown that Mr So-and-so is the man who is going to\r\n\r\ntest  all  the  applicants speaking his  language,\r\n\r\nthen allegations of corruption and, of course, the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  real  corruption  will  certainly\r\n\r\nstart.  That is a very important point,  I  think,\r\n\r\nfor  making  sure that the applicant  cannot  know\r\n\r\nbeforehand  who is going to test him. Moreover  if\r\n\r\nthe applicant fails, he goes to a different tester\r\n\r\non his second test, and if he fails again, he goes\r\n\r\nto  a  different tester again. This is  partly  to\r\n\r\nprotect  him just in case there was some  personal\r\n\r\ndislike on the part of the tester, or on the  part\r\n\r\nof the \"testee\" for that matter. The simple answer\r\n\r\nto  all  this,  of  course, is that  every  tester\r\n\r\nshould be able to speak every language or dialect,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  not easy to get testers of the  right\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  ability and  education  and  other\r\n\r\nqualifications required, and if we were to  insist\r\n\r\nthat  they  also had to be fully multilingual,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  almost impossible to get the number  of\r\n\r\ntesters you need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just mentioning these difficulties because\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of  the  language qualification  lies\r\n\r\nlargely in the administration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  these  tests, the need to see  that  they  are\r\n\r\nefficiently  conducted and  do  not  lead  to  any\r\n\r\nallegations of unfairness. I do not say  that  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties   which   I   have   mentioned    are\r\n\r\ninsuperable  and  I propose to try  and  get  them\r\n\r\novercome. I am going to give instructions that Kuo-yu  should  be  allowed as a  third  language  for\r\n\r\ntesting, and I think suitable arrangements can  be\r\n\r\nmade  to deal with that at present. If we can  add\r\n\r\nfurther  languages or dialects  at  a  later  date\r\n\r\nwithout  damaging the efficiency or  lowering  the\r\n\r\nstandards   of  driving,  then  I  will  certainly\r\n\r\nconsider  them further. I think Kuo-yu  will  meet\r\n\r\nthe  major needs at the moment and if we find that\r\n\r\nthat  is successful and if there is a clear demand\r\n\r\nor  reason for further languages or dialects to be\r\n\r\nadded to meet the needs of the public, I think  we\r\n\r\ncan consider them further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at fourteen</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">minutes past Three o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
