The cause is partly because\r\n\r\nof  the  new  tariffs. However,  there  are  other\r\n\r\nfactors such as the decline in trade between Japan\r\n\r\nand the United States with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  PSA is watching the position closely and will\r\n\r\ntake every measure to ensure that no hardship will\r\n\r\nbe caused to its workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In respect of the PSA wharves at Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  for  the  first quarter  of  1972  and  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding period of 1971:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 999 ships with a tonnage of 3.79 million NRT\r\n\r\nwere berthed in 1972, as compared with 1,032 ships\r\n\r\nwith 3.54 million NRT for the same period in 1971;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 2.31 million tonnes of cargo (including\r\n\r\ngeneral,  fuel and bulk) were loaded  on  and  off\r\n\r\nthese  vessels  in  1972, as  compared  with  2.53\r\n\r\nmillion tonnes for the same period in 1971;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) total revenue, including port dues,\r\n\r\npilot  age  and  dock dues, wharf labour  revenue,\r\n\r\nstorage   rent,  wharf  age  and  other   revenues\r\n\r\nconnected  with  these  ships  and  cargo  handled\r\n\r\namounted to $34.39 million for the period  January\r\n\r\nto  March  1972, as compared with $24.229  million\r\n\r\nfor the same period in 1971;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) PSA figures for work done by its employees\r\n\r\nat the wharf are not kept in terms of man-days but\r\n\r\nin  terms of gang-hours. For the first quarter  of\r\n\r\n1972  the  total  gang-hours  worked  amounted  to\r\n\r\n99,530,  as  compared with 131,949  for  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The reduction in the usage of the PSA wharves\r\n\r\nat  Tanjong Pagar is one of the objectives of  the\r\n\r\nnew   tariffs  introduced  with  effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1972. The new tariffs ensured that  there\r\n\r\nwill be more effective utilisation of the wharves,\r\n\r\nless  congestion, quicker working of  cargoes  and\r\n\r\nmore expeditious turn-round time of ships. Average\r\n\r\nturn-round time per vessel dropped from 49X  hours\r\n\r\nin  1971 to 39 hours in 1972. Average waiting time\r\n\r\nfor a berth dropped from five hours in 1971 to one\r\n\r\nand  a  quarter  hours in 1972.

What has happened,\r\n\r\nof  course, is that the port workers earn  a  full\r\n\r\nmonth's  wages for working 19 to 20  days  of  the\r\n\r\nmonth,  and for the rest of the month they  go  on\r\n\r\nholiday.  I  think  this is  the  reason  for  the\r\n\r\nimpression that there has been a reduced  workload\r\n\r\nat  the  port.  However, since 1964  the  PSA  has\r\n\r\nguaranteed its daily-rated port workers a  monthly\r\n\r\nminimum  earning  computed under  an  arithmetical\r\n\r\nformula  of  26  times the sum of  the  individual\r\n\r\nworker's  daily  basic salary, plus  his  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving allowance, average shift allowance payable,\r\n\r\nplus  30  times his daily housing allowance.  This\r\n\r\nminimum  earning  does not include  any  incentive\r\n\r\nbonus payment, which is dependent on productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add this further information to\r\n\r\nassure  the  Member  for Telok  Blangah  that  the\r\n\r\nintegrated gang labour during the first quarter of\r\n\r\nthis  year  had an average of 25 days'  work,  and\r\n\r\nmost  of them earned either more or less than what\r\n\r\nthey  earned last year. For the period January  to\r\n\r\nMarch  1972, as compared with the same period  for\r\n\r\n1971,  out  of  a  total of 2,122 integrated  gang\r\n\r\nlabourers, 1,376 had increased earnings whilst 746\r\n\r\nhad  decreased  earnings. The  port  and  shipping\r\n\r\nindustry is an industry in which there can  be  no\r\n\r\nconsistent level of work. On some days, more  work\r\n\r\nis performed above the average requirements, while\r\n\r\non other days there are shortfalls. It is for this\r\n\r\nreason  that  the PSA has resorted to  a  pool  of\r\n\r\ncasual labour who could be asked to supplement the\r\n\r\nnormal  labour force on those occasions  when  the\r\n\r\ndemand for labour exceeds the supply, and who also\r\n\r\nact as substitutes for permanent labourers who are\r\n\r\non leave or absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casual labourers consist of unemployed workers\r\n\r\nregistered  with the Ministry of Labour  and  also\r\n\r\nwith the Pont Authority. The registration of these\r\n\r\ncasual labourers does not imply that the PSA  will\r\n\r\nautomatically offer them work daily. But on  those\r\n\r\ndays  when  the casual labourers report and  offer\r\n\r\nthemselves for work and should there be no work, a\r\n\r\npayment  of  $1 is made to each worker  so  as  to\r\n\r\nassist him to recover his travelling expenses. The\r\n\r\npresent poo1 of casual labourers has been  on  the\r\n\r\nregister since February 1971. The total number  is\r\n\r\nabout 424 as at the end of March 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 1972, no casual\r\n\r\nlabourer  has less than 14 days' work in a  month.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, casual labourers have an average  of  19\r\n\r\ndays' work per month. However, it is the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Port Authority to gradually ease out the pool\r\n\r\nof  casual labourers into the general labour pool,\r\n\r\nand  this should be so particularly at this moment\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is a shortage of labour in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand it is important that we should not keep such a\r\n\r\nlarge  pool of casual labour around the port.  But\r\n\r\nafter  consultation  with representatives  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard,  we  have  agreed that the pool  should  be\r\n\r\neased  off  gradually so as to enable  the  casual\r\n\r\nlabourers to re-adjust themselves to another  form\r\n\r\nof work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said, Mr Speaker, points out the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the improved methods which have been adopted\r\n\r\nat  the Port have increased productivity, and  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the average worker is earning a month's\r\n\r\nsalary  in half the time that he used to do should\r\n\r\nordinarily be regarded as a boom to the  industry.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is  unfortunate that at this period  when\r\n\r\nthere  is a recession in world trade, particularly\r\n\r\nbetween Japan and the United States, the slack  or\r\n\r\nthe  leisure time which should have been  occupied\r\n\r\nin fruitful work has not been made available. I am\r\n\r\nafraid  the Port Authority is not responsible  for\r\n\r\nthis,  as  it  is  not  in control  of  the  world\r\n\r\neconomic  situation.  However,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  the Member for Telok Blangah that no  gang\r\n\r\nlabour registered with the Port Authority will  be\r\n\r\nregarded as redundant labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

In effect,\r\n\r\nthe  officers  receive  full  pay  throughout  the\r\n\r\nduration  of  the  course. This  practice  is  not\r\n\r\nungenerous, when considered in relation to another\r\n\r\nregulation  for  a Government officer  wishing  to\r\n\r\napply  for permission to attend a course of  study\r\n\r\nleading to a degree, diploma or other professional\r\n\r\ntechnical  qualifications. If  such  a  course  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  of  direct  value  to  his   Ministry,\r\n\r\napproval  may  be  given on  the  basis  that  the\r\n\r\nofficer  must use up his vacation leave,  if  any,\r\n\r\nand thereafter is given no-pay leave only. I would\r\n\r\nsuggest that a unionist should be prepared to make\r\n\r\nthe  small  sacrifice entailed  in  consuming  his\r\n\r\nvacation leave in attending, by his own choice,  a\r\n\r\ncourse  organised by his union.

The Consultants, who carried out a feasibility study on \r\n\r\nthe basis of economic considerations, the construction of a three-lane\r\n\r\ncarriageways at an estimated cost of $19 million. \r\n\r\nA section of the bridge could be opened at specific times to\r\n\r\nallow for the passage of ships, thus enabling shipyards and \r\n\r\nindustries situated there to continue operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative proposal to constuct a dam for the proposed crossing\r\n\r\nand to convert the Kallang Basin into a stoage reservoir cum scenic\r\n\r\nlake has also been investigated. It has been ascertained \r\n\r\nthat the densely populated catchments of the Kallang and Geylang\r\n\r\nRivers yield highly polluted water which is discharged into the Kallang\r\n\r\nBasin.

If an employer has not paid any bonus\r\n\r\nto  his employees or has paid a bonus of less than\r\n\r\none  month's wages before the commencement of this\r\n\r\nAct,  the  annual wage supplement payable  by  him\r\n\r\nshall   not  exceed  one  month's  wages  of   the\r\n\r\nemployee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a notice is served under section 17 of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act by an employer or a trade\r\n\r\nunion  of employees in respect of the annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement, annual bonus or annual wage  increases\r\n\r\nreferred to in subsection (I) of section 46, or  a\r\n\r\ncombination   thereof  as  is   referred   to   in\r\n\r\nsubsections  (2) and (3) of that section,  and  no\r\n\r\nagreement is reached between the parties on any of\r\n\r\nthose   matters,  either  of  the   parties   may,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the provisions of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Act, refer the matter to the Court which\r\n\r\nmay make a decision thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions are inserted in the Employ, ment Act\r\n\r\nwhich  enable an employer to invite a trade  union\r\n\r\nof  employees,  and for the latter  to  invite  an\r\n\r\nemployer  to  negotiate for  the  variation  of  a\r\n\r\ncollective agreement or award made before or after\r\n\r\nthe enactment of the Bill by including a provision\r\n\r\nfor   the   payment  of  either  an  annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement  or  an  annual bonus  or  annual  wage\r\n\r\nincreases, or a combination thereof as is referred\r\n\r\nto  previously.

The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  is aware of the needs and  aspirations\r\n\r\nof  the workers and the underlying purpose of this\r\n\r\nlegislation is to ensure that workers in Singapore\r\n\r\nmay  have their fair share of the prosperity  that\r\n\r\nhas been generated by the present buoyant economic\r\n\r\nconditions.  Employers  generally  recognise  that\r\n\r\nworkers  should  have an increased  share  in  the\r\n\r\nprofits  of their undertakings. However, all  this\r\n\r\ndoes not mean that excessive and unbridled demands\r\n\r\nshould be made upon employers - such demands  must\r\n\r\nbe  tampered by reasonableness and moderation.  By\r\n\r\nthe same token, employers are expected to exercise\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  reasonableness  in  meeting  the\r\n\r\nclaims of their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Amendment Bill now introduced by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Labour  has  come  about  because   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the National  Wages  Council.\r\n\r\nThis  has  a very important bearing on the  future\r\n\r\neconomic  growth of our industrial programme.  The\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill may affect the viability\r\n\r\nof  many  companies  which have  been  established\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  few years as a  result  of  our\r\n\r\nattractive   financial   inducements   and    good\r\n\r\nindustrial   relations,   and   other   favourable\r\n\r\ninvestment factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to point out to the House that\r\n\r\nnot  all these industrial firms are making profits\r\n\r\nand many of them are still struggling hard to keep\r\n\r\non  an  even keel. Therefore, it is vital that  an\r\n\r\nopportunity should be given to employers to  study\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  more thoroughly, and at the  same  time\r\n\r\nunions must keep a level-headed attitude in  their\r\n\r\ndemands  arising from the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council, and not to kill the  goose\r\n\r\nthat  lays  the golden eggs. The workers  are  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  suffer if their demands are so exacting\r\n\r\nas  to  hasten the company to become less able  to\r\n\r\nbreak even, or force the company to close down and\r\n\r\nfall  into  the  arms  of  the  receivers.  As  an\r\n\r\nemployer, I am all in favour of workers getting  a\r\n\r\nfairer share of the cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of what I have said,\r\n\r\nthe   Bill  has  a  serious  implication  on   our\r\n\r\nRepublic's  economic survival. I would  move  that\r\n\r\nthe Bill be referred to a Select Committee instead\r\n\r\nof  passing  the Bill on a Certificate of  Urgency\r\n\r\ntoday so that employers may have a chance to study\r\n\r\nthe  Employment (Amendment) Bill in depth  and  in\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

When the Minister  made  a\r\n\r\nlengthy speech on the Second Reading, I was trying\r\n\r\nto  make notes of his speech, and at the same time\r\n\r\nI was thinking whether it was really necessary and\r\n\r\nurgent that we must take this Bill through all its\r\n\r\nstages in today's sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister was right when he said that the\r\n\r\nNational  Employees  Council,  the  Manufacturers'\r\n\r\nAssociation, the NTUC, the Government, as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers of Commerce met on the 23rd May.  We\r\n\r\ndecided that, irrespective of legislative changes,\r\n\r\nwe should go ahead with the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council. Sir, you must have read in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  that  a  number  of  unions  have\r\n\r\nsubmitted claims and have invited the employers to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  on the Wages Council's recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe have not come across any hitch as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the speech made by the Minister just\r\n\r\nnow,  Sir,  I myself, having been associated  with\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, am confused with a number of  terms\r\n\r\nthat   he  referred  to,  such  as  \"annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement\", a phrase which I hear for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime.  If  I can be confused, other union  members\r\n\r\nwill  be  more confused with such terms  as  \"13th\r\n\r\nmonth   wage\",   \"annual  bonus\",   \"annual   wage\r\n\r\nincreases\",  and he also mentioned \"a  combination\r\n\r\nof all three\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill does not only put into effect the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the National Wages Council, but\r\n\r\nit  also recommends some other changes. One of the\r\n\r\nchanges   that   he  proposes  to   introduce   is\r\n\r\nincreasing the limit of overtime, from 48 hours to\r\n\r\n96   hours  per  month.  This  will  have  further\r\n\r\nimplications.  1  have  spoken  on  at  least  two\r\n\r\noccasions  in this Chamber about the  problems  of\r\n\r\nlimiting  overtime, especially  in  the  essential\r\n\r\nservices.  Therefore,  I support  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley that we submit this Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  instead of hurrying its passage  today.\r\n\r\nOn  that  note,  Sir,  I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nreconsider his decision to carry this Bill through\r\n\r\nall its three stages today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  very  glad that  the  Government  has\r\n\r\naccepted the recommendations of the National Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil. 1 believe this is in appreciation of  the\r\n\r\nhard  work,  the sacrifices and the restraints  on\r\n\r\nthe   part  of  the  workers,  thus  helping   the\r\n\r\nemployers  to make the best possible  profits.

Will  the  Minister   consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  a  minimum wage in  the  Bill?  if  a\r\n\r\nminimum   wage  is  introduced,  the  bonus   will\r\n\r\nprobably  be  restricted  to  three  months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The\r\n\r\nMinister  was  very interested about  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.

Is he proposing  that\r\n\r\nthe  unions  should negotiate with the Government,\r\n\r\nor  does he propose to introduce another Bill  for\r\n\r\nthe  public sector? I hope the Minister will  look\r\n\r\ninto  this  matter. It is very important  that  we\r\n\r\nalso  look after the public sector because  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  backbone of the Government.

That\r\n\r\nis why representatives of the NTUC, the management\r\n\r\nand  the  National  Wages Council  met  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  on  the 23rd May.

It embodied two objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To allow under certain circumstances the\r\n\r\nremoval of organs or tissues or the examination of\r\n\r\nthe  body  after death. Such procedures  could  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  when  the  person  before  death   had\r\n\r\nexpressly stated a desire that his body  at  death\r\n\r\nbe used for any of the purposes of the Act. In the\r\n\r\nabsence of any stated wishes of the person  before\r\n\r\ndeath,  the  relatives could  give  the  necessary\r\n\r\nconsent for the procedures to be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To provide sufficient safeguards to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the freely expressed wishes of a person are\r\n\r\ncarried out. If there was a specific wish to\r\n\r\ndonate his eyes or an organ, this would be carried\r\n\r\nout. Conversely, if there was a specific objection\r\n\r\nby the person no such procedures would be carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safeguards, however, went further, primarily\r\n\r\nfor  goodwill,  that no such procedures  could  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  even  if the person  had  explicitly\r\n\r\nwanted  it  before  his death, if  there  was  any\r\n\r\nobjection by any surviving relative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost from the onset it became apparent that\r\n\r\nthere  was a conflict in the purposes of the  Act.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, it has not been as successful in its\r\n\r\napplication in promoting the purposes  of  medical\r\n\r\nadvancement.  Because of the stringent  provisions\r\n\r\nand  ambiguities, there have been instances  where\r\n\r\nthe  hospital failed to obtain organs from a  dead\r\n\r\nperson  despite  his having given  consent  before\r\n\r\ndeath  or despite consent of his relatives  having\r\n\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this was the result of insufficient\r\n\r\nexperience and over-caution at the time  when  the\r\n\r\nAct   was   framed.   At  that   time   the   only\r\n\r\ntransplantation   operation  routinely   done   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  the  corneal  transplant.   Kidney\r\n\r\ntransplant operations had not been quite perfected\r\n\r\nnor   yet  undertaken  in  Singapore.  There  was,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  little experience to fall back  on  in\r\n\r\nthe  drafting  of the Act. The rapid  advances  in\r\n\r\nmedical science and technology had in the meantime\r\n\r\novertaken the legal provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One defect of the Act soon became apparent. To\r\n\r\nensure  the  success of the transplant, the  tissue\r\n\r\nmust  be  removed  from the dead body  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible  after  death.  The  legal  provisions  as\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Act do not allow this to  be  done\r\n\r\nbecause of the formal procedures to be taken.  Some\r\n\r\nof   these  provisions  are,  worse  still,   quite\r\n\r\nambiguous.  Another defect is that the  law  allows\r\n\r\nany  surviving  relative to forbid a donation  with\r\n\r\nthe  result that the hospital is unable  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the wishes of the donor who made them  before\r\n\r\ndeath. The serious defects in the Act may be listed\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is no definition of what is meant by any\r\n\r\n\"surviving relative\". There is no precedent to fall\r\n\r\nback on. Hence it could happen, even though this is\r\n\r\nonly  a theoretical possibility, that any relative,\r\n\r\nno  matter  how far removed, could come forward  to\r\n\r\nobject  to  the  operation  being  conducted.  This\r\n\r\nactually  occurred in the famous case of the  death\r\n\r\nof the American authoress, Grace Metalious, who had\r\n\r\nspecifically  willed her body to a medical  school.\r\n\r\nBut  this  was  forbidden by her  next-of-kin.  The\r\n\r\nresultant  controversy led to an amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nlaw of the State of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) As illustrated by the example I have just\r\n\r\ngiven, the properly stated wishes of the person may\r\n\r\nbe overruled by some relative at death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The phrases, that \"such reasonable\r\n\r\nenquiries  as may be practicable\" must be  made  by\r\n\r\n\"the  person in lawful possession of the body of  a\r\n\r\ndeceased\"  to  see  whether any  of  the  surviving\r\n\r\nrelatives (who are not defined) object to the gift,\r\n\r\nare ambiguous. The vagueness of these provisions is\r\n\r\nespecially deplorable in view of how critical it is\r\n\r\nthat  in transplant operations the time lag between\r\n\r\ndonor's  death and the operation should be kept  as\r\n\r\nshort  as possible. A good deal of time is lost  in\r\n\r\ngoing  around sounding every relative to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether or not he or she objects to the use of  the\r\n\r\nbody for the purposes of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase \"the person in lawful possession of the\r\n\r\nbody of a deceased\" is invoked in the case where no\r\n\r\nspecific  statement has been made by  the  deceased\r\n\r\nbefore death. In which case the person lawfully  in\r\n\r\npossession  of his body can give consent.  However,\r\n\r\nunder  the  present law it is not possible  to  say\r\n\r\nwith any degree of certainty who such a person  is.\r\n\r\nThere  has,  therefore, been much debate  over  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the  words  \"person  in  lawful\r\n\r\npossession\".  It  was  originally   used   by   the\r\n\r\ndraftsman of the Anatomy Act of the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nof  1832. This was a piece of legislation passed in\r\n\r\nthe  aftermath  of the ghoulish activities  of  the\r\n\r\nbody  snatchers of Burke and Hare. The  words  were\r\n\r\ninterpreted to include the Master of Workhouses and\r\n\r\nlikewise  the  Board of Management  of  a  hospital\r\n\r\nwhere an individual dies. This appears, however, to\r\n\r\nhave  been  restricted now as not  to  include  the\r\n\r\nhospital   management  but   executors   or   close\r\n\r\nrelatives of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, the corresponding law known\r\n\r\nas the Human Tissue Act, 1961, on which our own Act\r\n\r\nwas  modelled  on,  had  also  been  found  to   be\r\n\r\ninadequate.  Like our Act, it was  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  and  to provide a  charter  for  the\r\n\r\nadvancement of medicine, research and education. It\r\n\r\nhad  replaced a preceding Act known as the  Corneal\r\n\r\nGrafting  Act of 1952 and an earlier Act  known  as\r\n\r\nthe  Anatomy  Act,  1832. It was  probably  on  the\r\n\r\nmodels  of  these previous Acts that the  ambiguous\r\n\r\nterm  \"person in lawful possession\" had  come  down\r\n\r\nthrough to our present Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this evident defect, the Health\r\n\r\nMinister  in  the  United Kingdom in  January  1969\r\n\r\nformed an advisory group on transplant problems  to\r\n\r\nmake recommendations on amendments, if any, to  the\r\n\r\nHuman Tissue Act, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States of America the corresponding\r\n\r\nlaw is known as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. It\r\n\r\nis the product of three years of intensive study by\r\n\r\na  special committee of the National Conference  of\r\n\r\nCommissioners  on  Uniform  State  laws.   It   had\r\n\r\nconsidered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier   drafts  and  reviews  by   medical   and\r\n\r\nscientific   groups   and   also   received    the\r\n\r\nendorsement of the American Bar Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than touch up our existing Act with\r\n\r\namendments  here  and there,  it  was  decided  to\r\n\r\nrepeal it and replace it with an entirely new Bill\r\n\r\nmodelled  on the United States Uniform  Anatomical\r\n\r\nGift Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill before the House has, therefore,\r\n\r\ntwo  purposes, namely, the repeal of the  existing\r\n\r\nAct and its re-enactment. The objectives and scope\r\n\r\nof   its  provision  remain  the  same  while  the\r\n\r\noperation of its provisions is now made clear  and\r\n\r\nis without ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is designed to facilitate the donation and use\r\n\r\nof   human   tissues  and  organs  for  transplant\r\n\r\noperations and other medical purposes and provides\r\n\r\nfavourable legal provisions for such activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make its full beneficial impact on the\r\n\r\ncommunity  the  purpose for which such  anatomical\r\n\r\ngifts  can  be  made,  the  provisions  have  been\r\n\r\nextended  to include education and the advancement\r\n\r\nof   dental  science.  The  existing  Act  has  no\r\n\r\nreference to dentistry. The salient points in  the\r\n\r\nBill are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) It permits the removal of an organ or the\r\n\r\nuse   of  the  body  or  parts  of  the  body  for\r\n\r\nexamination  or  for  medical  education  where  a\r\n\r\nperson  has  specifically willed it in writing  or\r\n\r\norally in the presence of two or more witnesses. A\r\n\r\nsafeguard is provided for revocation of  the  gift\r\n\r\nby the donor at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Where no specific wish has been expressed\r\n\r\nto  make  a donation of parts of a body or  for  a\r\n\r\nmedical  examination of the dead person, authority\r\n\r\nto  do  so  may be given by relatives  or  by  the\r\n\r\nDirector of the Medical Institution if the body is\r\n\r\nnot claimed after 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safeguard here is that if it is known that\r\n\r\nthe  person  had  specifically  objected  to  such\r\n\r\nprocedures, then the procedures cannot be  carried\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Bill which differ from those\r\n\r\nin the existing Act are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Omission of all references to the ambiguous\r\n\r\nexpressions,   such   as   \"persons   in    lawful\r\n\r\npossession\" and \"having made such enquiries as may\r\n\r\nbe practicable\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) And, this is more important, that the\r\n\r\ndonor's wish takes primacy over all others. In the\r\n\r\nexisting Act, any relative may forbid the  removal\r\n\r\nor  examination of the body and can thus veto  the\r\n\r\nwishes of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) So as to avoid ambiguity as to which\r\n\r\nsurviving  relative or person  who  could  legally\r\n\r\nauthorise  removal  of parts  of  a  body  or  the\r\n\r\ncarrying out of a post-mortem, the Bill lists  the\r\n\r\nrelatives who may give valid consent in  an  order\r\n\r\nof  precedence. By this, the wishes of a  relative\r\n\r\nin a higher order in the list will take precedence\r\n\r\nover those relatives in a lower order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, a safeguard has been written into the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  that,  if there  be  any  conflict\r\n\r\nbetween  relatives in the same order of  priority,\r\n\r\nthe  authority to examine or remove parts  of  the\r\n\r\nbody will not be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should, however, like to mention that although\r\n\r\nit   may   be  desirable  to  make  this  law   as\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  as  possible, we have  deliberately\r\n\r\nnot touched on the point concerning the removal of\r\n\r\nan organ from a living donor. In fact, there is no\r\n\r\nneed  to do so because within the medical services\r\n\r\nand  profession there are codes of  conduct  which\r\n\r\ngovern  medical practice and which lay down  rules\r\n\r\non   determining  death,  obtaining  consent   for\r\n\r\ndonation  of  tissues and for the  examination  of\r\n\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present stage of medical development in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the provisions as embodied in the  Bill\r\n\r\ntogether  with the safeguards should be sufficient\r\n\r\nto  enable the use of the body or parts of a  body\r\n\r\nfor  transplants  and the advancement  of  medical\r\n\r\nknowledge, education and research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd.

Section 4  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Act  is  incorporated in the  Bill  under\r\n\r\nclauses  12  and  15. The present  practice  under\r\n\r\nsection  4  of the Act is that Muslim corpses  are\r\n\r\nexempted  from post-mortem. Can the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  give an assurance that this practice  will\r\n\r\nbe continued when the Bill is passed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan has referred to clause 15 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill where it is provided that if a body  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  claimed for more than  24  hours  after\r\n\r\ndeath, the Director may dispose of the body as  he\r\n\r\nthinks fit. Clause 15 is, in fact, a repetition of\r\n\r\nthe old provision of section 4 of the existing Act\r\n\r\nwhere it is stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the body of a deceased person has not\r\n\r\nbeen  claimed  from a hospital,  nursing  home  or\r\n\r\nother institution, maintained on public funds, for\r\n\r\nmore  than  twenty-four  hours  after  death,  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Medical Services may  authorise,  in\r\n\r\nwriting,  the use of the body or a specified  part\r\n\r\nof  the body or the post-mortem examination of the\r\n\r\nbody  for  the purposes for which an authorisation\r\n\r\nin  writing  may be given under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nparagraph (a) or (b) of section 3.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of the Member is: what about dead\r\n\r\nbodies   belonging  to  persons  of   the   Muslim\r\n\r\nreligion? The present practice is that if the body\r\n\r\nof  a dead person belonging to the Muslim religion\r\n\r\nis  not  claimed  for  more  than  24  hours,  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Medical Services would invoke  section\r\n\r\n4  of the existing Act, which I have read out just\r\n\r\nnow,  and  get  the  Muslim Religious  Council  to\r\n\r\ndispose  of  the  body in accordance  with  Muslim\r\n\r\nreligious  rites.  As  far  as  the  dead   bodies\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the Muslim religion are  concerned,\r\n\r\nthey  have  not  been touched by the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical  Services,  but  he  requests  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council  to do so. That  has  been  the\r\n\r\npractice  since  the existing Act  was  passed  in\r\n\r\n1965,  and  I  can assure the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan that when this Bill is passed  the  same\r\n\r\npractice will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DANGEROUS FIREWORKS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the result of a series of mishaps\r\n\r\nwhich could have been prevented, and the Bill made\r\n\r\nunnecessary,  if some sections of the  public  had\r\n\r\nbeen  co-operative and had acted with  good  sense\r\n\r\nand  restraint. Permit me, Sir, briefly to recount\r\n\r\nthe circumstances that finally led the Government,\r\n\r\nwith  the  support of public opinion, to introduce\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, which, I do not doubt, this House will\r\n\r\nfully endorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firing of crackers is an ancient Chinese\r\n\r\ncustom, rooted in beliefs no longer credible among\r\n\r\nthe  better educated, but, nevertheless, remaining\r\n\r\nan  enjoyable  way of celebrating Chinese  festive\r\n\r\noccasions,  like  the  Chinese  New  Year.   Other\r\n\r\ncommunities  have  also taken  up  the  firing  of\r\n\r\ncrackers but not the beliefs. However, the  firing\r\n\r\nof  crackers has always presented the  problem  of\r\n\r\nfire   hazards,  which  have  increased,  as   the\r\n\r\nexplosive  ingredients  are  improved  by   modern\r\n\r\nscientific  knowledge.  In  addition,  hazards  of\r\n\r\nphysical injuries also have become a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that, in February 1970,\r\n\r\nduring  the Chinese New Year festival,  there  was\r\n\r\nindiscriminate letting off of fire-crackers. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  there  were six deaths, 68  injured,  and\r\n\r\nS361,000  worth of damage to property.  There  was\r\n\r\npublic  concern,  and the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nfor  Social  Affairs announced in this Parliament,\r\n\r\non  the  9th of March of the same year,  that  all\r\n\r\nfiring of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrackers  would  be prohibited in  future,  unless\r\n\r\npermits  were  first  obtained  from  the  Police.\r\n\r\nDuring  festive occasions, like Chinese New Year's\r\n\r\neve and Chap Goh Meh, the firing of crackers would\r\n\r\nbe  permitted for adults in certain defined areas,\r\n\r\nand within specified hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 of the Minor Offences Act was amended\r\n\r\nto   enforce  this  policy.  In  substance,   this\r\n\r\namendment  imposes  a general prohibition  on  the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  fire-crackers  and  fireworks.  The\r\n\r\nDeputy  Commissioner of Police, or his  authorised\r\n\r\nrepresentative, is empowered to lift this  general\r\n\r\nprohibition,   either  by   way   of   a   Gazette\r\n\r\nnotification,  or  by  the issue  of  licences  to\r\n\r\nindividuals   or  public  bodies,   provided   the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  fire-crackers  or  fireworks  takes\r\n\r\nplace  in  the areas, and within the time  limits,\r\n\r\nstipulated by the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minor Offences (Amendment) Act, 1970, came\r\n\r\ninto operation on 19th June, 1970. Since then  the\r\n\r\ngeneral prohibition had been lifted for five  days\r\n\r\nduring the Chinese New Year festival of 1971,  and\r\n\r\nfor  another  five days for the same  festival  in\r\n\r\n1972. However, sections of the public did not  co-operate or observe the conditions under which fire-\r\n\r\ncrackers  and  fireworks might be discharged.  The\r\n\r\nresult  was  further  tragedies.  In  1971,   nine\r\n\r\npersons  were injured during the Chinese New  Year\r\n\r\nfestival.  In 1972, during the Chinese  New  Year,\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public became more bold  in  their\r\n\r\ndisregard   of   the   conditions   under    which\r\n\r\nfirecrackers could be discharged. The  result  was\r\n\r\nmore  tragedies. There were 376 incidents reported\r\n\r\nabout   crackers   being  indiscriminately   fired\r\n\r\noutside  the stipulated paces and times.  But  for\r\n\r\nvigorous  police  action,  which  resulted  in  37\r\n\r\narrests,  the indiscriminate discharge of crackers\r\n\r\nwould have been far more extensive. Despite police\r\n\r\nactions,  the  firing of crackers resulted  in  26\r\n\r\npersons  being injured. In addition,  two  unarmed\r\n\r\npolicemen  were brutally attacked,  and  seriously\r\n\r\ninjured  when  they tried to prevent  a  group  of\r\n\r\npersons from letting off fire-crackers unlawfully.\r\n\r\nBut for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeedy  surgical attention, their  injuries  would\r\n\r\nhave been fatal. It is said customs die hard, but,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  fact, they can cause deaths  and  make\r\n\r\ncripples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the numerous breaches of the law and,\r\n\r\neven  more  important,  the  injuries  and  deaths\r\n\r\nresulting   from  the  indiscriminate  firing   of\r\n\r\ncrackers,  the  Government came to the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  the  only practicable solution  left  was  a\r\n\r\ntotal ban on the possession or firing of crackers.\r\n\r\nPublic  sentiments, voiced through the newspapers,\r\n\r\nalso called for such action. The present Bill was,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  introduced  into  Parliament  on  21st\r\n\r\nMarch, 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to prohibit\r\n\r\npossession   and   discharge  or  letting-off   of\r\n\r\ndangerous  fireworks. As defined  in  this.  Bill,\r\n\r\ndangerous fireworks includes fire-crackers, rocket\r\n\r\nfireworks, sand crackers, and such other fireworks\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister may, by notification  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette, declare to be dangerous fireworks for the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Bill. The prohibition of possession\r\n\r\nof dangerous fireworks will not, however, apply to\r\n\r\ndangerous  fireworks  brought  into  Singapore  in\r\n\r\ntransit  to  other countries. Dangerous  fireworks\r\n\r\nbrought into Singapore for this purpose will  have\r\n\r\nto  be  stored and dealt with as the Minister  may\r\n\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who fails to comply with, or does any\r\n\r\nact contrary to the provisions of the Bill will be\r\n\r\nguilty  of an offence, and may be punished with  a\r\n\r\nfine  not  exceeding $5,000, or with  imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a term not exceeding two years, or with  both\r\n\r\nsuch fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A police officer may arrest without warrant any\r\n\r\nperson  offending in his, view against any of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill. Where dangerous  fireworks\r\n\r\nare  seized by a police officer, the fireworks may\r\n\r\nhe  disposed  of as the Minister may  direct.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to make regulations to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  better  carrying  out  of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Bill.
