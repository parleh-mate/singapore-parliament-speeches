Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in admiration, but not wholly in support,\r\n\r\nof  the business-like Budget that has been forcefully\r\n\r\nand   persuasively  presented  by  the  Minister  for Finance. The Budget, as I see it, can be divided into two parts. One deals with the need for an increase in the  Government's revenue. The other spells  out  the precise manner in which the increase may be effected. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no denying the validity of the Minister's\r\n\r\ncontention   that   with   Singapore   assuming   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for its own security and  defence,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to find funds to train our citizens and\r\n\r\nequip  them  with the military hardware for  our  own\r\n\r\ndefence.  That is, as the Minister has  pointed  out,\r\n\r\ndefence in the event of limited warfare - not warfare\r\n\r\ninvolving the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuper-powers. A convincing case has been made out for\r\n\r\nsuch realistically qualified defence of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows logically that new taxes have .to be\r\n\r\nimposed to make possible such defence. A snag here is\r\n\r\nthat  taxation does not seem to be conducive  to  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of industrial development. The  difficulty\r\n\r\nhas  been overcome, however, by adopting a policy  of\r\n\r\nindirect  taxation  which is to  be  borne  by  those\r\n\r\nsufficiently  affluent  to  bear  it.   The   general\r\n\r\nimpression seems to be that the Budget is as fair  as\r\n\r\ncan be in the circumstances. But I prefer to leave it\r\n\r\nto  those  Members  in this House who  represent  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the employers to point out in detail how\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  is not expected to have any disincentive\r\n\r\neffect on the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I prefer to touch on the disincentive\r\n\r\neffect of the Budget on the workers of Singapore.  It\r\n\r\nis  with  some temerity that I attempt to  point  out\r\n\r\nsuch  disincentive effect, as the Minister has thrown\r\n\r\nout  a  challenge  to  us to say that  the  proposals\r\n\r\ncontained in the Budget are not necessary or correct.\r\n\r\nIt  is  my  intention, however, to try to  avoid  the\r\n\r\nchallenge by restricting myself to pointing  out  the\r\n\r\nomission  from  the  Budget of  proposals  that  seem\r\n\r\nequally necessary and correct to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with the effect of, for instance, the\r\n\r\nimposition  of  15  per cent tax on made-up  garments\r\n\r\nwhich  include  underwear.  Two  reasons  have,  been\r\n\r\nadvanced  for  such a tax. One is that  it  helps  to\r\n\r\npromote our local industries. The other is that those\r\n\r\nwho  prefer imported foreign goods can very well  pay\r\n\r\nfor  their  preference. Granted that the reasons  are\r\n\r\nvalid,  I  do  not think the duty of  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  end  with the imposition of  tax  alone.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why  local consumers prefer to pay  more  for\r\n\r\nforeign  goods  than  for  the  locally  manufactured\r\n\r\nequivalent is simply that the former is far  superior\r\n\r\nin quality. That being the reason, there seems hardly\r\n\r\nany justification that the taxpayer should in-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectly    continue   to   subsidise    our    local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers   who   have   been   accorded   enough\r\n\r\nprivileges or incentives to make' the other  citizens\r\n\r\nappear  to be second-class, as it were. The need  for\r\n\r\nsome  sort of quality control of locally manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods  seems reasonable before the Government  starts\r\n\r\npenalising  local consumers for alleged bias  against\r\n\r\nlocal goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with quality control, it seems\r\n\r\nequally reasonable that there' should be some sort of\r\n\r\nretail  price  control or restriction The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  not been averse to enacting legislation to  curb\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits obtainable by our workers. But  when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to'  enacting legislation to restrain  the\r\n\r\ngreed  of  our  domestic breed of entrepreneurs,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment seems to drag its feet. Yet time and  time\r\n\r\nagain, it has been observed that the increase in  the\r\n\r\nretail  price of any goods on which a tax is  imposed\r\n\r\nis  more than proportionate to-the amount of the tax.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this point from my actual experience, I\r\n\r\ninquired about the price of a certain imported  brand\r\n\r\nof  briefs and singlets the day after the publication\r\n\r\nof  the' Budget, and I was not surprised to find that\r\n\r\nthe  price had increased from $1.20 to $1.60 a piece,\r\n\r\nrepresenting a jump of 33 1/3 per cent. If I have  to\r\n\r\npay  this  33  1/3 per cent increase, I would  rather\r\n\r\nthat  it  goes  into  the Government  revenue  to  be\r\n\r\nutilised for the general benefit of all than for  the\r\n\r\nparticular enrichment of a few. The insult to  injury\r\n\r\nis  compounded  when  it  is  realised  that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were to' rescind the 15 per cent tax  next\r\n\r\nyear, the price of the brand of underwear to which  I\r\n\r\nhave referred would be decreased by not more than ten\r\n\r\nper  cent,  if at all. This is borne out by  our  sad\r\n\r\nexperience  after the devaluation of the sterling  in\r\n\r\nNovember  1967.  The  Prime  Minister  optimistically\r\n\r\naffirmed  that  by  maintaining  the  parity  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar the workers of Singapore were given,\r\n\r\nin  effect, a 14 per cent increase in wages. It would\r\n\r\nbe  interesting  to  know how many  imported  British\r\n\r\ngoods had their prices reduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  14  per cent, if at all. I would not be surprised\r\n\r\nif  the  answer  is none, given the  avarice  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs who hold Singapore to ransom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licence to plunder given to the local importers\r\n\r\nand  their  business  associates  would  not  be   so\r\n\r\ndamaging if it were not for the fact that a resultant\r\n\r\nnear-monopolistic situation is created for the  local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers of a range of protected  goods.  It  is\r\n\r\nironical  that the local taxpayers who subsidise  the\r\n\r\nso-called  \"pioneer\" industrialists  by  way  of  tax\r\n\r\nexemption are abused and slandered if they try to get\r\n\r\ntheir  money's 'worth by buying imported goods rather\r\n\r\nthan contributing to the bulging pockets of the local\r\n\r\nindustrialists.  It  is  not  surprising   that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Manufacturers'  Association  is  full   of\r\n\r\npraise  for the Budget which enshrines the  principle\r\n\r\nthat  money  begets money. The ordinary citizens  who\r\n\r\nform   the  vast  majority  of  the  population  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly been admonished by the Government  not  to\r\n\r\nrock  the boat and to place national interests before\r\n\r\ntheir  own  selfish  interests. Yet  the  local  manu\r\n\r\nfacturers, who continue to churn out inferior quality\r\n\r\ngoods, such as \"Malcoa\", which are no substitute  for\r\n\r\nimported brands, such as \"Milo\", and which have to be\r\n\r\nforced  down the throats of the local consumers,  are\r\n\r\nfrequently  complimented  on their  profit-orientated\r\n\r\nattitude and their non-competitive incompetency.  The\r\n\r\nridiculousness of the whole situation may  be  summed\r\n\r\nup by reference to commonplace goods in daily use,  I\r\n\r\nrefer  to  \"Lux\"  soap,  for  instance,  which   when\r\n\r\nimported  costs  25 cents a piece  but  when  locally\r\n\r\nproduced  costs 60 cents a piece and looks less  like\r\n\r\nsoap.  I should think the credibility talk about  the\r\n\r\nbenefits    of    industrialisation   becomes    more\r\n\r\nincreasingly  apparent  and  painful  to  the   local\r\n\r\nconsumers  who  must foot the bill both  ways  -  tax\r\n\r\nexemptions as well as higher prices. It may  also  be\r\n\r\nmentioned that the Minister has wide powers to impose\r\n\r\nquotas and other restrictions at any time whenever he\r\n\r\ndeems necessary. Such quotas and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestrictions only lead to a spiralling cost of living\r\n\r\nin the absence of any legislative restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrialists, however, would be fools if they\r\n\r\ndo  not  take  advantage  of  the  artificial,  near-\r\n\r\nmonopolistic situations handed to them  on  a  silver\r\n\r\nplatter in the sacred name of development. The remedy\r\n\r\nis for the Government to enact legislation on quality\r\n\r\ncontrol and retail price control or restrictions. The\r\n\r\nneed  for legislative restraint on our industrialists\r\n\r\nand  developers is imperative, particularly from  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  point  of  view.  The  Minister  has,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  proudly referred to the number  of  hotels\r\n\r\nmushrooming   in  Singapore.  Yet,  in  knowledgeable\r\n\r\nquarters, it is widely held that Singapore hotels are\r\n\r\non  the  way to pricing themselves out of the tourist\r\n\r\ntrade  in this region. The damage done to Singapore's\r\n\r\nreputation as an inexpensive tourist centre, when the\r\n\r\npresent shortage of hotel accommodation in the region\r\n\r\nis  over, would be disastrous and irreparable. I have\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to  understand that  the  organisers  of\r\n\r\npackaged  tours  catering for major segments  of  the\r\n\r\ntourist   trade  are  already  beginning   to   leave\r\n\r\nSingapore out of their itineraries, as the high hotel\r\n\r\nprices  in  Singapore  eat into their  profits.  Such\r\n\r\nbeing  the  situation,  it  is  high  time  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  took some measures to balance the  short-\r\n\r\nterm interests of the entrepreneurs, who invest their\r\n\r\ncapital  here  for  profits,  against  the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterests of the ordinary citizens who make Singapore\r\n\r\ntheir home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that absolute power corrupts absolutely.\r\n\r\nSubstitute \"monopoly\" for \"power\" and we will not  be\r\n\r\ntoo  far wrong. The Budget contains, for instance,  a\r\n\r\nproposal  to  levy a 15 per cent tax on the  sale  of\r\n\r\nliquid  petroleum  fuel  for  cooking  purposes.  The\r\n\r\njustification is that such fuel is being sold at  too\r\n\r\ncompetitive  a price in relation to the rate  charged\r\n\r\nfor the Public Utilities Board gas. But the point  is\r\n\r\nthat  vast areas of Singapore are not piped  for  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  P.U.B, gas. If the residents  of  a  huge\r\n\r\nprivate housing estate, such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  Serangoon  Gardens, for instance,  were  to  make\r\n\r\napplications  for gas connection, it would  be  years\r\n\r\nbefore their applications can be considered. I  would\r\n\r\nimagine that the Ministerial reply would be that  the\r\n\r\nresidents  in  private  housing  estates   are   more\r\n\r\naffluent  and,  therefore, in a  better  position  to\r\n\r\nwithstand the economic squeeze than the residents  in\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board housing estates.  The\r\n\r\nonly way to disprove such assumption is apparently to\r\n\r\nconduct  a  survey on the per capita  income  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents in the respective estates. If such a survey\r\n\r\nis  not feasible or practical, then a rough count  of\r\n\r\nthe  per capita distribution of cars, excluding those\r\n\r\nfor commercial usage, may be of some help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my last point, which concerns the\r\n\r\nstate  of  the  economy.  The  Minister  has  proudly\r\n\r\npointed  out that the economy of the Republic, while\r\n\r\nnot  exactly booming, has developed at a satisfactory\r\n\r\nrate  and  shows every indication of maintaining  its\r\n\r\nmomentum. A reference has been made, however, to  the\r\n\r\nper capita gross domestic expenditure of Singapore as\r\n\r\nstanding  at $1,940 which represents a six  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease over that of last year and which conceivably\r\n\r\ngives  Singapore a standard of living second to  that\r\n\r\nof Japan in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures cited, however, relate to the average\r\n\r\npattern    of   distribution   of   gross    domestic\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  It may be interesting if  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan  arrange for the publication of data relating  to\r\n\r\nthe    median   distribution   of   gross    domestic\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Judging  from  the  percentage  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  who have no other sources of income  than\r\n\r\nthe meagre allowances doled out by the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment,  I would estimate that one-fifth  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation   has   a   per  capita   gross   domestic\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  not  more than $400.  We  must  also\r\n\r\nremember  that non-citizens are not entitled  to  any\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that every year the Government\r\n\r\nprogressively  and  in-directly  reduces   the   vote\r\n\r\nallocated for Social Welfare relief, with the  result\r\n\r\nthat those dependent on the dole find it increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  survive. The' vast majority  of  these\r\n\r\nunfortunate  people are in their present  predicament\r\n\r\nnot  because  they are malingerers but  because  they\r\n\r\ncannot obtain employment. Some cases are particularly\r\n\r\ntragic  because they represent the casualties in  the\r\n\r\ntransition of Singapore's economy from entrepot trade\r\n\r\nto  manufacturing  industry. There is  no  retraining\r\n\r\nscheme  for the retrenched employees of import-export\r\n\r\nhouses which closed down as a result of import quotas\r\n\r\nand  tariffs. As these employees have meagre  savings\r\n\r\nor  are  too  old  or  possess  unwanted  skills  for\r\n\r\nalternative employment, they have no choice but to go\r\n\r\non the dole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these circumstances, it would be\r\n\r\nextremely  cynical of the Government  to  pursue  its\r\n\r\npolicy  of  promoting a rugged and robust society  to\r\n\r\nthe  logical  conclusion of starving the unemployable\r\n\r\ncitizens  to death. With the present rates of  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  allowances, the recipients are condemned  to\r\n\r\nan  equally miserable fate of living death.  Thus,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government will find some way and the neces\r\n\r\nsary  funds  to  take care of our  citizens  who  are\r\n\r\nhapless  through no fault of their own. But,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, I wish to congratulate the Government  on\r\n\r\npresenting  a  reasonable Budget. The  only  trouble,\r\n\r\nfrom  my viewpoint,, is that it leaves too many loose\r\n\r\nends to strangle the ordinary citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\"painless\" has been the keyword used by the press to'\r\n\r\ndescribe  the  Budget  statement  presented  by   the Finance  Minister.  \r\n\r\nThere  has  also  been  all-round applause  and praise from the tycoons of \r\n\r\nthe  various Chambers of Commerce and the business community.  \r\n\r\nBut the  views  of  the ordinary man-in-the-street   \r\n\r\nthe workers and the wage-earners - have yet to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  heard.  Sir, as a trade unionist, I am  from  the\r\n\r\nsecond   category   and  I   will   speak   my   mind\r\n\r\ndispassionately. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would, like  to\r\n\r\njoin,   with  some  reservations,  the  Chambers   of\r\n\r\nCommerce and the business community in congratulating\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister  on  having  presented  a  com\r\n\r\nmendable Budget statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no doubt among us of the need for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  have  an adequately  equipped  defence\r\n\r\nsystem  of  its own capable of meeting  any  possible\r\n\r\neventualities on a limited scale. I do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nsound  belligerent. This is an age where  things  are\r\n\r\nmost  unpredictable and events change  most  rapidly.\r\n\r\nASEAN  was formed hardly one year ago; today it shows\r\n\r\nsigns of crumbling. Indonesian confrontation came  as\r\n\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly as the present estrangement\r\n\r\nof relations between Malaysia and the Philippines. So\r\n\r\nis  the  sudden and 'dramatic turn of events  in  the\r\n\r\nVietnam  war.  So  it may be for  Singapore  and  our\r\n\r\nperdition  if  we  allow ourselves to  be  caught  un\r\n\r\nawares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the United Nations and the balance of terror\r\n\r\namong the nuclear power nations, mankind is far  from\r\n\r\nhaving  achieved the elimination of war among peoples\r\n\r\nand  nations. The super-powers can restrain, or  even\r\n\r\nconnive  at conflicts on a limited scale among  small\r\n\r\nnations,   but  they  cannot,  even  in   their   own\r\n\r\ninterests,  prevent a localised conflict  if  one  of\r\n\r\ntwo, or both, small nations are determined to have it\r\n\r\nout  on  the  battlefield.  So  let  us  not  deceive\r\n\r\nourselves.  The world may not be able  to  survive  a\r\n\r\nfull-scale  war among the super-powers,  but  it  can\r\n\r\nafford  a  hundred wars among the small  nations.  We\r\n\r\nmust  be  realistic. We must be equipped for our  own\r\n\r\ndefence  in  the eventuality of a small nations'  war\r\n\r\nand,  if  possible,  in partnership  with  our  other\r\n\r\nimmediate counterparts in the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances,  the Government   is  certainly  right  \r\n\r\nin  having   given priority  to  defence expenditure in the \r\n\r\nnew  Budget, and I am in complete agreement  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   the  Government's  decision  and  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's    explanation   regarding   the    annual\r\n\r\nexpenditure on defence, which is $314 million or near\r\n\r\nly a quarter of the total Budget expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I draw the attention of this House\r\n\r\nto the Minister's comment on the state of  the economy  of \r\n\r\nSingapore? As in the previous  year,  the Minister's  statement \r\n\r\non the gross  national  product and  economic  growth  sounds  \r\n\r\nmost  encouraging  and optimistic  - Gross Capital formation up  by  17  per\r\n\r\ncent  and  gross domestic expenditure up by  7.7  per\r\n\r\ncent  over  the previous year. Trade has also  surged\r\n\r\nupwards  by  14.5  per  cent,  although  there  is  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable deficit balance of $960 million. This is\r\n\r\nreally very surprising to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be inclined to be as optimistic as the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister had it not been for the  fact  that\r\n\r\nfigures quoted without qualification can prove to  be\r\n\r\nmost puzzling, especially for the public. I refer  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect to the 7.7 per cent increase  in  gross\r\n\r\ndomestic expenditure quoted by the Minister, which he\r\n\r\nsaid  was  associated with the rate of investment  in\r\n\r\nfixed  assets undertaken by the economy. I  would  be\r\n\r\nhappy  if  the  Minister  for Finance  could  clarify\r\n\r\nwhether  this  figure represents the  value  of  real\r\n\r\ngrowth in gross domestic expenditure, over and  above\r\n\r\nthe  increased  cost  of  living,  or  the  rate   of\r\n\r\ninflation in the economy. In other words, the crucial\r\n\r\nquestion  here is, has our standard of living  really\r\n\r\nincreased?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our new industries at their infant stage and\r\n\r\nthe protection accorded them, an increase in the cost\r\n\r\nof living would appear quite inevitable. Many locally\r\n\r\nproduced  goods  are by no means cheaper  than  those\r\n\r\nimported  formerly. In fact, many items have actually\r\n\r\nbecome more costly. But this increased cost can  only\r\n\r\nbe   justified  provided  the  net  income  generated\r\n\r\nlocally and foreign exchange earned or saved  by  our\r\n\r\nnew  industries is greater than the increase in  cost\r\n\r\nto local consumers if the establishment of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  industries has resulted in such increased  cost.\r\n\r\nFor in such a situation increased cost will be offset\r\n\r\nby  greater  increase in income and net  addition  to\r\n\r\ngross  national product, and our standard  of  living\r\n\r\nwill  have  actually improved. The  Budget  statement\r\n\r\npresented  by  the Finance Minister  would  certainly have \r\n\r\nbeen more meaningful had it provided a breakdown of figures \r\n\r\nof the position of industries to show that such a positive \r\n\r\neffect has actually taken place.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, there \r\n\r\nis another grey area in the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister's  statement  which  needs  to   be\r\n\r\nclarified.  I refer to the ominous substantial  trade\r\n\r\ndeficit of $960 million which our economy suffered in\r\n\r\nthe  first nine months of this year, which the  Minis\r\n\r\nter  has only seen fit to mention but not explain.  A\r\n\r\ndeficit of this size is certainly not a feature of  a\r\n\r\nbuoyant economy. In the absence of facts and figures,\r\n\r\none   could  only  speculate  and  arrive   at   many\r\n\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the implication of this deficit in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  our  manufacturing  industries?  As  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector has to depend almost entirely on\r\n\r\nimports  for its raw materials, plant and  machinery,\r\n\r\nis this a sign that we are unable to export enough to\r\n\r\npay  for  the  purchase of these  imports,  which  if\r\n\r\nallowed  to continue in the long run, will mean  that\r\n\r\nour  industries are not actually self-generating  and\r\n\r\nwill  run  into a dead end and be doomed to  failure?\r\n\r\nWhat   is  the  position  of  our  exports   in   the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  export market? Much publicity  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  by our Government to the numerous trade  pacts\r\n\r\nand  trade missions which we have carried out in  our\r\n\r\nexport  drive.  But,  sadly, hardly  any  substantial\r\n\r\ninformation has been given in regard to the extent of\r\n\r\nthe success of these efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, are there any other avenues for us to boost\r\n\r\nfurther our export sales to secure improvement in our\r\n\r\ntrade  balance  in the short and; long  run?  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nrefer in this context to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhome  markets  of  the  foreign  industrialists   now\r\n\r\noperating  in Singapore. Our Government has  provided\r\n\r\nvery  generous concessions and innumerable incentives\r\n\r\nto  foreign  investors. But, are these  same  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors and their governments willing to open their\r\n\r\nhome  markets  for our products? It is  a  well-known\r\n\r\nfact that parent companies and governments of foreign\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries, in their own interests, are often quite\r\n\r\nunwilling to open their home markets to the  products\r\n\r\nof their foreign subsidiaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to give an example. For instance,\r\n\r\nthe  Yamaha motor cycle manufacturing company have  a\r\n\r\nfactory  in Singapore. They manufacture motor  cycles\r\n\r\nbut  their parent company in Japan will not allow  us\r\n\r\nto export these locally-made motor cycles for sale in\r\n\r\nJapan or even to any other country for sale there  so\r\n\r\nlong  as the parent company of Yamaha has established\r\n\r\na  market  there.  In other words, the  motor  cycles\r\n\r\nmanufactured  in Singapore can only be  sold  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  people. Or we have to find new markets in  the\r\n\r\ninternational  field. Therefore, instead  of  earning\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange,  we  are losing  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nbecause  we have to use our foreign exchange  to  buy\r\n\r\nmachinery and raw materials, if the Government is not\r\n\r\ncareful  in  selecting investors and allow  any  Tom,\r\n\r\nDick  and Harry to come in, I think it is not helpful\r\n\r\nto our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we can make successful inroads into the home\r\n\r\nmarkets of foreign investors, which the Puerto Ricans\r\n\r\nand  the Japanese have achieved in the United States,\r\n\r\nthen  perhaps the future of our industries  could  be\r\n\r\nmore secure and certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is the implication of this deficit in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  our  overall  balance  of  payments  and\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange position? What is  most  perturbing\r\n\r\nabout  this deficit is that it has cropped up in  the\r\n\r\nmidst of the British withdrawal, which in itself will\r\n\r\nhave  considerable adverse effects on the balance  of\r\n\r\npayments position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to draw the attention of this House\r\n\r\nto  the  proposed  tax measures  introduced  to  meet\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure  on  our  defence  commitment.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the Government is treading very  skilfully\r\n\r\nin  this  matter.  The proposed tax measures  on  the\r\n\r\nseven  items  mentioned are expected to  raise  $35.8\r\n\r\nmillion  in  a 15-month period. The burden  of  these\r\n\r\ntaxes, in aggregate, will not be really heavy on  the\r\n\r\neconomy  as  a  whole. This, however, has  been  made\r\n\r\npossible  partly by the defence fund  campaign  which\r\n\r\nhas  raised nearly $10 million, a measure  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was indeed farsighted enough to have taken\r\n\r\nto forestall painful tax measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one item in these new tax\r\n\r\nproposals which is not beyond criticism. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance's arithmetic on public utilities consump\r\n\r\ntion  does  not  appear  to be  very  convincing.  It\r\n\r\nappears  that  the Minister has conveniently  divided\r\n\r\nthe  different economic classes of Housing  and  Deve\r\n\r\nlopment  Board flat dwellers according to the  amount\r\n\r\nthey pay in their monthly PUB, bills. If a couple  is\r\n\r\nworking  as teachers and their total salary is,  say.\r\n\r\n$1,000. They stay in a Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nfiat,  their P U.B, bill for two persons surely  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  more  than  the  bill  of  a  poorer  family\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  a  husband,  wife  and  eight   small\r\n\r\nchildren.  The  imposition  of  a  tax  on  essential\r\n\r\nservices  really deserves a more realistic and  equit\r\n\r\nable  criterion  to  back  it  up.  Surely  a  family\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  ten persons will use more  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity than a couple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Have\r\n\r\nsmall families then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> With the new PUB, rates, I can\r\n\r\nforesee great hardships for large families with small\r\n\r\nincomes.

There is,\r\n\r\nfor  example, no reason why people living in mansions\r\n\r\nand  bungalows should not be asked to  pay  a  little\r\n\r\nmore  on  the  assessment rates for  their  property.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  increased  road tax  could  be  levied  on\r\n\r\nbigger vehicles owned by the higher income group.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  it will be more fair and equitable  if\r\n\r\nthe  $11 million could be raised from taxes on luxury\r\n\r\nitems enjoyed by the higher income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not asking too\r\n\r\nmuch from a socialist Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI rise in appreciation of the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the financial year 1st January,  1969,\r\n\r\nto  31st  March,  1970. The Budget presented  by  the Minister   \r\n\r\nfor   Finance  seeks  to  find   practical solutions  \r\n\r\nto  seemingly insoluble problems  and  has done  so  \r\n\r\nwith considerable success. The main problem of  finding  \r\n\r\nthe  necessary funds for many  competing wants appears \r\n\r\nto have been solved by the proposal  to\r\n\r\nimpose new forms of taxation in such a manner  as  to\r\n\r\nbe   reasonable  and  acceptable  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the increase in Government expenditure\r\n\r\nis  shown to be caused by the need to provide for our\r\n\r\nown national security and defence. As a result of the\r\n\r\nproposed British withdrawal from Singapore by the end\r\n\r\nof  1971, the Government has wisely made provision to\r\n\r\nincrease  the strength of our armed forces, that  is,\r\n\r\nthe Army, the Navy and the Air Force, to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel  which  is consistent with the  safety  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  While no one who has the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic   at  heart  will  deny  the  necessity   of\r\n\r\nincurring  the  heavy cost of our  own  security  and\r\n\r\ndefence, it is a source of constant anxiety and worry\r\n\r\nthat  new  taxes or increases in existing  taxes  may\r\n\r\nhave  to be imposed over the next few years in  order\r\n\r\nto  shoulder the burden of military defence. It would\r\n\r\nbe  most helpful if the Minister for Finance can give\r\n\r\nan   assurance  that  any  future  increase  in   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the defence forces and  installations\r\n\r\nduring the coming years will be phased out in such  a\r\n\r\nway  that it will be painless and fair to all. It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that no one can foresee the future and that  one\r\n\r\ncannot  give any assurance of the actual size of  our\r\n\r\ndefence  force  and installations in  the  future  by\r\n\r\nreason  of the fact that new circumstances and events\r\n\r\nmay arise which cannot be foreseen now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main concern is that while defence is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore, the burden of paying for any increase\r\n\r\nin   defence  expenditure  ultimately  falls  on  the\r\n\r\nworking men. The Government has decided to raise  the\r\n\r\nnecessary funds for our defence expenditure by  means\r\n\r\nof  indirect taxation in such a manner as  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  taxes are paid by those who can afford  to\r\n\r\npay.  On the surface, its explanation appears  to  be\r\n\r\nvalid,  such as the graduated scale of tax on  P.U.B.\r\n\r\nrates and the tax, for instance, on made-up garments.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  is correct in saying  that  if  people\r\n\r\npersist in buying goods of foreign origin when  their\r\n\r\nequivalents are beng manufactured locally, it is only\r\n\r\nfair  and reasonable that they should be made to  pay\r\n\r\nfor their choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that we require foreign investment\r\n\r\nin  order  to be able to create sufficient employment\r\n\r\nopportunities for our continuously increasing  labour\r\n\r\nforce.

In  this  respect,  I   must\r\n\r\nacknowledge  that the Government has been  singularly\r\n\r\nsuccessful in wooing foreign industrialists to invest\r\n\r\ntheir capital and know-how in our Republic. The  list\r\n\r\nof  foreign operations which have or are intending to\r\n\r\nset  up  factories in Singapore read like an  excerpt\r\n\r\nfrom Who's Who of the industrial corporations of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It  appears that the new Employment  Act  and\r\n\r\nsimilar  legislation  have helped  to  conjure  up  a\r\n\r\ncongenial  climate for the industrial development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the workers of Singapore have generally\r\n\r\nreconciled themselves to the fact that the Employment\r\n\r\nAct  and  other legislation seeking to  restrain  the\r\n\r\nworkers  from  demanding  higher  wages  and   better\r\n\r\nworking  conditions  are necessary  sacrifices  which\r\n\r\nhave to be tolerated in the interest of the Republic,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should also make  it  clear  to  all\r\n\r\nforeign investors not to take undue advantage of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  Workers in Singapore are pragmatists  who\r\n\r\nbelieve  in hard work. All that they ask of employers\r\n\r\nis  fair  treatment and an equitable return  for  the\r\n\r\nhard  work  they  render to their  employees.  It  is\r\n\r\nsurely  reasonable and equitable for workers  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  decent  wages and an adequate bonus  when  their\r\n\r\nemployers make sizable profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we, the leaders of the N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nhowever, shall always extend our fullest co-operation \r\n\r\nand assistance to the Government and to the employers in \r\n\r\nour  common effort to ensure our survival and  to maintain  \r\n\r\nour present prosperity during the next  few crucial  years.  \r\n\r\nWe  appreciate  that  in  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis  we have only ourselves to depend  upon  for\r\n\r\nthe  continuing political and economic  viability  of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic.  We  know  for  a  fact,  and  this  I\r\n\r\nemphasise,  that the world does not owe us  a  living\r\n\r\nand  that  if  we  want  to  continue  to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of  living in a separate  and  independent\r\n\r\nRepublic, we have to pay dearly for that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivilege by our own sweat and labour. But in the far-\r\n\r\nsighted  and  logical  proposals  enunciated  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the Budget, the Government  has  shown\r\n\r\nthat  it  can  provide the competent  and  determined\r\n\r\nleadership to see us through all our difficulties  in\r\n\r\nthe next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to place on record my sincere\r\n\r\nappreciation  of how the Government has  taken  great\r\n\r\npains  to  ensure that the necessary  new  taxes  are\r\n\r\nborne  by  those  who can afford  to  pay  them.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has done an excellent  job  of\r\n\r\nfinding the necessary funds in an unobtrusive fashion\r\n\r\nfor  equally  necessary expenditure to  be  spent  on\r\n\r\ndefence.  But  while such new taxes are  intended  to\r\n\r\nfall on those who can afford to pay them, I must  add\r\n\r\nthat in the end it is the common working men who have\r\n\r\nto bear the new taxes. It is simply common sense that\r\n\r\nfaced  with the extra expenses that have to  be  met,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, because of the levy on P.U.B, charges,\r\n\r\nthe  employer  will simply raise the  prices  of  his\r\n\r\nproducts to meet the extra cost, Thus, my only regret\r\n\r\nis  that the Minister for Finance has not seen fit to\r\n\r\nincorporate   into   his  Budget   complementary   or\r\n\r\nsupplementary legislation comparable to that  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act to restrain profiteers  from  passing\r\n\r\nthe burden of indirect taxation to the consumers, the\r\n\r\nmajority of whom must be the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI should like, first of all, to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  House  to certain salient features in  the  1969\r\n\r\nestimates of educational expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed that for the first time in\r\n\r\nthe  history of the Republic's Budget, Education  has\r\n\r\ndropped to second place behind Defence as the State's\r\n\r\nbiggest  spender.  This does not  mean  that  we  are\r\n\r\nspending less on Education in order to spend more  on\r\n\r\nDefence. It does show, however, that there are  other\r\n\r\nand more urgent demands on the public purse than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation and the order of priorities has,  at  least\r\n\r\nfor the time being, changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1969 estimates of educational expenditure are\r\n\r\npresented,  also for the first time, under  two  main\r\n\r\ndepartments:   General   Education   Department   and\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education Department, each  with  its  own\r\n\r\nP.E.,  O.C.A.R., O.C.S.E., and development estimates.\r\n\r\nThis reflects the importance which my Ministry places\r\n\r\non    technical    education,   and   the    separate\r\n\r\nadministrative  machinery which has been  created  to\r\n\r\nimplement the new policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary estimates for the Education Ministry\r\n\r\ntotals  $198.8 million for the next 15 months.  On  a\r\n\r\nproportionate basis, this works out to  $159  million\r\n\r\nfor  12  months or a 4.8 per cent increase  over  the\r\n\r\n1968  estimates.  Compared with previous  years,  the\r\n\r\n1969  provision  represents  a  very  small  increase\r\n\r\nindeed   -  for  example,  in  1965,  the  percentage\r\n\r\nincrease  was  13.8  per cent,  1966-19.7  per  cent,\r\n\r\n1967-11  per  cent, and 1968 the percentage  increase\r\n\r\nwas 5.8 per cent. Much of the increase in 1969 is due\r\n\r\nto  normal  increments in the personal emoluments  of\r\n\r\nexisting  posts.  Of the 362 new  posts  created  for\r\n\r\n1969,  336 are for the Technical Education Department\r\n\r\nand  only  26  for the General Education  Department.\r\n\r\nThis  again underscores the new emphasis on technical\r\n\r\nand vocational education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, out of the total provision of $30.9\r\n\r\nmillion   in  the  development  estimates   for   the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry  for  the  next  15  months,  $21\r\n\r\nmillion,  or  slightly more than  two-thirds  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal,  is  earmarked  for  the  Technical  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment, leaving only $9.9 million for the General\r\n\r\nEducation   Department.   The   Technical   Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  will have sufficient funds to  carry  out\r\n\r\nmajor  development projects to provide the  necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities for the massive expansion of technical and\r\n\r\nvocational education. On the General Education  side,\r\n\r\nonly  minor  provision is made for  replacements  and\r\n\r\nextensions of existing schools. On an overall  basis,\r\n\r\nthere will still be enough places in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  for  a number  of  years  to  come,\r\n\r\nalthough the population shift to new satellite  towns\r\n\r\nand  major  housing estates has created shortages  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas,  and  consequently  it  will  not  be\r\n\r\npossible  for all Primary 1 pupils to be admitted  to\r\n\r\nschools near their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the estimates reflect the changes in educational\r\n\r\npolicy,  I  should like to take this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\noutline  what  these  changes  are,  and  to  explain\r\n\r\nbriefly the rationale behind the changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The present vocational schools will be\r\n\r\nabolished.  As from next year, those  who  are\r\n\r\nnot  successful in the Primary School  Leaving\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examination and who are 14 years of age and\r\n\r\nabove,   will  not  be  posted  to  vocational\r\n\r\nschools.  However,  they  will  be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to apply for admission to  special\r\n\r\nclasses  which will be organised by the  Adult\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Board. These classes will provide\r\n\r\nintensive   instruction   in   languages   and\r\n\r\ntraining  in  certain basic skills  to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to seek employment or further vocational\r\n\r\ntraining  in the various new types of training\r\n\r\nestablishments   set  up  by   the   Technical\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Department. Pupils who are in\r\n\r\nVocational I this year will, however, continue\r\n\r\nwith Vocational II next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The secondary school system will be re-\r\n\r\nstructured so as to direct a much larger number of\r\n\r\npupils than at present to technical education. Begin\r\n\r\nning with Secondary I classes next year, a new common\r\n\r\ncurriculum will be introduced for all Secondary I and \r\n\r\nII pupils in all types of schools and in all four\r\n\r\nlanguage streams. This new curriculum provides for\r\n\r\nall boys and 50 per cent of the girls to take  a\r\n\r\ncombination of academic and technical  subjects,\r\n\r\nincluding workshop practice. Domestic Science-will be\r\n\r\na compulsory sub\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nject  for  all girls. However, for girls  who  are\r\n\r\nalso  taking technical subjects, Domestic  Science\r\n\r\nwill  not be an examination subject and a modified\r\n\r\nsyllabus will be followed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this, new curriculum\r\n\r\nfor  Secondary  I and II will  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nstreaming    of   students   into    academic,\r\n\r\ntechnical, or commercial education will not be\r\n\r\nundertaken until Secondary III. The objections\r\n\r\nwhich   have  been  raised  hitherto   against\r\n\r\nstreaming  from Secondary I have thereby  been\r\n\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) After completion of Secondary II, students\r\n\r\nwill either proceed to Secondary III\r\n\r\nand IV and then on to Pre-University as  at\r\n\r\npresent, or branch off to a variety\r\n\r\nof new educational establishments to train as\r\n\r\ncraftsmen and technicians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) For students who branch off to technical\r\n\r\ntraining after completing Secondary II,\r\n\r\nfour  industrial training centres  will  be\r\n\r\nestablished to provide courses in\r\n\r\nelectrical,  building  and  metal  trades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These courses, varying in duration\r\n\r\nbetween  six  months and  two  years,  will\r\n\r\nconcentrate on the acquisition of a\r\n\r\nspecialised  skill through practical  work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each course will lead to the award\r\n\r\nof a Trade Certificate, and the acquisition\r\n\r\nof a number of Trade Certificates\r\n\r\nwill  qualify  the  holder  for  the  craft\r\n\r\ncertificate awarded by the vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes.  Students  who  have  completed\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary II can also compete for\r\n\r\ndirect entry into vocational institutes  of\r\n\r\nwhich two more will be established\r\n\r\nby 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Technical Institute will also be\r\n\r\nestablished  by 1970 to train industrial technicians.\r\n\r\nIt  will provide advanced craft courses for those who\r\n\r\nhave completed courses in vocational institutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes which I have just listed call for a\r\n\r\nheavy  outlay in new plant and conversion of existing\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Four new vocational institutes  will  he\r\n\r\nestablished,  two of them to function  in  their  new\r\n\r\npremises  in  1969  and the other two  in  1970.  Six\r\n\r\nvocational  schools will be paired with six  academic\r\n\r\nschools   within  the  same  compound  with  improved\r\n\r\nworkshop   facilities  to  provide  for  a  technical\r\n\r\nstream.  Three  other  vocational  schools  will   be\r\n\r\nconverted into industrial training centres to provide\r\n\r\na  variety  of short-term trade courses  and  another\r\n\r\nindustrial  training centre will  be  established  at\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah,  making four centres in  all.  Twenty\r\n\r\nunits  of  centralised workshops will be  created  to\r\n\r\nprovide  practical training for all the boys  and  50\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the girls in Secondary I and  II,  and\r\n\r\nadditional  machinery will be installed in  three  of\r\n\r\nthe  nine existing technical schools to convert  them\r\n\r\ninto  technical  high schools offering  courses  from\r\n\r\nSecondary   III   to  Pre-U  classes.   Pending   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of its own building, the nucleus of  the\r\n\r\nproposed National Technical Institute will be  housed\r\n\r\ntemporarily in the Singapore Vocational Institute  in\r\n\r\n1969 to provide courses in advanced mechanical engine\r\n\r\nering   practice  and  shipbuilding.  The   Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational Institute itself will be expanded with the\r\n\r\naddition of a three-storey building to provide for an\r\n\r\nenrolment  of  2,500  as compared  with  the  present\r\n\r\ncapacity of 2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the necessary teachers for the swing\r\n\r\ntowards  technical education, a massive training  and\r\n\r\nretraining  scheme is already under  way.  In  August\r\n\r\nthis year, 371 general education teachers began their\r\n\r\n36-week   part-time  re-training  to   become   craft\r\n\r\nteachers   in  one  of  three  subjects:   Metalwork,\r\n\r\nWoodwork and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nBasic   Electricity.  Another  batch  of  85  general\r\n\r\neducation teachers have been selected to undergo full-\r\n\r\ntime re-training conducted by the Economic Industrial\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Agency. At this point, I must  add  that\r\n\r\nteachers  have responded admirably to the re-training\r\n\r\nscheme.  The  training programme will move  into  top\r\n\r\ngear  next  year with the expansion of the  technical\r\n\r\nwing of the Teachers' Training College. This will  be\r\n\r\ncarried out with the assistance of the United Nations\r\n\r\nDevelopment Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are no doubt aware that the Government has\r\n\r\nemphasised  technical and vocational education  since\r\n\r\n1960. These changes in technical education have  been\r\n\r\nproposed   so  that  the  education  can  meet   more\r\n\r\neffectively    the    manpower    needs    of     our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. It is widely  recognised\r\n\r\nthat  the  present  predominantly  academic  type  of\r\n\r\neducation  has  produced  an  inadequate  number   of\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  and technicians. The  shift  to  an\r\n\r\neducation  with  a  larger  technician  content   and\r\n\r\npractical  training  will  cut  down  the  number  of\r\n\r\nunemployable  secondary school-leavers  and  increase\r\n\r\nthe  inflow of skilled manpower to our rapidly expand\r\n\r\ning industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in other aspects of educational policy will\r\n\r\nalso be made. The emphasis on the improvement of  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  education at all levels  will  continue.\r\n\r\nSteps  have  been taken and will be taken to  improve\r\n\r\nschool   curricula,  textbooks,  teaching  aids   and\r\n\r\ntechniques,  teacher training and  further  training,\r\n\r\neducational  testing,  health  education  and  extra-\r\n\r\ncurricular activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater stress will be laid on bilingualism in\r\n\r\nschools.  Increasing use will be made of  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage as the medium of instruction in certain  sub\r\n\r\njects. In 1966, Mathematics was taught in English  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  Primary I Chinese-medium  classes  on  an\r\n\r\nexperimental   basis.   As  the   experiment   proved\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  it was extended to Primary  II  classes.\r\n\r\nThis  year,  English is used for teaching Mathematics\r\n\r\nin  Government Chinese Primary I, II and III classes,\r\n\r\nand in Malay and Tamil Primary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  classes. The same language is used this  year  for\r\n\r\nteaching  Science  in Government  Chinese  Primary  I\r\n\r\nclasses  and  in  all Malay and  most  of  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nPrimary  I  classes.  The use  of  English  to  teach\r\n\r\nScience and Mathematics in non-English medium schools\r\n\r\nwill thus be extended gradually to Primary VI and  it\r\n\r\nis  expected  that the same gradual process  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  Government-aided  non-English  medium\r\n\r\nschools beginning in 1970. On the other hand, a start\r\n\r\nhas  been made this year to use Chinese as the medium\r\n\r\nof  instruction for civics in English-medium  primary\r\n\r\nclasses  for pupils whose second language is Chinese.\r\n\r\nIt  is  intended that the same arrangement will apply\r\n\r\nto  History by 1970. As an added measure to  increase\r\n\r\nlanguage  proficiency,  oral  tests  in  the   second\r\n\r\nlanguage will be introduced next year in the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool Leaving Examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingualism must be emphasised in schools if we are\r\n\r\nto  build  a  multi-racial society  with  a  national\r\n\r\nidentity. It should be obvious that a small community\r\n\r\nof  two  million people cannot survive in four water-\r\n\r\ntight  language compartments, with no common language\r\n\r\nof communication. In the past, our efforts to promote\r\n\r\nbilingualism   were   confined  to   increasing   the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  time to the second  language  and  im\r\n\r\nproving  teaching methods. It has become  clear  that\r\n\r\nthese  measures  by  themselves  are  not  enough  to\r\n\r\nproduce the desired results. This is because children\r\n\r\nhave  little  opportunity to use the second  language\r\n\r\noutside  the periods allotted to it on the timetable.\r\n\r\nBy  using the second language as a medium of  instruc\r\n\r\ntion, children would be exposed to that language  for\r\n\r\na   much  longer  period  and,  moreover,  would   be\r\n\r\ncompelled to speak it, write it and use it as a  tool\r\n\r\nof  communication.  For those children  whose  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  is  English,  it is  logical  to  use  that\r\n\r\nlanguage   for  teaching  Mathematics,  Science   and\r\n\r\neventually technical subjects, since English has long\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted as an international language in  these\r\n\r\nfields. For the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren whose second language is Chinese or Malay or\r\n\r\nTamil,  it  is  equally logical  to  use  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  for teaching subjects which have affinities\r\n\r\nwith their own language and culture, subjects such as\r\n\r\nHistory and Civics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doubts have been expressed in the press on the\r\n\r\nwisdom  of  using the second language as a medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction.  The critics fear that the teachers  who\r\n\r\nare  called upon to teach Mathematics and Science  in\r\n\r\nEnglish   in  non-English  medium  schools  may   not\r\n\r\nthemselves  have  a  sufficiently  good  command   of\r\n\r\nEnglish.  I  should like to give the  assurance  that\r\n\r\neverything  possible will be done  to  avoid  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation.  The  changes in the  language  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction  in certain subjects will be carried  out\r\n\r\nin  gradual  stages.  As many English-medium  trained\r\n\r\nteachers  as we can spare will be sent to non-English\r\n\r\nmedium  schools to teach Mathematics and Science.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  intensive three-year  courses  in  English\r\n\r\nwith a scientific language bias will be organised for\r\n\r\nthose teachers who are currently teaching Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science in the Chinese, Malay or Tamil  language\r\n\r\nmedium  to enable them to attain proficiency  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language for teaching these subjects. Another\r\n\r\nnagging  fear is that the use of the second  language\r\n\r\nas  a  medium of instruction might lead to a lowering\r\n\r\nof  standards  in  the  first  language  and  in  the\r\n\r\nsubjects  taught  in  the second  language.  On  this\r\n\r\npoint,  surveys conducted by my Ministry  have  shown\r\n\r\nthat  there is no basis for such fears. For  example,\r\n\r\nEnglish  was  first used in 1966 to teach Mathematics\r\n\r\nin   certain  Government  Chinese-medium  Primary   I\r\n\r\nclasses.  A  survey conducted at the end  of  a  year\r\n\r\nrevealed  that these children had gained  fluency  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  without  any  loss  in  their  standard   of\r\n\r\nattainment in Mathematics and Chinese. Moreover,  the\r\n\r\nuse of the second language as a medium of instruction\r\n\r\nis  introduced gradually, beginning with  Primary  I,\r\n\r\nand  every  effort is made to ensure that  syllabuses\r\n\r\nand textbooks are carefully graded and chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion has been made that a Regional Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  Centre  should be set  up  similar  to  the\r\n\r\nRegional  English  Language  Centre  established   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  under the auspices of the Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nMinisters of Education Council. I welcome this sugges\r\n\r\ntion as a means of further improving the teaching  of\r\n\r\nChinese  both  as  a first and as a second  language.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I must point out that the Regional  English\r\n\r\nLanguage  Centre  was  established  with  substantial\r\n\r\nforeign  aid, amounting to 50 per cent of  the  total\r\n\r\ncapital  cost and recurrent cost for five  years.  If\r\n\r\nsimilar  financial  assistance  is  available  for  a\r\n\r\nRegional   Chinese  Language  Centre   from   private\r\n\r\nsources, particularly from the large Chinese  dailies\r\n\r\nand  publishers who have a vested interest in  seeing\r\n\r\nmore  readers of Chinese publications, I am sure that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will be only too willing to  consider\r\n\r\nsuch a project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes pose a challenge to both teachers\r\n\r\nand  pupils,  but it is a challenge that  has  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken up. Bilingualism in our schools must succeed if\r\n\r\nwe  are to build a cohesive yet tolerant society, and\r\n\r\ntechnical  education must also succeed if we  are  to\r\n\r\nkeep  pace  with  the new status of Singapore  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent and forward-looking state moving  towards\r\n\r\nrapid industrialisation and urbanisation. With the co-\r\n\r\noperation of teachers, pupils and parents, succeed we\r\n\r\nshall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  although  defence  expenditure   has\r\n\r\nincreased  to  $337  million, our wise  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  been able to surmount this  problem  of\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure  by  good  budgeting.  I  must\r\n\r\ncongratulate him on this. If I am not wrong, he  must\r\n\r\nhave  deliberated hard and long over the  preparation\r\n\r\nof  the  Budget.  I  believe  those  people  who  are\r\n\r\nrational  will undoubtedly welcome it in its  present\r\n\r\nform.  In  my opinion, there are two aspects  to  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the increase in defence expenditure does not\r\n\r\nseriously  affect social services and development  in\r\n\r\nother  fields. We all know that in order to safeguard\r\n\r\nour   independence  in  the  present  age,  we   must\r\n\r\nmodernise our defence system. Of course, we  have  to\r\n\r\nspend large sums of money to achieve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget Statement of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  we learn that the defence build-up  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry will proceed step by step so that we will not\r\n\r\nhave  to bear an unduly heavy burden. We are not like\r\n\r\nmany other countries which build up their defence  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of social services and in the end  their\r\n\r\nsocieties deteriorate and they cannot but come  under\r\n\r\nmilitary  rule. Our defence expenditure will  be  met\r\n\r\nout   of   the   economic  growth  in  our   revenue.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  in other fields, such as  education  and\r\n\r\nsocial services, will have to be at a standstill.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  necessary funds  are  allocated  to\r\n\r\nsectors  needing additional expenditure. This  course\r\n\r\nis  very  judicious, so that we  can  make  at  least\r\n\r\nnormal  progress. Our per capita domestic expenditure\r\n\r\nhas  also increased from $1,682 in 1967 to $1,940  in\r\n\r\n1968.  Our  gross  national  product  has  also  been\r\n\r\nincreasing every year as a result of the diligence of\r\n\r\nour people and the stability and economic progress of\r\n\r\nour  country. Our economic growth will be slowed down\r\n\r\nif  our people do not work hard. We will then have to\r\n\r\nchoose between doing away with additional expenditure\r\n\r\non  defence  or  social  services  and  resorting  to\r\n\r\nincreased taxes. All this is not to our liking. If in\r\n\r\nthe  few years ahead when the British are withdrawing\r\n\r\nwe  can  face  the trials and overcome  the  economic\r\n\r\nproblems, our future will be bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a general feeling that increased\r\n\r\ntaxation  is  not  something  which  all  the  people\r\n\r\nwelcome.   Nevertheless,  the  seven  new  items   of\r\n\r\ntaxation  to be imposed next year are mild. They  are\r\n\r\ntaxes  which  the people can afford.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\ndecision to impose these seven types of taxation  has\r\n\r\nbeen  arrived at after very exhaustive deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe   taxation  is  based  on  democratic   socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples. The aim is to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who are most able to bear the burden pay  more\r\n\r\ntowards  the national expenditure. This new  taxation\r\n\r\nwill  bring in about $35 million, which is only about\r\n\r\none-tenth  of  our  total defence  expenditure.  This\r\n\r\nadditional  amount  of  revenue  is  not  merely   to\r\n\r\nmaintain our military requirements. After taking away\r\n\r\n$40.7  million, there is a deficit of  $11.7  million\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  met from the reserve fund.  The  new\r\n\r\ntaxation  will  not affect incentives for  investment\r\n\r\nwhich  are  now being given to industry.  This  is  a\r\n\r\njudicious policy; otherwise investors will fight  shy\r\n\r\nof  coming  here  and,  as a result,  there  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficulties in our industrialisation efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the revenue and expenditure for\r\n\r\nnext  year, there will be a deficit of $11.7 million.\r\n\r\nIf  I  am not mistaken, this is the first time, since\r\n\r\nthe Government came to power, that the deficit is  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a size. If there has not been too wide a  range\r\n\r\nof  new taxation, it is because the Government do not\r\n\r\nwant  the  people  to bear too much  of  the  burden.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Finance Minister, in the first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of this year, trade figures show that imports\r\n\r\nreached a figure of $3,840 million and exports $2,880\r\n\r\nmillion. There is therefore a trade deficit  of  $960\r\n\r\nmillion. There are many items of international income\r\n\r\nderived  from  shipping,  insurance,  tourism,   etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough no exact calculations have been made,  these\r\n\r\nitems  are  estimated  to reach about  $600  million.\r\n\r\nSubtract  this sum from the trade deficit,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  deficit of $360 million. If this  condition\r\n\r\nwere to continue year after year, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister whether this would  affect  our\r\n\r\nforeign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to talk about the problems of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.    It    is    undeniable     that\r\n\r\nindustrialisation has been going on at  a  tremendous\r\n\r\npace.  At the moment, we have 174 factories employing\r\n\r\n18,000  workers. In addition, the Government has  set\r\n\r\nup  three institutions, namely, the Development Bank.\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Town  Corporation and INTRACO,  to  help\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  commerce and industry.  I  believe  our\r\n\r\nindus-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrialisation  has  a  bright future.  The  centre  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is now at Jurong. Seven  years  ago\r\n\r\nJurong was a barren land. But now 3,600 acres of land\r\n\r\nhave  been  developed.  About 137  factories  are  in\r\n\r\nproduction, employing 14,000 workers. However, as the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance has pointed out in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  there is an urgent need  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsocial amenities of Jurong Town. This is true. At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there are no social amenities and facilities\r\n\r\nfor  recreation which one would expect  in  a  normal\r\n\r\ntown.  There  are  not  enough  housing  and  medical\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  the workers there.  They  should  be\r\n\r\nprovided   with   sufficient  social   and   cultural\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Their needs in these  fields  should  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied. House occupancy is said to be 99 per cent.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the  houses there are occupied by  military\r\n\r\npersonnel  at  Taman Jurong and other personnel  from\r\n\r\nabroad together with their families. There is a  lack\r\n\r\nof  good transport. Although most of the -'workers in\r\n\r\nJurong Town are now staying there, their families are\r\n\r\nstill  staying in urban areas because of the lack  of\r\n\r\nsocial  amenities  and  transport  in  Jurong   Town.\r\n\r\nWorkers have no intention to settle down there. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  the industrialisation  policy  is\r\n\r\nbeing properly implemented. Otherwise how could these\r\n\r\nconsiderations have been overlooked? Or  could  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  some  other reasons why the  workers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  families  have not been provided  with  social\r\n\r\namenities?   It   is   only   recently   that   these\r\n\r\nshortcomings have been discovered by the authorities.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only now that the Jurong Town Corporation  is\r\n\r\nthinking of providing these social amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the Corporation is trying its best\r\n\r\nto  develop  Jurong  into a tourist  centre.  In  the\r\n\r\nvicinity   of  the  Jurong  River,  there   will   be\r\n\r\n\"artificial  islands\". There will be a floating  rest\r\n\r\naurant,  an  aviary  for birds and  an  18-hole  golf\r\n\r\ncourse,  etc. Of course, it would be a good thing  if\r\n\r\nJurong could be developed into a tourist centre.  But\r\n\r\nI  do  not think the ordinary workers there have  the\r\n\r\ntime  and  leisure to play golf, to see the birds  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naviary, or to go to the floating restaurants and bars\r\n\r\nto  enjoy themselves. I hope the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwill  seriously  consider the question  of  providing\r\n\r\npractical    social   amenities   and    recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities for the workers so that they can  actually\r\n\r\nenjoy  themselves. At the moment,  what  the  workers\r\n\r\nneed  is a place where they can rest or take part  in\r\n\r\nrecreational activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a community centre in Jurong Town,\r\n\r\nit  was  not built according to plan. It  is  only  a\r\n\r\ncentre   made  by  merging  several  flats  together.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  it is quite far away from the majority  of\r\n\r\nresidences of the workers. It does not meet the needs\r\n\r\nof the population there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nthat a \"Workers' Cultural Centre\" should be set up in\r\n\r\nthe  most populous part of Jurong Town. Here they can\r\n\r\ntake  part in various activities which would  benefit\r\n\r\nboth  their  minds  and  their  bodies.  We  hope   a\r\n\r\ngymnasium  with facilities for games and sports  will\r\n\r\nbe  provided.  We hope, too, that reading  rooms  and\r\n\r\nrooms  for  recreational activities will be available\r\n\r\nat this cultural centre. We can ask the trade unions,\r\n\r\nthe   employers'  association  and  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation to help in the management of this centre.\r\n\r\nWe  can  also ask the People's Association for  their\r\n\r\nassistance in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about some of the other\r\n\r\nproblems   relating  to  Jurong  Town.   First,   the\r\n\r\nincreased  rent of factory sites in Jurong  Town.  In\r\n\r\nthe   beginning,  when  the  Government   wanted   to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  setting up of  factories  there,  the\r\n\r\nrental  was low. It was six to nine cents per  square\r\n\r\nfoot  per year. With the prospect of a common  market\r\n\r\nwith  'Malaysia,  many  industrialists  invested   in\r\n\r\nJurong.  There  are at the moment  137  factories  in\r\n\r\nproduction.   This   achievement,   of   course,   is\r\n\r\nattributable   to   the  efforts,  co-operation   and\r\n\r\ncontributions  of the Government, the  employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers. Sir, I have learnt that the authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  have tried to increase the rental  of  the\r\n\r\nland by as high as 50 per cent. I feel that we should\r\n\r\ndiscuss these matters frankly and face\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  realities  of  the situation.  At  present,  the\r\n\r\nfactories in Jurong appear to be doing quite well and\r\n\r\nthey   may   be  getting  good  returns   for   their\r\n\r\ninvestments.  But  there are many pioneer  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  are unable to make any profit this year  owing\r\n\r\nto  lack of markets. Therefore, to increase the  rent\r\n\r\nof  factory sites is generally not a wise move.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  additional burden on the factories which  are\r\n\r\nnot  making  money,  and may be a factor  leading  to\r\n\r\ntheir  closure.  I  feel that  the  attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nauthorities in encouraging industries should be  more\r\n\r\nrealistic.   We   should  not  ask  the   established\r\n\r\nfactories  to give up their vacant land in  order  to\r\n\r\ninduce more investments and establishment of new  fac\r\n\r\ntories. We should help the manufacturers in Jurong to\r\n\r\nsolve  their  problems and help them develop.  In  my\r\n\r\nview,  the  Government should give  consideration  to\r\n\r\nindividual  cases in respect of rent  increases.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should not increase the rents of those who\r\n\r\nare  just  able  to  make ends  meet.  If  Government\r\n\r\nintends  to increase the rent, a decision  should  be\r\n\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I wish to cover in my speech is\r\n\r\nfire prevention. I do not know whether the Government\r\n\r\nintends  to  set  up  a fire station  on  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial  site.  There is none in existence  there.\r\n\r\nThe  two nearest fire stations are in Queenstown  and\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah, at least seven miles away  from  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown.  If  there  is a fire at the Jurong  industrial\r\n\r\nestate,  by  the  time the fire engines  arrive,  the\r\n\r\nfactories  will  have been burnt  down.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance will take note of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point concerns industrial waste. This\r\n\r\nis   a  problem  confronting  our  industrialists  in\r\n\r\nJurong. No doubt there is a dumping ground at Lim Chu\r\n\r\nKang.  It  is  convenient for  large  factories  with\r\n\r\nplenty  of industrial waste to hire lorries and  dump\r\n\r\nthe  industrial waste at Lim Chu Kang.  But  for  the\r\n\r\nsmall  factories  with a small amount  of  industrial\r\n\r\nwaste,  it is uneconomical for them to hire  lorries.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are to combine their resources, it is  also\r\n\r\nquite inconvenient because of the varying amounts  of\r\n\r\nindustrial waste produced by these small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactories,  and  also  because of  the  time  factor.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I hope the Ministry of Health  will  send\r\n\r\nmore  rubbish  trucks  to Jurong  to  take  away  the\r\n\r\nindustrial waste from the light industries section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the supply of water for industrial estates is\r\n\r\nof great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

According to estimates, the con\r\n\r\nsumption of water by the various industries is  5,000\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons a year. I understand that  sometimes\r\n\r\nthe  supply of water is interrupted, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nwhich there is great inconvenience and production  in\r\n\r\nthe  factories is interrupted. If the supply of water\r\n\r\nis  to be interrupted because new pipelines are being\r\n\r\nlaid  or  for  any other reason, I ask that  adequate\r\n\r\nnotice be given to manufacturers in order to minimise\r\n\r\ninconvenience to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, Jurong Town at the present moment is\r\n\r\nin  reasonably  good shape. It is  becoming  a  self-\r\n\r\nsustaining ,town. But the Government should pay  more\r\n\r\nattention  to it. Otherwise we will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nattain our objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\na  few  months  ago the Minister for Finance  gave  a\r\n\r\nwarning that the Budget for next year would no longer\r\n\r\nbe a painless one.

Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, I think it will assist in\r\n\r\nthe debate if you speak on the Finance Minister's tax\r\n\r\nproposals  rather than on the rumours that circulated\r\n\r\nbefore his Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, that will be\r\n\r\nthe  main  theme of my speech. But such rumours  were\r\n\r\nvery  widespread. However, on the 3rd of this  month,\r\n\r\nthe  mystery surrounding such rumours was lifted, for\r\n\r\non  that day the Minister for Finance announced seven\r\n\r\ntax proposals. They include a tax on P.U.B, bills,  a\r\n\r\nsmall  duty  on  liquid  petroleum  gas,  a  tax   on\r\n\r\ntelephone bills and a tax on made-up garments.  There\r\n\r\nwill  also  be changes in three old taxes, namely,  a\r\n\r\nnew  basis  to  value a motor vehicle  on  which  the\r\n\r\nadditional  registration fee is levied; the  revision\r\n\r\nof  stamp  duties; and the levy of a fee of  two  per\r\n\r\ncent  for  motor vehicles on transfer  of  ownership.\r\n\r\nThese  tax  proposals are mild in nature.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to usher in a Merry Christmas and a  Happy\r\n\r\nNew  Year to our people. For these measures, we thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Budget Statement was well received by people\r\n\r\nfrom  all walks of life. Although defence expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  reach  the  enormous sum of $337  million,  the\r\n\r\nrevenue from new taxes will be $35 million, about  10\r\n\r\nper  cent  of defence expenditure. That  is  why  the\r\n\r\npeople praise the Government for its intelligent  and\r\n\r\nprudent tax proposals. These new taxes are quite fair\r\n\r\nand   in   accord  with  the  tenets  of   democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism.  For  example, the 10  per  cent  levy  on\r\n\r\nP.U.B, bills will not affect the lower income group.\r\n\r\nUnder this tax proposal, those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose  bills  fall between $10 and $20 a  month  will\r\n\r\nhave  to pay five per cent. Those whose bills  exceed\r\n\r\n$20  will  have to pay the full rate of 10 per  cent.\r\n\r\nThose  whose bills are under $10 are not affected  at\r\n\r\nall. There are about 58,000 consumers whose bills  do\r\n\r\nnot  exceed  $10, which is 25 per cent of the  total.\r\n\r\nThe  number of consumers whose bills fall between $10\r\n\r\nand $20 is 73,000, which is 32 per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nThey  will  pay about $1 a month in tax.  Forty-three\r\n\r\nper  cent are consumers whose bills exceed $20;  they\r\n\r\nare  well-to-do. They have radio and television sets,\r\n\r\nrefrigerators and other modern appliances. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  unreasonable to ask them  to  make  some\r\n\r\ncontribution to our defence expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the tax on telephone bills, the poor\r\n\r\npeople will not be affected. Only wealthy people  can\r\n\r\nafford   to  install  telephones  in  their   houses.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is not unreasonable to ask them to  pay\r\n\r\n$27  additional tax a year. As for users of  business\r\n\r\ntelephones,  it is within their means to  pay  $37.50\r\n\r\nper line per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is questionable whether a tax should be levied on\r\n\r\nimported  made-up  garments, because  most  of  these\r\n\r\nimported  garments  are bought by  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup.  They  are not only cheaper than the  locally-\r\n\r\nmanufactured  garments, but they  are  also  of  good\r\n\r\nquality. As they are cheap, they should not be taxed.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Government has levied a 15 per  cent  import\r\n\r\nduty   on   made-up  garments,  their   prices   have\r\n\r\nincreased,  and this is an added burden on  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople.  Although the Minister has said that  we  are\r\n\r\nmanufacturing enough for local consumption, from  the\r\n\r\nconsumers' point of view, however, they prefer to buy\r\n\r\nclothing  which is not only cheap but  also  of  good\r\n\r\nquality.  There  are two reasons why  these  imported\r\n\r\ngoods  are  welcomed by the consumers. Firstly,  they\r\n\r\nare cheap and, secondly, they are of good quality and\r\n\r\ndurable.  Therefore, if we want  our  people  to  use\r\n\r\nlocally-manufactured  goods, our  manufacturers  must\r\n\r\nraise  the  standard of their goods and their  prices\r\n\r\nshould not be higher than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  of the imported goods. Only then can  we  make\r\n\r\nlocally-manufactured   goods   attractive   to    our\r\n\r\nconsumers.  To impose taxes on imported garments  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  not  wise since the Minister  can  obtain\r\n\r\nrevenue  from other sources, such as increased  taxes\r\n\r\non  expensive  liquor,  cosmetics  and  other  luxury\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which I do not understand.\r\n\r\nWhy  does  the Minister not impose taxes on  garments\r\n\r\nmade of fur? In my opinion, these garments should  be\r\n\r\ntaxed  because it is only the wealthy people who  can\r\n\r\nafford  to buy them, and it is right that they should\r\n\r\nmake some contribution to our defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is gratifying to note that\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the substantial increase  in  defence \r\n\r\nexpenditure, no cut has been made in the  expenditure \r\n\r\non  rural development for which the sum of $2,215,000 \r\n\r\nhas  been  allocated.  This  shows  the  Government's \r\n\r\nconcern for the welfare of the rural people. This  is\r\n\r\nin keeping with our Party's objective of establishing\r\n\r\na  more  just  and equal society and it is  therefore\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with is our economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  I  will  quote  some figures  given  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance.  He said  that  our  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth is still in good shape. For example, in  terms\r\n\r\nof  total investment, we have $606 million, which  is\r\n\r\nan  increase of 17 per cent. In the first nine months\r\n\r\nof  this  year  the  total trade  figure  was  $6,720\r\n\r\nmillion,  representing an increase of 14.5 per  cent.\r\n\r\nIn  the first six months of this year there were  174\r\n\r\npioneer firms in production, an increase of 47  firms\r\n\r\nover  last year. We have a total fixed investment  of\r\n\r\n$436  million, an increase of 19 per  cent,  and  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  total industrial production we  have  $472\r\n\r\nmillion,  which is an increase of64 per  cent.  These\r\n\r\npioneer industries employ 18,780 workers, an increase\r\n\r\nof  5,380  over last year. At the same time,  56  new\r\n\r\nfactories are being constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that Singapore is rapidly becoming an\r\n\r\nimportant industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry in this region. It is also noteworthy that we\r\n\r\nhave  an  even  more  rapid expansion  in  our  ship-\r\n\r\nbuilding industry. This new industry not only earns a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of foreign exchange for our country,  but\r\n\r\nalso  provides many employment opportunities for  our\r\n\r\npeople. We have already converted the Sembawang Naval\r\n\r\nease  into  a shipbuilding yard capable of  absorbing\r\n\r\nover  3.000  ex-civilian employees from  the  British\r\n\r\nestablishment. This is a clear indication of the Will\r\n\r\nand  capacity  of the Government. As the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  I wish to congratulate the Government  on\r\n\r\nits  success in converting the Naval Base to civilian\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the defence expenditure for next\r\n\r\nyear  comes to $337.5 million, which is more than  33 \r\n\r\nper  cent of our total expenditure of about $1,024.89 \r\n\r\nmillion.  In  spite  of  this,  there  has  been   no \r\n\r\nsubstantial increase in the taxes, and for  this,  we \r\n\r\nmust  pay  a tribute to our Minister for Finance.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we need only have about $117.3 million in  cash\r\n\r\nto  pay  for all this expenditure. The sum of  $156.3\r\n\r\nmillion for the purchase of military equipment is  on\r\n\r\ncredit  terms and we can also obtain a sum  of  $63.9\r\n\r\nmillion  from the United Kingdom Defence  Aid  funds.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  like to ask the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nabout  the \ufffd50 million of aid promised by the British\r\n\r\nGovernment. I hope the Minister can give more details\r\n\r\non this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a newly independent country, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us  to establish a  suitable  defence\r\n\r\nsystem, because without it there will be no security.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the reaction of our people to this important\r\n\r\nproblem?  In  my view, the people have already  shown\r\n\r\nthat they understand the significance of defence  and\r\n\r\nhave   given  the  Government  positive  support   by\r\n\r\nresponding to the call for National Service  and  the\r\n\r\nNational  Defence Fund. Therefore, if anybody  should\r\n\r\nsay  that it is a wrong policy to establish  our  own\r\n\r\ndefence,  then  they  are, in my view,  either  short\r\n\r\nsighted or have some axe to grind. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould not endorse this pessimistic capitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from next year, great emphasis will be placed\r\n\r\non technical and vocational education. This will mean\r\n\r\na great reform in our educational system. This reform\r\n\r\nis undoubtedly necessary because only then will we be\r\n\r\nable to meet the increasing demand for technical  per\r\n\r\nsonnel   in   industrial  expansion.  Although   some\r\n\r\nrestrictions have been imposed on the expenditure for\r\n\r\nhealth  and social services, we have enough resources\r\n\r\nto look after the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, the Budget can be described as\r\n\r\nrational  and fine. It is based on sound  principles,\r\n\r\nand  also  at  a time when our country is  undergoing\r\n\r\nchanges,  it  does  not increase the  burden  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  At  the  same time, it has  also  created  a\r\n\r\nbetter  atmosphere  for  economic  expansion  and  to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign  investment. Our people  have  every\r\n\r\nreason to expect that 1969 will be a better year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Budget of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when independence\r\n\r\ncame   to   us   three  years  ago,   our   immediate\r\n\r\npreoccupation at that time was to find ways and means\r\n\r\nby  which  to promote economic growth, as if  out  of\r\n\r\nnothing.  Today,  looking back, we can  take  comfort\r\n\r\nfrom,  and have a sense of pride in, the achievements\r\n\r\nof  these eventful years. What economic progress  has\r\n\r\nbeen  attained is undoubtedly the result of effective\r\n\r\norganisation, realistic planning and  a  disciplined\r\n\r\napproach to our numerous problems. Compliment must of\r\n\r\ncourse   be   paid   to  the  untiring   efforts   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and it is on industrialisation  and\r\n\r\nalso trade which the hon. Member for Sembawang has, I\r\n\r\nthink,  given  me justification to make this  general\r\n\r\ncomment  on  policy in relation to  foreign  affairs.\r\n\r\nBecause  without industrialisation and  trade,  there\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  marketing, and without marketing  with\r\n\r\nforeign countries there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  trade representatives.  I  think  trade\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  have  to  go  along  with  political\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the way of High Commissioners  and\r\n\r\nAmbassadors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must not overlook the\r\n\r\nfact  that  another element which has  made  all  the\r\n\r\nachievements possible is our adherence to a realistic\r\n\r\npolicy  -  one  which  seeks the  maximum  number  of\r\n\r\nfriends  on the basis of equality and mutual respect,\r\n\r\nnon-alignment  in bloc rivalries and  the  desire  to\r\n\r\ntrade   with  all  countries  irrespective  of  their\r\n\r\npolitical ideology or their systems of government, so\r\n\r\nlong  as such trade is to the mutual benefit of these\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This realistic approach to problems of international\r\n\r\nrelations  has  indeed  paid dividends.  For  looking\r\n\r\naround  us, the results of these policies  should  be\r\n\r\nevident to all of us. We have in Singapore diplomatic\r\n\r\nmissions,  consular offices and trade representations\r\n\r\nfrom  different countries in the world, many of  whom\r\n\r\nadhere   to   diverse  policies  and  take  different\r\n\r\npostures  on international issues. I would  say  even\r\n\r\nbelonging  to different blocs. But what is  important\r\n\r\nis  the  fact that we would not have counted so  many\r\n\r\ndiverse  friends to our credit, if not for  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  permanent premises on  which  our  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  is 'based is something on which others cannot\r\n\r\nfind  fault with us. Foreign policies may change  but\r\n\r\nthe premises on which these policies are founded must\r\n\r\nalways  remain unaltered. Our basic principles  of  a\r\n\r\nnon-communist,  democratic,  socialist   state   will\r\n\r\nforever remain unchanged. That I am confident will be\r\n\r\nthe  case with us now and in the future. For who  can\r\n\r\nblame  us  for  these  premises? Our  fundamental  ob\r\n\r\njective is to enhance the prosperity and the security\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  We are simply for Singapore.  We  are\r\n\r\nanti nobody, just pro-Singapore. For this is the case\r\n\r\nin  fact with every country in the world, and I would\r\n\r\nsay this is the right of every nation to pursue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, which is the philosophy of our foreign\r\n\r\npolicy, is how we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee the world around us and interpret the changes and\r\n\r\ninstability outside our frontiers. For is it  not  in\r\n\r\nthe light of these changes that any country will have\r\n\r\nto  make whatever adjustments that are called for  in\r\n\r\ntheir  foreign  policy and enhance its  security  and\r\n\r\nprosperity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore be flexible in our policies\r\n\r\ntowards  other  governments  and  states.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  be one-track minded. Indeed  we  have  to\r\n\r\nadopt  a  policy of open-mindedness in our  relations\r\n\r\nwith  other governments and states. At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  have to be firm, consistent and rational  in  our\r\n\r\npostures.  As a government and people we  cannot  and\r\n\r\nshould never allow emotions to get the better of  us,\r\n\r\nbecause  this can only lead to irrational, insensible\r\n\r\naction.  Governments and states we  have  learnt  are\r\n\r\nprimarily  motivated by self-interest, and  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing unusual or extraordinary about this.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, we also know that this motivating  factor\r\n\r\nof  self-interest is not inconsistent  with  friendly\r\n\r\nexternal  relations with others. This is  the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy   difficulties  between  governments  and  states\r\n\r\nencountered one day are more often than not  resolved\r\n\r\nand  overcome  the next. International  relations  or\r\n\r\nintercourse  between  states is not  something  which\r\n\r\nstarted with the League of Nations or with the United\r\n\r\nNations  or  with the present-day regional  groupings\r\n\r\nand   alliances.  They  started  ever   since   human\r\n\r\ncommunities made contact with one another  from  time\r\n\r\nimmemorial.  The only difference is that since  human\r\n\r\nsocieties  became more complex, the social,  economic\r\n\r\nand  political  problems  which  arose  with  greater\r\n\r\nsophistication    needed    equally     sophisticated\r\n\r\nsolutions.  And international relations is  merely  a\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of  the external  complexities  within\r\n\r\nstates  and between them. So to be inflexible in  our\r\n\r\nattitudes towards other states and governments is  to\r\n\r\nbe  like  the proverbial ostrich and reflects  immatu\r\n\r\nrity. No problem is beyond solution; no difficulty is\r\n\r\ntoo great. We must never be overawed by international\r\n\r\nproblems, however insoluble and great they may appear\r\n\r\nto be at the start. Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieves  in having a warm heart and a cool  head  in\r\n\r\nits relations with other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Southeast Asia, of which we are an\r\n\r\nintegral  part,  is  in a state of turbulence.  There \r\n\r\nhave been troubles and anxieties for the past 20  odd years,  \r\n\r\nsince the end of the last World War.  A  look into  recent  \r\n\r\nhistory should confirm  that  wars  and revolutions,    \r\n\r\nracial   conflicts    and    economic\r\n\r\ndisintegration, communism and colonialism,  all  have\r\n\r\nplagued us in Southeast Asia. Be that as it may,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  that  arises is how we in Singapore  should\r\n\r\nperceive  this  turbulent world around  us  and  take\r\n\r\nintelligent  steps  in our own interest  to  overcome\r\n\r\nthese  problems.  In the history of nations,  such  a\r\n\r\ncrisis  is not new. The same could also be  said  for\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  But like all  others,  we  in  this\r\n\r\nregion must benefit from the lessons of history,  for\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that emerges from history is that  mankind\r\n\r\nhas  seen  such  turbulence and crises  in  different\r\n\r\nways.  Some  see  in them nothing  but  danger.  They\r\n\r\naccept  them as inevitable and succumb to  the  gloom\r\n\r\nand  hopelessness which such a mood generates. Others\r\n\r\nhave  seen  in  such turmoil challenges  as  well  as\r\n\r\nopportunities and it has not been uncommon  for  some\r\n\r\nto face these challenges and successfully tackle them\r\n\r\nwith resoluteness and self-confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has seen many crises in the past and,\r\n\r\ngoing  by  past experience, I am confident  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore will also rise to new challenges\r\n\r\nif  and  when  they arise. During confrontation  many\r\n\r\npeople  thought that this thing called  confrontation\r\n\r\nwas  insoluble. Many threw up their hands in despair.\r\n\r\nMany  secretly  and  privately  thought  Sukarno  was\r\n\r\nright. Yet our patience and, of course, circumstances\r\n\r\nproved that it could not and did not last. I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat   in  the  coming  years  they  will  see  these\r\n\r\nchallenges more as an opportunity to put things right\r\n\r\nin the interest of Singapore, rather than give way to\r\n\r\ngloom and despair. It is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore, inevitable that we in Singapore  must  not\r\n\r\nonly   appreciate  the  challenges  ahead  but   must\r\n\r\nunderstand the nature of the problems that  face  us,\r\n\r\nif  we  are  to take measures which are necessary  to\r\n\r\ninsulate  ourselves  against  the  problems  well  in\r\n\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is precisely what the Budget, which has been\r\n\r\npresented by the Minister for Finance for the  coming \r\n\r\n15  months,  seeks to do. As a realistic  people  who \r\n\r\nsupport  realistic policies, which  are  intended  to \r\n\r\nserve  their best interest, I am confident  that  the \r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore will rally to the call, as  they \r\n\r\nhave  always done in the past. For they know that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  tightly  packed society in an island  of  two\r\n\r\nmillion  people,  with no natural resources  and  not\r\n\r\neven  an  adequate  supply of water.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  know  that the Government has  always  pro\r\n\r\nmoted  realistic  solutions to their  problems.  They\r\n\r\nknow that since the P.A.P, came to power in 1959,  we\r\n\r\nhave  consistently followed our major goal of  giving\r\n\r\nour  people  all the opportunities to  develop  their\r\n\r\nhuman  potentialities and to give them a better life.\r\n\r\nThey   are   conscious  that  we  have   consistently\r\n\r\nmaintained  these  policies and I am  confident  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  perceive the objectives which  -  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has outlined in the presentation\r\n\r\nof  this  Budget  - aim not only at  furthering  this\r\n\r\nmajor  goal  but  also seek to ensure  that  what  we\r\n\r\nachieve is always available to them and to succeeding\r\n\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, people in all walks of life are\r\n\r\nconscious  that  a new element has  loomed  over  our \r\n\r\nhorizon.  They realise that the British  decision  to \r\n\r\nwithdraw in 1971 and not in the mid-1970s has made it \r\n\r\nimperative  that  we  seek  alternative  measures  to \r\n\r\nsecure our independence. What this means is that with\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal, we also have to  make  ourselves\r\n\r\nself-reliant in matters of defence and this has to be\r\n\r\ndone  not  within  eight to  ten  years,  as  we  had\r\n\r\noriginally  envisaged, but within  three  years  from\r\n\r\nnow.  Judging by the enthusiastic support  which  our\r\n\r\npeople have hitherto given us in respect of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchallenges posed by other problems, I feel confident\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore should be able to be reasonably self-\r\n\r\nreliant  in  matters  of defence,  with  the  assured\r\n\r\nsupport of its people for the measures that have been\r\n\r\nproposed. Of course, the objectives have been clearly\r\n\r\noutlined  by the Minister for Finance in  the  presen\r\n\r\ntation  of  the  Budget and it should be  obvious  to\r\n\r\neveryone  what we mean when we say that we intend  to\r\n\r\nbe self-reliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact of international life that small\r\n\r\ncountries  have always had to live in the shadows  of\r\n\r\nbigger  ones.  In recent years, there was  reason  to\r\n\r\nhope that the shadows which big nations cast over the\r\n\r\nsmaller   nations   would  grow  shorter   and   less\r\n\r\nthreatening. There were indeed encouraging  signs  at\r\n\r\none  time  when  big  nations joined  others  in  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  and recognition of  ethical  norms  in\r\n\r\ninternational relations. It is loudly proclaimed that\r\n\r\nadherence to the principles of sovereign equality  of\r\n\r\nall   states;   that  respect  for  the   territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  of other states; that non-interference  in\r\n\r\nthe  internal affairs of other states; and  that  the\r\n\r\nrenunciation  of the use or threat of  force  in  the\r\n\r\nsettlement  of  disputes  between  states   are   the\r\n\r\nfoundations on which relations between countries  are\r\n\r\nto  be conducted. It is even said often that the  old\r\n\r\ndoctrine  of  spheres  of interests,  or  spheres  of\r\n\r\ninfluence, in which a dominant power could dictate to\r\n\r\nthe state living in its shadows, is clearly repugnant\r\n\r\nto  universally accepted principles of  international\r\n\r\nconduct.  But  the sad fact of international  conduct\r\n\r\ntoday  suggests  that what may be an  ideal  may  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not dispute the fact that the ultimate\r\n\r\nsecurity for small countries like us depends less  on\r\n\r\nwasteful  expenditure  on  armaments  and   more   on\r\n\r\nbuilding  and strengthening the international  forces\r\n\r\nof  peace.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nconvinced that only the strengthening of the  climate\r\n\r\nfor   peaceful  relations  and  greater  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween  nations, both big and small, can  help  save\r\n\r\narms expenditure and enable us small countries to use\r\n\r\nthe  money to combat poverty, ignorance and  disease,\r\n\r\nwhich are our real enemies and whose defeat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis both rational and worth while. But if we are to go\r\n\r\nby  what is going on around us, notwithstanding these\r\n\r\nideals,  I am afraid we cannot help but believe  that\r\n\r\nevery  dollar  spent on arms, though wasteful,  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  expenditure  under the  circumstances,  at\r\n\r\nleast until we have satisfied ourselves that we  have\r\n\r\nattained  that  measure of self-reliance  in  defence\r\n\r\nwhich  is  necessary for us small  countries,  or  at\r\n\r\nleast until the forces of internal peace can come  to\r\n\r\nour aid. Until such time as nations can achieve these\r\n\r\ngoals  and  view  relations with  one  another  in  a\r\n\r\nrealistic   fashion,  I  am  afraid  we   cannot   be\r\n\r\ncomplacent  about  such  questions  and  ignore   our\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to become self-reliant  for  our  own\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world of interdependence, our objectives of\r\n\r\na  better life for our people can be achieved in many\r\n\r\nways. We recognise that not least among them is by co-\r\n\r\noperating  with  other countries, particularly  those\r\n\r\naround  us and closest to us as well as others  which\r\n\r\nare more advanced than we are. This is the kind of co-\r\n\r\noperation  which,  in  our  view,  will  be   further\r\n\r\nenhanced  only  if  conflicts  between  nations,  and\r\n\r\nparticularly  the bigger nations, are brought  to  an\r\n\r\nend. It is increasingly dawning on the minds of world\r\n\r\nleaders  that  we  can no longer  seek  solutions  to\r\n\r\ninternational problems in terms of past memories  but\r\n\r\nshould realistically look for these solutions in  the\r\n\r\npresent  circumstances and with future objectives  in\r\n\r\nmind.  In  other words, we must not go  back  to  the\r\n\r\nglories of the past, imaginary or otherwise. We  must\r\n\r\nlook  to the present and to the future with optimism.\r\n\r\nWe  must  bury  the dead past. That is why  Singapore\r\n\r\nlooks hopefully for an end to irrelevant conflicts in\r\n\r\nthis region and other regions, which for the last two\r\n\r\ndecades have distorted relations not only amongst  us\r\n\r\nin Southeast Asia, but also amongst countries outside\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  Our salvation  lies  in  us  -  the\r\n\r\ncountries of Southeast Asia - cooperating and pooling\r\n\r\nour resources in order to progress and advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to join and support the Association\r\n\r\nof Southeast Asian Nations - ASEAN. We have not done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  for nothing. We are in ASEAN because we believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  pursuit of regionalism is in the interests\r\n\r\nof all of us in Southeast Asia. We have absolutely no\r\n\r\nillusions about regionalism and even though ASEAN  is\r\n\r\npresently  having some difficulty, we  are  convinced\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  but a temporary phase and  one  which\r\n\r\nother   successful   regional   organisations    have\r\n\r\nexperienced in their early years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even the case with the United Nations, and\r\n\r\nalthough  one hears frequent criticism of the  United\r\n\r\nNations  and  its  role in world affairs,  its  short\r\n\r\ncomings  and  failures; though one hears  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  described  as  a big talk-shop;  though  one\r\n\r\nknows that the United Nations has not been able to do\r\n\r\nmuch  in  areas  of  conflict like the  Middle  East;\r\n\r\nthough one knows that the wasteful war in Vietnam has\r\n\r\nbeen  what it has been for several years in the  past\r\n\r\nbecause the United Nations has been helpless; yet the\r\n\r\nfact remains that no member organisation, whether big\r\n\r\nor  small,  in  the United Nations has been  able  to\r\n\r\nconvince its members that the best course is to scrap\r\n\r\nit.  All  members of the United Nations believe  that\r\n\r\nthe organisation should continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rather than concern ourselves with trivial and\r\n\r\ntransient  issues,  it is important  that  we  should\r\n\r\npursue  the  more formidable and long-term challenges\r\n\r\nwhich  ASEAN has been established to face and  solve.\r\n\r\nWhatever  others may say, Singapore is determined  to\r\n\r\nsee  that regardless of the minor difficulties  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmust   continue.  Whatever  the  differences,  recent\r\n\r\ntensions  in the world have proved that it is  always\r\n\r\nbetter   to  go  on  talking  on  problems,   however\r\n\r\ninsoluble  they may appear, rather than pretend  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not exist. There is a saying in Malay,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that however annoyed one  is  by  the\r\n\r\nnuisance  created by the mosquito buzzing near  one's\r\n\r\nears, one should never seek a solution by burning the\r\n\r\nmosquito net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of regionalism and\r\n\r\ninterdependence upon which I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwish  to touch. We in Southeast Asia can be described\r\n\r\nas  developing nations. We are at varying degrees  of\r\n\r\nunder-development. Co-operation between  economically\r\n\r\nweak  and  politically unstable situations, with  all\r\n\r\nthe best of intentions and mutual goodwill, cannot, I\r\n\r\nam  afraid,  ensure rapid growth and development.  To\r\n\r\nachieve  this,  we  must also  co-operate  with  more\r\n\r\nadvanced  friends in other parts of the  world  in  a\r\n\r\njoint enterprise or in several joint enterprises  for\r\n\r\nour  common prosperity and advancement. But our  more\r\n\r\nadvanced  friends are not going to be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nhelp  us if we cannot co-operate and make regionalism\r\n\r\nwork   successfully.  They  are  not  going   to   be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to help us if we quarrel among  ourselves\r\n\r\nover small issues. They will naturally ask how we are\r\n\r\nto work together on bigger and more important matters\r\n\r\nif we cannot solve and settle minor problems. This is\r\n\r\nthe  problem  faced by members of regional  groupings\r\n\r\nand  alliances  which, for some  reason  or  another,\r\n\r\ncannot  get  along  with one  another.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion which they should pose themselves and try to\r\n\r\nanswer   honestly.  However,  this  alone   will   be\r\n\r\ninsufficient, for co-operation among ourselves  alone\r\n\r\nwill  not  make for speedy advances towards modernisa\r\n\r\ntion.  On  the  other hand, they  will  be  slow  and\r\n\r\ndifficult, for the simple reason is that co-operation\r\n\r\namong poorer countries is not always the best way  of\r\n\r\ngrowing  rich materially and spiritually in  a  short\r\n\r\nspace  of  time.  We  believe  that  co-operation  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia must, therefore, involve not only asso\r\n\r\nciation  among ourselves but that these  associations\r\n\r\nmust  be  complemented with association with friends,\r\n\r\nrich  as  well  as the not so rich in  the  world.  I\r\n\r\nthink, if the big powers realise that they have  more\r\n\r\nto gain by co-operating both with themselves and with\r\n\r\nothers to help less advanced countries, the less  the\r\n\r\noccasion for big power conflict and rivalries and the\r\n\r\never present danger of major conflict in our area. To\r\n\r\nthat extent, Singapore will support any move for  co-\r\n\r\noperation among ourselves in Southeast Asia, and  any\r\n\r\napproaches which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow a sincere and practical desire by the big powers\r\n\r\nto  assist in the genuine development in the  region,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  drawing small countries into  big  power\r\n\r\nconflicts, will be welcomed and supported by  us  and\r\n\r\nother small countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite often mentioned by us and by others\r\n\r\nthat small nations do not have the power to influence\r\n\r\nevents  in the world. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  very\r\n\r\ntrue.  This is so true that only a few months ago  we\r\n\r\nhave   seen  how  a  relatively  small  country  like\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia was subjected to intrusions by a  very\r\n\r\nmuch  more  powerful country. But  the  question  is,\r\n\r\ncollectively  small countries can,  given  the  right\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  given the right leadership  and  with\r\n\r\ngood  intentions,  assert their  moral  influence  in\r\n\r\ninfluencing  world events. To that extent,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  co-operate  in pursuit of its  policy  of  non-\r\n\r\nalignment in influencing world events, not by  itself\r\n\r\nalone but in conjunction with other countries in  the\r\n\r\nworld which pursue policies which are not detrimental\r\n\r\nto the interests of others and which certainly do not\r\n\r\ninterfere  in the internal affairs of small countries\r\n\r\nlike Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  shall  not\r\n\r\nembarrass him any further, but shall reply to some of\r\n\r\nthe  points raised by the Members who have spoken  so\r\n\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Telok Blangah, Bras Basah and Bukit\r\n\r\nHo Swee raised the question of the 15 per cent tax on\r\n\r\nimported  made-up  garments. The  Members  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  and  Bras Basah complained of the  tax.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Ho Swee, on the other  hand,  said\r\n\r\nthat  the tax was equitable. I think both the Members\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah and Telok Blangah want to have  their\r\n\r\ncake and eat it too. On the one hand, they complained\r\n\r\nthat the tax will be a burden on the workers. On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, they said that we must create more employ\r\n\r\nment  for our workers. I would have thought that  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Telok Blangah and Bras Basah  should  be\r\n\r\nthe  last  persons to complain of the tax  which,  in\r\n\r\nfact, helps the local garment industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Point of clarification, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir,I am sure I did not complain of the  15\r\n\r\nper cent tax on imported made-up garments. In fact, I\r\n\r\nagreed with the Government. What I complained  of  is\r\n\r\nthe 10 per cent levy on P.U.B, bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am glad the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  is  not  complaining of the tax. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nneed only confine myself to answering the Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah. As I was saying, this tax,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nhelps our local garment industry. As we all know, the\r\n\r\ngarment  industry is employment intensive. It employs\r\n\r\na  lot  of workers. The fact that this tax helps  the\r\n\r\ngarment  industry is borne out by the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Garment Manufacturers'  Association\r\n\r\nwelcomes the tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah, however, says that\r\n\r\nforeign  garments are superior in quality.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nhow he gets this impression. Sir, as you know,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  garments  compete very effectively with  foreign\r\n\r\nproducts, especially in the United States of  America\r\n\r\nand  in  the United Kingdom markets, so much so  that\r\n\r\nthese  two  governments have to put a restriction  on\r\n\r\nthe entry of our products into their markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Govindasamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I\r\n\r\njust  want  to  find  out whether  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is wearing imported underwear or  locally-\r\n\r\nmade underwear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon.

My shirt, socks and under-garments are  all\r\n\r\nlocally made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also complained that,\r\n\r\nas  a result of our protective policies for industry,\r\n\r\nthe  prices of goods have gone up. I do not know  how\r\n\r\nthe Member could have got that impression. He must be\r\n\r\nquite  unscientific, for I have here the latest  copy\r\n\r\nof  the  Monthly Digest of Statistics which  keeps  a\r\n\r\nconsumer  price index. The volume I am quoting  from,\r\n\r\nSir,  is the November issue, Volume VII, No.  11.  At\r\n\r\npage 117, it gives the consumer price index. The base\r\n\r\nis 100 as at April/May, 1960. For January 1968, it is\r\n\r\n113.5  points.  For  September, lo  and  behold,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is 111.1 points. According  to  this\r\n\r\nprice  index,  which is collected by  the  Statistics\r\n\r\nDepartment  -and it is the authoritative price  index\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore - the cost of living has in fact  gone\r\n\r\ndown. The Member for Telok Blangah should have a look\r\n\r\nat  this consumer price index. If he can convince  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  prices have gone up and give  evidence  to\r\n\r\nsupport it, I shall definitely look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction of the consumer price index is\r\n\r\nbased on retail prices. Weights are given for various\r\n\r\ngoods.  I should ask the Member to be more scientific\r\n\r\nthan just say, \"Prices have soared up.\" In fact,  the\r\n\r\nexpression he used was \"spiralling of prices\". He  is\r\n\r\nusing  a  very technical term but his statements  are\r\n\r\nbased not on facts but on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeelings.  It is true that the prices of one  or  two\r\n\r\nitems  might  have gone up, but there are  comparable\r\n\r\nsubstitutes in the market. For example, if the Member\r\n\r\nis  taken in by an advertisement saying that by using\r\n\r\na  particular  brand of toilet soap he  could  get  a\r\n\r\ncomplexion as smooth as that of nine out of ten  film\r\n\r\nstars, he has got to pay for that belief. There is  a\r\n\r\ncomparable brand of soap in the market. Why  does  he\r\n\r\nnot  use it and help the local industry? In fact,  he\r\n\r\nwill be helping his own fellow men to get employment.\r\n\r\nWhy  must he buy an imported brand of soap?  I  think\r\n\r\nhis  fellow men should ask him that question, and  he\r\n\r\nmust be prepared to answer them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also raised the point\r\n\r\nthat hotel charges are too high and that package tour\r\n\r\nagents are beginning to leave Singapore out of  their\r\n\r\nitinerary.  Sir,  I  can only say  that  he  has  not\r\n\r\nproduced any evidence whatsoever to substantiate this\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a\r\n\r\npoint   of   clarification.

I do not see any reason why our women folk\r\n\r\ncannot  look nice in locally-made sarees. I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthey will look equally charming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tax on liquid petroleum gas, the\r\n\r\ntax  is three cents per pound and not 15 per cent  as\r\n\r\nstated  by  the  Member for Telok  Blangah.  This  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  in order to make not only the gas  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board  but  also  its  electricity\r\n\r\ncompetitive with petroleum gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of per capita income of workmen, I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the Labour Department keeps a  record\r\n\r\nof  the figures of the average yearly earnings of the\r\n\r\nworkers.   These  figures  show  that  the   workers'\r\n\r\nearnings  have  been going up over the years,  though\r\n\r\nnot  very dramatically. I think I have replied to the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  come to the points raised by the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah quoted 'from the Budget\r\n\r\nspeech of the Minister for Finance and said that  the\r\n\r\ndifference between imports and exports, or the  trade\r\n\r\ngap,  is  somewhere in the region of $1,000  million.\r\n\r\nThis  figure,  of course, covers only goods  imported\r\n\r\nand exported, and does not take into account services\r\n\r\nlike  insurance,  port services and the  rest.  These\r\n\r\nservices  normally make up the deficit,  as  is  very\r\n\r\neloquently  shown in our reserves. Surely,  the  acid\r\n\r\ntest  is whether our reserves go up or 'down,  and  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure Members that our reserves have been going\r\n\r\nup  year  by  year and are now in a very satisfactory\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that 'certain foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  come and invest here and yet do  not  open\r\n\r\ntheir own home market to the products manufactured in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What does the Member expect? Surely,  the\r\n\r\nidea of attracting foreign investment here is that we\r\n\r\nshould  create employment opportunities for  our  own\r\n\r\npeople.  The question of where they sell the products\r\n\r\ndoes  not really matter. As long as the products  can\r\n\r\nbe  sold,  whether in the home market of the  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestor  or elsewhere, that is what really  matters.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some of these foreign investors do come here\r\n\r\nwith  their  market. One such example is  Bridgestone\r\n\r\nTyre  Company Limited. In any case, even  if  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  do not come here with their market  or  do\r\n\r\nnot  open their home market to our products, I  think\r\n\r\nthe  best  thing  to do is to help these  foreign  in\r\n\r\nvestors find their market rather than complain  about\r\n\r\nthem. Does the Member really mean to say that if they\r\n\r\ndo  not  open their home market to us, we should  not\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  come  in, thereby  resulting  in  no\r\n\r\nfactories being opened and unemployment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that the 10 per cent tax\r\n\r\non the Public Utilities Board bills fall very heavily\r\n\r\non the working class and that it is a regressive tax.\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid  he  has not read  the  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance very carefully, because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance did say that more than  32  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the consumers need only pay half of the tax,\r\n\r\nthat is, 5 per cent, and more than a quarter need not\r\n\r\npay  any  tax  at  all.  I am  sure  this  is  not  a\r\n\r\nregressive tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the points raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong. I think he brought up the same point made  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bras Basah, and that is the trade gap.\r\n\r\nI have already answered that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained of the lack of social\r\n\r\namenities in Jurong and asked for an improvement. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  very  conscious  of  this  particular\r\n\r\naspect.  That  is one of the reasons why  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation  was established  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nbringing about an improvement in the social amenities\r\n\r\nin  Jurong. The other reason for the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation  is  the better management  and  the\r\n\r\nrationalisation of development, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also proposed that a workers'\r\n\r\ncultural  centre  be established in Jurong.  I  would\r\n\r\nadvise  him  to  look into the possibility  of  using\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres for this purpose. I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nfacilities there can be utilised for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1\r\n\r\nwould  like to clarify that I did mention the problem\r\n\r\nof a community centre in Jurong Town. I said that the\r\n\r\npresent  community centre was not properly built.  It\r\n\r\nis  only an assorted collection of several flats  and\r\n\r\nis  situated quite far away from the workers'  homes.\r\n\r\nThat   is   why  it  cannot  be  used  for   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, there are many community\r\n\r\ncentres in Jurong and I would recommend the Member to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  the facilities there, if the  existing\r\n\r\ncommunity centres are too far away from the  workers'\r\n\r\nhomes, perhaps  he  can make representation  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  for  the   establishment   of\r\n\r\nadditional  community centres in order to incorporate\r\n\r\ncultural activities into the community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the Member touched on is about the\r\n\r\nFire  Brigade.  He complained that the  nearest  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade is at Bukit Timah. That is true, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  But,  as  far as I can see, it takes  about  10\r\n\r\nminutes  to go from Bukit Timah to Jurong  Town.  The\r\n\r\nroads are wide and the traffic is smooth flowing.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  is  not possible to have  fire  brigades\r\n\r\neverywhere. Singapore is such a small island and land\r\n\r\nis  precious  and  priorities have  to  be  given  to\r\n\r\nindustries and factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised the point that\r\n\r\nimported  made-up  garments  are  cheaper  and   more\r\n\r\nlasting.  I have spoken on this point and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nintend to say anything further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Sembawang suggested a tax on\r\n\r\nfurs. As we all know, Singapore is in the tropics and\r\n\r\nvery  few people here wear furs, if at all. It is  an\r\n\r\nitem  only  for  sale to tourists  and  it  will  not\r\n\r\nbenefit  our  tourist trade if we put a  tax  on  any\r\n\r\narticles  that are likely to be bought  by  them.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  as  foolish as putting a tax  on  cameras,\r\n\r\nbecause,  after  all, Singapore has a  reputation  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a shopper's paradise and we must do everything\r\n\r\nto maintain that reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the points\r\n\r\nraised.  As  other Members are waiting  to  speak,  I\r\n\r\nshall not hold up the proceedings any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.16p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Mr Speaker. Sir, I am afraid that\r\n\r\nwhat  I  am  going  to  say has been  said  by  other\r\n\r\nMembers.  However, I would like to  enlarge  on  what\r\n\r\nthey have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Finance warned that the next\r\n\r\nBudget  would not be painless, people from all  walks\r\n\r\nof  life  were mystified. They were worried that  in,\r\n\r\nfuture  they would be asked to bear more taxes.  This\r\n\r\nis  only  natural  because everyone  knows  that  the\r\n\r\nBritish forces will be withdrawn from Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  1970  and 1971. As Singapore  lacks  natural\r\n\r\nresources,  we  have to depend on our entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nand  industrialisation for our livelihood.  How  then\r\n\r\nare we to get the money for the necessary build-up of\r\n\r\nour  defence as a result of the withdrawal of British\r\n\r\nforces from Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we adhere to a non-aligned\r\n\r\nforeign policy. We will not stretch out our hands  to\r\n\r\nbeg  for aid from the big powers to help us with  our\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure.  So the  only  thing  that  the\r\n\r\npeople can expect is increased taxation. It came as a\r\n\r\nsurprise  to  those people who had been  expecting  a\r\n\r\npainful Budget when the Minister for Finance proposed\r\n\r\nonly  seven mild taxes on the 3rd of this month. This\r\n\r\nwas  contrary  to their expectations  and  they  were\r\n\r\nnaturally pleased. As a matter of fact, the  majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people  realise that increased  taxation  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable  in order to fill the gap in our  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Everyone is prepared to make sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThis is an indication of the people's patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of the Budget is that it reflects\r\n\r\nthe  prosperity of our commerce and industry and  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  confidence of investors.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\npeople are proud of this Budget. In the context of  a\r\n\r\nturbulent Southeast Asia, ours is a clean and  honest\r\n\r\ngovernment for a newly emergent nation. What is  very\r\n\r\nprecious  is that we have shrewd economists like  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. We are relieved to know  before\r\n\r\nChristmas that there is nothing worse in the  Budget.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been  fortunate in  not  following  in  the\r\n\r\nfootsteps of some of our neighbouring countries whose\r\n\r\neconomy  is on the verge of collapse. This is because\r\n\r\nof  the  prudence of our Minister for Finance and  of\r\n\r\nthe   precautions  which  have  been  taken  by   our\r\n\r\nGovernment. This is something of which we are  proud.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will agree  with  me\r\n\r\nthat  if  there is a Nobel Prize for a  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, our Minister for Finance deserves to win it!\r\n\r\nThe future development of our country still needs the\r\n\r\ncollective effort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  persons like the Minister for Finance  and  other\r\n\r\nMinisters. I am sure that Singapore will shine like a\r\n\r\nbeacon in turbulent Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the new tax proposals affect only a\r\n\r\nminority  of  people.  'There  is  nothing  much   to\r\n\r\ncriticise about the new taxes. But from the financial\r\n\r\npoint  of  view,  I think there is some  defect.  The\r\n\r\nbasis  of taxation should be reviewed. The only  fair\r\n\r\nway  of  going  about  it is to impose  taxes  propor\r\n\r\ntionately  on the people who are able to  bear  them.\r\n\r\nThe  burden  of taxation must be fairly  distributed.\r\n\r\nThe  raising of revenue must not be the sole  factor.\r\n\r\nTaxation  must also reflect the financial  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  State. The trend of modern economics is just the\r\n\r\neconomics of finance and nothing else. This is a very\r\n\r\nweak  foundation, in other words, the development  of\r\n\r\ncommerce   and  industry  cannot  be  divorced   from\r\n\r\nfinancial  factors  imposed by  financiers.  Although\r\n\r\nMarx  said that the use of currency will die out  one\r\n\r\nday,  it  was  Lenin who did not oppose  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncurrency  - \"The Central Economic Planning  Committee\r\n\r\nis in the sole control of the country's finances.\" it\r\n\r\nmeans  that  it is not enough to depend on  political\r\n\r\ninfluence alone to solve the financial problem  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry. According to this analysis, it is clear that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance had  already  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount   both   the  financial  administration   and\r\n\r\npractical  factors before he presented the Budget  to\r\n\r\nthis House. He was able to balance both these factors\r\n\r\nto  a  certain degree. When elaborating on the  seven\r\n\r\nnew  taxes and adjustments to the old taxes, he  said\r\n\r\nthat   in  imposing  a  tax  on  P.U.B, bills,  some\r\n\r\nconsideration would be given to the industrial use of\r\n\r\npublic utilities. This is in order not to reduce  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  position  of the local  industries.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has also proposed to exempt industries  from\r\n\r\nthe  new  levy on public utility services.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  new  tax  will not hamper  our  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and industrial expansion. All this  is  being\r\n\r\ndone  to attract more foreign investments and to make\r\n\r\nour goods competitive in price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must turn our thoughts to these new\r\n\r\ntaxes.  In my view, there is one outstanding  feature\r\n\r\nabout them. The emphasis on the burden of the tax  is\r\n\r\non  the  poor  people. The Finance Minister  gave  an\r\n\r\nexplanation for increasing the rate of tax on  public\r\n\r\nutility   services.  I  will  now   dwell   on   this\r\n\r\nexplanation. According to him, there will be about 25\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the consumers who will fall within  the\r\n\r\ncategory of those whose PUB, bills do not exceed  $10\r\n\r\nper month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.32p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This category is exempted from the new tax. Those\r\n\r\nconsumers  whose bills fall between  $10  and  $20  a\r\n\r\nmonth  constitute  about 32 per  cent  of  the  total\r\n\r\nconsumers. On this category a rate of five  per  cent\r\n\r\nis  levied.  In  the  view of the  Finance  Minister,\r\n\r\nconsumers whose monthly bills range from $10 to $20 a\r\n\r\nmonth  are quite well off financially and they should\r\n\r\nnot be classified in the category of poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out, first of all, that\r\n\r\nthis tax, as explained by the Finance Minister, is  \r\n\r\nneither  clearly defined nor  evenly  spread.  In fact,  \r\n\r\nconsumers in the range of $10 to $20 per month can  \r\n\r\nbe included in the category of poor people.  The majority \r\n\r\nof consumers in this range are poor and  the\r\n\r\nadditional tax will have an adverse effect  on  them.\r\n\r\nAt least they will be affected psychologically. Those\r\n\r\naffected  by  this new tax are not rich people.  They\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the  hard-toiling type  of  people.  This\r\n\r\nburden is particularly felt amongst those who are not\r\n\r\nrich.  For  example, if a family uses  $20  worth  of\r\n\r\npublic  utility services a month, we can say that  it\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  the $300 income group. But we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that human beings need water and lighting.  A\r\n\r\nbigger  family will, therefore, need a greater supply\r\n\r\nof  water  and electricity even though its income  is\r\n\r\nonly  about $300 per month. If you take a  family  in\r\n\r\nthe  $300  income group which has eight members,  the\r\n\r\nconsumption will be substantial. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother words, the consumption rate of public utilities\r\n\r\nis  no  indication of the financial position  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware of the fact that tenants in Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  use more public utility  services  than\r\n\r\nthose whose monthly P.U.B, bills come up to $10. This\r\n\r\nis  because  of the size of their family.  But  their\r\n\r\nincome  may be within the range of $200 to  $300  per\r\n\r\nmonth. They are now worried about the new tax because\r\n\r\nof  the size of their family. They are worried  about\r\n\r\nthe  high cost of public utility services. We  cannot\r\n\r\nassume  that, because a family's P.U.B, bill is  $20,\r\n\r\nit  belongs  to  the well-to-do group and  should  be\r\n\r\ntaxed  accordingly.  That is a  wrong  assumption  to\r\n\r\nmake.  If we carry this assumption too far,  it  will\r\n\r\ngive  rise  to a great deal of ill consequences.  For\r\n\r\nexample, consumers whose bills amount to $20  may  be\r\n\r\nclassified  as  the  lower middle  income  group.  In\r\n\r\naddition to the normal P.U.B, expenses, they will now\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay these additional taxes. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthis  increased  burden, they will  not  allow  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to make use of electric lights for  reading\r\n\r\nat  night. They may have to switch to kerosene lamps.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, their eyes will suffer. We  will  then\r\n\r\nhave  more  and more shortsighted people in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the future. Many families now use electricity  or\r\n\r\ngas  for  cooking.  The  additional  levy  on  public\r\n\r\nutility  services  will force them  to  use  kerosene\r\n\r\ncookers  or  even  bottled gas as a  substitute.  The\r\n\r\nadditional cost of water will also induce them not to\r\n\r\nuse  sufficient  water to wash their  clothes  clean.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  adverse  consequences  we  have   to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merchants and traders use neon lights for\r\n\r\nadvertising  purposes. However, we  do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nworry  about the big businessmen. But what about  the\r\n\r\nsmall businessmen? As a result of the increased  cost\r\n\r\nof  public  utility services, they may  pass  on  the\r\n\r\nincreased cost to the consumers by raising the retail\r\n\r\nprices  of  goods  and  services.  Consequently,  the\r\n\r\npeople will again suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the rural areas. We are now\r\n\r\nencouraging  the  rural people to make  more  use  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  water.  In  other  words,  we   are\r\n\r\ninstalling electricity in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are cutting down the provision of stand-pipes in\r\n\r\norder to encourage the rural people to install water-\r\n\r\npipes  in  their  own homes. The  additional  tax  on\r\n\r\npublic utility services will be a burden on the rural\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  already poor. They  are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\npoorer than the urban people. They will thus hesitate\r\n\r\nto install water and electricity in their homes. As a\r\n\r\nresult,  they will not be able to enjoy these  modern\r\n\r\nfacilities.  In my humble view, the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  give  further thought to  the  new  forms  of\r\n\r\ntaxation.  He  should look further into the  question\r\n\r\nbefore he makes a final decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no way of increasing revenue other than by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the levy on the public utility  services?\r\n\r\nCannot  we  impose additional taxes on luxury  goods?\r\n\r\nCannot  we do it by way of purchase tax? In my  view,\r\n\r\nit  is  only by increasing the taxes on luxury  goods\r\n\r\nand  purchase tax that we are able to get money  from\r\n\r\nthe    rich.   For   example,   refrigerators,   air-\r\n\r\nconditioners, perfumes and cosmetics for women and  a\r\n\r\nhost of other luxury goods can be considered for  tax\r\n\r\nincreases. These are the articles used by  the  upper\r\n\r\nmiddle class or the middle class people. More revenue\r\n\r\nwill  come from these sources than from the  levy  on\r\n\r\npublic utility services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics, the yield from this new tax\r\n\r\non P.U.B, bills will amount to $11 million per annum.\r\n\r\n[f  we were to substitute this tax with purchase  tax\r\n\r\nand  taxes on luxury goods, we might be able  to  get\r\n\r\nmore  money from the people who should be taxed.  Our\r\n\r\nbudget  will  then be nearer to perfection.  It  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  in keeping with the Government's policy  of\r\n\r\nlooking   after   the   majority   of   the   people,\r\n\r\nparticularly the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is gratifying to note that, due to the\r\n\r\nefforts made by the Ministry of Finance, we have been \r\n\r\nable  to attract a large amount of  investments into  \r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think this is  a  very  important feature  \r\n\r\nin  the Finance Minister's Budget Statement. As  a result\r\n\r\nof the continuous flow of foreign investments  into \r\n\r\nSingapore, we are able to give more  jobs\r\n\r\nto our people. Our economy is given another boost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nto  the  fact  that amongst the investors  coming  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, there are very few women investors. As far\r\n\r\nas I know, there are many wealthy women in the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough  these rich women are not so  aggressive  as\r\n\r\ntheir  male  counterparts, they are financially  well\r\n\r\noff  to  be able to invest in our markets. We  should\r\n\r\nnot overlook them because of their lack of aggressive\r\n\r\nness.  If we are able to attract them to invest here,\r\n\r\nwe    can    perhaps   get   additional   substantial\r\n\r\ninvestments. As regards the women in our own country.\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister should find ways and  means  to\r\n\r\nencourage  them to invest locally. This  will  be  of\r\n\r\ngreat   assistance  to  our  national  economy.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  our women may have property like  jewellery\r\n\r\nand   other  precious  ornaments.  They  bought  them\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the fear that their cash may be  stolen.\r\n\r\nThey  bought  them as a form of investment.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  there  has  been no encouragement  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for our women to make proper investments.\r\n\r\nlf  the  Government  can set up a women's  investment\r\n\r\nbureau,  perhaps our economy will be  better  off  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give consideration to these\r\n\r\nproblems. I give him my full support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.46p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

Since  the announcement of  the  accelerated\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of British forces from Singapote,  no  one\r\n\r\ninside  and outside this House has any doubt  of  the\r\n\r\nneed to build up our own defence forces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquickly.

The  resultant  economic\r\n\r\nproblem  poses such a formidable challenge that  many\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministers  even  of the  affluent  countries\r\n\r\nwould  rather quit their posts than stay  on.  Taking\r\n\r\nthis  into account, Sir, I cannot help congratulating\r\n\r\nour  Finance  Minister on his courage  and  brilliant\r\n\r\nrendering of his annual Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with the military build up, the\r\n\r\nMinister outlined his plans for economic growth  and,\r\n\r\nin  this  respect,  he quoted gratifying  figures  of\r\n\r\nachievement  in  our  industrial  expansion.  Foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  is  continuously being  poured  in  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is optimistic that the factories in  Jurong\r\n\r\nand other industrial estates will continue to grow in\r\n\r\nnumber  and  in  size.  I would  like  to  share  his\r\n\r\noptimism,   but   industrialists,  both   local   and\r\n\r\noverseas,  have  repeatedly  warned  that  with   our\r\n\r\npopulation of two million, the prospects of industria\r\n\r\nlisation  would  be  dim unless our  industries  were\r\n\r\noriented towards exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that among the factories already\r\n\r\nengaged in the export trade, some have secured repeat\r\n\r\norders while others have not gone beyond their  first\r\n\r\norder.  I  am  sure the Minister is  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of new factories will only serve  as  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  relief  in our unemployment  problem.  And\r\n\r\nunless   these   factories  can  be  sustained,   the\r\n\r\nsituation   will   quickly  be   reversed,   to   the\r\n\r\ndisappointment  of  everyone. The sustenance  of  any\r\n\r\nfactory  depends  on the quality  and  price  of  its\r\n\r\nproducts.  As  I  see  it,  the  Government,  by  its\r\n\r\neconomic incentives like relief from income  tax  and\r\n\r\nother   concessions,  has  succeeded  in   attracting\r\n\r\nforeign  investors to set up factories in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  by  the  Employment Act,  it  has  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nimproving  efficiency which is supposed to  cut  down\r\n\r\nthe cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  production. But nothing seems to have  been  done,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  statement  of  the  Finance  Minister,   to\r\n\r\nregulate the quality of products. Sir, I consider this\r\n\r\nmost  essential  now.  Otherwise, our  export-oriented\r\n\r\nfactories  receiving their first  export  order  would\r\n\r\nalso have received their last export order. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  earnestly suggest that the Minister look into  this\r\n\r\nmatter as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the raising of revenue, the Minister has\r\n\r\nannounced four new taxes. On the basis of distributing\r\n\r\nthe  burden  according to individual ability,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  a  five per cent levy on P.U.B, bills for  those\r\n\r\nwhose bills fall between $10 and $20 a month is to ask\r\n\r\nthe   lower   middle   income   group   to   carry   a\r\n\r\nproportionately heavier burden. It may be argued  that\r\n\r\nthis levy does not amount to more than $1 a month. But\r\n\r\nin  the  light of the increasing cost of  living,  the\r\n\r\nadditional  $1 means much more to this group  than  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $100 to the higher income group. It should\r\n\r\nalso  be  borne  in  mind that  this  group,  although\r\n\r\nconsisting of 32 per cent of the total, has  a  larger\r\n\r\nnumber  of children. Any specific increase in taxation\r\n\r\non this group, however small it may be, would be borne\r\n\r\nnot  only by the head of the family but shared out  by\r\n\r\nthe children as well. I therefore urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nreconsider  the levy of five per cent on P.U.B, bills\r\n\r\nfor  consumers whose bills fall between $10 and $20  a\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  said that this is not a  high  tax.  \r\n\r\nHis explanation is not satisfactory. Therefore, I hope \r\n\r\nthe Minister will reconsider this matter.  In   conclusion,  \r\n\r\nI  am  not  unappreciative  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties confronting our Finance Minister. Despite\r\n\r\nmy  remarks,  to  which I hope he will  give  due  con\r\n\r\nsideration, I endorse his Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhile  many other countries find themselves in a state\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious   concern  over  the  international   monetary\r\n\r\ncrisis,  we,  in a newly emergent Singapore,  must  be\r\n\r\nthankful  that  we  have achieved continuous  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and industrial progress during the past  year.\r\n\r\nDespite  the fact that we are faced with the  prospect\r\n\r\nof   British   withdrawal  and  the  problem   arising\r\n\r\ntherefrom in the l970s, we have been presented with  a\r\n\r\nfairly  mild change and what I might say a  reasonable\r\n\r\nBudget  in  the circumstances for the coming  year.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  sure that this will most certainly be envied  by\r\n\r\nothers,  and  we Singaporeans can take  pride  in  our\r\n\r\nachievements and what we hope for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nbrought realistic changes which, in the Minister's own\r\n\r\nwords,  dispel  unwarranted  gloom  and  reassure  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  the  new  taxation  will  not  have  any\r\n\r\ndamaging effect on investment incentives. In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to add that it establishes confidence  for\r\n\r\nthe  future.  Due  to  the accelerated  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nBritish  troops by 1971, the stability in this  region\r\n\r\ncan no longer be taken for granted. Readjustments have\r\n\r\nto   be  made  to  meet  the  changing  circumstances.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   it   is  inevitable  that   our   defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will be increased if we are  to  be  more\r\n\r\nsecure and keep up with new developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1970s are drawing nearer and nearer. We\r\n\r\nmust  now start preparing and planning for the future.\r\n\r\nif we do not take cautious and steady steps to prepare\r\n\r\nfor  a  more secure and brighter future, then we  will\r\n\r\nlive  to  pay for the consequences of our neglect.  If\r\n\r\nthat were to happen, future generations would judge us\r\n\r\nas  having  been selfish and leaving them  to  face  a\r\n\r\nworld  of  hardship and desperation. We in this  House\r\n\r\nare  all  aware  of the fact that changes  are  taking\r\n\r\nplace  with  great  and  startling  rapidity  in  this\r\n\r\nturbulent  part of Southeast Asia. The whole  security\r\n\r\nand  political situation in Southeast Asia is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  change. Change, according  to  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  is the very essence of life. The moment  we\r\n\r\ncease to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   be   able  to  adapt,  to  adjust,  to   respond\r\n\r\neffectively to a new situation, 'then we  have  begun\r\n\r\nto die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the changes that the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nbrought  to us in this Budget are realistic  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  can draw inspiration from it to overcome  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of the crucial years ahead. In the  Budget,\r\n\r\nwe  notice  the change in the basis of the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  in  the presentation of the Estimates  and  the\r\n\r\nneed to spend more on national defence. I support the\r\n\r\nmove  by  the  Minister for Finance to  increase  our\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure  on the  ground  that  the  real\r\n\r\nproblems  facing  us  are of a  completely  different\r\n\r\nworld  after  the British withdrawal. The  prevailing\r\n\r\nstability in this region will then vanish. The vacuum\r\n\r\nleft  by  the British withdrawal makes it  imperative\r\n\r\nthat we establish an effective defence system of  our\r\n\r\nown   to  maintain  our  security  and  preserve  our\r\n\r\nidentity.  If we do not develop a strong and  lasting\r\n\r\nemotional  attachment to Singapore, then I am  afraid\r\n\r\nour rich and strategically valuable island will be  a\r\n\r\ntempting place for others, especially at a time  when\r\n\r\nthe fact of international life is for the nations  to\r\n\r\nbe increasingly driven by hatred and conflict against\r\n\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  in  Bangkok on the 14th  October,  after\r\n\r\nexamining  the  hard  facts and  harsh  realities  of\r\n\r\nAsia's  political scene, warned us that  today  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries live in fear not of Western imperialism but\r\n\r\nof one another's imperialism. This statement has made\r\n\r\nus realise the fact that the entire situation in this\r\n\r\nregion does not encourage optimism about regional  co\r\n\r\noperation, but instead if we look around us, we  will\r\n\r\nnotice   that  confrontation  has  overshadowed   co-\r\n\r\noperation.  Faced with such an unpredictable  environ\r\n\r\nment,  it  might  be advisable to follow  the  French\r\n\r\nprinciple  our destiny, our path, our policy  be  our\r\n\r\nown - in order to deal with the narrow-minded foreign\r\n\r\npolicies  of certain nations in this region.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, it would be more appropriate that we devote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore of our time and energy to ensure our survival by\r\n\r\nconsolidating  our national defence and  working  for\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance, in presenting his Budget,\r\n\r\nhas  observed  the  objectives for  the  Republic  \r\n\r\nas outlined  by  the  President in his  Speech  to  \r\n\r\nthis Chamber on 6th May. The three objectives are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noptimum use  of  the time available to build up an  effective\r\n\r\ndefence  capability;  greater  economic  growth;  and\r\n\r\nenhancement of national consciousness of the problems\r\n\r\nthat will come upon us in the next few years. A study\r\n\r\nof  the above objectives will make it easy for us  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the intention of the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nto allocate $330 million, or about 30 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal expenditure, on defence, $364 million, or about\r\n\r\n35  per cent, on social and educational services, and\r\n\r\n$108  million,  or  about 10 per  cent, on  economic\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above expenditure for the coming 15 months,\r\n\r\nwe  notice that the Government is determined to build\r\n\r\nup   an   effective  defence  capability  to   ensure\r\n\r\ncontinuing  security and that, at the same  time,  it\r\n\r\nhas  not  forgotten the task to speed up our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The figure of $35.8 million to be raised\r\n\r\nfrom  the  new  taxes  is relatively  very  low  when\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the amount to be spent on  defence.  It\r\n\r\nmerely, in the Minister's own words, helps to pay for\r\n\r\nrather  less  than 10 per cent in defence expenditure\r\n\r\nto  be  incurred next year. Moreover, these new taxes\r\n\r\nhave  been so calculated by the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nthat  families in the lower income group will not  be\r\n\r\naffected, and they will not have the effect of impair\r\n\r\ning    incentives   to   economic   development    or\r\n\r\ndiscouraging  and  disrupting  the  flow  of  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment.  This is the price that the people  could\r\n\r\npay  in order to build up an effective defence system\r\n\r\nat  the  minimum cost, and this cost is not too  much\r\n\r\nfor  the  people to bear. In fact, the price that  we\r\n\r\npay  today  to ensure a bright, secure and prosperous\r\n\r\nfuture is relatively low. Sir, you may agree with  me\r\n\r\nthat this is due\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the economic growth which has reached the mark of\r\n\r\n7.7  per  cent  since last year despite  the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary rundown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of June this year there were 174 pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries   in   production  with  a   total   fixed\r\n\r\ninvestment  of  $436 million and the combined  output\r\n\r\nwas $472 million. Investment and production increased\r\n\r\nby  19 per cent and 64 per cent respectively when com\r\n\r\npared with the same period last year. This is another\r\n\r\nindication  that  enhances our belief  that  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth in our Republic is beyond doubt. Although  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation is bright, there is still the need\r\n\r\nto create confidence in foreign investors in order to\r\n\r\nencourage  their active participation in our  overall\r\n\r\neconomic programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that in the new Budget no\r\n\r\ndisruption  has  been laid upon  industries  and  the\r\n\r\nexport trade. Since last year, some fiscal incentives\r\n\r\nhave  been  designed to encourage export  to  oversea\r\n\r\nmarkets  and  expansion of productive  capability  to\r\n\r\nincrease  output.  To  meet  our  growing  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion, recently the Jurong Town Corporation,  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore and INTRACO were formed\r\n\r\nto  provide  facilities to assist local  and  foreign\r\n\r\npotential investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a suitable investment climate in the field of\r\n\r\neconomics   is  insufficient  to  attract   investors\r\n\r\nwithout   security.   Today,   many   under-developed\r\n\r\ncountries, though rich in natural resources, find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  create a stable political  climate  to\r\n\r\nattract potential investors. As a result, the  people\r\n\r\nin  these countries are still backward and living  in\r\n\r\npoverty. Fortunately for us in Singapore, we  have  a\r\n\r\nfar-sighted government that has in the past few years\r\n\r\nstarted  planning  to build a secure  and  prosperous\r\n\r\nnation  which  will provide a better living  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But  how long can we enjoy such  a  pleasant\r\n\r\nposition  will  depend  on the determination  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has assured us that for the\r\n\r\ncoming  year the greater part of the cost of  defence expenditure  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  met  by increased revenue due  to  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  rather than by new taxes. To  me  this  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  -  a  challenge for the best  or  for  the\r\n\r\nworst..  The  implementation of  his  assurance'  can\r\n\r\nsimply  mean that if we are disciplined and dedicated\r\n\r\nto  make the grade in our economic growth, new  taxes\r\n\r\nwould  not  be necessary to meet the cost of  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure. If we are not disciplined and dedicated,\r\n\r\nwe  will  have to face the consequence of our  short-\r\n\r\nsightedness. There are some selfish people who  think\r\n\r\nthey  can quit Singapore if something happens to  it.\r\n\r\nLet  me tell them that there is no alternative  place\r\n\r\nto  escape  but  to follow the Chinese saying,  \"Live\r\n\r\nhere, die here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should instil into the minds of our people a deep\r\n\r\nconcern not just for their personal future only,  but\r\n\r\nalso for the future of Singapore. This is the kind of\r\n\r\nthinking  that is working directly to strengthen  our\r\n\r\neffort  in  nation building. We are  all  aware  that\r\n\r\nnation  building is a long process and the task  that\r\n\r\nwe  are pursuing to achieve it is difficult. But I am\r\n\r\nconfident that our people, imbued with initiative and\r\n\r\ndedication,   will   be  able   to   overcome   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties. Even the Prime Minister of  Japan,  Mr\r\n\r\nSato,  when  he  visited Singapore on  15th  October,\r\n\r\n1968,  was confident that the course' which Singapore\r\n\r\nis  following today, however thorny it may be, is the\r\n\r\npath leading to a bright and hopeful future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to realise this expression of confidence\r\n\r\nand  translate  visions  into realities,  the  whole-\r\n\r\nhearted  efforts of the people must be  harnessed  to\r\n\r\nachieve specific projects. Plans must be laid now and\r\n\r\nconcurrently  the  people must be wakened  to  devote\r\n\r\ntheir resources to the implementation of these plans.\r\n\r\nideas  and plans are easy to formulate. The difficult\r\n\r\ntask comes after. The time has come for the people to\r\n\r\nrealise  the  pitfalls ahead  if  the  plans  do  not\r\n\r\nsucceed.  To  this end, the Government  must  make  a\r\n\r\nconcerted effort to educate, the people to  meet  the\r\n\r\ntask ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the people of Singapore will\r\n\r\nrise to the occasion, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey   did   in   the  past,  to  overcome   whatever\r\n\r\ndifficulties they may have to encounter.  I  may  add\r\n\r\nalso   that  I  am  confident  that  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, with their resourcefulness and initiative,\r\n\r\nwill push Singapore to new heights of achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us with studied\r\n\r\nconfidence look forward to a new era in the nineteen seventies.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this\r\n\r\nBudget comes as a surprise in many ways. Most  of  us\r\n\r\nknew   of   the   extensive  military  build-up   and\r\n\r\nconsequently expected substantial tax increases. Most\r\n\r\nof us, including those in business, knew how well our\r\n\r\neconomy was developing. What we did not know was that\r\n\r\nwe  were  doing  so  well that the  heavy  demand  of\r\n\r\nmilitary  spending  could be met almost  entirely  by\r\n\r\nnormal  increases in revenue arising from an expanded\r\n\r\neconomy.  Sir,  this  is  a remarkable  feat  by  any\r\n\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in most cases, non-defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure had to have increases curtailed. I regard\r\n\r\nthis as a rather small price to pay for our security.\r\n\r\nWe  all  know how awful the burden of defence is.  In\r\n\r\nmost   countries,  including  even  developed   ones,\r\n\r\nincreases in military spending would have given  rise\r\n\r\nto   severe   economic  problems,  if  not   led   to\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  But here our Finance Minister  does  not\r\n\r\neven  have to increase rates. All he needs is an addi\r\n\r\ntional  $35 million in 15 months, representing  about\r\n\r\nthree  per  cent  of his Budget, to pay  for  further\r\n\r\neconomic  development. I regard this as  close  to  a\r\n\r\nmodern miracle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were told that a preliminary estimate of our\r\n\r\ngross  domestic  expenditure for  1968  put  the  per\r\n\r\ncapita  figure  of Singapore at $1,940.  This  figure\r\n\r\nmust surely indicate that we are a rather rich nation\r\n\r\nin Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister, in a speech at the recent\r\n\r\nopening  of  a  new  factory, said that  our  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves  stand at S$2,000 million. With a population\r\n\r\nof around two million, our per head of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexternal reserves is S$1,000. In Asia, only Japan and\r\n\r\nThailand  have more external reserves than Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  June  1968, the external reserves of  Japan  were\r\n\r\nUS$2,001   million  and  the  external  reserves   of\r\n\r\nThailand  were  US$1,051  million.  Their  respective\r\n\r\npopulations,  however,  are  99.5  million  and  32.7\r\n\r\nmillion. Therefore, in terms of external reserves and\r\n\r\non  the  basis of population, Singapore is  ahead  of\r\n\r\nJapan and Thailand. The per head of external reserves\r\n\r\nof  Japan  is 5560 and that of Thailand  is  S$96  as\r\n\r\nagainst  ours of S$l,000. This figure must again  put\r\n\r\nus  well ahead of other nations in Asia, if not ahead\r\n\r\nof many prosperous nations of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having done so well in the year, it is no wonder\r\n\r\nthat  the  public  have responded favourably  to  the\r\n\r\nadditional  requirements  of  the  Finance  Minister.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  additional sums required  are  for\r\n\r\ntransfer  to  the Development Fund to expand  further\r\n\r\nour economy. Therefore, I do not wish to touch on the\r\n\r\nnew  tax measures and the variations on the old ones.\r\n\r\nAll  of them appear to have been carefully calculated\r\n\r\nand designed to spread the load on those most able to\r\n\r\nbear them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I wish to touch on is the rather\r\n\r\ngrim  prospect facing us in  the  next  three years.  \r\n\r\nI have little doubt that our economy will  ex pand  enough \r\n\r\nto meet the increasing needs of defence. However, I do \r\n\r\nhave grave misgivings about the outcome of  the  work  \r\n\r\nof  those Ministries  whose  share  of\r\n\r\neconomic  increases  will  be  siphoned  off  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Interior and Defence. I quite appreciate\r\n\r\nthat without an adequate defence system, all economic\r\n\r\nand  social development will not be to our good.  But\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time we have to ensure  that  we  have\r\n\r\nsomething worth while to defend. I fear that if  non-\r\n\r\ndefence expenditure is kept at a standstill, not only\r\n\r\nwill  there  be  a  standstill in  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  concerned, but there may be  a  deteriora\r\n\r\ntion  that will, in the end, be very costly to arrest\r\n\r\nand rectify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While agreeing that our rate of defence build-up is\r\n\r\nnecessary, I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  at  the same time other Ministries  should  not\r\n\r\nacquire  the defeatist attitude of doing  nothing  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  improvements are concerned, The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance has set up a trading company and a bank on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis so that the additional  expenditure\r\n\r\ninvolved will be more than met from commercial  opera\r\n\r\ntions instead of being a further charge on Government\r\n\r\nfunds.  The Ministry of Communications now  functions\r\n\r\nmore  like  a  huge  business  concern  than  like  a\r\n\r\nregulatory  Government department.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture has formed a trading company to cut down  the\r\n\r\ncost of production of radio and television programmes\r\n\r\nand  at  the  same  time to market  those  programmes\r\n\r\nlocally  and  abroad.  The  other  Ministries  should\r\n\r\nfollow  suit.  The  Ministry of  Education  can,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, try to sell its excellent E.T.V, programmes\r\n\r\nabroad. The Ministry of National Development can, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  sell  more  of its housing  and  technical\r\n\r\nexpertise   to  other  countries.  The  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board should accelerate its sale of  low-\r\n\r\ncost  houses.  At present, I do not think  that  more\r\n\r\nthan  15  per cent of those who live in the  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing estates own their own flats. The ideal  would\r\n\r\nprobably  be  about 50 per cent. I am not  suggesting\r\n\r\nthat the Government should go all out to compete with\r\n\r\nbusiness  enterprises. What I am suggesting is  that,\r\n\r\nwith some thought and imagination, the Ministries can\r\n\r\nin  one way or another operate along commercial lines\r\n\r\nto  cut  costs  and increase their  income.  Even  if\r\n\r\nnothing  more  than  an attempt has  been  made,  the\r\n\r\nexercise  will  keep those Ministries  which  have  a\r\n\r\nstandstill  budget for the next three years  fighting\r\n\r\nfit until better times come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

At half-past seven I must,\r\n\r\nunder Standing Orders, call the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget and\r\n\r\nthe Government's financial policy for the coming year\r\n\r\nhave obviously been framed with an eye on and under\r\n\r\noverwhelming intimidation of the impending withdrawal\r\n\r\nof the British forces from Singapore. In the midst of\r\n\r\nextremely wild speculation, the Budget has been\r\n\r\nhailed as sensible and mild. But, Sir, I have my\r\n\r\nreservations and consider that the levying of a ten\r\n\r\nper cent tax on P.U.B, services is incorrect and\r\n\r\nuntimely and that the allocation of expenditure in\r\n\r\ncertain cases is unbalanced and not properly handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the 10 per cent tax on P.U.B.\r\n\r\nservices,  I wish to draw the Government's  attention\r\n\r\nto the following considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was only on the 1st November, 1966, that\r\n\r\nthe P.U.B, last raised its rates of charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government has exempted some $14 million\r\n\r\ntaxes  on  petroleum products consumed by the  P.U.B.\r\n\r\nwhose  trade  surplus  for  the  coming  year,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  is somewhere in the  region  of  $26\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as pointed out by the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nwith   the  introduction  of  more  efficient   power\r\n\r\ngeneration  systems, there could  be  a  considerable\r\n\r\ndrop  in production costs resulting in still a higher\r\n\r\ntrade surplus. Therefore, if the Government reimposes\r\n\r\nthe  tax  on  petroleum products, it  will  still  be\r\n\r\npossible  for the PUB, to maintain a reasonably  high\r\n\r\nlevel  of  trade  surplus  which  should  fulfil  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the World Bank Loan without having to\r\n\r\nthrow the burden of tax on to the people at large, if\r\n\r\nthis  is clone, it will probably make the P.U.B, work\r\n\r\nharder  and raise the level of its trade surplus  and\r\n\r\nat the same time ensure that the services it provides\r\n\r\nare kept at the most efficient level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my point that the allocation of expenditure is\r\n\r\nunbalanced  and  not  properly handled,  I  refer  in\r\n\r\nparticular  to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  which\r\n\r\nhas to live with only about one per cent of the total\r\n\r\nBudget.  I  beg  to  disagree with the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  allocation is any indication of the  importance\r\n\r\nhe attaches to this Ministry. I base my consideration\r\n\r\non  the  relative  merits of the two  Ministries  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Interior and Defence and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Foreign Affairs - which are both important to our\r\n\r\nsecurity and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of our defence build-up is \"to achieve\r\n\r\nsecurity in the long term so that the people can  now\r\n\r\nplan  ahead  in  whatever they are doing\".  This  was\r\n\r\ndeclared by the Minister for Defence in his statement\r\n\r\non  26th March. 1968. This is all very good if a more\r\n\r\nlogical  and  realistic  approach  is  made  in   all\r\n\r\ndirections to attain such an objective. Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\nliving  in  a  turbulent area which has  always  been\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  wars  and  conflicts  throughout   its\r\n\r\nhistory  and  where  the political situation  changes\r\n\r\nrapidly.  I am sure that our very existence, security\r\n\r\nand attitudes are to a very large extent affected  by\r\n\r\nconditions and decisions made more from without  than\r\n\r\nfrom  within  this  region or  our  country.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs is here, I am sure  that\r\n\r\nhe will agree with my observation in this respect. If\r\n\r\nthis  is the case, does the Minister for Finance  not\r\n\r\nconsider it of paramount importance that we  must  be\r\n\r\nin  a  position to project a true and clear image  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   overseas  and  that  we  must   be   kept\r\n\r\nadequately informed of world opinion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote an example to show how a foreign\r\n\r\nmission  can  help tremendously to prevent  conflicts\r\n\r\nand  to  promote peace and security. I refer  to  the\r\n\r\nrecent   difficulties  we  had  with  our  Indonesian\r\n\r\nneighbours. I am sure that the situation in Indonesia\r\n\r\ntook  a  turn  for the better because of the  tactful\r\n\r\nhandling by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  we  have a capable and  gallant  diplomat\r\n\r\nthere.  This  goes to show that the returns  from  an\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  such  a  mission  can  bring  us  big\r\n\r\ndividends. Had it not been for the fact that we  were\r\n\r\nable to afford this mission, and have it established,\r\n\r\nwe would probably have had to pay a much higher price\r\n\r\nfor an amicable settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another reason for our defence build-up is to\r\n\r\nshow  to  the world at large that we are prepared  to\r\n\r\ndefend  what  we  have so that prospective  investors\r\n\r\nwill  feel it safe to put their money with  us.  Does\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance not consider  it  sensible\r\n\r\nthat  any prospective investor will first look around\r\n\r\nand  see how well we are getting along with the world\r\n\r\nat large before he conies and invests here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to clarify two points. The fact\r\n\r\nthat  I am asking for more money for the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs does not indicate my full  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  whatever  is being undertaken or pronounced  by\r\n\r\nthis  particular Ministry. It is neither my intention\r\n\r\nto  belittle the good work that the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nInterior  and Defence has been doing in  fostering  a\r\n\r\nclimate  that  is  conducive to the continued  peace,\r\n\r\nsecurity  and prosperity in our Republic,  nor  do  1\r\n\r\nwish  to  deny  that we have to be in a  position  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  substantially to any eventual  collective\r\n\r\ndefence  agreement and be a party  of  importance  in\r\n\r\nsuch an exercise as early as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I am fully convinced of the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  handling foreign affairs  for  us  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  If  the  Government  neglects   the\r\n\r\ncontributions to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,  I\r\n\r\nam  of the opinion that it is putting the cart before\r\n\r\nthe  horse  and' that it does not have a correct  and\r\n\r\nbalanced approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask the Government to provide us not only\r\n\r\nwith  an  alert, 'disciplined and well-trained  crew,\r\n\r\nready and capable of defending us from any danger and\r\n\r\nthreat to our survival, but also with people who  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of  reading and interpreting  signs  of  bad\r\n\r\nweather and of seeing us through the rough seas ahead\r\n\r\nso that we will come safely into port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir, my task this evening is made  somewhat\r\n\r\neasier  by  the  novel arrangement of introducing  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary at half-time.  He  has  dealt\r\n\r\nwith so many of the points raised by Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the House that only a few are to be dealt with by\r\n\r\nme.  However,  since my Parliamentary Secretary  made\r\n\r\nhis  speech,  some speakers have raised a  number  of\r\n\r\npoints and I think they deserve careful attention and\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have said that the tax on P.U.B, bills\r\n\r\nis  not such a good idea, particularly the levying of\r\n\r\na  five per cent tax on bills between $10 and $20 per\r\n\r\nmonth,  The  Member for Delta, the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nand, I think, the Member for Crawford have criticised\r\n\r\nthis  proposed measure in very clear terms. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Delta thought  that  in  some  poor\r\n\r\nfamilies children may be reduced to such straits that\r\n\r\nthey  will  have to study by kerosene  light.  May  I\r\n\r\nremind her of the \"Three Character Classic\", which no\r\n\r\ndoubt  she had read in her early childhood, in  which\r\n\r\nthere was a very distinguished scholar who studied by\r\n\r\nthe  light of glow-worms. We are still far from  this\r\n\r\ndesperate  position. To all these people I just  want\r\n\r\nto  make this reply. Let us get down to figures. They\r\n\r\nsay  that a family earning $300 per month and  having\r\n\r\nmany  children  will have difficulty in  paying  this\r\n\r\ntax.  In  fact,  on the average, they will  pay  only\r\n\r\nsomething  like  75 cents more per month.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink a family earning an average of $300 a month  --\r\n\r\naccording to the Member for Delta - would find it  an\r\n\r\nincredible  hardship to pay 75 cents more per  month.\r\n\r\nOf   course,   there  are  so  many  of  them   that,\r\n\r\ncollectively, we get about half a million  dollars  a\r\n\r\nyear. That is a very tidy sum. I do not think one can\r\n\r\ndespise  half a million dollars a year.  In  defence,\r\n\r\nall  I  say  is that the amount they have to  pay  is\r\n\r\nreally small, the number of tax payers is large,  and\r\n\r\nthe total sum collected is not negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has asked me to think of ways\r\n\r\nand   means  to  attract  foreign  rich  women   into\r\n\r\nSingapore. I confess I am very startled by  this  pro\r\n\r\nposal.  It  has never occurred to me just how  to  go\r\n\r\nabout this job. If there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolunteers  among the strong, virile  and  attractive\r\n\r\nBackbenchers to help us in this task, I  am  sure  we\r\n\r\nmight  achieve something. The Member for  Delta  said\r\n\r\nthat  our women buy jewellery and perhaps they  might\r\n\r\nbe  induced  to  sell  the jewellery  and  invest  in\r\n\r\nindustry.  I  am  not  a prig in these  matters,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  see no harm in  women  buying  and\r\n\r\nkeeping jewellery. After all, it is a very good hedge\r\n\r\nagainst   inflation.  In  any  event,  where  Finance\r\n\r\nMinisters in poor countries have asked their women to\r\n\r\ndisgorge themselves of their jewellery, they have all\r\n\r\nbeen  singularly  unsuccessful.  So  let  us  console\r\n\r\nourselves  with the thought that our Singapore  women\r\n\r\nbuy  jewellery and use it. Let us hope that they look\r\n\r\nmore   attractive  and  raise  the  morale   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Nee Soon has made what I\r\n\r\nconsider  to be a sober and constructive analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem that faces us. I would like to underline\r\n\r\nsome  of  the points that he has made. The  first  is\r\n\r\nthis.  After  1971,  with the  departure  of  British\r\n\r\nmilitary  protection, we will be  living  in  a  nevi\r\n\r\nworld. I do not think he is exaggerating the position\r\n\r\nwhen he says that it will be a new world and that  in\r\n\r\nthis new world it is as well that we have an adequate\r\n\r\ndefence capability. He also makes what appears to  me\r\n\r\na  very  crucial point, when he says that apart  from\r\n\r\nbuying weapons and training people, we need to instil\r\n\r\ninto the population a strong emotional attachment  to\r\n\r\nthe  country.  I wholeheartedly agree with  him  that\r\n\r\nthis  point must never be overlooked by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Defence,  by the Government, and by  the  general\r\n\r\npopulation. If we ignore this important psychological\r\n\r\nfactor, we do so at our own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the population of Singapore is\r\n\r\nreally of recent migrant origin. Our society does not \r\n\r\nstrike  deep roots into the past. Therefore,  the  natural  \r\n\r\nbasis  of  patriotism which  exists  in  older societies  \r\n\r\ndoes not exist here. In fact,  I  remember reading  the  \r\n\r\neditorial of a local  Chinese  language\r\n\r\nnewspaper   just  before  the  Budget  and   it   was\r\n\r\nspeculating on defence expenditure. The leader\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwriter  made  this point. Although in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  constitution we may be an independent country,\r\n\r\nin  fact we retain a great deal of the colonial  heri\r\n\r\ntage  -  namely, a good proportion of the  population\r\n\r\nlive  in Singapore not as residents of a home but  as\r\n\r\npaying  guests  in a hotel. If there  is  prosperity,\r\n\r\npeople  'enjoy  it. But if there is  adversity,  they\r\n\r\npack  up  and go to another hotel. This unfortunately\r\n\r\nis  true of a good number of Singaporeans, it  is  as\r\n\r\nwell  that we recognise this fact. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nwe  must also admit that among the younger people who\r\n\r\nhave grown up here and are educated here, this strong\r\n\r\nemotional  attachment is developing.  We  should  see\r\n\r\nthat  it develops speedily and strikes deep roots  in\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon is entirely right in saying\r\n\r\nthat  without  security there can be no stable  basis\r\n\r\nfor  investment. In fact, security from  disturbances\r\n\r\nboth from within and from without is an essential pre-requisite to economic growth. He has correctly  noted\r\n\r\nthat  in many developing countries which have  failed\r\n\r\nto  provide  a secure framework of internal  security\r\n\r\nand  defence  against external threat, no development\r\n\r\nof any kind is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock has drawn our attention to\r\n\r\nthe  strong  position of our external  reserves,  the\r\n\r\nlevel  now being some $2,000 million. He has compared\r\n\r\nit  with the reserves of Japan and Thailand. Although\r\n\r\nin  the  aggregate  both these  countries  have  more\r\n\r\nexternal  reserves than ours, in terms of per  capita\r\n\r\nreserves,  ours is between 10 and 15 times  those  of\r\n\r\nThailand  and Japan. I think his figures are correct,\r\n\r\nexcept  that the Japanese have been increasing  their\r\n\r\nreserves  very  fast in the last few months.  He  has\r\n\r\nasked how we compare with European countries. He  may\r\n\r\nbe  interested to know that I have in my Ministry two\r\n\r\nGerman  advisers  who  have been  sent  here  by  the\r\n\r\nInternational   Monetary   Fund.   They   have   done\r\n\r\ncalculations and compared the external per capita  re\r\n\r\nserves of Singapore with those of their ~wn country -\r\n\r\nGermany. As you know,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Deutschesmark is the strongest currency  in  the\r\n\r\nworld. But our per capita reserves are two and a half\r\n\r\ntimes  those of the Germans. So I think, all in  all.\r\n\r\nwe  are  in a good position. Let us always  keep  our\r\n\r\nposition that strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock is entirely right in saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministries  which  are  now  suffering   a\r\n\r\nstandstill  in  their budget allocations  should  not\r\n\r\ndespair.  He has given us some proposals  on  how  to\r\n\r\nraise  income. It is not at all a bad idea. In  fact,\r\n\r\nso  far  as  the Ministry of National Development  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, they are carrying on with a very energetic\r\n\r\nplan  to sell houses to the tenants. In the next  few\r\n\r\nmonths the Housing and Development Board itself  will\r\n\r\nlaunch a very extensive scheme to sell houses to  the\r\n\r\ntenants. That part of his proposal is in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from getting income from various sources, and\r\n\r\nmind  you,  this  sort of thing can be  over-done,  I\r\n\r\nthink there is scope for ingenuity by officials. With\r\n\r\nthe  same  money, if they can think  of  solving  the\r\n\r\nproblems in novel ways, if they can apply their minds\r\n\r\nin  bold and imaginative ways, we can see not  merely\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance  of  existing  standards  but  great\r\n\r\nimprovements  in the standards of services  provided.\r\n\r\nLet  us  hope  that the non-defence  Ministries  will\r\n\r\nregard  this  as a great challenge and  rise  to  the\r\n\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Crawford raised a number of points.\r\n\r\nFirst,  with  regard to the P.U.B, he said  that  the\r\n\r\nP.U.B, has a surplus of $26 million. He thought  that\r\n\r\nif  we had reimposed the fuel tax, which could easily\r\n\r\nget us $12 million, it would not be necessary for  us\r\n\r\nto  have a 10 per cent tax on P.U.B, bills. First  of\r\n\r\nall,  the  trade  surplus of the P.U.B, is  somewhat\r\n\r\ndifferent  from, say, the trade surplus of a  private\r\n\r\ncorporation. Supposing XYZ Company makes $20 million.\r\n\r\nThat  belongs to the company --the directors and  the\r\n\r\nshareholders.  But  when the P.U.B, enjoys  a  trade\r\n\r\nsurplus, all it means is that it will need less money\r\n\r\nfrom the Finance Ministry by way of loans. Therefore,\r\n\r\nin a sense, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  surplus of the P.U.B, helps the Government  in\r\n\r\nthat  we  need  to  give them less  money  for  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure. Therefore, to impose a  fuel\r\n\r\ntax  would mean that in the end, although we get  $12\r\n\r\nmillion from them, we will have to give them back $12\r\n\r\nmillion for their development expenditure. That  does\r\n\r\nnot help us very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, more money for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs!\r\n\r\nOf  course,  no one will argue against the importance\r\n\r\nof having a good diplomatic service, having effective\r\n\r\nmissions abroad which will influence friends and keep\r\n\r\nenemies  at arm's length. We will agree to all  that.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Crawford gave the good example of our\r\n\r\nAmbassador  in Jakarta who put up such  a  brave  and\r\n\r\nresolute show in the face of very acute difficulties.\r\n\r\nWe  have  a  good man there and we have good  men  in\r\n\r\nother missions. But the trouble is that the supply of\r\n\r\ngood, resourceful and perceptive Ambassadors is  very\r\n\r\nlimited.  You may have good men who can  become  good\r\n\r\nAmbassadors,  but they prefer to remain in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  make  money.  After  all,  we  do  not  pay  our\r\n\r\nAmbassadors all that much money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. My\r\n\r\npoint is that the Ministry has no money. That is  the\r\n\r\nreason why we cannot pay them well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have got to pay Ambassadors\r\n\r\naccording  to  the salary scale of the civil  service\r\n\r\nstructure.  If you pay the Permanent Secretary  Grade\r\n\r\nC,  which is about $2,300 all-in a month, you  cannot\r\n\r\npay  the Ambassador $50,000 a month. This is  what  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful businessman is making. Be that as it  may,\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of  top-class  diplomats  is  a  greater\r\n\r\nlimitation  than money. Of course, it takes  time  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  Foreign Ministry. It is  not  merely  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of getting staff and training them: there  is\r\n\r\nthe   further  problem  of  developing  a  tradition,\r\n\r\ninculcating  professional skills and  so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that we struck a wrong balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Ministry  of Foreign  Affairs  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Interior and Defence. I do not  know.\r\n\r\nOf  course, we agree that we have to get on well with\r\n\r\nother  countries. But whereas you can take your  time\r\n\r\nto develop your Foreign Service, you have three years\r\n\r\nonly  to  develop \"the muscles\". That is why  we  are\r\n\r\nspending so much time and putting so much effort into\r\n\r\nour  defence build-up. Of course, what encourages  us\r\n\r\nor should encourage us and should assure other people\r\n\r\nis  the  fact  that it is quite fantastic  to  regard\r\n\r\nSingapore's defence build-up as in any way  offensive\r\n\r\nor  threatening  to  other people,  because,  by  our\r\n\r\nnature, we, as a trading centre, a small island  with\r\n\r\na  small population, above all, value peace, security\r\n\r\nand  stability. Wars and aggression are for countries\r\n\r\nwith  100 or 200 million people. Small countries just\r\n\r\nwant to be left alone to exercise their abilities and\r\n\r\ntheir talents for their own advantage. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nin  this part of the world and in the age in which we\r\n\r\nlive,  we are more likely to achieve these objectives\r\n\r\nand  to  get on well with other countries if  we  are\r\n\r\nrespected rather than if we are despised. So whatever\r\n\r\nthe correct balance may be in the next two years,  it\r\n\r\nis  quite  clear in my mind that we have  to  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  the defence build-up. In the meantime,  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking around for astute, resourceful and perceptive\r\n\r\nambassadors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the financial year 1st January,  1969,\r\n\r\nto 31st March, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"-[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Ten minutes to Eight o'clock p.m</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1968/19681212/19681212-HA-0280201.pdf\"\">Appendix to Mr Speaker's Announcement(Col. 112)(Cols 0201-0204)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
