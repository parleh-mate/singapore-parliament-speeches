Under this particular head of expenditure, I am\r\n\r\nhere to explain why we have put in a vote of $10 million for\r\n\r\nacquisition of private lands for public purposes for the year\r\n\r\n1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the assessment of valuation, I think really he ought to\r\n\r\nconsult his legal adviser. The law on the acquisition of land is\r\n\r\nquite clear. There is at present before a Select Committee of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly a new Land Acquisition Bill some provisions of\r\n\r\nwhich may well have to be altered, or otherwise provisions will\r\n\r\nhave to be made in the constitutional articles relating to\r\n\r\nacquisition of property, to remove any doubt as to the\r\n\r\nconstitutional validity of some of these provisions. I do not\r\n\r\nwish to go into the intricacies of the law on land acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Member ought to know, from the representatives of his Party\r\n\r\non the Select Committee, what is the present position and what\r\n\r\nwe hope to do by an alteration of the law on land acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make\r\n\r\nonly a few comments under this heading. I feel that $10.5\r\n\r\nmillion voted for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nacquisition of land is an over-estimated provision. My  feeling\r\n\r\nis  that  not  so  much should be spent in 1965  because  of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that there are periodical fire sites to be\r\n\r\ncompulsorily acquired, and the Government pays to the land-owners\r\n\r\nonly a small fraction, perhaps 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the\r\n\r\nmarket price of land, and pays to each fire victim a few tens  of\r\n\r\ndollars  as  fire relief at the most. As far as my  memory  goes,\r\n\r\nthere are already four big fires in the past four years, say, one\r\n\r\nfire for each year. If the Government has to pay the market value\r\n\r\nfor these lands, adding to it the cost of removing the squatters,\r\n\r\nthe  inhabitants, and perhaps spend many years in removing  them,\r\n\r\nthen  these lands in the four fire sites will cost the Government\r\n\r\nperhaps many hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the resettlement compensation paid by\r\n\r\nthe  Government to villagers and squatters of lands, through  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board, is much below that paid to squatters  by  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers, perhaps only one-third or half of the market price of\r\n\r\nevicting the squatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that since the Government intends to pass\r\n\r\nits  Land Acquisition Bill which, as the Prime Minister has  just\r\n\r\nindicated, is even subject to certain alterations, the Government\r\n\r\nis  only  required  to pay land-owners a small  fraction  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket price of the land it has compulsorily acquired\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know, under the provisions of the Bill,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government can pay land-owners perhaps even  $500  per\r\n\r\nacre --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The day before, I asked the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister certain questions. He did not give me a reply  and\r\n\r\nthe  other  Ministers were also not able to  give  me  any  satisfactory  reply. This matter concerns a piece of land in  Tampines\r\n\r\n11  milestone  which  has been acquired by  the  Government.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment have mentioned that this piece of land has been sublet\r\n\r\nto others. In fact, there is no proof and --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

He  is\r\n\r\nnot  being  relevant, in the first instance, to the  topic  under\r\n\r\ndiscussion. Will he proceed to some other point relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nissue before the House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I\r\n\r\nwill  dwell  on the question which I have just raised.  I  regret\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister did not give me a reply point by  point.\r\n\r\nInstead he touched on a certain Bill which is now before a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. The Bill is called the Land Acquisition (Amendment No.\r\n\r\n2)  Bill.  I  just want to know how much land the Government  has\r\n\r\nacquired  during the period I have indicated and at what  prices.\r\n\r\nAccording to my knowledge, the land acquired by the Government is\r\n\r\nmostly  private land. I would like to ask whether the  Government\r\n\r\nintends   also   to  acquire  land  belonging  to  the   military\r\n\r\nauthorities,  such as the War Department and the Naval  Base.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the British military authorities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  described as one of the largest landlords in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Government  dare  not touch  a  single  hair  of  these\r\n\r\nauthorities.  Judging  by the vote of $10  million,  if  we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient power to take back all or part of the land occupied by\r\n\r\nthe  military authorities, I believe there will be a great saving\r\n\r\nin  this  vote.  The  saving,  I  think,  can  be  put  to  other\r\n\r\ndevelopment purposes. The Prime Minister dare not give me a  full\r\n\r\nreply to my questions. I think he is afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really\r\n\r\nbewildered. On  the  one hand, I am urged by the Member for Hong Lim to  \r\n\r\ngive more  money  away  to  land-owners.  He  regrets  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nGovernment has been able to acquire fire sites at 20 per cent the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  land.  I do not know what  he  really  wants  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do.  Take  this public money,  give  it  away  to\r\n\r\nlandlords who have fortuitously got their land cleared of tenants\r\n\r\nby  fire,  the burden of rehousing and resettling of  whom  falls\r\n\r\nupon the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I get the Barisan Sosialis Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  saying  that it is a great pity that we  should  acquire\r\n\r\nprivate  land.  I  would have thought that,  being  upholders  of\r\n\r\nsocialism, they would have been against private ownership of  all\r\n\r\nland.  That  is one of the basic tenets. We accept the  facts  of\r\n\r\nlife  as  they are. In so far as we can in our mixed economy,  we\r\n\r\ntry  to mitigate the acquisition of fortuitous wealth by just the\r\n\r\npossession  of land, particularly to prevent people from  getting\r\n\r\nwindfall  gains as a result of public expenditure on development.\r\n\r\nBut  just in case people will accuse the Barisan of lack of \r\n\r\nanti-colonial  fervour, back again we come to military land  holdings.\r\n\r\nThe Member has not read last year's proceedings of how we went to\r\n\r\nLondon and got back over 300 odd acres of land, and got a payment\r\n\r\nmade  of $10 million for use of T.O.L. land which belongs to  the\r\n\r\nState and to which the Army had no title. What does he want us to\r\n\r\ndo?  Take back the Naval Base and close it down? Take back Changi\r\n\r\nAirfield and close it down? What are the facts of life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we really feel that it is wrong to have military bases and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we ought to scrap them and grow vegetables instead  on\r\n\r\nthem? These are dead issues, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say on the amount set aside, $10 million, is that\r\n\r\nit has been set aside for the last few years, and the expenditure\r\n\r\nover the 1960s - 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1964, up to November -  has\r\n\r\nranged  between  $4  million and $8 million, depending  upon  the\r\n\r\nexigencies that arise in the course of these years. Whilst we may\r\n\r\nnot spend the $10 million, I think there is no particular harm in\r\n\r\nmaking  provision for $10 million. I do not know what will happen\r\n\r\nin  1965.  The  estimation is that we shall be acquiring  certain\r\n\r\nparcels  of  land for slum clearance and improvement schemes.  We\r\n\r\nshall  have to meet additional payments after a final  survey  of\r\n\r\nacquired  land.  There are certain contingency  awards  of  legal\r\n\r\ncosts  which will have to be met arising out of the reference  to\r\n\r\ncourt  in  respect  of several objections made  by  owners  under\r\n\r\ncollective awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Panjang, has spoken on behalf of my Party to\r\n\r\nthe  effect  that the Prime Minister should be urged to  save  on\r\n\r\npublic  funds  and acquire more land belonging  to  the  military\r\n\r\nauthorities, so that some of it may be distributed for the use of\r\n\r\nfarmers facing resettlement, so that they will have more land  in\r\n\r\nwhich  to do some farming. This is a good idea in my opinion.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as I know, Mr Speaker, in my own constituency and in  Sembawang constituency, or even in the Nee Soon area, there is a great\r\n\r\ndeal of land occupied by the military authorities. This land  has\r\n\r\nnot  been properly put to use and is deserted. Although there are\r\n\r\nsome squatters scattered about in these areas, one must note that\r\n\r\nthe  quit  rents  paid by the farmers are paid  to  the  military\r\n\r\nauthorities.  This  is unreasonable because  if  we  are  heading\r\n\r\ntowards independence, then this land should be taken back by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and whatever is paid by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmer should be paid into the Government coffers instead of  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  authorities. That means the British are  now  occupying\r\n\r\nour land and taking money from our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great deal of land - a few hundred acres - occupied\r\n\r\nby  the Naval Base, and a few hundred acres also occupied by  the\r\n\r\nWar  Department.  Some of this land is not properly  used  or  is\r\n\r\nnever used at all. So the idea put forward by my colleague  is  a\r\n\r\ngood one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point arises when land is acquired for general\r\n\r\npurposes.  Some farmers in Geylang Serai are faced with  eviction\r\n\r\nand resettlement in Sembawang. In this respect, I notice that the\r\n\r\nland given by the Government to these farmers is insufficient for\r\n\r\ntheir  farming, only about three-quarters of an acre. So  if  the\r\n\r\nfarmer  and  his family were to depend on this bit  of  land,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  enough  for farming. I hope the  Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider this matter and give more attention to the needs of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, if a farmer has to maintain his family by\r\n\r\nfarming  - say, a family of three or four persons - then at  least\r\n\r\nthe  piece of land required should be more than an acre in  area,\r\n\r\notherwise the yield is not sufficient to maintain the farmer  and\r\n\r\nhis family. Production from a small piece of land is far too low,\r\n\r\nand we must give the farmer more land to increase his production.\r\n\r\nIf  you  force  the farmer into the jungle to cultivate  a  small\r\n\r\npiece of land, say, three-quarters --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

But to go on developing the theme of  the\r\n\r\nfarmer, which should have been developed yesterday, is completely\r\n\r\nout of order today. Will the Member please remember that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The other suggestion I wish\r\n\r\nto make is that there are big landowners in Singapore. I hope\r\n\r\nthat the Government, when acquiring land, will not acquire it\r\n\r\nfrom small landowners or small holdings, unless such small\r\n\r\nholdings are actually necessary for development purposes. If it\r\n\r\ncan be avoided, we should not force the small landowners out of\r\n\r\ntheir land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one company in Sembawang Estate which occupies a big\r\n\r\npiece of land. The Government has not taken action to acquire it.\r\n\r\nI  suggest that in case of acquisition, the Government should pay\r\n\r\nmore  attention to big landowners, because it will then bring  in\r\n\r\nmore  profit  for  the people and for the Government.  These  big\r\n\r\nlandowners  will  not  suffer badly from the acquisition  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  rich.  So it is my hope that the Government  will  pay\r\n\r\nattention to what I have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas said just now that after merger he was able to take back some\r\n\r\n300 acres of land from the British. I do not know whether he will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do this in future, that is to say, to get back  more\r\n\r\nland  from  the military authorities. As a matter  of  fact,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu has said that the military authorities  are\r\n\r\noccupying  the  land  of the people of Singapore  for  no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose at all. This is a point worthy of attention. I think  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister cannot deny this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the areas of land occupied by the military\r\n\r\nauthorities,  some bombs may be stored. I do  not  want  this  to\r\n\r\nhappen  because they can always send their bombs back to  England\r\n\r\nfor  safe keeping. Our land should be used for farming and  other\r\n\r\nuses  so that we can save more money on purchase of land. I think\r\n\r\nthis is a good suggestion worthy of Government's attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has just said that we have already acquired 300\r\n\r\nacres of land and we can forget about the rest of it. This is not proper \r\n\r\nbecause,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  a matter of fact, there is still a vast area of land occupied\r\n\r\nby the British military.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, it is a very sad commentary\r\n\r\non  the Opposition - flogging all the dead horses, these issues  of large\r\n\r\nand  vast  tracts  of land being captured by  the  British  armed\r\n\r\nforces, greedily dog-in-the-manger squatting on them. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim  used  to flog this issue  in  every  one  of  our\r\n\r\nsessions. We have gone through all that. In 1963 we went  through\r\n\r\nit  in London before the final terms on Malaysia - every scrap of\r\n\r\nland,  title  to  it,  user being put to. I welcome  any  further\r\n\r\nsuggestions  from  Members of the Opposition  in  regard  to  any\r\n\r\nspecific piece of land which they think the Army is not using but\r\n\r\njust squatting on with a view to denying Singapore its user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind Members opposite that there have\r\n\r\nbeen some fundamental changes in this situation. The problem that\r\n\r\nwill  arise  for us in the next decade is what to do  when  these\r\n\r\nbases  are gradually scrapped away, as they will be in course  of\r\n\r\ntime,  maybe 10 years, maybe 15 years, but certainly  within  the\r\n\r\nnext  two  decades. These are not the problems.  The  problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will still remain - shortage of land. We  are  a  small\r\n\r\nisland  of 224 square miles. We are reclaiming land on  the  east\r\n\r\ncoast;  the whole of the foreshore from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu.  We\r\n\r\nare  also reclaiming land in the Kallang Basin. We are reclaiming\r\n\r\nland  in  Jurong, all the estuaries. We will willingly scrutinise\r\n\r\nany further better ideas which the Opposition can offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to suggest, as the Member for Jalan Kayu did, that we\r\n\r\nshould not acquire land belonging to small landlords - it is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  Barisan  Sosialis philosophy that  small  landlords\r\n\r\nshould  be  protected  and  land  acquired  only  from  the   big\r\n\r\nlandlords. We do not want to acquire land unless we have to,  and\r\n\r\nland  is acquired not whether it belongs to a small or a big landlord,  but  whether that particular area needs certain particular\r\n\r\nfacilities or amenities to be provided for, such as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools, hospitals, roads, circuses, fire brigade, fire stations,\r\n\r\nand  so on. It is irrelevant whether the landlord is a big  or  a\r\n\r\nsmall  one.  I  know the Member for Jalan Kayu considers  himself\r\n\r\nreasonably safe in the definition of \"small landowner\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to give Members this assurance: that the\r\n\r\n$10  million will be disbursed in a business-like manner,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  our duty as the Government to pay more than we have to  when\r\n\r\nwe  acquire land or to give largesse when removing squatters from\r\n\r\nCrown land. We understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that legally we  are\r\n\r\nnot  bound to give anything away when we ask people to  move  out\r\n\r\nfrom  Crown  land. They are people who have squatted,  encumbered\r\n\r\nlands.  The  Member for Bukit Panjang has mentioned the  \r\n\r\ncompensation  paid  as  $300/$400. There are certain  rules  and  \r\n\r\ncertain scales  - the area of the attap huts, fruit trees, and so on and\r\n\r\nso  forth.  This  will  be worked out. We have  never  been  more\r\n\r\ngenerous in the whole of the history of squatter resettlement. We\r\n\r\ntake this as a form of social welfare aid to resettle and rehouse\r\n\r\npeople. But there is a limit. Otherwise we may well and justly be\r\n\r\naccused of encouraging more squatting on Government land for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of extracting or extorting resettlement prices when  the\r\n\r\nland has to be cleared for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these issues have been gone through ad nauseam every\r\n\r\ntime. The problem that still remains is one of insufficient  land\r\n\r\nfor the number of people in this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not pretend to be able to solve the problem of\r\n\r\nagricultural land in Singapore. It is one of those problems which\r\n\r\nare basically insolvable. If we succeed as the industrial base in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, as we may well do in the next decade, then there is  no\r\n\r\nplace  for  either  grazing  land or  agricultural  land  in  the\r\n\r\npopularly  understood  sense  of  that  term.  Singapore  is   an\r\n\r\nindustrial city, and the price of land is being determined on the\r\n\r\nbasis of a developing industrial complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10,500,000 for Head D 01 ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 02 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

In this House on 16th  December,\r\n\r\n1963,  the  Finance Minister also mentioned that we  were  giving\r\n\r\nsome  $30  million per year to North Borneo so that it  would  be\r\n\r\nable to get some 8,000 labourers from Singapore every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister for Finance whether the promise by North\r\n\r\nBorneo to engage workers from Singapore still holds good today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether, at the present juncture, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is continuing negotiations with North Borneo\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to the employment of labourers from  Singapore  and\r\n\r\ntheir terms of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. If the North Borneo Government\r\n\r\nfinally refuses to engage workers from Singapore, why do we  have\r\n\r\na  provision for next year of a loan of $30 million to the  North\r\n\r\nBorneo Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st November, the newspapers reported that Dato Pang Tet\r\n\r\nTshung, the Minister for Social Welfare of Sarawak, said that  he\r\n\r\nwas prepared to go to Taiwan to recruit labour. That being so,  I\r\n\r\nask,  why do we have a provision for next year of a loan  of  $30\r\n\r\nmillion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not speaking on\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  not responsible for what the newspapers report about  what\r\n\r\nMinisters say. I can only inform the Assembly what I know  for  a\r\n\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present position is this. Discussions have taken place\r\n\r\nbetween  officials  of  the  Singapore  Government,  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Sarawak  and Sabah  Governments  over  this\r\n\r\nmatter. The Finance Ministry of the Central Government is  making\r\n\r\na  study  of the Development Plan of the North Borneo territories\r\n\r\nof Sabah and Sarawak to find out how much labour content there is\r\n\r\nin  this Plan; that is to say, if their development proposals are\r\n\r\ncarried  out,  then  how many workers will be involved?  On  that\r\n\r\nbasis,  50 per cent - it may be more or it may be less -  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  they will employ in projects financed by the loans  made\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Singapore  Development  Fund  will  be  engaged  from\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is quite a complicated operation. The Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour  has asked people in the Unemployment Exchange whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  they  were prepared to work in Sabah and Sarawak,  and  just\r\n\r\nover 8,000 persons have said that they were prepared to go there.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Singapore Government is making plans to  establish\r\n\r\nreception  areas in Kuching, Jesselton, Sandakan and I  think  at\r\n\r\none  or  two other points, so that these people who want to  work\r\n\r\nthere  can  be sent there at Government's expense and live  there\r\n\r\nuntil the call for their employment is made. We have agreed  with\r\n\r\nthe Central Government and the Sabah and Sarawak Governments that\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  sending  workers  from  Singapore  to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories and the cost of maintaining them until they find work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  borne by the Singapore Government. If once  they  are\r\n\r\nfound  unsuitable after employment, then the cost of repatriating\r\n\r\nthem  back  to  Singapore will be borne by the Borneo  Government\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, this is a very complicated operation. The\r\n\r\nofficials  of  the  four  Governments  concerned  -  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the Singapore Government and the Sabah  and  Sarawak\r\n\r\nGovernments - are working out the details and I hope that we  can\r\n\r\nreach  an early and satisfactory solution to this problem. If  we\r\n\r\ncan  find  jobs  for 8,000 of our citizens in Sabah  and  Sarawak\r\n\r\nsometime next year, I think this will be a worthwhile achievement\r\n\r\nto  relieve a lot of the distress and enforced idleness among our\r\n\r\nyoung men and women. I do not think that this is too high a price\r\n\r\nfor  extending a $20 million interest-free loan and a $10 million\r\n\r\nloan  with  interest. I am sure - whether we are in the Opposition\r\n\r\nor  in the Government - that all we want to see is that young men\r\n\r\nand  women  who  are unemployed will get an early opportunity  to\r\n\r\nfind useful work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, we\r\n\r\nall  hope that we can solve our unemployment problem. We  are  of\r\n\r\nthe  view  that  the  Government should  solve  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem by solving the financial problem. We are granting a  loan\r\n\r\nto  Sabah and Sarawak, and if they promise to give employment  to\r\n\r\nour  youths,  then it will solve our unemployment  problem  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Prime Minister has said that our loan is tied\r\n\r\nup  with  the  desire  of the Borneo territories  to  employ  our\r\n\r\npeople, but the Minister for Finance has repeatedly said that his\r\n\r\nofficials  have been carrying on negotiations. This seems  to  be\r\n\r\ncontrary to what the Prime Minister has said and the White  Paper\r\n\r\nagreement.  Negotiations have taken place between  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the North Borneo Government,  but  a  Government\r\n\r\nspokesman of the Borneo territories has denied such negotiations.\r\n\r\nIt  is  reported in the newspapers that the Sarawak Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare is going to Formosa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  recruit  labour.  Therefore, we  feel  despondent  over  this\r\n\r\nquestion. We must understand clearly that the loan money  belongs\r\n\r\nto the Singapore Government. According to the Estimates, there is\r\n\r\na deficit of more than $20 million. We have been negotiating with\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank for loans to promote our industrial projects  for\r\n\r\nexample, the Jurong and Pasir Panjang projects - and yet  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  lend money to other people. If the loan is granted  to\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo  and  our people are not recruited  for  employment\r\n\r\nthere, it will be detrimental to the interest of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After merger and Malaysia, we have to contribute $127 million\r\n\r\nto  the  Central Government. This is a great burden to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. If in addition to this we have to grant  a  yearly\r\n\r\nloan  of $30 million to North Borneo without getting anything  in\r\n\r\nreturn,  it  will be a bad deal. We have to look after  ourselves\r\n\r\nfirst.  We hope that the Minister will take a firm stand  by  not\r\n\r\nsacrificing  the interest of the people of Singapore when  making\r\n\r\nthe loan to North Borneo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Government to clarify whether the North Borneo\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed to recruit labour from Singapore.  If  not,\r\n\r\nthe loan must not be granted. This issue is one of the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  White  Paper.  For  the past one  year,  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have been in the dark with regard to the actual  terms\r\n\r\nof  merger.  The Prime Minister is duty bound to reveal  all  the\r\n\r\nfacts. If North Borneo intends to do something detrimental to the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people of Singapore, then we must point  out  to\r\n\r\nher the terms of the White Paper agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you do not know how\r\n\r\npleased  I  am  to say that I absolutely agree with almost  every\r\n\r\nword of the Member for Paya Lebar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

What is the purpose of this  loan?  Has  this\r\n\r\nsomething  to do with the loan (with interest) that we are  going\r\n\r\nto  get from the World Bank for the Johore River Project and  the\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang Power Station Project?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Public Utilities Board is divided\r\n\r\ninto  three  main  service departments:  namely  the  Electricity\r\n\r\nDepartment, the Water Department and the Gas Department.  As  the\r\n\r\npopulation  is growing and the standard of living  is  going  up,\r\n\r\nthere is a continuous increase in the demand for more water, more\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  more gas. As a result, we  have  to  build  new\r\n\r\nstations, to obtain new sources of water and build new plants  to\r\n\r\nmake more gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, the Public Utilities Board has a capital development\r\n\r\nprogramme  of $83.3 million, of which the Electricity  Department\r\n\r\nhas  been  allocated  $52.2 million, the Water  Department  $25.4\r\n\r\nmillion,  and the Gas Department $5.8 million. This rather  large\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure will require finance from  several  sources.\r\n\r\nThere  are three main sources. The first is from the Board's  own\r\n\r\nfund.  It  has  a  surplus in its operating accounts.  The  Board\r\n\r\nitself  expects to finance its development projects to the amount\r\n\r\nof $42 million. We expect to draw on the World Bank loans for our\r\n\r\nelectrical expansion as well as for our water expansion scheme to\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  $20 million. The Government will, therefore,  be\r\n\r\ncalled upon to provide an additional $25 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat  the actual financial position of the P.U.B. is.

Now,  if\r\n\r\nthis  sum of $88 million can help to relieve the increasing  pressure of growing unemployment in Singapore, I say that it is worth\r\n\r\nit.  But  if  this sum of money is going to be wasted,  then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  be made responsible to the  businessmen,  the\r\n\r\nclerks,  the  hawkers, the taxi-drivers and all the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore who have contributed to this big amount of money. After\r\n\r\nall, $88 million is not a small sum. There are three main items:\r\n\r\n$31\u00bd million for industrial development; $30 million for interest\r\n\r\nfree  loan  to Sarawak and Sabah; and a $25 million loan  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board, presumably to complete the $100  million\r\n\r\nPower Station or to start with the new water project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme is a flop. The Government  has  spent\r\n\r\n$54 million up to several months ago. I have received the written\r\n\r\nanswers  to  my questions - and the figure given to  me  was  $54\r\n\r\nmillion  -  which  is  in  addition  to  the  Government's  and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen's investment in the scrap plant, the Jurong  shipyard\r\n\r\nand the other 17 factories. I was told by the Minister that there\r\n\r\nare   19  factories  now  in  production  in  Jurong.  All   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure has cost $100 million. I was told by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  that  in Jurong there were 1,851 people  working  as  at\r\n\r\nAugust  1964. I have worked out the figures. In other words,  for\r\n\r\nevery  million dollar of investment in Jurong, we have only  been\r\n\r\nable to create jobs for 20 persons - $1 million for 20 jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this is additional employment for the\r\n\r\nworking  population in Singapore, it is not so bad.  But  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of the Jurong scrap plant, the jobs created for 483  people\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in the loss of jobs in other parts of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  ban on the export of scrap has resulted in the loss of  much\r\n\r\nemployment  to  those people engaged in scrap collection.  Scrap,\r\n\r\nwhich  used to come to Singapore from Johore, Malacca and as  far\r\n\r\nas  Negri Sembilan, is now directed to Port Swettenham for export\r\n\r\nto  Japan  as  it  fetches  a better net  price  despite  freight\r\n\r\ncharges. Mr Speaker, there are many people involved in the scrap\r\n\r\nbusiness.  They are lorry-drivers, workers and small businessmen.\r\n\r\nAll these people have now lost their jobs. Moreover, very soon, a\r\n\r\npig-iron  and  scrap plant will be built in Prai.  When  this  is\r\n\r\ncompleted,  there  is  little prospect for  the  Singapore  scrap\r\n\r\nplant. Mr Speaker, Sir, I must make clear the difference between\r\n\r\na  scrap plant and a steel mill. A scrap plant costs $10 million.\r\n\r\nWe can have a small one for as little as $2 million, like the one\r\n\r\nin  Bukit Timah. A pig-iron plant costs $50 million. A steel mill\r\n\r\ncan cost anywhere between $500 million and $2,000 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Government is one step above the Lim Yew Hock Government.\r\n\r\nIt is wasting big sums of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  will not be surprised if one day the whole  Jurong Industrial Scheme will be written off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take a few minutes to deal with the\r\n\r\nscheme  in  Jurong  for which we are asked to  vote  another  $25\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  is  the Jurong shipyard on which  more  than  $10\r\n\r\nmillion have been spent. Can the Minister tell us how many  ships\r\n\r\nhave  been  built  so far? I understand that no ships  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  except some small tugboats. This job could have been under\r\n\r\ntaken  by three existing shipyards, Thornycroft, United Engineers\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore Harbour Board. Actually if the Government  is\r\n\r\nmore keen on practical results and the creation of employment and\r\n\r\nless  keen  on propaganda and opening ceremonies, it should  have\r\n\r\nprovided  assistance to existing industries  for  expansion.  The\r\n\r\nscrap  plant  in  Bukit  Timah Road can  be  expanded.  The  ship\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  ship  repairing industries of Thornycroft,  United\r\n\r\nEngineers  and  the Singapore Harbour Board can  be  expanded  to\r\n\r\nprovide an equal number of employment opportunities as the Jurong\r\n\r\nshipyard, and at only a small fraction of the cost. We would  not\r\n\r\nhave  been asked to vote for so much money. These are two of  the\r\n\r\nfew  instances of the Government's hare-brained scheme. After six\r\n\r\nyears  of  effort, the Prime Minister tells us in  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  only  able  to  produce 43  \"pioneer  certificate\"\r\n\r\nfactories with a capacity to employ 6,687 people, when  they  are\r\n\r\nin full production, not when they are operating now. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  most  of  the factories that are given pioneer certificates\r\n\r\nbefore  Malaysia  Day  have not commenced building  but  are  now\r\n\r\nadopting  a  wait-and-see  policy.  They  want  to  see  how  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  confrontation is going to be resolved. They  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  see their factories destroyed either by the possibility\r\n\r\nof  enemy bombs or sabotage. They are also waiting to see whether\r\n\r\nthey  should  be  given Common Market protection by  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment if they set up factories in Jurong. If not, they  will\r\n\r\ngo into the Federation. Although they are given work sites by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, they are not eager to start\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork.  But they must show that they are going to start, otherwise\r\n\r\ntheir  pioneer certificates will be cancelled. The  only  way  to\r\n\r\nkeep  their  pioneer certificates alive is to spend a  couple  of\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  dollars  performing  the  foundation  stone  laying\r\n\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it does not mean that Singapore cannot be\r\n\r\nindustrialised. Monies voted by this Assembly will not  be  lost.\r\n\r\nSingapore   can   be  industrialised  as  Hong  Kong   has   been\r\n\r\nindustrialised. But such success depends on many  factors.  First\r\n\r\nof  all, it depends on the goodwill and connivance of the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  because  it controls and issues pioneer  certificates\r\n\r\nand  offers Common Market protection. As long as Lee Kuan Yew  is\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister,  I am afraid the relationship  between  the\r\n\r\nCentral and the State will not improve --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

He is a more acceptable chap. He stayed clear  from  the\r\n\r\nFederal elections. He has always been taken along as a member  on\r\n\r\nmissions  abroad - Bangkok, Tokyo or the United Nations.

A  change  at\r\n\r\nleast  will  help to prevent further disturbances from occurring,\r\n\r\nwill  help to repair the relationship between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nCentre,  particularly at a time when Singapore is bleeding  white\r\n\r\nunder  Indonesian confrontation. A change in the P.M.I.P.  Mentri\r\n\r\nBesar  of Kelantan has done wonders and there is now more  active\r\n\r\nco-operation  between the Centre and Kelantan. In  the  meantime,\r\n\r\nthe  present  Prime Minister can remain the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nhis  Party, the Mao Tse-tung of Singapore.

This should also cover\r\n\r\nsabotage, particularly when we had reports only yesterday of Indonesian landings in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the relationship with the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  has improved, it is also necessary for the Government\r\n\r\nto  reorganise  the Economic Development Board.  A  programme  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation has to be drafted. Target dates for  completion\r\n\r\nmust  be set. General outlines of the plan of action have  to  be\r\n\r\nlaid  down  and published. I wish to outline briefly the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  the Government's industrialisation programme has failed  and\r\n\r\nwhy  therefore  it is coming back here year after year  for  more\r\n\r\nmoney.  It  is  not  due  to  the  Communists.  If  it  were  so,\r\n\r\nGovernment's industrialisation programme would have succeeded now\r\n\r\nbecause  all  the  Communists have now  been  locked  up  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Neither was it the fault of the Indonesians.  Because\r\n\r\nif  it  were  so,  before Malaysia Day, there was  no  Indonesian\r\n\r\nproblem.  The  Government's industrialisation programme  had  not\r\n\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's industrialisation policy has failed because:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It has no set objectives. The Government works from day to\r\n\r\nday,  on  the  basis of trial and error. There has never  been  a\r\n\r\nmaster plan of industrialisation, because none of the P.A.P.  Ministers have any business or industrial experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.There is no difference between the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard and Lim Yew Hock's Industrial Promotion Board except the\r\n\r\nchange of name --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Good God!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 3. The P.A.P. Government is unrealistic. It\r\n\r\nis  only  keen  on  projects which can  bear  results  on  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda, instead of establishing factories which  can  be  run\r\n\r\nwithout  Government subsidies and providing more jobs per  dollar\r\n\r\nof investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government should concentrate on\r\n\r\nsmall-size and medium-size factories which have provided Hong Kong with\r\n\r\ncountless jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will summarise briefly the steps which Government should take\r\n\r\nonce  its  relationship with the Central Government has improved;\r\n\r\nthat  is,  if  the  Government  intends  to  accept  some  of  my\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Government should find a man of the calibre of Teh\r\n\r\nChiang Wan as he is to the Housing Board -[Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time is up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, confronted by the farrago of nonsense\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Member for Hong Lim, it is difficult for me to  decide\r\n\r\nwhere  to start and where to end. He is like one of the  old  warriors using those mortars where you put in nails, springs and old\r\n\r\nbolts,  and  fire at the target hoping that some damage  will  be\r\n\r\ndone.  Let me just deal with one or two falsehoods. He says there\r\n\r\nis  no difference between the Economic Development Board and  the\r\n\r\nformer Government's Industrial Promotion Board. The difference is\r\n\r\nso  tremendous that I cannot understand how a sane man  can  make\r\n\r\nsuch  a  foolish and reckless statement. The Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  has  got 39 professional officers, engineers,  architects,\r\n\r\nchemical  engineers, accountants and economists. Six of them  are\r\n\r\nexperts  sent by the United Nations, men of international  reputation. The rest are local people. Whereas the Industrial Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  has  not got anybody. Really, they have not  got  anybody.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they were just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstarting. Then he says our industrialisation programme is a flop.\r\n\r\nOf  course, he is entitled to his opinion. One of the reasons  he\r\n\r\nsays  is  that  we have not got Mr Teh Chiang Wan. Members  will\r\n\r\nrecollect that two and a half years ago he said that our  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme was a flop. Now when it is a success, he says it is due\r\n\r\nto  a  genius, Mr Teh Chiang Wan. One does not want  to  detract\r\n\r\nfrom  the excellent work done by this officer, but I think credit\r\n\r\nis  also due to the Government and the Minister concerned in this\r\n\r\neffort. So perhaps in another few years' time the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  will say that the success of the industrialisation programme\r\n\r\nis  due to the genius of Mr Hon Sui Sen, and has got nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo with the effort or the policies of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in my reply in the\r\n\r\nBudget debate, I did point out the errors of these statements  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the steel mill. The Member for Hong Lim was  not  present.  Perhaps I may just be permitted to give briefly  what  the\r\n\r\nfacts are. He says that although some 480 workers are now working\r\n\r\nin  the  steel mill in Jurong, it has not created any  additional\r\n\r\nemployment because about the same number of workers has been  rendered  unemployed  elsewhere.  That  is  absolute  nonsense,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. As I have said the other day, the steel mill  buys\r\n\r\nall  the  scrap  that is available here. In fact, the  supply  of\r\n\r\nlocal  dealers  cannot meet the demand. They are buying  all  the\r\n\r\nscrap  that  is coming from the Federation and the  prices  which\r\n\r\nthey pay are higher, 10 per cent higher than the f.o.b. price  of\r\n\r\nsimilar grades of iron ore in Singapore. The whole thing has been\r\n\r\nentered into the contract of agreement between the steel mill and\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board, and in the event of  differences\r\n\r\nbetween the steel mill and the scrap dealer, there are procedures\r\n\r\nfor arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says the Jurong shipyard is a waste of\r\n\r\ntime.  How many ships have they produced? Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nJurong  shipyard became operational sometime in July  this  year,\r\n\r\nabout four months ago. Does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  expect  any  shipyard to be able to  produce  ships  in  four\r\n\r\nmonths?  They  now have under construction some  small  craft,  a\r\n\r\nwater boat, which the Port Authority of Klang have ordered.  They\r\n\r\nhave  on  the  order books two or three larger  vessels.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  until the very large dry dock which they are  building\r\n\r\nand  which will be able to accommodate oil tankers of up to about\r\n\r\n80,000  tons is completed, business will be less than the  target\r\n\r\nproduction. It takes some time for facilities of the shipyard  to\r\n\r\nbe  completed.  The Member says it is better to  help  the  small\r\n\r\nshipyards  in Singapore and the small boat builders. He  mentions\r\n\r\nThornycroft  and United Engineers, some expatriate companies.  He\r\n\r\nis  not  aware that we have already given assistance to  no  less\r\n\r\nthan  19  local ship builders and boat builders on  the  edge  of\r\n\r\nKallang Park, where it abuts on to the Geylang River. As a result\r\n\r\nof  the facilities that we offer, these small operators have been\r\n\r\nable to increase their activities considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Hong Lim has made any other\r\n\r\nconstructive  comments, nor is there any substance in  the  other\r\n\r\npoints  he has raised. I think we have discussed the question  of\r\n\r\nthe $30 million loan to Sabah and Sarawak and have clarified the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his ratio of $l million for 20 jobs in Jurong, I\r\n\r\nthink  he, being an accountant, knows what the real position  is.\r\n\r\nHe is deliberately trying to mislead and deceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the capital expenditure of $54 million spent on Jurong\r\n\r\ncovers  general development purposes, such as roads,  which  will\r\n\r\nserve the whole area and not merely the 19 industries that are in\r\n\r\nproduction now. The wharves and other facilities will  serve  the\r\n\r\nwhole  area  and these are long-term development facilities,  and\r\n\r\nthey  should not he imputed to the 19 factories that are  now  in\r\n\r\noperation  in Jurong. Considerable sums of money have  also  been\r\n\r\nspent on social services, which is part of Government's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility to provide the residents there. It is completely\r\n\r\nincorrect  to  say that this should be related to the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople employed there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to argue with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance as to whether a $1 million  investment\r\n\r\ncreates jobs for 20, 25 or 35 persons. What we know is that  vast\r\n\r\nsums  of money have been voted year in and year out for the  last\r\n\r\nfour or five years for the Jurong industrial project. And today I\r\n\r\nhave been told that there are only 1,831 people working in the 19\r\n\r\nfactories. Mr Speaker, Sir, surely this figure shows that it  is\r\n\r\na flop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am going to suggest ways and means to bring about an\r\n\r\nindustrial  revolution.  Once relationship  with  the  Centre  is\r\n\r\nimproved,  the Government should find a man, as I have said  just\r\n\r\nnow,  of  the  calibre  of  Teh Chiang Wan  to  master-mind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's industrialisation programme. We cannot eat the  cake\r\n\r\nand still have it, Mr Speaker. In the case of the Housing Board,\r\n\r\nI  am told it is not Mr Teh Chiang Wan or the civil servants who\r\n\r\nshould  get  the credit. It is the Minister. If Mr Hon  Sui  Sen\r\n\r\nstarts it, it is not he who claims credit. It is the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you remember, several days ago we had a\r\n\r\nmagnificent  episode  in  the Victoria Theatre  where  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister dramatically caught a fly and put the whole blame on the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.  He  put  the blame on the  civil  servants  for\r\n\r\nmeandering cows, stray dogs, beggars, flies, and the increase  in\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  Once upon a time Singapore could  claim  to  be  the\r\n\r\ncleanest city in South-East Asia. Now everybody says this is  the\r\n\r\ndirtiest city in South-East Asia, even surpassing Jakarta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this: the key staff of the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  should not be civil servants  but  should  be\r\n\r\nexperienced  industrialists,  cost accountants,  economists,  and\r\n\r\nhankers,  recruited  from  the business  world;  people  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to sever all outside business connections and  dedicate\r\n\r\nthemselves to the country's industrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that a general outline of Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation plan should be worked out and published. So far\r\n\r\nwe  have no plans whatsoever. There should be a complete stop  to\r\n\r\nexperimentation of factories by trial and error, which is such  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of public funds. At present the Government has no  policy.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has no plans. The Government has set no  targets.\r\n\r\nIt does not know what it is doing. Where are we heading for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is this: a full list of all products which can\r\n\r\nbe  profitably  produced in Singapore should  be  worked  out  in\r\n\r\ndetail  and published. Last time the Government published details\r\n\r\nof  three  types  of products, hoping to solve Singapore's  acute\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem - generators, fire crackers,  and  mosquito\r\n\r\nkillers. These products are not practical. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nfar as I know, no factory in Singapore has taken the cue from the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point: Government should give liberal loans to\r\n\r\nsmall-scale  and medium-scale enterprises. I understand that at present\r\n\r\nit is very hard for them to get loans from Government unless they\r\n\r\nhave  special connections. Mr Speaker, Sir, the only factory  to\r\n\r\nget  a  liberal loan was, I understand, the ship-breaking factory\r\n\r\nwhich  Government  helped with 2\u00bd per cent interest.  There  have\r\n\r\nbeen  complaints from other factories that it is  very  difficult\r\n\r\nfor them to get loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all this difficulty about\r\n\r\ngetting loans\r\n\r\na  string  of falsehoods and stupidity. Every week the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board considers loan applications, and, speaking from\r\n\r\nmemory, subject to verification, I think the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  is committed to lending something like $35 million. It  is\r\n\r\nreally tedious to listen to all these falsehoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this point about a list of products. The Member says we do\r\n\r\nnot have a list of products. We have a list of products. They are\r\n\r\ncalled Study Papers. Dozens of Study Papers have been produced by\r\n\r\nthe Economic Development Board. They are not published   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Straits  Times  because  nobody  generally   is\r\n\r\ninterested  in them. But they are circulated to manufacturers  in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  fields. As for electrical  products,  he  says\r\n\r\nnobody  is taking the matter up. It has been taken up by  two  or\r\n\r\nthree firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On relationship with the Centre, his main thesis is this, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that in the administration of the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\ncommon  market and general industrialisation policy, the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment will not observe good faith. That is the basis of  his\r\n\r\nwhole  argument the Federal Government will go out of its way  to\r\n\r\ndo  in Singapore. If that were to happen, it would be not only  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of our industries not going up, but the whole of Malaysia\r\n\r\nmight  break up. I cannot see under what circumstances people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are going to put up with a Central Government that acts\r\n\r\nin  bad  faith.  But  until that is shown, I think  it  would  be\r\n\r\nutterly  wrong  for  the  Member for Hong  Lim  to  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that the Federal Government is acting in bad faith. We\r\n\r\nhave  had  many  discussions  over  concrete  issues  on  various\r\n\r\nmatters,  and  we  have found that they acted in a  business-like\r\n\r\nmanner  and in good faith. I have no reason at all to  doubt  the\r\n\r\nfaith  of  the  Federal  Government  in  matters  connected  with\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for Jurong, the Member for Hong Lim says 1,800 workers\r\n\r\nemployed  in  six  years. I did make the  point  that  the  first\r\n\r\nfactory went into production on 31st January this year, and  that\r\n\r\nthe  1,800  workers was the count made in August.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  now  will have exceeded 2,000. In addition to that,  there\r\n\r\nare 2,600 workers engaged in various construction works in Jurong\r\n\r\n-  factories, housing, new roads, and so on. So if the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim still believes this is a flop, then, of course,  he  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to  his own opinion. He cannot expect  many  people  to\r\n\r\nagree with him on that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really surprised that a\r\n\r\npublic accountant who is a Member of this Assembly could come  to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that the success of any organisation,  like  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board or the Economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, could depend solely on the efforts of one man.\r\n\r\nNo  one has claimed that the success of the Housing Board is  his\r\n\r\nown  solo  effort, except the Member for Hong Lim, who  now  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  Housing  Board is a success,  when  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has said that two years ago the Member for Hong Lim  said\r\n\r\nit  was a flop.

Mr Teh Chiang Wan, Mr Ng Chee Seng, and a few other senior\r\n\r\noflicers  were brought by him into the Housing Board to help  him\r\n\r\nbuild  houses and run the S.I.T. What happened? They made a  mess\r\n\r\nof  it. The only one who is now left there is Mr Teh Chiang Wan.\r\n\r\nThe  Member had a good man there but he did not know how to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  him. As for the others, Mr Ng Chee Seng was the manager\r\n\r\nunder  him. He was the chairman, Mr Ng Chee Seng was the  No.  1\r\n\r\nman,  and  Mr Teh Chiang Wan was No. 2 man. When the  Board  was\r\n\r\nreorganised,  his  friends  and  all  his  minions   were   found\r\n\r\nunsuitable.  We  took them out. We only retained  those  whom  we\r\n\r\nthink  can  work. And we work as a team. So the  success  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board is not due to the efforts of his picking out people\r\n\r\nwhom  he  cannot use, but is the result of the work of a team  of\r\n\r\nyoung and very dedicated workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says that the Government has got no\r\n\r\nlong-term  plans  or long-term industrialisation programmes,  and\r\n\r\nthat what we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing  is by trial and error.

Now I have  to\r\n\r\nraise  again the same questions because the past shortcomings  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education are still existing today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various items on page 16 of the Development Estimates\r\n\r\nfrom which we can see that the Government is making many plans to\r\n\r\nbuild  primary schools and secondary schools. There are academic,\r\n\r\nvocational,  technical and commercial types of schools.  However,\r\n\r\nsome  schemes  which  were started in  1960  have  not  yet  been\r\n\r\ncompleted up till now. We are now talking about the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates for 1965. A period  of  five  years  has\r\n\r\nelapsed since the scheme was first mooted. There are three  items\r\n\r\nunder  subhead 002. They refer to secondary technical schools  at\r\n\r\nDunearn  Road, Ngee Ann Kongsi, and Serangoon Garden; $40,000  is\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the Ngee Ann Kongsi vote to complete  the  school.\r\n\r\nDoes  this  reflect on the efficiency of Ngee Ann Kongsi  or  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education? Or does it mean that the sum allotted  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough? Where in one year the vote is not spent then in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  year  the same sum will be voted again  for  the  same\r\n\r\nproject.  What sort of plan is this? Many schemes of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education are useless. Their purpose is to serve as ornaments.\r\n\r\nThey  want to show others that Singapore is very progressive  and\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Education is being responsible in wanting to\r\n\r\nspend a lot of money on various projects. I would like to give  a\r\n\r\npoint-by-point  criticism  of the various  items  of  expenditure\r\n\r\nwhich are asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, under subhead 003, there is provision for\r\n\r\nbuilding a school called Wallich Street Primary School. The  idea\r\n\r\nto  build such a school was started in 1961. But up till  now  it\r\n\r\nhas not yet been completed. Last year the Assembly voted $379,000\r\n\r\nfor  a  secondary  academic school at Jalan  Eunos,  Kaki  Bukit.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this vote was not used at all. In the 1965  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  a  sum  of $421,000 is required for  this  particular\r\n\r\nschool. Last year, there was a plan for another school, but  this\r\n\r\nyear, this item has disappeared. This refers to the school in the\r\n\r\nNew  Market area. According to my understanding, nothing has been\r\n\r\ndone about it. Work has never been started on it. I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer  especially to the proposed academic school  under  subhead\r\n\r\n003,  item  002. The sum which was allocated to build a secondary\r\n\r\nacademic  school at Jalan Eunos, Kaki Bukit, has not  been  used.\r\n\r\nUnder  subhead  004, there are three secondary  academic  schools\r\n\r\nwhich  have  not yet been completed. In the 1963 school  building\r\n\r\nprogramme,  which now appears under subhead 005, item 002,  there\r\n\r\nwere 3 secondary academic schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposed  to  be  built and which have not yet  been  completed\r\n\r\naccording  to plan. These various votes which have been  approved\r\n\r\nin  the  past involve a big sum of money. However, they have  not\r\n\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, I remember the Minister for Education asked\r\n\r\nthis  House to approve a supplementary vote because 6,000 pupils\r\n\r\nwere trying to enter academic secondary schools. There was a lack\r\n\r\nof  accommodation. Other types of school buildings - technical\r\n\r\nand  vocational schools - have had to be used to accommodate such\r\n\r\nstudents.  But judging from this programme here, if the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhad  been able to complete their building plans, there would  not\r\n\r\nhave been a lack of accommodation at the moment. The outcome  now\r\n\r\nis  that many pupils who left the primary schools were unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  places  in  the secondary schools. I am referring  to the\r\n\r\n6,000  pupils  who  were  unable to join the  secondary  academic\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remember in the past the Assembly approved a vote for the\r\n\r\nbuilding of schools just for this purpose. However, many  schools\r\n\r\nhave  not  yet  been  completed. The main  reason  is  this.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has never made full use of the money. I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow what is the factor which has contributed to this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nProvisions  for various projects covering a period of five  years\r\n\r\nhave  been allotted to the Ministry of Education. Are they  being\r\n\r\nused?  We  have  already  approved a vote  for  the  building  of\r\n\r\nschools.  However,  the  Ministry of Education  is  not  able  to\r\n\r\ncomplete the project. This shows that the Ministry is not able to\r\n\r\ncarry it out, it has not been making full use of the money.\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  these three secondary technical schools  are  the\r\n\r\nDunearn  Hill  Secondary  Technical School,  the  Balestier  Hill\r\n\r\nSecondary  Technical  School and the Serangoon  Garden  Secondary\r\n\r\nTechnical  School. The construction work of these  three  schools\r\n\r\nhas  already  been  completed, except an assembly  hall  for  the\r\n\r\nDunearn Hill Secondary Technical School. Both the Balestier  Hill\r\n\r\nSecondary  Technical  School and the Serangoon  Garden  Technical\r\n\r\nSchool  are  now already functioning and the media of instruction\r\n\r\nare Chinese and English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Thomson also mentioned Wallich School which\r\n\r\nis included in the 1961 school building programme. The difficulty\r\n\r\nhere is that the site is under-sized and therefore it requires  a\r\n\r\nspecial  non-standard size plan. Then when a special plan  for  a\r\n\r\nschool  in  this  particular area was prepared, work  had  to  be\r\n\r\nstopped  at  the request of the Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nwhich was then considering including this particular school  site\r\n\r\nin  the  Urban  Redevelopment  Plan.  However,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development has now agreed not to raise any  objections\r\n\r\nto  the  construction of the school and work  will  proceed  very\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Thomson also mentioned several other\r\n\r\nacademic  schools which were included in the 1961, 1962 and  1963\r\n\r\nplans, but were not completed to date. There are good reasons  in\r\n\r\neach  one of these. In the case of the secondary academic  school\r\n\r\nat  Jalan  Eunos,  Kaki  Bukit, more than  56  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction work has so far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  completed and the building is expected to be ready  early\r\n\r\n1965. Then in the case of the secondary technical school at Upper\r\n\r\nAljunied Road, more than 70 per cent of the construction work has\r\n\r\nalready been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the three academic schools provided for under subhead 004,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  at  Still Road, Queenstown 3 and Whitley  Road/Dunearn\r\n\r\nRoad  junction. All these three schools are in various stages  of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  In  the case of the Still Road  and  Queenstown  3\r\n\r\nsecondary  academic  schools,  more  than  70  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction work has been completed. In the case of the  Whitley\r\n\r\nRoad/Dunearn Road junction secondary academic school, 65 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the  work  has been completed. As I have said just  now,  the\r\n\r\ndelay  is  due principally to the difficulty of land acquisition,\r\n\r\ndifficulty of finding a suitable school site, and having found  a\r\n\r\nsuitable school site, the difficulty connected with clearance  of\r\n\r\nsquatters, and they the Barisan Sosialis are the persons who make\r\n\r\nthe clearance of squatters doubly difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although there are difficulties and delays in\r\n\r\nwork which cannot be helped, nevertheless, the important point is\r\n\r\nwhether  every  child of school-going age can  find  a  place  in\r\n\r\nschool.  If  no child of school-going age is denied  a  place  in\r\n\r\nschool, then I say we have succeeded. For the last five years  we\r\n\r\nhave  been able to admit every child of school-going age. To that\r\n\r\nextent, Mr Speaker, Sir, I say our school building programme has\r\n\r\nnot failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to differ with the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education that the yardstick  of  success  in  our\r\n\r\nschool building programme is whether every child gets a place  in\r\n\r\nschool  or not. Mr Speaker, Sir, if we extend school classes  to\r\n\r\n24 hours a day, I think there is no need to build schools at all.\r\n\r\nWe  can  still accommodate all children in schools. Now, we  have\r\n\r\ntwo  sessions.  If we fail in our school expansion programme,  we\r\n\r\ncan  stretch  it  to  three  sessions for  one  school.  But  the\r\n\r\nimportant  point  is  this.  Schools  are  built  not   only   to\r\n\r\naccommodate children, but they are also built in order to provide\r\n\r\ntraining in industrialisation, which is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  of  our main objectives. That is why, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nsupported the Government when they voted to build more vocational\r\n\r\nschools  and  technical schools in the earlier  Budgets - in  1960,\r\n\r\n1961,  1962,  1963 and 1964 - where provisions were made  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of vocational and technical schools. These  schools\r\n\r\nwill  complement the Polytechnic to produce technicians,  masons,\r\n\r\ncarpenters,  bricklayers, whom the Polytechnic does not  produce.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, in a colonial country technicians are not  required\r\n\r\nbecause  a  colonial  country does not require industrialisation.\r\n\r\nBut  since Singapore from the time of the Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\nonwards  is  supposed  to have entered the phase  of  industrialisation,  we  must have more technical schools. It is  because  of\r\n\r\nthis  objective that the Lim Yew Hock Government has set  up  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Promotion  Board,  established  the  Singapore   Poly\r\n\r\ntechnic,  built industrial estates and started building technical\r\n\r\nschools.  Whichever government that comes to power will  have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with the industrialisation of Singapore. This  is  the\r\n\r\npattern of economic progress in all developing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation has become the yardstick of economic progress\r\n\r\nand  the expression of economic nationalism. An industrial estate\r\n\r\nis  a waste of money unless there are factories. A factory has to\r\n\r\nhe  operated  by  technicians. It is the task  of  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  to build technical schools to supply these technicians.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation  can never be achieved  if  a  country  has  to\r\n\r\ndepend  forever  on foreign technicians. China would  never  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  produce an atomic bomb if it  had  to  depend  on\r\n\r\nforeign  technicians.  The Education Ministry  must  prepare  and\r\n\r\npublish  a  blue  print to replace all foreign  technicians  with\r\n\r\nlocal technicians in the space of five years. I do not think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has such a plan. If it has, it has not published  it.\r\n\r\nIt  is  very  disheartening  to see industrial  progress  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry so slow, crawling like a snail. Mr Speaker, Sir, imagine\r\n\r\nstarting  to  build  schools  in 1960  and  they  have  not  been\r\n\r\ncompleted yet! Hong Kong and Eastern\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralia  are examples of countries which have achieved  their\r\n\r\nindustrial breakthrough in less than six years, the time given to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government. The unquestionable supply of technicians\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the  basic conditions to bring about  an  industrial\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Polytechnic has not been expanded. The\r\n\r\ntechnical  colleges have not been built. The Government  announce\r\n\r\ngigantic  plans from year to year to build technical schools.  In\r\n\r\nmy opinion, I do not think any has been completed so far. One was\r\n\r\nannounced  this morning to have been completed.  It  was  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times this morning, Sir, in page 4, under  the  caption,\r\n\r\n\"The  Government  spending $18 million on 41 new  schools.\"  They\r\n\r\nannounced  that  one  technical  school  had  been  completed  in\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  I  wonder whether it was completed this  morning  or\r\n\r\nlast  night. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think even the Queenstown\r\n\r\nTechnical  School which was announced this morning to  have  been\r\n\r\ncompleted  has  been  completed, because  there  was  no  opening\r\n\r\nceremony.  To soften the weight of the Opposition attack  on  the\r\n\r\ncomplete  failure  of the P.A.P.'s school-building  programme  in\r\n\r\ntoday's  Budget  debate on schools, the Government  announced  in\r\n\r\nthis  morning's  papers of a $40 million plan to  build  so  many\r\n\r\nschools. Why do the Government not wait for a few hours more  and\r\n\r\ntell the Assembly this plan? Mr Speaker, Sir, it is like hitting\r\n\r\nbelow the belt. It is an insult to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the 1965 Budget we see everything very clearly. A\r\n\r\ntechnical  school  started in 1961 is still  not  completed.  Two\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools started in 1962 have still a long  way  to  go\r\n\r\nbefore they are completed. Two technical schools for which  money\r\n\r\nwas  provided  in the 1963 Budget have not even got started.  Two\r\n\r\ntechnical schools due to he started in 1963 have not even got the\r\n\r\nplans.  From  1961 to 1964, seven technical schools  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed. Even if we accept that the Queenstown  Technical\r\n\r\nSchool  was completed, according to today's Straits Times,  there\r\n\r\nare still six behind time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not only in the technical schools section\r\n\r\nthat  the Government's school construction programme is  a  flop.\r\n\r\nThe  whole  school building programme is a flop.  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nsimple.  There are no plans, no organisation, no Teh Chiang  Wans\r\n\r\nto carry out the school construction programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing Board also faces the same\r\n\r\ndifficulties as the Minister for Education has outlined just now.\r\n\r\nSquatters'  problem, availability of site. They have  got  50,000\r\n\r\nunits  of  houses to build, not seven schools, Sir. There  is  no\r\n\r\nharm.  Put  the  blame  on the P.W.D.! Before  the  elections,  I\r\n\r\nremember  the  Housing  Board under Teh  Chiang  Wan  built  some\r\n\r\nschools  for the Ministry of Education. That is why I  have  said\r\n\r\nthat so long as Teh Chiang Wan is there, houses will be built, no\r\n\r\nmatter  who  is appointed to be Minister in charge of Housing  or\r\n\r\nwhoever is appointed to be Chairman of the Housing Board,  though\r\n\r\nhe  might  be a nincompoop who does not understand the difference\r\n\r\nbetween  a  brick  and a stone. Since 1961, we have  primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools the building of which has either not started or\r\n\r\nhas not been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Budget, all the primary and secondary schools\r\n\r\nin  the  1962, 1963 and 1964 school-building programmes have  not\r\n\r\nyet been completed. Before the elections, the Government promised\r\n\r\nfree  secondary  education. How can we have free secondary  educa\r\n\r\ntion  when  there are not enough secondary schools? Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this is another of the P.A.P.'s broken promises. I ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not to make more excuses when it comes back next  year\r\n\r\nfor  the  1966 Budget, but immediately to obtain the services  of\r\n\r\nMr  Teh  Chiang  Wan to organise a breakthrough in  the \r\n\r\nschool-building programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are solemn promises to the electorate which the\r\n\r\nGovernment   must  fulfil.  Altogether  there  are  53   primary,\r\n\r\nsecondary, vocational, and technical schools which the Government\r\n\r\npromised to build for the people before 1964. Unless this backlog\r\n\r\nof schools is cleared -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of  them started as early as 1960 - how can the  Government\r\n\r\nstart planning for the 19 secondary schools which\r\n\r\nthey have asked to be provided in the 1965 budget?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just now the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education, in answering my questions, made some  excuses  to\r\n\r\ncover  up his mistakes. He talked about the reasons for the delay\r\n\r\nin  the  school building programmes for 1961-62-63. He also  said\r\n\r\nthat   it  was  because  of  difficulties  in  land  acquisition,\r\n\r\nclearance of squatters, and, in particular, he mentioned that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis was trying to put difficulties in  his  way.  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  him  to  point out the areas  where  we  have  put  up\r\n\r\ndifficulties  to  cause a delay in the school-building  programme\r\n\r\nfor Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the difficulties mentioned are not\r\n\r\ninsuperable.  The real reason is that the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nis  not  too clever. He is not realistic in drafting the  \r\n\r\nschool-building  programme.  They tried to build a  ship  behind  closed\r\n\r\ndoors.  They  found an unsuitable place. It is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof the Minister concerned to know where to find vacant places for\r\n\r\nschool  buildings. They may say that they want to build a  school\r\n\r\nin  the Clifford Pier or Asia Building area. If they cannot, then\r\n\r\nthey  will  say that they are not able to get any land.  So  they\r\n\r\nhave  no  time  to find out where they could get available  land.\r\n\r\nThey are trying to bluff the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no difficulties that cannot be surmounted. No excuse\r\n\r\ncan  be given for failure to build a school in five years. No one\r\n\r\nwill ever believe this excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about land, its acquisition and the clearance of\r\n\r\nsquatters,  the Minister tried to put the blame on the  squatters\r\n\r\non   the  land  to  be  acquired  for  development.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nunreasonable to put the blame on others. I can give  you  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple and clear example. I think I have mentioned it last  night\r\n\r\nin  this  House. It is about the Chi Hua Chinese  School  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  I  found  that  the Government  had  no  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nclearing the squatters in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  squatters  were occupying the land near  the  school,  and\r\n\r\nunder  the development programme of Toa Payoh, the school had  to\r\n\r\ngive  way to this development. The school was asked to move  away\r\n\r\nfrom this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to another matter, i.e., if the Government has a\r\n\r\nplan  to build a school and that plan is found not realistic,  if\r\n\r\nthe Government is not able to build enough schools to accommodate\r\n\r\nall  the students. On the other hand, the Government tries to  do\r\n\r\naway  with  some of the existing schools apart from the  Chi  Hua\r\n\r\nChinese School which has been in existence for a long time. There\r\n\r\nare  some  other  cases.  Sometime  this  year  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  had  to do away with a school in the Joo  Chiat  area.\r\n\r\nThis  was  the Min Yee School. For no reason at all, it  was  done\r\n\r\naway with. The directors and governors of the school --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member is in great danger of\r\n\r\ngetting back to yesterday's debate. Will he keep that in mind and\r\n\r\ncome back to the subject before the House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was just trying to\r\n\r\ndraw  an analogy to show how and why the Government is unable  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  school-building programme. On the one  hand,  some\r\n\r\nschools  were  put out of existence. On the other hand,  the  Government  has not been able to build any new schools. This closely\r\n\r\nties up with the development programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about Min Yee School in Joo Chiat, I think sometime in\r\n\r\nAugust  or September, a notice was given to the school  to  close\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member can\r\n\r\nshow  that  the  closing  down  of  schools  will  advance  his\r\n\r\narguments  on  the topic under discussion, then  he  will  be  in\r\n\r\norder.  But  if he is going into the merits and demerits  of  the\r\n\r\nclosing  clown  of  schools, then he will be  completely  out  of\r\n\r\norder, and I shall stop him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There is one other school, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, which was closed down last year or the year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore.  This was Chung Kuok School in the neighbourhood  of  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital.  The Government promised  to  accommodate  the\r\n\r\nstudents of the school in another school nearby. So it called  up\r\n\r\nthe  governors of this school and said that the students had been\r\n\r\noccupying the Government school building for one year and if they\r\n\r\nwere  unable  to provide alternative accommodation  for  the  students,  then  the students would have to be transferred  to  some\r\n\r\nintegrated schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned three cases of schools having to close\r\n\r\ndown.  This  is  to show a contrast that, on the  one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not completed its school-building programme  and,\r\n\r\non the other hand, schools are being closed down so that students\r\n\r\nof  these  schools  are  absorbed into  Government  schools.  The\r\n\r\nshortage  of schools has therefore become acute. This is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious mistake made by the Minister for Education. He should not\r\n\r\ntry  to  bring  extraneous matters into the education  field  and\r\n\r\nshould not try to give excuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not wish to\r\n\r\ngo further into these allegations of our failure to carry out our\r\n\r\nschool-building programme. I have already said just now that  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties lie in land acquisition and in looking for  suitable\r\n\r\nland, it is difficult to find vacant space in the city to  build\r\n\r\nschools.  This  is  well known to all. Even if  you  can  find  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  plot  of  land, it will take some time  to  acquire  it\r\n\r\nbecause  you  will have to bargain over the price. And  when  the\r\n\r\ndeal  is  concluded, it will still require some time  to  put  up\r\n\r\nplans and to survey. Even after the land has been acquired, there\r\n\r\nmay be squatters on the land. And to clear them will require more\r\n\r\ntime. So it is not that we do not want to build schools according\r\n\r\nto  schedule, but because of difficulties beyond our control.  In\r\n\r\nspite  of that, I have already said that up to date we have built\r\n\r\nenough  schools  to accommodate every child of school-going  age.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no child of school-going age who is denied a place  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has said just now that if we wanted to\r\n\r\nfind more accommodation, we could extend the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  for  schooling. Instead of having two sessions, we  could\r\n\r\nhave  three  sessions,  or even have classes  at  night.  He  has\r\n\r\nsuggested that we should have three sessions instead of  two.  He\r\n\r\nhas  also  said that if this were done, then we could  have  more\r\n\r\naccommodation.  I want him to give one instance  where  a  school\r\n\r\nruns three sessions in Singapore. Otherwise his suggestion is far\r\n\r\ntoo  fantastic.  As  a matter of fact, there is  no  shortage  of\r\n\r\nschool accommodation. In fact, we have more than enough. In  some\r\n\r\nrural areas there are vacancies in primary schools, so the use of\r\n\r\nthe  school building is enough for the morning session. There  is\r\n\r\nno  need to run afternoon classes because of the vacancies in the\r\n\r\nmorning session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim then said that some technical and\r\n\r\nvocational  schools were not completed according to  schedule.  I\r\n\r\nhave  already  pointed  out the difficulties,  and  I  have  also\r\n\r\npointed out that the majority of technical and vocational schools\r\n\r\nwere completed, some by 70 per cent and some by 50 per cent,  and\r\n\r\nsome  have  already been opened. Yet he said that none  has  been\r\n\r\nopened. If he is not day-dreaming, I do not know what it  is.  He\r\n\r\nalso  said  that  in Queenstown there was one  technical  school\r\n\r\nwhich was not completed although a newspaper reported that it was\r\n\r\nopened. In fact, if he is not day-dreaming, I can tell him that I\r\n\r\nmyself opened that school. I officiated at the opening ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then referred to a news item in the Straits Times of today\r\n\r\nabout  Government's intention to spend so much money on  building\r\n\r\nschools.  He  complained that this was given to the Press  before\r\n\r\nthe Assembly convened. Mr Speaker, this news was not released by\r\n\r\nme  and I did not instruct anyone to give such information to the\r\n\r\nPress   and  I  will  not  be  held  responsible.  But   whatever\r\n\r\nconstruction  work that the Government is doing  should  be  made\r\n\r\nknown to the public. I should bring this point to your attention.\r\n\r\nSo  there is nothing wrong for the Government to tell the  people\r\n\r\nwhat it is doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Hong Lim also said just now that if\r\n\r\nSingapore  wanted to succeed in its industrialisation  programme,\r\n\r\nthen we should train more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical personnel. No one quarrels with him on this point. This\r\n\r\nis  precisely  what the Government appreciates and is  doing.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that to bring industrialisation to a successful conclusion,\r\n\r\nwe must have more technical personnel. That is why we are putting\r\n\r\nup so many technical and vocational schools under the first\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan.  It  is  all  very clear, as  we  can  see  from  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  We have plans to put up vocational and technical  and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, without realising the importance of trained and skilled\r\n\r\npersonnel,  how  would one expect the Government  to  incorporate\r\n\r\nsuch plans in the first Five-Year Plan? We would not have put  up\r\n\r\nour programme for so many technical and vocational schools if  we\r\n\r\nhad  not appreciated its importance. As a matter of fact, in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary vocational, and technical schools, there are more  than\r\n\r\nenough  vacancies to meet the demand of students. Not only  that,\r\n\r\nwe  also  have plans under way to expand our Vocational  Training\r\n\r\nInstitute. We intend to put in a vote of $2 million to expand the\r\n\r\nVocational  Institute with a view to training more technical  and\r\n\r\nskilled labour to meet our industrial requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson just now said something about Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\nHe  mentioned this yesterday and he is still mentioning it today.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that we closed down Chi Hua Chinese School because  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board wanted to acquire the land on which\r\n\r\nthe  school  stood,  and the school was asked  to  move  away  to\r\n\r\nanother  school. Mr Speaker, we have built a new school  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  of  this particular school. It  is  known  as  the\r\n\r\nBalestier Hill West School. The idea is to absorb students of Chi\r\n\r\nHua  Chinese School and of other neighbouring schools  into  this\r\n\r\nschool. If the residents of Toa Payoh, on the other hand, have to\r\n\r\nmove  away from this area to some other places, then some of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  may not be able to go to the neighbouring schools  that\r\n\r\nwe  have built. In that case, we are prepared to find alternative\r\n\r\nschools for these students. We have tried as far as possible,  to\r\n\r\nput  them  in schools nearest to their homes. There is no  single\r\n\r\nschool student who is forced out of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool because of the Government's land acquisition programme  in\r\n\r\nToa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also mentioned the Chung Kuok School\r\n\r\nnear the General Hospital. He said the Government was responsible\r\n\r\nfor  closing  it down. He said that we forced the school  out  of\r\n\r\nexistence  with the intention of absorbing it into the Government\r\n\r\nSilat  Road School. As a matter of fact, two or three months  ago\r\n\r\nthe directors of this school wrote me a letter - to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education, to put it more precisely - asking the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\ntake  over  this  particular school. The  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nthought it was a good idea, because there was already a school in\r\n\r\nSilat  Road, which has enough accommodation to start  classes  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  stream.  So  we met the request  of  the  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors of this school and we shouldered our responsibility. As\r\n\r\na  result,  Silat  Road School will become an  integrated  school\r\n\r\ncatering for Tamil, Chinese and English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in planning the building of schools, all that we\r\n\r\ncan do is to estimate how many schools we should build every year\r\n\r\nto  meet  the requirements and demands, and how many  schools  of\r\n\r\nwhat type should be built to absorb the increasing student population.  It  is  impossible for us to look after the  land  of  the\r\n\r\nschool  at  the same time, in the Development Estimates  we  have\r\n\r\nplans to build certain schools, and once the vote is approved, we\r\n\r\nhave  to start looking for school sites. I have already said that\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, particularly in the city area, it is difficult  to\r\n\r\nfind land to build schools. In spite of that we have been able to\r\n\r\nmeet the demands of parents by building enough schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Although plans have been drawn up, the schools  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  built  in  accordance with  actual  requirements.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education has said just now that there  is  enough\r\n\r\naccommodation in the schools for all the pupils. From what he has\r\n\r\nsaid,  we can also see that the building plans had not been based\r\n\r\non actual needs. Had it been so, there would not have been pupils\r\n\r\naccommodated in other types of schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to stress is that the Minister for Education is\r\n\r\nsomewhat  exaggerating the sum to be voted for school  buildings.\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude on the Minister's part is not quite proper. Now,\r\n\r\nlook  at  subhead  018 of Head D 04, relating  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational Institute at Balestier Road. We see that the 1964 vote\r\n\r\nwas  $84,000 for this particular item in respect of furniture and\r\n\r\nequipment for this school. But we see that not one cent has  been\r\n\r\nspent.  Also, under subhead 019 and subhead 020, there  are  some\r\n\r\ncontradictions.  Subhead 019 - \"Teachers'  Training  College\"  is\r\n\r\nmeant  to  complete the building scheme, but so far not a  single\r\n\r\ncent  has  been used from the $750,000 entered in last year's  Development  Estimates. And now there is a new item of  expenditure\r\n\r\nunder  subhead  020  \"Second Teachers'  Training  College  (First\r\n\r\nPhase)\".  In this case, last year's vote was $1,000,000 but  this\r\n\r\nmoney  has not been used at all and the Government wants  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor some more money! What is the actual situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a single cent has been used from the past year's votes, and\r\n\r\nyet the Government has come forward to put another plan before us\r\n\r\nand ask us to approve the new sums to be voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year under the Head - Ministry of Education - the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates totalled $24,358,780, but according to  the\r\n\r\nfigures  given in the 1965 Development Estimates, only  one-third\r\n\r\nof last year's provision has been utilised. There are cases where\r\n\r\nlarge sums of money have been voted for last year and which  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  used, and yet the Government is asking us  to  approve\r\n\r\nmore  funds  for similar expenditure! Thus, every year  the  sums\r\n\r\nvoted for the Ministry of Education appear to be very impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember last year when I was giving my views on matters\r\n\r\nrelating to the Ministry of Education, the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nsaid  that  my  criticisms were merely a waste of time.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  I  told him that the Government's plans were not  in  line\r\n\r\nwith  the  actual  state  of affairs.  Now,  the  same  thing  is\r\n\r\nhappening  again. Of course, he may be able to explain  that  the\r\n\r\nplan  will ultimately be completed, that several million  dollars\r\n\r\nout  of the sums allocated have already been spent to prove  that\r\n\r\nsome  work  has  already been done. But this sort of  explanation\r\n\r\ncannot  satisfy  us. In principle, of course, it  is  right  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  not  be any wastage of the vote approved,  but  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact, what has been spent to complete the plan is  a  far\r\n\r\ncry  from the actual vote approved. I have already said that only\r\n\r\none-third  of  the vote approved for last year has actually  been\r\n\r\nspent.  This  shows that the plan has not been realistic.  During\r\n\r\nthe  debate  last year also, when I alleged that there  were  not\r\n\r\nenough  secondary schools, the Minister for Education  said  this\r\n\r\nwas not a fact. I said that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisted such a situation last year. Six thousand pupils were  not\r\n\r\nable  to  find  places  in the right type  of  schools.  One  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  see  what  the  actual  position  is.  The  Minister's\r\n\r\nintention is just to present us with impressive figures  to  fool\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Mr Speaker,  as\r\n\r\na matter of fact, it is not true that we have only used one-third\r\n\r\nof  the  money voted for last year's Estimates. The  majority  of\r\n\r\nschool  buildings were completed this year and all  the  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  will  be  put before the Government  early  next  year.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  payment of bills will only be  made  early  next\r\n\r\nyear.  It  is  true  that the actual payment  is  less  than  the\r\n\r\noriginal   estimate, it  does  not  mean,  however,   that   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  last year was not used to the fullest  possible\r\n\r\nextent. Furthermore, the vote approved by this House can only  be\r\n\r\nused  when  the work has actually started. For example,  we  have\r\n\r\ndrawn up certain plans for next year but the work cannot commence\r\n\r\nearly next year. The same applied to the plans drawn up last year\r\n\r\nand work was supposed to commence this year, but it could not  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out due to some difficulties and delays. So we  have  to\r\n\r\npostpone the commencement of such work to next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has also referred to the Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational  Institute  in Balestier Road, saying  that  the  vote\r\n\r\napproved for last year has not been used at all. Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Vocational Institute at Balestier Road presents  some\r\n\r\ndifficulties because the plans have not been drawn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup according to specification. It is not an easy task to put up a\r\n\r\nproper  plan  for  this Institute. It is an altogether  different\r\n\r\nplan from that of an ordinary school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has also mentioned the Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College. The same reasons apply in this case because the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  the Teachers' Training College is a  new  type  of\r\n\r\nwork,  and the plans have to be considered carefully before  they\r\n\r\nare  approved.  This takes time because of the expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nworkshops  for  the  teachers who will be  trained  to  teach  in\r\n\r\nvocational and technical schools. The expansion actually  relates\r\n\r\nto  equipment  and  the  building of the  Science  Block  in  the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College workshops. In addition, there is  also\r\n\r\nthe  construction of a hail, a library, etc. This work is  rather\r\n\r\ntechnical,  and  so more time is required to complete  them.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  all the plans have been drawn up, I think work may commence\r\n\r\nsometime  next year. The foundation may be laid in December  this\r\n\r\nyear and the actual construction may start next year. I think  by\r\n\r\n1966,  the  whole  work will be completed. The expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training  College and the  construction  of  a  second\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training College are two different  matters.  We  feel\r\n\r\nthat  according to present needs, for the next five years we will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to meet the requirements of schools  if  we  train\r\n\r\nteachers  in  only one College in spite of the expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Teachers' Training College. This is because at  present\r\n\r\nhalf  of the number of teachers, i.e. some 15,000, have not  been\r\n\r\ntrained.  Some  of  these teachers are in the initial  stages  of\r\n\r\ntraining.  If  we want to meet the requirements of  schools,  one\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training College is not enough and so  we  have  plans\r\n\r\nunder  way to put up another Teachers' Training College. We  only\r\n\r\nask for a token vote in next year's Estimates in respect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this  Second Teachers' Training College because we intend  to\r\n\r\ntry  to get financial and technical aid from other sources in the\r\n\r\nconstruction of the second Teachers' Training College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, if I remember correctly, the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nalso  referred  to the 6,000 students who were unable  to  go  to\r\n\r\nsecondary  academic schools. I think I have already mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthis  House that these 6,000 students have not been kept  out  of\r\n\r\nschool  entirely.  They desire to attend the  secondary  academic\r\n\r\nschools  but  because there is not sufficient  accommodation  for\r\n\r\nthem,  we  have  therefore to make use of  school  buildings  for\r\n\r\ntechnical  and  vocational schools in order to accommodate  them.\r\n\r\nSo,  although they are not schooling in secondary academic school\r\n\r\nbuildings,  they are nonetheless pursuing courses of an  academic\r\n\r\nnature  in  these  buildings. So, in future, when  we  have  more\r\n\r\nacademic  schools  built, say next year, these students  will  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to suitable types of schools. Therefore,  it  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say that the 6,000 students are not in school  now  and\r\n\r\nthat they have been forced to take up courses other than those of\r\n\r\nan academic nature as alleged by the Member concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions on the amendments* put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*See footnote at cols. 725-6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

It appears also that the  Government  is\r\n\r\ntrying  its  best  to  foster the growth of higher  education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But I feel that if one looks deep into the matter, the\r\n\r\nHouse  must, of necessity, be very careful in dealing  with  this\r\n\r\nvote.

We remember\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  past  some  actions  were  taken  against  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  this  gave rise to a feeling  of  despair  among\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public. Furthermore the Government is making  use\r\n\r\nof  public  funds to interfere with academic freedom  and  higher\r\n\r\nlearning.

I am not quite sure whether the  Member  is\r\n\r\nagainst the provision of this $1 million or is in favour of it. I\r\n\r\nhave not quite followed him yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am just trying\r\n\r\nto  point  out  that this vote of $1 million  asked  for  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the Party in power, ostensibly to help Nanyang University\r\n\r\nin  the building of a Library, has some hidden motive. I want  to\r\n\r\nair my views about it. I think it is necessary for the Government\r\n\r\nto  let us know all the facts and circumstances surrounding  this\r\n\r\nvote. In this way, we shall be able to understand  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  how the P.A.P. Government has made use  of  public\r\n\r\nfunds to achieve its own party ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Nanyang University is controlled by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Government. The Government at one time  refused  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  single  cent  to help Nanyang University.  But  when  it\r\n\r\ndecides  to resort to undemocratic means and shamelessly  imposes\r\n\r\nre-organisation on Nanyang University in order to assume  control\r\n\r\nof  it, it now wants to give $1 million to the University. Before\r\n\r\nthis,  the  Government  also  promised  to  obtain  pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\nrecognition of Nanyang University degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government tried its best to give publicity to the\r\n\r\nproposed  aid to be given to Nanyang University, one  finds  that\r\n\r\nsoon  after this the P.A.P. asked the Central Government to  send\r\n\r\ntroops and police to arrest Nanyang University undergraduates  in\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of the night. As a result of this, many students  of\r\n\r\nNanyang University have been arrested. And following this, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government,  by an underhand way, got  some  people  to\r\n\r\ncoerce   the  ex-Vice  Chancellor  of  Nanyang  University   into\r\n\r\nresigning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I really cannot relate the coercion of\r\n\r\nthat gentleman to the contribution by the Government of a million\r\n\r\ndollars. If the Member can do so, then I shall hear him on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I think these two\r\n\r\nmatters  are  related the $1 million contribution by  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  resignation of the ex-Vice Chancellor  of  Nantah  took\r\n\r\nplace  almost at the same time, so the public will know there  is\r\n\r\nsome connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

On the one hand, the Government took forceful  means\r\n\r\nto  reorganise Nanyang University. On the other hand, it declared\r\n\r\nthat  it was helping Nanyang University with $1 million. So after\r\n\r\nthe  publicity  about this $1 million, we find that  the  ex-Vice\r\n\r\nChancellor was forced to resign. That gives rise to the suspicion\r\n\r\nthat  Government must have tried to snake use of some  people  to\r\n\r\nforce  the Vice Chancellor to resign, otherwise the same fate  of\r\n\r\nthe  ex-Vice  Chancellor  of the University  of  Singapore  might\r\n\r\nbefall  him. Then there was the so-called committee to take  over\r\n\r\nthe  place  of the Vice Chancellor. And after this committee  had\r\n\r\nbeen   set   up,  a  lot  of  members  of  the  staff  and   some\r\n\r\nundergraduates were expelled from the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member is really discussing\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University set-up, the way in which the  Government\r\n\r\nis   interfering  with  Nanyang  University,  the   way   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity is objecting to Government's interference. Now,  those\r\n\r\nare  matters  which  were  discussed yesterday,  I  believe,  and\r\n\r\nproperly discussed. Today the question is about the provision  of\r\n\r\n$1  million to Nanyang University. What the Member is entitled to\r\n\r\nsay  is that the Government should contribute to it or should not\r\n\r\ncontribute  to it, or should increase it, say, by $5  million  or\r\n\r\nsomething like that. That might be relevant to the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am trying to\r\n\r\nsketch to you the circumstances behind the vote of $1 million and\r\n\r\ngive my criticism, because this criticism is very important. From\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  already  said, it is  very  clear  that  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted to give the $1 million to help Nantah, this was\r\n\r\ndone  in order to cover up its intention to reorganise the set-up\r\n\r\nof Nanyang University, thereby\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreating  an  impression  among the people  that  giving  the  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  was the real intention of the Government to help Nantah.\r\n\r\nThis  is a smoke-screen. I think I have already made myself clear\r\n\r\non this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, following this, made use of a Government\r\n\r\nofficer  to  sit on the Nantah Committee, thereby causing  direct\r\n\r\ninterference with Nanyang University, and this gave rise to  some\r\n\r\ndiscontentment among the staff. So we see the Government wants to\r\n\r\ngive  $1  million to help Nanyang University build a new  library\r\n\r\nand, as promised, wants to help Nantah obtain recognition of  its\r\n\r\ndegrees  from all the States in Malaysia. I do not know  to  what\r\n\r\nextent  the Government has succeeded in doing so, in  so  far  as\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  degrees is concerned. As  far  as  I  know,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not  taking positive steps to achieve  this  end.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it has forgotten about it. Or is it because  it  has  no\r\n\r\ncourage to face the Central Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nregrettable that the Member for Jurong has taken up some time  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  without giving an indication whether he is  objecting\r\n\r\nto,  or agreeing with, the Government in giving $2 million as aid\r\n\r\nto Nanyang University for the building of a new library, purchase\r\n\r\nof  equipment,  furniture  and books.  Is  he  objecting  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for doing this, or otherwise? He has taken  some  time\r\n\r\nwithout being able to tell us this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have already indicated very clearly that if the Government is sincere in wanting to help the growth of higher education and in helping Nantah, then nobody will object. I have already mentioned the circumstances relating to this vote to show that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  using public funds to  assume  control  of\r\n\r\nNanyang University by interfering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  academic  autonomy.  I  have  already  stated  my\r\n\r\ndisappointment  and  raised objection to this  behaviour  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, the point that the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong  is making is that the Government, by providing $1 million\r\n\r\nwill  be  interfering  with the autonomy of  Nanyang  University.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister would like to answer that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it is a pity that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong has not asked the Government not  to  give\r\n\r\nthis  sum of money to help Nanyang University. He has a suspicion\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore Government's intention to help Nantah is  not\r\n\r\nsincere. He is suspicious of our sincerity. If we are not sincere\r\n\r\nin  wanting to help Nantah, then we will not have asked for  this\r\n\r\nvote of $2 million to help it in 1965 to build a library and  buy\r\n\r\nscientific equipment and books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the past, when Nanyang University was in the\r\n\r\nhands  of pro-Communist elements like the Member for Jurong,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment had no obligation to help in the training of more \r\n\r\npro-Communist   students  to  undermine  the  democratic  system   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Nobody in his right senses would do this. This applies\r\n\r\nto the Government too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will remember to carry out our promise that, after the\r\n\r\nreorganisation,  we  will try to get the  Central  Government  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the degrees of Nanyang University. But the  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  Nanyang  University  has not completed  its  reorganisation\r\n\r\nwork. It is only in the initial stage. At the right time, we will\r\n\r\ncarry out our promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also talked about our using public funds\r\n\r\nto  interfere  with  the academic freedom of the  University  and\r\n\r\nabout the ex-Vice Chancellor who was forced by us to resign.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  these  people are not really  interested  in  the\r\n\r\nautonomy  of  the  University. They are not  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nacademic  freedom of the University. All they are concerned  with\r\n\r\nis  the  question of how to turn the University into  a  training\r\n\r\nground for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npro-Communist  elements.  They  are  only  concerned   with   the\r\n\r\nindoctrination   of  Communist  ideas  in  the   minds   of   the\r\n\r\nundergraduates. They are only concerned with the freedom to carry\r\n\r\nout subversive activities. All this --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have ruled the Member for Jurong out of\r\n\r\norder on that. I have allowed the Minister to dwell on it just to\r\n\r\nreply to him, but I would not like the Minister to take it beyond\r\n\r\nthe reply. So will the Minister get on to his next point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, unfortunately I\r\n\r\nhave no opportunity to say what I wish to say. But, in short,  on\r\n\r\nthe  question of Nanyang University, the Central Government  has\r\n\r\nalready  issued  a  White  Paper about  the  activities  of \r\n\r\npro-Communist elements in Nanyang University. Mr Speaker, since  you\r\n\r\nhave  made a ruling that I should not dwell on it any further,  I\r\n\r\nshall go on to the next point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong said that we tried to create an\r\n\r\nimpression  on  the  people.  He  himself  tried  to  create   an\r\n\r\nimpression that he was very interested in Nanyang University  and\r\n\r\nin its autonomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the reorganisation of Nanyang University and\r\n\r\nthe  appointment of an ad hoc Administrative Committee,  we  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  a great deal of damage has  been  done  to  the\r\n\r\nhostels and the canteen. We have evidence to show that wires have\r\n\r\nbeen  pulled  down, chairs and tables damaged, bulbs  broken.  We\r\n\r\nhave  pictures  to  show  the damage done  by  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements. They are undermining the University. If the Barisan are\r\n\r\ninterested,  I  can show them the pictures. Their so-called  love\r\n\r\nfor  the  University is really a desire to see it  damaged.  When\r\n\r\nthey  failed  to  turn the University into a  hive  of  Communist\r\n\r\nelements, they tried to damage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister to answer one question.

I would like to ask what he meant by the  reorganisation of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is an absurd question. If\r\n\r\nhe  has seen the agreement signed between Nanyang University and\r\n\r\nour  Government on the reorganisation of the University, he  will\r\n\r\nknow  that  if  the  reorganisation is  in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Review Committee, then the  reorganisation\r\n\r\nhas been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): How many per cent of the\r\n\r\nreorganisation has been completed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with some training in\r\n\r\nstatistics,  may  I  say  that these are matters  which  are  not\r\n\r\nquantifiable?

But  we  object   to\r\n\r\nGovernment's  using  this sum of money for  their  own  notorious\r\n\r\npurpose, it is very easy and simple to answer this question.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the P.A.P. Government has asked for a provision  of  $2\r\n\r\nmillion out of which $1 million is to help Nantah build a library\r\n\r\nand  the  other $1 million is to help Nantah purchase  scientific\r\n\r\nequipment,  and  library books. But we must not just  simply  say\r\n\r\nthat  we object to or agree with this vote. What we want to  know\r\n\r\nis  when was this money asked for? Their purpose is to show  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  helping Nanyang University and they make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nmoney  to  cover  up their misdeed. They are giving  sugar-coated\r\n\r\npoison to Nanyang University, a poison which contains $2 million,\r\n\r\nand  now they are asking us whether we support or object to  what\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing. What I am pointing out is their  motive  behind\r\n\r\nasking  for  this vote. The P.A.P. are not able  to  answer  this\r\n\r\nquestion.  When they are not able to do so, they talk  about  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  That is what they are in the habit of  doing.  After\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have  carried  out the reorganisation,  let  us  see\r\n\r\nwhether  it has become better. After the reorganisation,  I  hear\r\n\r\nthat  there  has been no improvement. The P.A.P. have  used  the\r\n\r\nstudents in Nanyang University, it is an open secret.

All\r\n\r\nthis is a smoke-screen. The Ministers are clear about this.

It  also shows that Nanyang University,  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nacademic  standards  and other fields, has already  come  to  the\r\n\r\nright  track. And it is a good thing. But the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nhave voiced their doubts and suspicions in our providing this sum\r\n\r\nof  $2  million. I say that if the vote had been  asked  for  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago  when the Barisan elements were doing their  worst  in\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, then they would have agreed. Now  that  they\r\n\r\nare not able any more to control Nantah, they say that the grapes\r\n\r\nare  sour,  and  have  described us as handing  out  sugar-coated\r\n\r\npoison  to Nantah in this vote of $2 million. In fact,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants  to give financial aid to  Nantah,  it  has  to\r\n\r\nensure that the money is used in a proper way, put to proper use,\r\n\r\nand  in all justification, it should not be handed out when these\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements are in control of Nantah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Mr Jek Yeun Thong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now a chance is offered me to\r\n\r\ntell the inside story. The ex-Vice Chancellor, because of his own\r\n\r\nweakness,  was  not  able to control them, but  this  is  another\r\n\r\nmatter.  But  if we were to use public funds to aid a  University\r\n\r\nwhen it is under the control of undesirable elements, that is not\r\n\r\nright.  When  these  people were having  their  way  in  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  carrying out illegal activities, the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  not  give public funds to aid the University. When  these\r\n\r\npeople  were  controlling the undergraduates there,  people  were\r\n\r\nthreatened.  The  situation  was that  when  the  under-graduates\r\n\r\nagreed  with them, they allowed them to continue. Otherwise  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  suppressed by them. Let us take the graduate assistant\r\n\r\nlecturers. If a graduate assistant lecturer were on the  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  Students Union and agreed to their political ideology,  then\r\n\r\nhe  was  quite all right. But if undergraduates dared  to  differ\r\n\r\nfrom  such a controlling clique, then this lecturer would  deduct\r\n\r\nmarks from their examination papers in order to fail them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

We know that the vote is in the right direction, and that\r\n\r\nNanyang  University will in future become a higher  institute  of\r\n\r\nlearning befitting its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that last year\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Assembly was having sittings in December, the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  and  Jurong were trying their best  to  attack  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  especially on the question of Nantah,  and  accusing\r\n\r\nthe Government  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  being  undemocratic and of trying to  curb  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom.  They  also  said the Government did  not  want  to  aid\r\n\r\nNantah. But now they have changed their tactics, and are shouting\r\n\r\nabout  academic freedom and freedom of assembly, as  though  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  reject this vote for Nantah. In the past they  attacked\r\n\r\nthe  Government for not wanting to help Nantah, hut now that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to give financial aid to it, they turn round and\r\n\r\nattack it for not giving academic freedom to Nantah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, at that time, they wanted to prevent the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Council  from  carrying  on  negotiations  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  respect of the organisation of  Nantah.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  at that time they wanted to control Nantah. They accused\r\n\r\nthe  Government of trying to control Nantah instead.  Their  main\r\n\r\npurpose  then was to allow the Communists to keep on  controlling\r\n\r\nNantah. Their real purpose, which is evident now, is to make  use\r\n\r\nof academic freedom as a pretext and as a smokescreen to carry on\r\n\r\nwith their Communist activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has asked me what has been achieved\r\n\r\nafter  the  reorganisation. He said, \"How much has been  achieved\r\n\r\nafter  the  reorganisation?\"  We can  tell  him  that  the  under-graduates  of  Nantah  can now study in  a  peaceful  environment\r\n\r\nwithout interference from Communist elements. This is a situation\r\n\r\nthey  have  never  dreamed of before. Before the  reorganisation,\r\n\r\nNantah  was a campus for the pro-Communist activists.  But  after\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation, it has become a suitable institute  for  the\r\n\r\nundergraduates  to  pursue  their  higher  studies.  Before   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  Nantah  was  in a  topsyturvy  state.  After  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation,   things  returned  to  what  they   should   be.\r\n\r\nDiscipline is restored and maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the vote of $1 million for buying scientific\r\n\r\nequipment and library books, this sum could, of course, be put to\r\n\r\nother use. In providing this vote for Nantah, it is our hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNantah  will  be worthy of its name as an institute  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning. Under the ex-Vice Chancellor, Dr Chuang Chu  Lin,  the\r\n\r\nannual vote for this item was put to other uses. Dr Chuang built\r\n\r\na  theatre  in the University. The $1 million, which comes  under\r\n\r\nthe  annually  recurrent expenditure vote, was used  in  building\r\n\r\nthis  theatre. In the end, the payment of the salaries of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  professors and lecturers became a  problem.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  theatre  cannot be used now in spite of  the  fact  that  $1\r\n\r\nmillion has been spent on it. According to the original plan  for\r\n\r\nthe  theatre,  it  should be air-conditioned.  But  although  $1\r\n\r\nmillion has been spent on it, there is no air-conditioning in the\r\n\r\ntheatre. According to reports submitted by the architects, if the\r\n\r\nauditorium  were to accommodate more than 300 people, then  there\r\n\r\nis   the   danger  of  suffocation.  There  are  no   ventilation\r\n\r\nfacilities. That is the way they were using public money at  that\r\n\r\ntime.  All these things happened before the reorganisation. After\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation  things have become better.  I  have  already\r\n\r\ngiven  them  some  photos to show that before the reorganisation,\r\n\r\nthe  pro-Communist  under-graduates were  engaged  in  subversive\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was invited by the Students' Fellowship of Nantah to speak on\r\n\r\nthe  occasion of Malaysia Day. When I was there. I found that the\r\n\r\nwiring  and equipment were all torn up and broken. The  furniture\r\n\r\ntoo  was  damaged. There were no lighting and no loudspeakers.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand a big sum of money had been spent on such things.  But\r\n\r\nthis only goes to show what the pro-Communist elements did in the\r\n\r\nUniversity  campus. $3,000 musical instruments  were  also  lost.\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  was  set up through  donations  by  hawkers,\r\n\r\ntrishaw riders and people from all walks of life. The purpose  of\r\n\r\nsetting up Nantah is to educate our youths in order that they can\r\n\r\nserve  the country. The Barisan claim that they love and  support\r\n\r\nNantah.  In  actual  fact, we can only see  sabotage  in  Nantah.\r\n\r\nEquipment  was damaged and musical instruments were  lost.  These\r\n\r\nare facts surrounding the situation in Nantah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for Education has\r\n\r\nwasted a lot of the time of this House by mentioning irrelevant\r\n\r\nmatters. In the short time available, I wish to reply only to the\r\n\r\nmore important points. He says that after the reorganisation,\r\n\r\nNanyang University has got academic freedom. But I wish to ask him\r\n\r\nthis. How is it that the Government has to send one of its\r\n\r\nofficials to participate in the work of the Administrative Committee? He receives directives from the Government and interferes\r\n\r\nwith the administration of Nanyang University. Why should this be\r\n\r\nso? Does it mean that Nanyang University has no other persons to\r\n\r\nsit on the Administrative Committee so that one official from the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has to be a member of the Administrative\r\n\r\nCommittee? This only goes to show further interference by\r\n\r\nGovernment and the undermining of the autonomy of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. They also claim that the administration of Nantah is\r\n\r\ngoing along the right track. They say the old days have gone. The\r\n\r\nquestion still remains whether Nantah is in fact going along the\r\n\r\nright track. We should not waste much time. He says that the\r\n\r\nadministration then was deteriorating and in a topsyturvy state.\r\n\r\nI think such remarks are an insult to the academic staff who were\r\n\r\nresponsible for Nanyang University in the past. We know that\r\n\r\nthere are still some members of the academic staff who were in\r\n\r\nNantah before the reorganisation and who were responsible for its\r\n\r\nadministration. Their work was appreciated by the public at\r\n\r\nlarge. To say that these people have brought Nantah to a chaotic\r\n\r\nstate is a great humiliation to those who love Nantah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also mentioned about the theatre in Nanyang University. He has mentioned about the damage done, and the useless condition of the theatre now. We know that when the hall\r\n\r\nwas  built,  it  was through donations coming  from  the  Hokkien\r\n\r\ncommunity. Of course, this theatre was to meet the urgent need of\r\n\r\nNanyang University for a place where the undergraduates can  hold\r\n\r\ntheir convocation and other necessary gatherings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Will those affected by\r\n\r\nresettlement schemes be given proper accommodation? Are they in a\r\n\r\nposition to carry on their business as usual in their alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation? Of those affected, how much compensation is  given\r\n\r\nto  cover their losses? Are they given any rent subsidies in  the\r\n\r\nnew  accommodation?  A more important consideration  is  that  in\r\n\r\nareas such as New Bridge Road, which is a business centre for the\r\n\r\nChinese  and  other communities, I wonder how the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing to provide them with alternative places of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people carry on business which has a direct bearing on\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of the people in Singapore. My concern  in  these\r\n\r\nmatters  is  that  the Government may not be able  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nmatters carefully and satisfactorily. In fact, some people may be\r\n\r\ngreatly  affected by this re-development programme. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  should be able to present us with a comprehensive  plan\r\n\r\nand give us some idea about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the North Bridge Road area, because of the Alliance and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. shedding crocodile tears, some difficulties have arisen. I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether there is going to be any change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  respect  of the development programme for the North  Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad and Minto Road areas where two major races live together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to know whether the Central Government has any\r\n\r\nright  to interfere with our urban development programme. I  want\r\n\r\nthe Minister to give me a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Chairman, in reply to the first question\r\n\r\nof  the  Member  for  Jalan Kayu as to whether  the  $20  million\r\n\r\nearmarked  includes compensation or not, I wish to  say  that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not include compensation. Compensation comes under  another\r\n\r\nheading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his second question, i.e. have those people who\r\n\r\nare  affected been given proper accommodation, I say that in  our\r\n\r\nresettlement  scheme, the people affected are  always  given  the\r\n\r\nchoice of accommodation and, for his information - in spite of the fact that they will not face realities, they\r\n\r\nsay that our compensation scheme is rejected by the people, it is\r\n\r\ninadequate,  it  is causing great suffering -  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ninform  him that, for instance, in Kallang Basin, there  are  750\r\n\r\nfamilies  living mostly in stilt houses. To date 700 odd families\r\n\r\nhave been cleared. They have all accepted the compensation scheme\r\n\r\nand alternative accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the Redhill cemetery site, 397 squatters are\r\n\r\naffected  by  clearance in this 60-acre plot. About 350  families\r\n\r\nhave accepted accommodation offered to them and have moved away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it can be seen that in our resettlement scheme,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  families affected have accepted  the  compensation\r\n\r\noffered.  It is only in the minds of Opposition Members that  our\r\n\r\ncompensation scheme is not a just and equitable one.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nin any resettlement, in any large-scale moving of people from one\r\n\r\nplace to another, there usually will be some hardship. But it  is\r\n\r\na  question of time before people get settled down in  their  new\r\n\r\nsurroundings. I think, on the whole, the people of Singapore  are\r\n\r\npublic-spirited  enough  to understand  that  what  little  incon\r\n\r\nvenience  is  caused  to them now is all  for  the  good  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and for the future generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asks whether they are given rent subsidies. For businesses we have what we call a rent rising system. That is, if a\r\n\r\nman  who  is doing business in one area is moved or has  accepted\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  shops  in  another  area  to  continue  with  his\r\n\r\nbusiness,  he  is  only  charged 70 per  cent  of  what  we  call\r\n\r\n\"assessed  rent\", and it will rise by 10 per cent  until  on  the\r\n\r\nffourth  year  he  will  be paying the full  assessed  rent.  What\r\n\r\nalternatives  are to be given to people who are to be  moved  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  New Bridge Road and North Bridge Road areas for  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal?  In  the  North Bridge Road area, Minto  Road,  Crawford\r\n\r\nRoad, there is alternative accommodation given to them. The first\r\n\r\nchoice is that they are given flats in Tanjong Rhu; or if they so\r\n\r\nwant  to, they can choose any flat which is under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board anywhere in Singapore. Here, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ninform  the  Member for Jalan Kayu that quite a  number  of  ship\r\n\r\nchandlers have been moved from Beach Road and Crawford to Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu.  At  first they protested that the rent was higher than  the\r\n\r\nrent  which  they paid in the rent control houses.  But  now  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  them  are happy because in their new  surroundings,\r\n\r\nwith  a  larger population, in better shops, they  are  having  a\r\n\r\nlarger  turnover  than they ever had before.  Therefore,  in  all\r\n\r\nthese  resettlement schemes, people will sometimes find they  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay higher rents, incur a bit more expenses  than  they\r\n\r\nused  to  in  their  old surroundings which were rent-controlled.\r\n\r\nBut,  on  the  whole, they find that because of better  locality,\r\n\r\nbetter  facilities,  more people in the new  surroundings,  their\r\n\r\nbusiness is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the New Bridge Road area, we have cleared part of Outram\r\n\r\nGaol and there is quite a large area of land which we can work on\r\n\r\nfirst.  Then, as we go on, we will be able to remove  the  people\r\n\r\naround the area that we want to redevelop into buildings which we\r\n\r\nwill he putting up for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His last question is whether the Central Government has any\r\n\r\nright to interfere in our planning programme. The plans which  we\r\n\r\nput up are our own for the improvement of the standard of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving  of our people, and whether it is the Central Government\r\n\r\nor  the  Barisan  boys opposite, if they have got  better  plans,\r\n\r\nbetter  suggestions to make, they are welcome. If he thinks  that\r\n\r\nby  this  it  is interference, then I say yes, everyone  has  the\r\n\r\nright to interfere with our plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nurban redevelopment plan has met with difficulties even before it\r\n\r\nis  carried out, because this redevelopment project is not a \r\n\r\ncomprehensive one. It cannot take into account the problems  of  all\r\n\r\nthose people who are going to be affected. The Minister says that\r\n\r\nthe people who were affected were satisfied with the Government's\r\n\r\ncompensation. This is a falsehood. Those who were affected in the\r\n\r\nvarious areas did not want to accept the compensation. They  were\r\n\r\nforced  to  accept it because, otherwise, their houses  would  be\r\n\r\ndemolished. Under such circumstances, these people had  no  alternative  but  to  accept such compensation  and  move  into  other\r\n\r\nalternative  houses.  This  is the most  barbaric  way  of  doing\r\n\r\nthings. It is killing a man and saying that he is asleep.  I  can\r\n\r\ngive  a  very  concrete example to show whether  the  people  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to accept the Government compensation or not.  This  was\r\n\r\nstated  by the former Rural Dwellers' Association. They  were  of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  that the compensation of the P.A.P. Government  was\r\n\r\nnot  equitable and just, be it in the rural area or  urban  area.\r\n\r\nThe question of urban redevelopment gave rise to the disturbances\r\n\r\nin  July  and September because there are many loopholes in  this\r\n\r\nplan --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order.

I was merely  saying  that\r\n\r\nbefore these two disturbances,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  were people who were staying in the Crawford  area\r\n\r\nwho  were  not satisfied with the compensation rate paid  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  thus  resulting in some extremists creating  disturbances. I was merely pointing out the defects and shortcomings  of\r\n\r\nthis  compensation rate. Before it was revised, the  compensation\r\n\r\nrate  was even worse. The people in Toa Payoh, Kallang, Wee Choon\r\n\r\nVillage,  Geylang, and Aljunied have not forgotten the  treatment\r\n\r\nthey  got  from the Government when they were asked to  resettle.\r\n\r\nThey  got  only  a  few  hundred  dollars  as  compensation   for\r\n\r\nresettlement.  But  then  there were two rural  organisations  in\r\n\r\nthose days which could fight for the people affected. But in  the\r\n\r\nurban  area  there  was  no such organisation,  apart  from  some\r\n\r\nparties  and civic organisations which were not in a position  to\r\n\r\nfight  for  the  people affected by urban redevelopment.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, the rural organisations, in fighting for the benefit of the\r\n\r\npeople, were  very cautious in their approach because  in  every\r\n\r\naffected area, there were mixed races. They did not make  use  of\r\n\r\nracial issues to deal with this problem. Therefore, in the  past,\r\n\r\nno  matter  how the Government abolished the houses in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas, the action did not meet with any trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the Government says about the Country People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  and the Rural Dwellers' Association, that  they  are\r\n\r\nCommunist  front organisations, they fought for the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  especially those who were affected by resettlement.\r\n\r\nThe  Government now says that most of the people who are affected\r\n\r\nby  the  resettlement scheme are willing to accept  compensation.\r\n\r\nThis is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, to the boys opposite,\r\n\r\neverything  that  the Government does is wrong;  even  giving  $2\r\n\r\nmillion to Nanyang University is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of order.

It has already  been\r\n\r\nexplained  in this House that we give compensation to  these  peo\r\n\r\nple,  although  legally we do not have to give them compensation.\r\n\r\nIt  is  because  we want to minimise the effects of resettlement,\r\n\r\nthe  effects of disturbances that we give this compensation.  And\r\n\r\nthere must be a limit to which one can give compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the so-called champions of the poor - the Rural\r\n\r\nDwellers'  Association  and  the other  organisation  which  they\r\n\r\nhave - championed  the  poor and offered them  everything,  in  any\r\n\r\nscheme  that you carry out, there are a few dissenters  who  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  happy  with  whatever you do.  And  here,  these  people\r\n\r\npromised them the moon. But we are the Government and we are  responsible  for expenditure of public money. We have to stand  here\r\n\r\nand   justify  to  the  Opposition  every  cent  that  we  spend.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to he very careful in how we do it and why  we\r\n\r\ndo  it.  Because of that, we set about it carefully. Some of  the\r\n\r\ncolleagues  of  the Members opposite are not  here  now.  But  we\r\n\r\nworked out a compensation scheme which we thought and still think\r\n\r\nis  equitable. Here we get these chaps coming up to say,  \"People\r\n\r\nare  only  paid $300.\" Here are people who are really experts  at\r\n\r\ndistortion.  We have not only been paying people $300,  but  some\r\n\r\nare  paid $10,000 and $15,000. Do you know that? Why do  you  not\r\n\r\nmention that? You have just mentioned $300, which is an allowance\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  move out. From the percentage of acceptances.  Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  it can be seen that the majority of the people  accept\r\n\r\nour compensation rates. And what interests us most is that it  is\r\n\r\nthe majority who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccept,  and  not  a few dissenters like them  who  try  to  make\r\n\r\npolitical capital out of political bankruptcy now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that quite a lot of people did not accept. Our\r\n\r\nrecord shows that the majority of them have accepted. I have just\r\n\r\nenumerated  two areas where most of the people have accepted  our\r\n\r\ncompensation  scheme and moved away, public  spirited  enough  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  they  have  got  to put  up  with  a  little  bit  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience for the good of the future generation and  for  the\r\n\r\ngood of the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding the Toa Payoh area, the Member says that the\r\n\r\ncompensation  rates  were unfair. The first  compensation  scheme\r\n\r\nthat  we put up, I think, did not have an equal anywhere else  in\r\n\r\nthe  world. We offered a terrace house of over 1,000 square  feet\r\n\r\nin  area, costing at least $7,000, for a ramshackle squatter hut.\r\n\r\nWhat  could be fairer than that? And they are the chaps  who,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of this good offer, went round and tried to put a stop  to\r\n\r\nit.  But  the squatters were wise enough and realistic enough  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  it was a good offer and they accepted it straightaway,\r\n\r\nin spite of the machinations to stop our progress of development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have already said, if our compensation scheme is not\r\n\r\nfair,  then how is it that in Kallang Basin, out of 750 families,\r\n\r\n700 families have already accepted? He says that we are doing  it\r\n\r\nby  force. Can you force 700 families, consisting of about \r\n\r\n4,000- odd  people to move out? Did he see the police moving in to force\r\n\r\nthese  people out? He is just daydreaming and talking  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Honourable Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, just now the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development has claimed that there were  no\r\n\r\nforced  removals.

And  now the  Government  wants them to stay in flats \r\n\r\nwhich  cost  them  a rental  of  $200  or  $300. Is that the way to \r\n\r\nhelp  the  people affected by eviction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of housing, the substitution of flats for attap huts\r\n\r\nwill increase the rents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

It\r\n\r\nseems that under this head nothing is allocated to help the  fire\r\n\r\nfighting  squads in the rural areas. I hope that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  allocate  some  funds  to provide fire-fighting  equipment,\r\n\r\npails, etc. to the fire-fighting squads in all the rural areas. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that if such fire-fighting facilities are provided, it will\r\n\r\nbe better than asking the Fire Brigade to prevent the outbreak of\r\n\r\nfires  or  to  fight  them. The reason is that  whenever  a  fire\r\n\r\noccurs,  the  Fire Brigade engines and firemen have to  travel  a\r\n\r\nlong  way to reach the fire site. Sometimes due to a traffic jam,\r\n\r\nthe  fire  engines are not able to reach the fire  site  in  good\r\n\r\ntime.  For  instance,  the fire engines will  take  at  least  15\r\n\r\nminutes to travel from High Street to Lorong 1, Geylang. From  my\r\n\r\nknowledge, by the time the fire engines reach the fire site, many\r\n\r\nhouses  will have been completely burnt down. Therefore,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will allocate fire-fighting equipment for installation\r\n\r\nat  various  rural  areas, it will be  of  great  help  in \r\n\r\nfire-fighting.  In this way, I feel that the efficiency of  the \r\n\r\nfire-fighting squads in the rural areas will be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the vote for the Toa Payoh Fire Station on\r\n\r\npage 26 of the Development Estimates. How is it that there is  no\r\n\r\nprovision for the building of a Toa Payoh Fire Station? There  is\r\n\r\nonly  a token vote of $10. This refers to subhead 004, items  001\r\n\r\nand 002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, shall I answer the last point\r\n\r\nfirst?  As we know, a number of areas have been developed or  are\r\n\r\ndeveloping  rapidly with housing and industry, for  example,  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh, Thomson, Sembawang and Nee Soon. It is proposed to erect a\r\n\r\nnew  fire  station for Toa Payoh where 50,000 housing  units  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to house about 250,000 people. This will be a  standard\r\n\r\nfire  station  with  4  fire engines,  one  ambulance  and  three\r\n\r\nfiremen. It will be provided with staff quarters. A token vote of\r\n\r\nonly $10, however, has been provided for this fire station in the 1965\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the first point raised just now by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang,  we  all know that there are five fire stations  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  strategically placed in various parts of Singapore,  such\r\n\r\nas  Hill Street, Queenstown, Bukit Timah, Serangoon Road and Paya\r\n\r\nLebar, with an operational strength of 600 men. The fire fighting\r\n\r\ncapacity of these stations has been found to be adequate for  present needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member just now has said that we should provide some funds\r\n\r\nto  equip  the voluntary fire fighting squads. In fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  done so, as we told them yesterday. So we need not  have\r\n\r\nto answer this question again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the speech made yesterday by the Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs.  I do not know whether he has promised any more  aid  to\r\n\r\nthe  fire-fighting squads. The Parliamentary Secretary says  that\r\n\r\nthe answer has been given, but if I remember correctly, no answer\r\n\r\nhas  been  given. If any answer has been given, no aid  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary says that the five fire stations are\r\n\r\nmanned by 600 men. I do not doubt this. But I think that  in spite  of \r\n\r\ntheir efficiency, more aid should be given to the rural\r\n\r\nfire-fighting  squads.  We know that  in  the  Geylang  fires  at\r\n\r\nLorongs 1, 5 and 21, a few hundred houses were burnt down causing\r\n\r\na  few thousand people to be homeless. All these facts show  very\r\n\r\nclearly  that  if  more help is given to the rural  fire-fighting\r\n\r\nsquads,  the situation may be quite different. Such help is  very\r\n\r\nnecessary.  We feel that if the Government wants to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation, then it should give the squads more aid and  equipment\r\n\r\nso that they will be more efficient in fire-fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $730,920 for Head D 07 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 08 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Sometimes a  scheme  which\r\n\r\nhas  been worked out for such a purpose cannot be implemented for\r\n\r\nvarious reasons. Nevertheless, if the authorities concerned could\r\n\r\nclean the drains along Chye Chee up to Geylang River, it would be\r\n\r\na  good  thing. The water in these drains does not  flow  freely.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the Work Brigade carried out the job of cleaning  the\r\n\r\ndrains,  but at the moment this work has stopped. In  order  that\r\n\r\nthere  may  be a smooth flow of water in the drains,  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned to remove the rubbish and dirt  which  are\r\n\r\nchoking the drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, during a heavy rainfall the water remains\r\n\r\nstagnant, resulting in houses being flooded and causing a lot  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to  the  residents there.  The  farmers  are  also\r\n\r\naffected, and they face losses during a heavy rainfall. So I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry concerned to look after these drains  so  that  the\r\n\r\nwater in these drains can flow freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan has got the whole picture quite correctly when he  says\r\n\r\nthat because of several reasons we are unable to proceed with the\r\n\r\nPelton  drainage scheme in Geylang Serai. This is so because  one\r\n\r\nof  the  reasons is that there are thousands of squatters  there,\r\n\r\nand  if  we  are to proceed with providing adequate drainage  for\r\n\r\nthis  very  low-lying area, then all these squatters have  to  be\r\n\r\nmoved.  In the meantime, while it is not possible to do this,  we\r\n\r\nare  providing partial relief by improving the minor drainage and\r\n\r\nalso  reconstructing the culverts across Jalan  Kembangan,  Jalan\r\n\r\nBijaya  and Lengkong Tiga, which are of adequate size to  prevent\r\n\r\nback  flooding. This year, Sir, it is estimated that $10,000 will\r\n\r\nbe spent on all these works and another $6,000 will be spent next\r\n\r\nyear.

Although  the\r\n\r\npeople  at Jalan Angteng and Jalan Ladang are peace-loving people\r\n\r\nwho  cannot be influenced by the Indonesian Communists, they  are\r\n\r\nstill  frightened because radio patrol cars cannot go round these\r\n\r\nkampongs due to the bad roads.

However, to my knowledge, an amount of $26,000 was spent on\r\n\r\nimprovements to these roads in the early part of 1964.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   because   such   attention   is   paid   to    various\r\n\r\nconstituencies, it is not possible to improve all  the  roads  of\r\n\r\none  constituency within one year.

I\r\n\r\nmade a point in reply that the majority of capital subscribed  in\r\n\r\nthese pioneer industries is local capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this question from the Member for Hong Lim as it\r\n\r\nprovides  me  with  an opportunity for giving full  details.  The\r\n\r\nSchedule  setting out the particulars in respect of each  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  119  pioneer  firms will be sent to you in  due  course.  To\r\n\r\nsummarize  the  aggregates, the total subscribed capital  in  all\r\n\r\npioneer  industries amounts to $221,967,000. 57 per cent of  this\r\n\r\ncapital  is  provided by local businessmen and 43 per  cent  come\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad.  Among  the  pioneer industries  are  a  number  of\r\n\r\ninternational  oil  companies.  Their  total  subscribed  capital\r\n\r\ninvested  comes to $49.8 million and the enterprises  are  wholly\r\n\r\nowned  by  them.  If we deduct the enterprises set  up  by  these\r\n\r\ncompanies - there are only five oil companies involved - the ratio\r\n\r\nof  local  capital to foreign capital is 73 per cent  to  37  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of workers who will be employed by these industries\r\n\r\nat  the initial stage of production is estimated at 10,032.
