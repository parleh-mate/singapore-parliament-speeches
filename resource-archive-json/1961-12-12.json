We know the Department\r\n\r\nof Social Welfare is a department which has to\r\n\r\nshoulder many responsibilities, including assistance\r\n\r\nto needy people. Therefore, if the Director of Social\r\n\r\nWelfare makes statements of a political nature, they\r\n\r\ntend to confuse the people and cause misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nexplained  last  evening that the Director  of  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare was appointed Secretary and Treasurer  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  under the People's  Association\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Since community centres  are  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial   services  provided  by  the  Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment,  therefore the Director of Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nwas appointed to serve the People's Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation that he is being asked\r\n\r\nto issue public statements of a political nature, as I\r\n\r\nexplained  last evening, he is purely an employee  and\r\n\r\nhe carries out the instructions of the Board.

The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nused  to  attend  these meetings very irregularly.

The\r\n\r\nfirst  thing is about the frequent changes of officers\r\n\r\nin  the  home.  In many of the homes,  especially  the\r\n\r\nboys'  homes, the officers in charge have been  change\r\n\r\nso  frequently that there is no continuity at all. The\r\n\r\nofficer,  when  put  in that position,  scarcely  gets\r\n\r\nenough time to settle down to learn about the problems\r\n\r\nand  difficulties of the home before  he  is  switched\r\n\r\noil'  and  taken to another department, while somebody\r\n\r\nelse  is  put  in his place. I remember the  Visitors'\r\n\r\nBoard  once complained and said that the previous  man\r\n\r\nwas good. He was put back, and all of us rejoiced. But\r\n\r\nwe rejoiced too soon. Before we knew where we were, he\r\n\r\nwas  taken  away  again. The children  too  will  lose\r\n\r\nconfidence if there are frequent changes. They do  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough  time  to  be friendly  enough  with  the\r\n\r\nofficer  in  charge  to have confidence  in  him.  The\r\n\r\nchildren  too are very confused. For the sake  of  the\r\n\r\nhomes  and  the children, I appeal to the Minister  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  this matter and, if he will, see  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture there will be as little changes as possible  in\r\n\r\nthese  homes.  The children in the homes  are  already\r\n\r\nhandicapped, or underprivileged, or they are  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents, and they cannot be confused like that. It\r\n\r\nis  going  to make them worse. So I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill do something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that there is a Parole Board for\r\n\r\nwell-behaved  boys in the homes. If they behave  well,\r\n\r\nthey  can he let out sooner than their term. But as  I\r\n\r\nhave pointed out in the last few days, Sir, whenever a\r\n\r\nthing is for the benefit of the females, it just  does\r\n\r\nnot  happen.  There is no Parole Board for  the  well-behaved  girls.  So  I  hope  the  Minister  will   do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  this. He should either  empower  the\r\n\r\npresent  Board to parole the girls as well, or appoint\r\n\r\na new Parole Board for the girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned the Junior Approved School. I\r\n\r\nhave  not  seen  the  posts,  but  the  Minister   has\r\n\r\nexplained.

Government will establish more creches\r\n\r\nto look after children while mothers are at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will encourage factories employing large numbers\r\n\r\nof women to provide creches or, factory sites.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no extra vote for creches. I very much doubt,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  there has been an increase of  creches  or\r\n\r\nthere is an intention to increase them. But I ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to tell me if there have been increases, both\r\n\r\nin  factory  sites  and Government creches,  with  the\r\n\r\nexception of the four from the City Council which they\r\n\r\nhave  taken over, and the two Government creches which\r\n\r\nthey are continuing with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I notice in the Budget some posts\r\n\r\nin  the  Community  Recreation Section.  One  lot  was\r\n\r\nactually put \"abolished post\", another lot - has no vote\r\n\r\nfor  1962.  I  am just wondering whether the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould tell us the reason for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the movement of\r\n\r\nstaff,   I   entirely  agree  with  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten.  In  fact, that was the advice  I  always\r\n\r\nreceived  from  the  Board  of  Visitors  when  I  was\r\n\r\nChairman of that Board. The Director of Social Welfare\r\n\r\nis  aware  of  the  position and I understand  he  has\r\n\r\nissued  instructions  that, as far  as  possible,  the\r\n\r\nstall  who  are recruited for service in a  particular\r\n\r\nhome remain in that home to develop an interest in the\r\n\r\nwork of that home. So that matter is in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a Parole Board for female delinquents, so\r\n\r\nf  at I am glad to report to the House that there  are\r\n\r\nvery  few  female delinquents. They behave  themselves\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the boys, so that as far  as  girls  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  we do not need the equivalent of  a  Gimson\r\n\r\nSchool   for  them.  The  Parole  Board  looks   after\r\n\r\ndelinquent boys who get remission of sentences  whilst\r\n\r\nthey  are  working in the Gimson School.  A  different\r\n\r\nproblem  arises with regard to girls. They are usually\r\n\r\ninmates  of the Mount Emily Home and I think it  would\r\n\r\nbe dangerous to put such girls out on parole, unless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Mountbatten wants to look after  these\r\n\r\ngirls and be the Chairman of their Parole Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as creches are concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  four City Council creches and two Government\r\n\r\ncreches.

Sir,  I  understand  the   Government's\r\n\r\ncommunity association project has, in fact,  met  with\r\n\r\ntremendous  failure  in  that the  response  from  the\r\n\r\npeople  has  not been to the liking of the Government.\r\n\r\nStrangely  enough, as the Member for  Mountbatten  has\r\n\r\npointed out, many people are inclined to look  at  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association centres as institutions  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and not as community institutions. Sir, we have\r\n\r\nall  heard quite a lot about the People's Association.\r\n\r\nWe  have  read a lot in the papers, and in this  House\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister and various other Ministers  have\r\n\r\nsaid  quite  a  lot.  In all talks  referring  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association,  the  Government  have   merely\r\n\r\nseemed  to  be  interested  only  in  connecting   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association's current strike with the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. They have been so eager to hold the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis responsible for the strike that they have, in\r\n\r\nfact,   ignored,   first   and   foremost, to   give\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  the legitimate  grievances  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees  of the People's Association and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nto  find the solutions to the legitimate grievances of\r\n\r\nthese  employees. Sir, in the first place,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how and in what pattern these community  centres\r\n\r\nare  built.  I  believe they are situated  within  the\r\n\r\nboundaries of the electoral constituencies. There  are\r\n\r\nconstituencies  which  do not  have  even  one  single\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre, while at the same  time  there  are\r\n\r\nconstituencies  which  have more  than  one  community\r\n\r\ncentre.  But I am aware of the circumstances in  which\r\n\r\nthe  officials  of  the  People's  Association,  maybe\r\n\r\ncommunity centre leaders, etc., were appointed. I do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  want  to go into the circumstances, but  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to take this opportunity briefly to touch on  the\r\n\r\nposition  that  is  prevalent today in  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was giving, Sir, the Government's interest\r\n\r\nseems   to  be  just  to  hold  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the strike. But this is something  on\r\n\r\nwhich we must be clear. I think most of the Government\r\n\r\nMinisters will at least secretly agree with me that if\r\n\r\nwe have 100 or 200 workers going on strike, there must\r\n\r\nbe,  in  the first place, a legitimate reason.  It  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  ridiculous  to suggest  that  anybody  can\r\n\r\nforce 10 or 20 workers to go on strike, let alone  100\r\n\r\nor  200 people. Therefore, I say it is important  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should - after they have done enough  of\r\n\r\nsmearing - at least try to concentrate on the legitimate\r\n\r\ngrievances of the workers. They, in fact, ask for  the\r\n\r\nformation  of a union through which they can  constitu\r\n\r\ntionally put forward their grievances, and that  right\r\n\r\nhas been denied. The Prime Minister said the other day\r\n\r\nthat  because these workers do not belong to  a  union\r\n\r\nthey  have no right to go on strike. On the one  hand,\r\n\r\nthey deny these workers the right to form a union;  on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, they said, \"Because you are not in  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union, you have no right to go on strike.\"  The\r\n\r\nfact  remains that there are grievances and they ought\r\n\r\nto be looked into. The Government must attempt to seek\r\n\r\nsolution.  Insofar  as  I  can  gather,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, employees are employees who do  not  come\r\n\r\nwithin   the   same   category  as   civil   servants,\r\n\r\nparticularly they are not governed by General  Orders.\r\n\r\nAs   such.   I   think  the  Government   must   state\r\n\r\ncategorically that whatever political views individual\r\n\r\nemployees of the People's Association may hold, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  inconsistent with  the  objects  and\r\n\r\nideals of the People's Association. I am told that the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, in an interview with a delegation from\r\n\r\nthe  employees of the People's Association, said  that\r\n\r\nhe  expected the employees of the People's Association\r\n\r\nto be loyal to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> This is something which the Ministers can\r\n\r\nconfirm  or  deny,  but  I have sufficient  reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that this was said - of course, not only loyalty\r\n\r\nto   the   Government  but  also   to   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  But insofar as loyalty to  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  is  concerned, I do not  think  that  any\r\n\r\nemployee  involved is disputing that fact. Insofar  as\r\n\r\nloyalty to the Government is concerned, I do not think\r\n\r\nanybody  is disputing that fact. But if employees  are\r\n\r\nto  be penalised because their political views are not\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  the views of the P.A.P. leadership.\r\r\n\r\nthen it is an entirely different matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I hear that the dispute in the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  is centred around this fact,  that  seven\r\n\r\nmembers  of the P.A.P. left the P.A.P. and joined  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis - I do not know whether they joined the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis or they are members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. The point is that even if they had been  mem\r\n\r\nbers  of  the P.A.P. and had resigned from the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  have now joined the Bansan Sosialis, that  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  reason  for  their  expulsion  from  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association,   unless,   of   course,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can show why the political beliefs  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees   of  the  People's  Association   must   be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  the views of the P.A.P. leadership  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  the  fact that they are employees  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the cost of building community  centres\r\n\r\nis  paid by the public. But during the past two  years\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen know the Party in power has turned  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  into branches of  the  P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment have said that it is to the credit of their\r\n\r\nParty  that  they  have put up the community  centres.\r\n\r\nAfter  putting up the community centres,  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  some  constituencies   were   not\r\n\r\ninvited to the opening ceremony but officials  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were invited. We know that the cost  of  these\r\n\r\ncommunity centres is paid by the public and  not  from\r\n\r\nthe  purse  of the P.A.P. Public money should  not  be\r\n\r\nused for the Party. We have seen that the employees of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association  are  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of the community centres but they  do  not\r\n\r\nagree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the political ideas of the P.A.P. They want to be\r\n\r\nloyal  to  the  People's Association  but  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  want them to be also loyal to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThis   is  unjust.  The  P.A.P. make  use  of   these\r\n\r\norganisations as their Party branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. Last year there were two by-elections. The P.A.P. got the employees of the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  to  take  part  in  their  mass\r\n\r\nrallies.   We   know   this  was   very   unjust   and\r\n\r\nunreasonable. I do not know why the Government want to\r\n\r\nspend  such a big sum in 1962. Do they want to set  up\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in constituencies which  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. or in constituencies which do not belong to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.? There is one community centre  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  closed down by the Government. There is  another\r\n\r\none, which is a very shabby building built during  the\r\n\r\nJapanese occupation.

The people were all confused.  They\r\n\r\ndid  not know whether they could or could not go  into\r\n\r\nthem. When the community centres came under the direct\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the Government, the officers were  changed\r\n\r\nso  often that the people who went there did not  know\r\n\r\nwho  they  were. The whole place was in confusion  for\r\n\r\nseveral  months. Then one fine day we were told,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nyes,  the community centres have been returned  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.

As soon as the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  power - if I am not mistaken, it may have  been  a\r\n\r\nfew  days  or a few weeks after they came  into  power - they learned that the President of the Singapore Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil  was given a grant to go to America.

Now   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Youth  Council had 35  youth  organisations\r\n\r\naffiliated  to  it. It did a very  good  job.  It  was\r\n\r\naffiliated  to  a  world body - the  World  Assembly  of\r\n\r\nYouth.  At the next function of the World Assembly  of\r\n\r\nYouth,  Singapore was not affiliated to be represented\r\n\r\nbecause   the   Government   virtually   killed   that\r\n\r\nassociation.

There is a rumour that as they could not  find\r\n\r\nenough pro-P.A.P., they even got people sympathetic to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.

The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas denied that, saying that he has tape re-cordings made in his office to prove that he  had  not\r\n\r\ncalled  upon their loyalty to the P.A.P. I  regret  to\r\n\r\nhave  to say this, Sir. In fact, I am still trying  to\r\n\r\ndecide whether I should say it or not. It is not\r\n\r\nnice  for the Prime Minister. But I would like to tell\r\n\r\nhim  this: it is no use denying it. When the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation went on strike, the strikers  came  to  my\r\n\r\nhouse  and handed me a tape which recorded the  speech\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister given on his first day of  leave\r\n\r\nwhen  he  went to the People's Association.  And  that\r\n\r\ntape  definitely  said, \"You  must  be  loyal  to  the\r\n\r\norganisation  (meaning the People's  Association),  to\r\n\r\nthe  Govemment, and to the P.A.P.\" Now, they have given\r\n\r\nme  this  tape. I do not know to how many more  people\r\n\r\nthey  have  given this tape. I do not think the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister should deny it, as there is evidence. And  if\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister wishes to hear the tape,  or  does\r\n\r\nnot believe that I have it, he can have it anytime  he\r\n\r\nwants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is useless for the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson to pretend that the trouble in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association is unconnected with the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. In fact, the whole furore in the\r\n\r\nAssociation started at the time the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nmembers formed themselves into a political Party. The\r\n\r\ngenesis of all this is quite simple, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe key and important staff of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation were recruited by a sub-committee of the\r\n\r\nBoard of Management of the People's Association. On\r\n\r\nthat sub-committee the two most important members - in\r\n\r\nfact, the members who decided on the appointments - were\r\n\r\nthe Member for Nee Soon and the Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon. Of course, they packed important positions\r\n\r\nin the Association with their cronies. In one of the\r\n\r\nlaw courts, the Member for Upper Serangoon stated that\r\n\r\nhis Branch Secretary, who had been out of work for\r\n\r\nabout ten years, suddenly passed the examination paper\r\n\r\nmarked by them, and got appointed to the post of\r\n\r\ncommunity centre organiser in that district. Now that\r\n\r\nis the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbackground. When the Barisan Sosialis members  - former\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the P.A.P.  - defected, it is only  natural\r\n\r\nthat  their  views would be transmitted to the  former\r\n\r\nstaff  of the People's Association. The opinion  among\r\n\r\nthe  former  staff was very simple. They said,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nthe Government is falling. There will be a revolution\r\n\r\nin October when a new government will take over.\" Some\r\n\r\nof the people who generally opposed us thought we were\r\n\r\nwrong. Other thought they might as well\r\n\r\nclimb   on   the  winning  bandwagon.  So  it   became\r\n\r\nimpossible  to enforce discipline in the  Association.\r\n\r\nTop members were openly conspiring right down the line\r\n\r\nto  oppose  the Government. In the first instance,  it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary  to  make  an  example  of  a  few   by\r\n\r\ndismissing  round about half a dozen members.  Instead\r\n\r\nof  having the salutary effect that we had hoped  for,\r\n\r\nthis led to more agitation. And it became necessary to\r\n\r\ndismiss more people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, the ringleaders were running\r\n\r\nthe   Association  and  its  facilities  as  if  these\r\n\r\nbelonged  to them and not to the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nlet alone the Board of Management of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association. They defied orders. They  held\r\n\r\nmeetings as and when; and where they liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it became obvious that control over a section of\r\n\r\nthe  staff  had been completely lost, and it therefore\r\n\r\nbecame necessary to force the issue. Accordingly, when\r\n\r\nthe  ringleaders sought an interview  with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  he agreed to talk to the general  rank  and\r\n\r\nfile  of  the  staff  of the People's  Association  and\r\n\r\nexplain to them the situation. The ring leaders agreed\r\n\r\nto convene such a meeting. I think the House has heard\r\n\r\nfrom  the Prime Minister what transpired - that contrary\r\n\r\nto the agreement with the Prime Minister, they held  a\r\n\r\nrival  meeting at a different place at the same  time.\r\n\r\nAfter that, of course, these misguided persons went on\r\n\r\nwhat  they called their \"strike\". Sir, the strike  was\r\n\r\nnot,  as the Member for Thomson was trying to suggest,\r\n\r\nbecause  they wanted to form a union and  were  denied\r\n\r\nthe right to form a union. That was not the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did not say the cause of the strike\r\n\r\nwas  the  demand  to form a union. I said  there  were\r\n\r\nlegitimate grievances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, when one talked of\r\n\r\ngrievances, one meant grievances leading to a  strike.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the inference must be that they  wanted  to\r\n\r\nform  a  union and were denied that right.  Sir,  they\r\n\r\nnever  wanted  to form a union. That came  about  only\r\n\r\nafter they had vacated their posts. Then we told them,\r\n\r\n\"You have walked out of your jobs. You are not walking\r\n\r\nout on strike, as you have not got a legal union.\"  It\r\n\r\nis  only  then they said, \"Let us form a union.\"  When\r\n\r\nthey  applied  to  the Registrar of Trade  Unions,  he\r\n\r\nquite  naturally  pointed out to them,  \"You  are  not\r\n\r\nbeing  employed by anybody. So you cannot be a  member\r\n\r\nof  a union of the People's Association staff, because\r\n\r\nyou  are  no longer the staff.\" That is a side  issue,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir. The main point is that  once  they\r\n\r\nembarked on a so-called strike, Singapore saw a series\r\n\r\nof  examples of utterly reprehensible conduct  on  the\r\n\r\npart of these persons. They resorted to violence. They\r\n\r\nbeat  up  people.  They broke the windows  of  certain\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. They broke up furniture of other\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. In one place they even spilled  pig\r\n\r\nexcreta   on   the   premises.  That  was   absolutely\r\n\r\ndisgusting, uncivilized conduct. And all the time they\r\n\r\ntried  to  prevent members of the public  from  having\r\n\r\naccess  to  the community centres. Community  centres,\r\n\r\nSir,  are meant for the public. They provide a  useful\r\n\r\nservice - people rest there, read newspapers, listen  to\r\n\r\nthe radio, play\r\n\r\ngames, and enjoy other facilities for recreation.  But\r\n\r\nthis   gang  of  undisciplined  louts  took  it   upon\r\n\r\nthemselves,  with  no  legal  right  whatsoever,   to\r\n\r\nprevent  members of the public from entering community\r\n\r\ncentres. In somecases they turned up in big force  and\r\n\r\nfrightened  the loyal staff who wanted to work  there.\r\n\r\nThere  have  been numerous instances of staff  members\r\n\r\nbeing assaulted by these ruffians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in these circumstances, may I suggest that\r\n\r\nwhen the Member for Thomson said that we must find a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolution to this problem, we have found a solution  to\r\n\r\nthis problem? These persons have been dismissed. In so\r\n\r\nfar  as  the  Government or the Board of the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation is concerned, there is nothing for  us  to\r\n\r\ndo.  They walked themselves out of their jobs and they\r\n\r\nstay out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first round of the scrap between the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis and the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nsupporters.  The result of this, Sir, is that  persons\r\n\r\nwhom  they have duped into this foolhardy action  have\r\n\r\nlost  their jobs, and lost a good permanent career  in\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association. There was round two.  Round\r\n\r\nthree - students did not sit for examinations. But the\r\n\r\nmajority  did, and they never got the support  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the Chinese students. Only  a  misguided\r\n\r\nminority did not take the examinations. The result  is\r\n\r\nthat one year's work in school\r\n\r\nis wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it could go on. There is trouble in the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade. Perhaps several hundreds of people will  have\r\n\r\nlost  their  jobs and no opportunity to get  work.  If\r\n\r\nthis  is  the way the Barisan Sosialis think they  can\r\n\r\nrally  the  support of the working masses, by  leading\r\n\r\nthem  to misery, loss of employment, then, Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nthem the best of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely the result of political\r\n\r\nmanceuvres. My colleague, the Minister for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw, will be able to recount to the House when one  of\r\n\r\nthe  persons  who was dismissed at an earlier  period,\r\n\r\napproached him and pleaded that she be given back  her\r\n\r\njob.  The Minister for Health and Law said, \"Well,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be glad to take you back. But you must give some\r\n\r\nundertaking that there will not be a repetition of the\r\n\r\ndisgraceful  conduct  which  these  people  have  been\r\n\r\nindulging in.\" The long and short of it is that,  when\r\n\r\nshe found that she would not be taken back, this young\r\n\r\ngirl shook her fist at the Minister for Health and Law\r\n\r\nand  said,  \"You just wait for the October revolution.\r\n\r\nYou  will be out. We will be in office.\" This was  the\r\n\r\nway these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoolish  and  misguided  young  men  and  women   were\r\n\r\ninveigled into mounting their so-called strike.  Their\r\n\r\nattempt  to  get support and sympathy from the  public\r\n\r\nhas  failed dismally. Indeed, they are now reduced  to\r\n\r\nforming two littte outposts, one in Havelock Road  and\r\n\r\none off Geylang Road, as a gesture of futile defiance.\r\n\r\nThey  attempted  to  mount  what  they  called  mobile\r\n\r\npickets.  They  tried to block the  entrances  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association. For what reason, I do not  know,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir,If they think that is the way  they\r\n\r\ncan  get sympathy from the public, that is, by denying\r\n\r\nthe  public the means of access to community  centres,\r\n\r\nthen  there  is something wrong with their  ways.  But\r\n\r\neven  their mobile pickets have packed up, having  met\r\n\r\nwith hostility and opposition wherever they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest to the Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis that they call it a day and not try  to  make\r\n\r\nan  issue  of  a  lost  cause? One  feels  sorry,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   for  the  victims  who   have   been\r\n\r\nmanipulated by evil men behind the scenes. They had  a\r\n\r\npromising career in the People's Association. There is\r\n\r\na salary scheme. There are conditions of service. With\r\n\r\nthe expansion of recreational facilities in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthey  had  a bright future and considerable scope  for\r\n\r\nimproving  themselves. We have arranged with  overseas\r\n\r\ngovernments, including the Governments of Israel,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and New Zealand, to run training  courses\r\n\r\nfor  these  persons so that they can  see  what  other\r\n\r\ncountries  more advanced than we are in  this  respect\r\n\r\nare providing.

So much so that they even trained\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Work  Brigade  and  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association to attend mass rallies,  to  come\r\n\r\nalong somewhere around the City\r\n\r\nHall  and cheer them when they were getting a  beating\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Hong Lim. In the two  by-elections\r\n\r\nthat  took place recently, members of the Work Brigade\r\n\r\nand  the  People's  Association were  ordered  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be  present  at  their  mass  rallies.\r\n\r\nAllegations have been made against the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nthe   Chairman   of  the  People's  Associat\ufffdon,   who\r\n\r\naddressed  a  meeting of the employees and  told  them\r\n\r\nthat  they  must be loyal not only to the  Association\r\n\r\nand  the  Government, which no doubt would  have  been\r\n\r\nright,  but also to the P.A.P.

The\r\n\r\nanswer  i3  simple.  We saw complete  failure  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres under the previous Government. I was\r\n\r\nat  one  time  the Director of Social Welfare,  and  I\r\n\r\nfound  the  community  centres  were  total  failures.\r\n\r\nFirst,  they were too big. An average community centre\r\n\r\ncost  about a quarter of a million dollars.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthey  were  sited in the wrong places, far  away  from\r\n\r\nwhere the people stay. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthirdly, the staff were all wrong. Therefore, in order\r\n\r\nto  make sure that former errors are not repeated, and\r\n\r\nthat  vast  sums  of  money are not  wasted,  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided   that  we  must  have  direct   control   and\r\n\r\nsupervision over these community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to comment rather briefly on what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Nee Soon said.

Earlier  on\r\n\r\nduring  these  troubles, the ex-staff of the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  I think probably on the advice  or  with\r\n\r\nthe  assistance  of  the Member for  Upper  Serangoon,\r\n\r\nissued a statement saying that these were the names of\r\n\r\nthe  staff,  and these were the persons who introduced\r\n\r\nthem  or  who recommended them for employment. Against\r\n\r\nmy  name  was  a  certain Miss - I have forgotten  her\r\n\r\nname.  I  found out that I did not even know  who  she\r\n\r\nwas.  Later  on  I checked with the Treasurer  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association and found out that she was one of\r\n\r\nthese people.

Every\r\n\r\nAssemblyman  in  this Chamber came  here  because  his\r\n\r\nParty  or his election agent managed to put over  good\r\n\r\npropaganda  to convince the electorate  that  what  he\r\n\r\nstood  for  was right. I am told the august origin  of\r\n\r\nthe   word  \"propaganda\"  started  at  the  time  when\r\n\r\nChristianity was being propagated. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nword  \"propaganda\" means really to propagate a  belief\r\n\r\nor  a faith. To that extent, we who are elected as the\r\n\r\ngovernment   certainly  have  a  right  to   use   all\r\n\r\npropaganda  machinery to put over a point of  view.  I\r\n\r\ncan  quite understand why Members of the Barisan  have\r\n\r\nsuddenly  developed an antipathy for  Radio  Singapore\r\n\r\nover  which  many  of  them were  not  only  eager  to\r\n\r\nbroadcast but also got our Ministry officials to write\r\n\r\nthe speeches for them. So they were using at that time\r\n\r\nthe  propaganda machinery to put over a point of view.\r\n\r\nWhat  has  happened is that we have used the machinery\r\n\r\nof  propaganda effectively. What they are  complaining\r\n\r\nabout   is  not  that  we  are  using  the  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery,  but  that we are using it  so  effectively\r\n\r\nthat  today many of them have been reduced to silence.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  they have even to quit the Chamber  because\r\n\r\nthere are lots of propaganda even in this Assembly. We\r\n\r\nare  not claiming that the propaganda machinery is not\r\n\r\nbeing   used.  It  should  be  used,  and   by   every\r\n\r\ngovernment, to put over a point of view.  If  it  were\r\n\r\nimproperly  used, that is, if we were doing  something\r\n\r\nwhich  should  not be done, then that is  a  different\r\n\r\nmatter. The radio department, publicity, and films are\r\n\r\nin  tended to convey a particular type of message. But\r\n\r\nI  will  say this: that never in any instance have  we\r\n\r\nused  Radio  Singapore or any of the other  propaganda\r\n\r\norgans  of  government  to put forward  purely  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda. We have used it to put forward  Government\r\n\r\npropaganda.  It happens to be a party government,  and\r\n\r\nto  that extent we put forward the Government's  point\r\n\r\nof  view; the Government's attitude to certain things;\r\n\r\nthe  Government's stand on certain problems.  That  is\r\n\r\nsomething which every democratic government, if not  a\r\n\r\ntotalitarian government, uses. The only difference  is\r\n\r\nthat  in the case of a totalitarian government,  there\r\n\r\nwill be no Barisan Sosialis to ask questions about the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture. But in a democratic government,\r\n\r\nthey   can  even  very  light-heartedly  ask   certain\r\n\r\nquestions,  knowing full well, Sir, that they  can  go\r\n\r\nback home quietly and go to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsleep  without hearing a strange knock on their  doors\r\n\r\nat 2 o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I just correct one misapprehension, Sir? An\r\n\r\nallegation  was  made. I do not think the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  really believes it. He has a way  of  putting\r\n\r\nforward certain things without proving them or stating\r\n\r\nthe  facts, just as he insisted that I worked for  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times,  the  Malayan  Tribune  and  for   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Standard as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did not say the Tribune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To that extent, he has a way of\r\n\r\nputting forward half-truths and then withdrawing them.\r\n\r\nHe says we use the property of the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nto   issue   statements  by  the   Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee. I would like to point out to you, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe  have  never gone out of our way to  use  even  the\r\n\r\nradio  to  put over reports of our P.A.P. conferences\r\n\r\nexcept insofar as they may have national implications.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I remember when the Member for Hong Lim left\r\n\r\nthe  Government, we felt that there was a  case  where\r\n\r\nthe  matter had gone beyond party politics to national\r\n\r\npolitics.  Here was a Minister who had  to  leave  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and in that case we did issue a  statement\r\n\r\nfrom the Central Executive Committee over the radio. I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the previous Government used to  broadcast\r\n\r\nover  the  radio the opening of every  branch  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Front.

I  was referring to the first Chief  Minister.)\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  never done that. The only time  we  have\r\n\r\nissued  party  statements is when  they  have  national\r\n\r\nimplications,  just  as when we had  a  special  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee which made certain suggestions as to how  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the government should be improved. Since  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  included  not only Ministers  but  also  the\r\n\r\nformer Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs who deserted half-way through, we thought  that\r\n\r\nsince  these  recommendations  were  being  made  by  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  group, to that extent  we  broadcast  them\r\n\r\nover  the  radio. Again, Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhad  their two inaugural meetings, those meetings  were\r\n\r\nbroadcast over Radio Singapore. So I would ask them  to\r\n\r\nsay  whether we have at any time used the radio or  any\r\n\r\nof  the  other instruments of propaganda at our command\r\n\r\nto  propagate  purely party politics. I say  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot produce such evidence because we have never done\r\n\r\nso, but we do certainly use the machinery of propaganda\r\n\r\nto  put forward Government's views on any questions  of\r\n\r\nnational importance to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation \"Oh, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture, of course, does not intimidate editors. He\r\n\r\ndoes not call them into his office and frighten them\r\n\r\ninto playing up this or that news.\". let us say quite\r\n\r\nopenly that we do call the newspaper editors and we\r\n\r\ndiscuss things with them and say, \"We think it is\r\n\r\nimportant news. These are the implications behind it.\r\n\r\nWould you give us good play?\" Just as the Members\r\n\r\nopposite who criticise the papers for not giving them\r\n\r\ndue play, are at liberty to ring up the reporters or\r\n\r\nthe editors concerned. If the newspapers do not listen\r\n\r\nto them, it is just their bad luck. They do not happen\r\n\r\nto be the Government. But we certainly ask the press\r\n\r\nfor publicity - and it is quite legitimate; it happens in\r\n\r\nevery democratic country. A government can call the\r\n\r\neditors to a Press conference and say, \"This is what we\r\n\r\nintend to do. These are the reasons why we are doing\r\n\r\nit. We would like full play given to it.\" - When a paper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefuses to give publicity for some reason or other\r\n\r\nand then you close down the Press - then we say the\r\n\r\nfreedom of the Press has been infringed.

That, I  submit,\r\n\r\nis  nothing  irregular. In fact, any  government  which\r\n\r\ndoes  not  use its propaganda machinery effectively  to\r\n\r\nput over its message deserves to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Culture said that\r\n\r\nhe was responsible for putting over a point of view and\r\n\r\nthat  P.A.P. propaganda was never solely put  over.  At\r\n\r\nthe  present moment, the P.A.P. and the Government  are\r\n\r\nboth the same. If the Minister says he is going to  put\r\n\r\nover Government propaganda, in actual fact, he is going\r\n\r\nto  put  over  P.A.P. propaganda. If he  wants  to  put\r\n\r\nforward any point of view, it is only fair that he  put\r\n\r\nforward  both points of view. Why should he put forward\r\n\r\nonly  one  point of view? This is very pertinent,  Sir.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent debate on the merger issue, you  will\r\n\r\nremember that I complained in this House that there was\r\n\r\ncomplete blackout of news of speeches from the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. On the first and secon4 days, nearly half  an\r\n\r\nhour  was  devoted to the speeches of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  and  other  people, but hardly  one  line  was\r\n\r\ndevoted  to the speeches made by Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  In  this  particular  case,  there   was   a\r\n\r\ndeliberate blackout, I think, on the citizenship issue.\r\n\r\nEven the English\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnewspapers were told that that question should  not  be\r\n\r\nbrought  up.  If the Minister wants to  be  fair  about\r\n\r\nanything, it is only fair and right that the people  be\r\n\r\nrightly  informed. If Radio Singapore is to be  put  to\r\n\r\nproper use, then all controversial questions should  be\r\n\r\nput  forward to the people and they would then be  able\r\n\r\nto judge. It is now the general talk in town that Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore is no more Radio Singapore but Radio P.A.P. I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will be able to correct this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned a little while back that there was\r\n\r\nno  party propaganda put forward. I will even go so far\r\n\r\nas  to  say that the Minister has instructed the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  in  his department to put forward  his  party\r\n\r\npropaganda line. There were talks by one P.S. Raman. He\r\n\r\nis  the  Programme Supervisor. He gave three  talks  on\r\n\r\nmerger   arid   they  smacked  completely   of   P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda. He never gave both sides of the picture.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure what he said must have been dictated to him by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. We would like to know whether, in actual\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Minister is encouraging neutrality  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil service or encouraging the civil service to  take\r\n\r\npart in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if and when the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis do come into power, then I gather that\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are  going  to do is  to  take  over  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore and use it to put over their own propaganda.\r\n\r\nAny  government  which comes into power will  naturally\r\n\r\nput  over its own propaganda. Everybody knows - in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  whole  town knows  - that the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nhas  been  repeatedly invited to come to a radio  forum\r\n\r\nand  we are still awaiting a reply from him whether  he\r\n\r\nis  prepared to have an encounter with the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  the Member for Farrer Park, and I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim as soon as it is convenient. So we\r\n\r\nare  far  from  wanting  to keep out  the  Opposition's\r\n\r\nviews.  We are inviting them to come and say what  they\r\n\r\nlike  openly over Radio Singapore, subject to the usual\r\n\r\nlaws of libel, sedition, slander and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown had complained that Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore had been blacking out reports of speeches  by\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and other Opposition  Members.  So  I\r\n\r\nasked the News Section to give me a summary of how many\r\n\r\nlines  were  allocated  to  Government  and  Opposition\r\n\r\nspeakers at a given period. They chose the period  21st\r\n\r\nto  23rd  November. On 21st November,  the  total  news\r\n\r\nitems  at 7 p.m. was 190 lines of which the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  merited  185 lines. On 22nd  November,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  speaker had the bulk of the time.  On  23rd\r\n\r\nNovember, during the 7 o'clock news, there was a  total\r\n\r\nof 346 lines out of which - I had been speaking then -  I\r\n\r\nhad 161 lines and the Member for Anson had 166 lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd November, in the 10.30 p.m. round-up of news,\r\n\r\nthere  were altogether 436 lines, of which I  had  156,\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Anson  had  176,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  had  87, and the Member for  Changi  had  12\r\n\r\nlines.  So it is not quite true to say that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  has  been blacked  out.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult to compress a speech which extended over 7\ufffd\r\n\r\nhours  into something like 5, 7 or 8 minutes. In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  I would like - perhaps not on this occasion but  on\r\n\r\nsome  other  occasion - to ask the Member for Queenstown,\r\n\r\nas  an  experiment, to try and compress his 7\ufffd-hours\r\n\r\nspeech into a ten-minute bulletin, which runs to  about\r\n\r\n190  lines, without his complaining that some  material\r\n\r\npoints  or some pungent phrases have been left out.  He\r\n\r\nmade  another  allegation - allegations are  made  by\r\n\r\nindicating that they do not know whether it is true  or\r\n\r\nnot,  but  they think that it is so. For  example,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown said the English newspapers  were\r\n\r\ntold  not  to  play up some statements  he  made  about\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  Sir,  I  myself had great  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nfollowing   the   point  he  was   driving   at   about\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  In  fact,  he  had  great  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nsorting out his notes. But I can assure him that at  no\r\n\r\npoint  did  I bother to ring up any newspaper  or  even\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"Blackout  whatever  points  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  made  about Singapore citizenship.\"  It  is\r\n\r\nobviously ridiculous. I thought it would be more to the\r\n\r\nadvantage of Government for people to read the kind  of\r\n\r\nnonsense that had been talked about citizenship then to\r\n\r\nhave  it blacked out and, therefore, give to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown the intellectual stature  and  standing\r\n\r\nwhich he does not otherwise merit. So I can assure  him\r\n\r\nand  everybody else that I do not ring up any newspaper\r\n\r\nand say, \"Keep so-and-so's speech short\", or \"Black-out\r\n\r\nso-and-so's speech.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson said he had made enquiries.\r\n\r\nCan he produce any newspaperman or any editor who could\r\n\r\nsay that I said that at any time?

I was secretly delighted when I heard one of\r\n\r\nthe  speakers  refer  to the Straits  Times  and  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore as \"Rajaratnam Times\" and \"Radio Rajaratnam\".\r\n\r\nThat  is a fact. We do not object to the fact that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   necessarily   to   have   propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery.

I realise that if you want to  have\r\n\r\nan  information service, you have it. Having a Ministry\r\n\r\nlike  this  for government propaganda, in my  view,  is\r\n\r\nsomething that is proper, just and reasonable.  But  if\r\n\r\nyou  have it for P.A.P. propaganda, well then, it is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter. Sir, the Minister for Culture can say\r\n\r\nthat the only things dealt with in the radio talks, the\r\n\r\nonly items touched on by radio announcers in their news\r\n\r\nitems, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly things that we tell the newspapers to play up, are\r\n\r\nmatters  which  are  connected with the  government  or\r\n\r\nmatters which are of national interest, it only needs a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of common sense to know that you can have  a\r\n\r\nwide  range of matters under the definition of \"matters\r\n\r\nof  national  interest\" and \"Government  matters\".  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Prime Minister gave 12 radio talks.  They\r\n\r\nwere  supposed  to  be matters of merger - what  merger\r\n\r\nmeans  to the people. But he used the 12 talks to carry\r\n\r\non   a   character  assassination  of   his   political\r\n\r\nopponents.  I  read in the newspapers, and  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nquite a few others also read in the papers, that the 12\r\n\r\nradio talks were intended to be followed by radio talks\r\n\r\nto be given by Mr C. V. Devan Nair. In the case of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, it is the Prime Minister of the  State\r\n\r\nspeaking  to the people. But Mr Devan Nair? I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why they have not put him on the air. It  may  be\r\n\r\nbecause they know we were prepared to raise objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the point I want to make, Sir. One can\r\n\r\neasily  raise  any  matter, a pure  and  simple  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolitical  propaganda  matter,  under  the  pretext  of\r\n\r\nraising a Government matter, because the Government  in\r\n\r\noffice  today is the P.A.P. Government. When the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim was expelled, the Minister  for  Culture\r\n\r\nsaid  that  that was a national matter and, under  that\r\n\r\npretext,  Radio Singapore was used. I am not  going  to\r\n\r\nargue  with  the  Minister  on  the  principle   of   a\r\n\r\ngovernment  wanting  to  use the government  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery for propaganda purposes. But, Sir, as far  as\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore is concerned, I ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  to  read the Hansard which recorded  what  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister said in 1955. I think one of the  first\r\n\r\nmatters   the  People's  Action  Party  representatives\r\n\r\nraised in this Assembly, when they were on this side of\r\n\r\nthe Chamber, was to have Radio Malaya transferred to  a\r\n\r\npublic  corporation. I do not have the time to look  up\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard, but if the Minister for Culture looks  it\r\n\r\nup, he can find the sort of argument the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nput forward. He then downed the previous Government for\r\n\r\nusing Radio Malaya as a propaganda medium for the Party\r\n\r\nin power, it is now more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  2\ufffd years since the P.A.P. assumed office, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  not heard any Minister talking of Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nbeing transferred to a public corporation, because  all\r\n\r\nthis  is  forgotten  so  long as  they  can  use  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore for P.A.P. propaganda purposes, and  so  long\r\n\r\nas it suits their convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Any further speeches on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to stress one further\r\n\r\npoint,  Sir:  that we are not against the P.A.P. using\r\n\r\nthe  radio.

I\r\n\r\nquite  concede  that. It is one of the difficulties  of\r\n\r\nanybody  operating a propaganda machine.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  we have, as far as is humanly  possible,\r\n\r\navoided   using  Radio  Singapore  for   purely   party\r\n\r\npropaganda  purposes. It is obviously  a  region  where\r\n\r\nthere are borderline cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the 12 talks by the Prime Minister are\r\n\r\nconcerned, at no time was any of the talks used to  run\r\n\r\ndown  any political Party as such. The main purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe talks was to pinpoint those who are playing the pro-Communist game.\r\n\r\nIndividuals were mentioned, and  groups\r\n\r\nassociated with such individuals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  also  mentioned. To that extent, we contend  that\r\n\r\nthose  talks  were  of  national  importance,  and  not\r\n\r\nintended  to put over P.A.P. propaganda. There  was  no\r\n\r\nclaim  to get the people to support the P.A.P. as such,\r\n\r\nbut  to  support  merger as such  and  to  support  the\r\n\r\nnationalist cause as such. It might have meant to  find\r\n\r\nout,  who  are nationalists and who are for merger.  To\r\n\r\nthat  extent,  it  was  a campaign against  anti-merger\r\n\r\nelements or against pro-Communist elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is this. I say that the\r\n\r\ninvitation to the Member for Queens-town is still open,\r\n\r\nand if he wants to put forward his point of view, Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore will readily accommodate him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is 5 o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the committee\r\n\r\nand took the Chair of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting.

He is a part of the  Government.\r\n\r\nMinisters and Parliamentary Secretaries of a government\r\n\r\nare, in fact, the managers of the civil administration.\r\n\r\nThey  are,  therefore,  the  employers  of  the  public\r\n\r\nemployees.  I would like to ask the Government  whether\r\n\r\nit  is  right and proper that a Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\ncan  be  the Secretary-General of a union of their  own\r\n\r\nemployees. If an assistant manager\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a company were to be the Secretary-General of  the\r\n\r\nunion  of  that  company's employees,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould be the very first one to stand up and decry that\r\n\r\nunion   as   a  yellow  union.  The  fact   that   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary is the  Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. makes A.U.P.E. a yellow union. What  is  more\r\n\r\nsignificant is that the Secretary-General of A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\nshould  be the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture. What a culture! If one were to talk about\r\n\r\nyellow  unions, then that kind of culture  is  nothing\r\n\r\nbut yellow culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Parliamentary Secretary can only owe one\r\n\r\nloyalty,  and  that is to the Government.  I  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult   to  describe  the  situation   where   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary,  as  Secretary-General   of\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E.,   issued  a  warning  in  the   Press   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees may strike. Sir,  this  is  just\r\n\r\nlike  an  assistant  manager of a  company  issuing  a\r\n\r\nwarning to himself that his employees may go on strike\r\n\r\nagainst himself. What a joke!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point about A.U.P.E. is that in the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture there may be employees  who  are\r\n\r\nmembers of A.U.P.E., although I hope not. If they have\r\n\r\na  grievance  to lay before their employer  the  boss,\r\n\r\nthey will then have to go to him, who is the Secretary-General of their union, and say, \"Come on, we have  a\r\n\r\ngrievance against you. \"Will you please lay it against\r\n\r\nyourself?\"    What   an   invidious    position    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary would be in  should  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to say much on this subject\r\n\r\nwhich  leaves a very bad taste in the mouth, a subject\r\n\r\nwhich can bring no credit to any man who wishes to  be\r\n\r\naccepted   as  a  genuine  trade  union   leader.   A\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, as I said, can only have  one\r\n\r\nloyalty,  and  that  is to the Government.  He  cannot\r\n\r\npretend  to  owe  loyalty to the trade  union  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's own employees which he claims to lead. It\r\n\r\nis  for  the  Parliamentary Secretary to  declare  his\r\n\r\nloyalty.  If his loyalty is to the Government,  as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be,  then  he must resign  from  the  post  of\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of A.U.P.E. and other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions,  and  also as honorary adviser to other  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  But  if he feels so strongly that  his  first\r\n\r\nloyalty is to the trade union movement, then he cannot\r\n\r\nand  must  not be the Parliamentary Secretary  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this matter is a simple one. It is for the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  himself,  up  to   his   own\r\n\r\nconscience,  to  decide  whether  he  wishes   to   be\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary or to be a genuine trade union\r\n\r\nleader.  While  being  a Parliamentary  Secretary, he\r\n\r\nshould not organise unions of his own employees and of\r\n\r\nother   employees,  and  then  for  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  in the Ministry of Labour to stand  up  and\r\n\r\nsay, \"There are no P.A.P. unions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Thomson is not\r\n\r\nspeaking. Mr Rajaratnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always\r\n\r\nthought  the  Ministry  of  Culture  deals  only  with\r\n\r\ncultural affairs. But I understand from the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  that  I  should be drawn into  an  argument\r\n\r\nwhether a Parliamentary Secretary can continue  to  be\r\n\r\nan  officer of a union. If the argument put forward by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill is correct - that by being  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary there is therefore a  conflict\r\n\r\nbetween   his  loyalty  to  the  Government  and   his\r\n\r\nresponsibility   as   a   trade  unionist - then   every\r\n\r\nAssemblyman, who is a member of the Government, should\r\n\r\nalso  come  under  the  censure,  because  there   are\r\n\r\nobviously  possibly  conflicts  of  loyalty   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  such and to any outside  organisation.\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is a trade union or any other association\r\n\r\nto  which  he  belongs. So the question, is  not  that\r\n\r\nbecause he is a Parliamentary Secretary, and therefore\r\n\r\nmore  closely  associated  with  the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nconflict  of  loyalty is more acute than when  he  was\r\n\r\njust  an Assemblyman and Deputy Speaker. I can  assure\r\n\r\nyou that there will be no occasion when his duties  as\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture\r\n\r\nwill  conflict with his loyalty to a trade union.  But\r\n\r\nif  it  is  true,  Sir,  that just  because  he  is  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary,  his   position   is   more\r\n\r\ninvidious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  if  he were an Assemblyman, then the question  is\r\n\r\nwhether an Assemblyman, especially one with connections\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government, should or should not be involved\r\n\r\nin  a trade union, because then obviously there may  be\r\n\r\noccasions when he cannot reconcile his loyalty to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment with his loyalty to the trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the\r\n\r\nMinister has got it wrong. A Parliamentary Secretary is\r\n\r\na  part of the Government. How can he be the Secretary-General  of a union of its own employees? So  if  there\r\n\r\nare  grievances in, say, the Ministry of Culture,  then\r\n\r\nmembers   of   A.U.P.E. will  go  to  the   Secretary-General - according to the Minister, it is not wrong  for\r\n\r\nhim  to  be the Parliamentary Secretary - and say,  \"Hey,\r\n\r\nboss,  you  as  Secretary-General go and speak  against\r\n\r\nyourself,  and  say  we want this,  etc.\"  How  is  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary going  to  do  his  duty?  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law - he is now the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  and Law - in 1959 and 1960 was most critical  of\r\n\r\nyellow  unions. Would he not describe a union  where  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the management is leading his own employees\r\n\r\nas the biggest yellow union, if the term \"yellow union\"\r\n\r\nis not to be distorted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Assemblyman is entirely different, Sir. An\r\n\r\nAssemblyman can owe his position to the fact that he is\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the  trade unions,  and  that  he  got\r\n\r\nhimself elevated to the position of Assemblyman because\r\n\r\nof  his  close connection with and his good work  among\r\n\r\nthe workers of Singapore. An Assemblyman should, as far\r\n\r\nas  possible, know for himself what he can do and  what\r\n\r\nhe cannot do. But it does not matter, he can still lead\r\n\r\na trade union. But if he were to belong to the Party in\r\n\r\npower,  then  his  position would  be  very  indivious,\r\n\r\nbecause  every  time  if  he went  down  to  his  union\r\n\r\nemployees  and say. \"Boys, be patient.  Do  not  be  so\r\n\r\nfast,\"  then what would the unions say? \"Ah, you stooge\r\n\r\nof  the  Government! You running dog of the Government!\r\n\r\nDo  not come to us and talk rubbish!\" Although he might\r\n\r\nat that particular time sincerely believe that patience\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary.

But\r\n\r\nfor  a  Parliamentary Secretary, who is a part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, to  be controlling a union  of  Government\r\n\r\nemployees,  it is, I am driven to say it,  the  biggest\r\n\r\nattempt by the P.A.P. to control its own employees,  by\r\n\r\nsaying \"Shut up!

The  reason is that we  all  know  that  the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated   Union   of   Public   Employees   is   an\r\n\r\namalgamation   of   certain  Government   unions.   The\r\n\r\nimportant  Government unions that form the amalgamation\r\n\r\nare  the  union of postal clerks and the union  of  the\r\n\r\nuniformed  postal staff. So it would  have  been  quite\r\n\r\nimproper  if  the  Member for Kampong  Kapor  had  been\r\n\r\nplaced  in  the  position  of being  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to, the Deputy Prime Minister  whose  portfolio covers the postal department. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  is  tucked  away  now in the Ministry  of  Culture,\r\n\r\nhaving  nothing to do with the organisations of  public\r\n\r\nemployees  in  their relationship to the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  where  they  are  employed.  So  that,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir,  we  submit that  this  appointment  was\r\n\r\nproperly   made,  and  there  can  be   no   suggestion\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  that, because the Member for Kampong  Kapor\r\n\r\nis the Secretary-General of A.U.P.E. and he is also the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary of the  Ministry  of  Culture,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  case  where  a  member  of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nManagement  is  also on the Executive  Committee  of  a\r\n\r\nunion. That is not the case, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill knows that very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I know other things very well\r\n\r\ntoo.

Is this relevant to the issue we\r\n\r\nare discussing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is. If I can crave your\r\n\r\nindulgence,  you  will find there is a  meaning  to  my\r\n\r\nwords here. There was a ballot. The medical workers won\r\n\r\nthe  ballot. Therefore, they should be recognised,  and\r\n\r\nthey have been recognised by the previous Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  as  the only union to represent the workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Health Ministry. The then Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw  came along. He felt that because A.U.P.E. was led\r\n\r\nby a Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, he also was in\r\n\r\nthe  invidious  position  of having  to  slap  his  own\r\n\r\ncolleague.  He  said that A.U.P.E. could  also  collect\r\n\r\nsubscriptions. That nearly caused another strike by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Workers' Union. Fortunately,  he  saw\r\n\r\nthe  error of his ways. He said, \"All right, since  the\r\n\r\nS.M.W.U. is the legally recognised union for employees\r\n\r\nin the Health Ministry, therefore, A.U.P.E. should have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do with it.\" All these things are  putting\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary himself and  the  Minister\r\n\r\nand  the whole Government in an invidious position. The\r\n\r\nMinister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsays  he has found nothing. I am not worried about what\r\n\r\nthe   Government  think,  because  we  know  what   the\r\n\r\nGovernment think. They want to control the unions.  But\r\n\r\nas one trade unionist to another trade unionist, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsay  this to the Parliamentary Secretary, that you  can\r\n\r\nonly  owe  one loyalty, that you cannot owe loyalty  to\r\n\r\nboth,  and they are conflicting interests. It is up  to\r\n\r\nthe man himself to declare his stand. But if he were to\r\n\r\nsay  that he can still be Parliamentary Secretary  and\r\n\r\ncontinue to be Secretary-General of a union of his  own\r\n\r\nemployees, then I, for one, would begin  to  lose  alt\r\n\r\nrespect I have for a trade union leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nmisunderstood the dispute between the Medical  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion  and the A.U.P.E. It is true there was  a  ballot\r\n\r\ntaken.  There  was intense trade union rivalry  between\r\n\r\nthese two organisations. Following on the result of the\r\n\r\nballot.  Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Woodhull - he was at  that\r\n\r\ntime in the Health Ministry - issued instructions to  say\r\n\r\nthat the union which won the ballot should be given the\r\n\r\nexclusive  right  to  collect union subscriptions.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  all know that a  ballot  determines\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  a union. The winner  of  a  ballot  is\r\n\r\nrecognised by the employer. Every employer is so bound,\r\n\r\nand the Government as an employer is equally bound. But\r\n\r\nin  this  case Mr Woodhull went further than that.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  he  would give the union the exclusive  right  to\r\n\r\ncollect  subscriptions. If I am a worker,  I  have  the\r\n\r\nright to pay my subscription to the union of my choice.\r\n\r\nWho   is  Woodhull  to  compel  a  worker  to  pay  his\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  to a particular union? That  was  wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd  when  that came to my notice, I, as the  Minister,\r\n\r\nhad  to do something about it. First of all, I proposed\r\n\r\nthat  we  would see what we could do to  come  to  some\r\n\r\narrangement. We would give equal facilities to  collect\r\n\r\nunion  subscriptions to both unions.  But  the  Medical\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union disliked it. They said they would want a\r\n\r\nballot  to be held again. That was the proper thing  to\r\n\r\ndo,  Mr  Speaker,  because in the ballot  the  Medical\r\n\r\nDepartment  did not extend the ballot to the  employees\r\n\r\nof Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Woodbridge Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  a  ballot  were to be taken of the  whole  of  the\r\n\r\nmedical  service,  the ballot should  be  taken  right\r\n\r\nthrough the service. But for some reason or other,  in\r\n\r\nthe  ballot,  Tan  Tock Seng and Woodbridge  Hospitals\r\n\r\nwere  excluded. However, the A.U.P.E. would not  agree\r\n\r\nto  the holding of another ballot. The matter has been\r\n\r\nput  right  by  granting  the  union  which  has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  in  a  particular  establishment  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  collecting subscriptions  from  those\r\n\r\nemployees  who  are working in that establishment  and\r\n\r\ndenying  those facilities to the rival union which  is\r\n\r\nnot  recognised. That is how a solution was found. But\r\n\r\nthe principle remains that we could not give any union\r\n\r\nthe exclusive right to collect subscriptions. That was\r\n\r\nthe  point at issue in the dispute between the Medical\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union and A.U.P.E. Surely the Ministry cannot\r\n\r\nbe accused of playing politics in this matter now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health and Law has seen fit  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  whole  issue again, I think I am the only  Member\r\n\r\nleft in this House who knows the exact facts that  led\r\n\r\nto this ballot. The argument in the beginning was that\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. represented Woodbridge Hospital, and that the\r\n\r\nMedical  Workers'  Union  represented  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital.  Each had the exclusive right of  collecting\r\n\r\ntrade union dues in their own sphere of influence.  In\r\n\r\nthe other hospitals we were not very sure whether this\r\n\r\nunion or that union would have the majority of workers\r\n\r\nsupporting them, and therefore a ballot was taken.  It\r\n\r\nwas  mutually agreed upon that the ballot should  only\r\n\r\nconcern  hospitals other than Woodbridge Hospital  and\r\n\r\nTan  Tock Seng Hospital, and that the results  of  the\r\n\r\nballot  would  give  whichever  union  that  won   the\r\n\r\nexclusive  right they had enjoyed hitherto  in  either\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital or Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  It  so\r\n\r\ntranspired,  Sir, that originally A.U.P.E. represented\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital and the Singapore Medical Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion represented Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and each had\r\n\r\nthe exclusive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright  of  collecting dues in the respective hospital.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when the ballot was held and  the  results\r\n\r\nmade  known, naturally the Singapore Medical  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion  which had won then had the exclusive  right  of\r\n\r\ncollecting  membership  dues from  all  the  hospitals\r\n\r\nexcept  Woodbridge  Hospital.  These  conditions  were\r\n\r\nagreed  between the two unions before the  ballot  was\r\n\r\ntaken  and  I was one of the persons involved  in  the\r\n\r\nmeeting that resulted in this ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

But I think today he has made it quite clear.\r\n\r\nHe  has  suggested that I should resign not only  from\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. but  also from the advisership  of  several\r\n\r\nunions.  Sir,  this is the crux of  the  problem.  The\r\n\r\nUnited  Workers  in  the  Petroleum  Industry  is  the\r\n\r\namalgamation  of  two  unions  and  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has  very great interest in  one  of  these\r\n\r\nunions -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not going to allow this\r\n\r\ndebate  to  range  over  all  these  disputes  between\r\n\r\nadvisers and so on and so forth. The Member for Cairn-hill  has  raised  an issue. It is whether  or  not  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  should  be  the   Secretary-General  of a union of Government employees.  That  is\r\n\r\nall.  I did suggest that mention of this ballot  would\r\n\r\ntake  the debate out of the issue, but the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill was certain in his mind that it was relevant\r\n\r\nand  I  allowed it.

I shall abide by your ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain here that the Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\nof  each Ministry is the only person who has the right\r\n\r\nto  hire  and  fire.

If he cannot  resolve\r\n\r\nit, then it is the Public Service Commission, which has\r\n\r\nfuller  powers.  It is not the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nnor  the Minister.

It is the majority of the 48 that  will\r\n\r\nmake  decisions on the policies of the union. It  might\r\n\r\nbe  interesting to mention here that several members of\r\n\r\nthe  Executive Council of this Union are  members,  and\r\n\r\nactive  members, of U.M.N.O. Indeed, Sir, the President\r\n\r\nof the Union was, in the opinion of the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  when he was Mayor in 1958, a S.P.A. member.

It reminds me, if I may say so, of the  Polish\r\n\r\npainter  who  was  asked  to  write  an  essay  on  the\r\n\r\nelephant.  Instead of writing about  the  elephant,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Before I can write about the elephant, let  me\r\n\r\nstart  with the Polish question.\" Similarly, I  suspect\r\n\r\nthat this particular post of Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture has been made an  opportunity\r\n\r\nfor ventilating an old trade union vendetta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me say this about the duties of the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture.\r\n\r\nThey  are quite plain. They include, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nThom, son  said,  keeping an eye on newspapers,  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore,  printing, the National  Theatre,  attending\r\n\r\nshows  that I cannot attend. So I cannot see  which  of\r\n\r\nthese  duties conflicts in any way with his trade union\r\n\r\nactivities.  I can assure the hon.

I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Member for Cairnhill and others that  I\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with trade unions. Occasionally,  I\r\n\r\ndo  transmit any statement that comes from the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour about trade union matters.

Therefore,  it  was   $300   more.\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries  now  have  their   salaries\r\n\r\njacked  up  to  $1,350, and  when  I  queried  this\r\n\r\nincrease, in comparing this salary with that of the\r\n\r\nPublicity Liaison Secretary (Political), the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister mentioned in this House that there was  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  fill  this post.

All these\r\n\r\nfacilities, Sir, I claim, have been misused. The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture exists with the aim of building\r\n\r\na Malayan nation, fostering and promoting Malayan\r\n\r\nculture, to foster good relations among the\r\n\r\ndifferent races, and to inform the public of Government's policy. How have these been carried out,\r\n\r\nSir? How successful have these been? What have they\r\n\r\nachieved?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is supposed to be a public\r\n\r\nrelations organ of the Government and, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid before, to promote good relations and under\r\n\r\nstanding between the Government and the public.\r\n\r\nNow, are the current events, like the picketing of\r\n\r\nthe Chinese School students a sign of good\r\n\r\nrelations and understanding? I know the students'\r\n\r\npicketing arose from an educational issue. There is\r\n\r\nno doubt about it. But it is the duty of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture to bring Government policy to\r\n\r\nthe public so that the public understand and\r\n\r\nappreciate it enough not to create trouble over the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding. I am sure there is a lot of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding in the Chinese educational system\r\n\r\nof 4-2. As I have said before, I myself\r\n\r\nmisunderstood it until I had a chat with the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation. I now see the point. I do not know\r\n\r\nenough of Chinese education to say whether I\r\n\r\nsupport it or not. But I know what I used to think\r\n\r\nof it before. I was ignorant, and so were the\r\n\r\nstudent picketers. Probably they too are thinking\r\n\r\nthe wrong way, as I used to think. Has it been\r\n\r\nbrought to their notice? Have the public been\r\n\r\nconvinced of the 4-2 system? When I was speaking to\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation, Sir, there were a few guests there. They\r\n\r\nthemselves learned a new thing. When I said, \"Is\r\n\r\nthat so\", I was not the only\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\none  to  say  that. My voice was echoed by  several\r\n\r\nguests  there. It just shows, Sir, that the  public\r\n\r\ndo not know what is the real principle behind the 4-2  system.  It is the Ministry of Culture  that  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for bringing Government policy  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same with the People's Association. If the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association exists for the  good  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  again I say it is the duty of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture to bring that to the public. But as  it\r\n\r\nis,  there is trouble there. And the Work  Brigade.\r\n\r\nAnd as mentioned just now, P.A.P. unions versus non-P.A.P. unions. If there is no such thing as P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions  versus non-P.A.P. unions, then  why  should\r\n\r\nthe public say so? What has the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\ndone  to see that if it is not so, then the  public\r\n\r\nunderstand it is not so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, Sir, I claim the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nhas  failed in its duties. What it has done has not\r\n\r\nbeen to bring Government policy to the public,  but\r\n\r\nto glorify P.A.P. Members and Ministers -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was afraid that might come\r\n\r\nout.

It was shown to Assemblymen. I  was\r\n\r\nthere  at one of the filmings. Sir, at a time  when\r\n\r\nthere  were  enough workers to clean  the  streets,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  workers were functioning quite normally,\r\n\r\nMinisters,  who were paid over $3,000 each  by  the\r\n\r\npublic,  swept  the  streets and  changkolled  when\r\n\r\nthere  were labourers to do those jobs.  Yet  at  a\r\n\r\ntime,  when  there was a strike and  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore was filthy, the Ministers did not go  out\r\n\r\nto  clean  the streets. I am not maintaining,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  the  Ministers'  duty  to  clean  the\r\n\r\nstreets. Far from it. We do not pay street-sweepers\r\n\r\n$3,000-odd each. Oh, no, I am not maintaining that.\r\n\r\nBut  following the point of argument that Ministers\r\n\r\nshould   he  filmed  cleaning  streets  and   using\r\n\r\nchangkols  and  clearing dumps  or  stones  on  the\r\n\r\nroads, Sir, the proper time to do it is when it  is\r\n\r\nneeded. At least if they had filmed that and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, when Singapore needed cleaning,  we\r\n\r\nourselves went out and cleaned it,\" probably  there\r\n\r\nis  justice in that. I am not saying that Ministers\r\n\r\nmust  clean  the streets, but I do say  that  since\r\n\r\nthey  did sweep the streets, they should sweep them\r\n\r\nwhen  it  was  necessary and not  when  there  were\r\n\r\nlabourers to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand, Sir, that we are\r\n\r\ntaking a few items together\r\n\r\namendments (7), (8), (11) and (12).

What  I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  is that, unlike the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nshe  believed that the Government should  not  use\r\n\r\nthe  media of propaganda to put forward any  point\r\n\r\nof  view. The Member for Mountbatten chided us for\r\n\r\nnot  having  put  forward more explanations  about\r\n\r\nChinese   education   and   about   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> The Government's point of\r\n\r\nview.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, the Government's point of\r\n\r\nview. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the question  of\r\n\r\nChinese   education  is  concerned,   a   lot   of\r\n\r\nstatements  issued  by the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nwere  put  over  the radio. These were  discussed.\r\n\r\nThere were statements by the various Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  long  statements  read  over   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore. Though the Member for Mountbatten takes\r\n\r\na  great interest in radio, I suspect she does not\r\n\r\nlisten to enough of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards glorifying the Ministers, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  that, in fact, I did  read  out  an\r\n\r\nextract from the Straits Times last time in  which\r\n\r\nthey   indicated  their  disappointment  that   we\r\n\r\nproduced  a  film where, unlike previous  regimes,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  were  not  glorified  at  all.  We\r\n\r\nprobably  shot  a  short scene showing,  I  think,\r\n\r\nMinisters  digging trenches and  levelling  roads.\r\n\r\nBut  I  can  assure you that one of  the  standing\r\n\r\ninstructions  in  making  films  is  not  to  show\r\n\r\nMinisters in it. This year, for example,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSir,  we  have produced seven films in the  series,\r\n\r\n\"People's  Singapore\". One of the  things  we  tell\r\n\r\nthem  is that, unless it is of specific importance,\r\n\r\nMinisters  should not appear in the films.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe  film needs a particular scene of a school, and\r\n\r\nif  a  Minister has made a statement about schools,\r\n\r\nthen he\r\n\r\nmight  be shown in a short flash. But by and large,\r\n\r\nout of the thousands of feet of film that have been\r\n\r\nshown,  very  few Ministers have appeared.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Mountbatten and any  other  Opposition\r\n\r\nMember would like to spend, say, six hours and  run\r\n\r\nthrough  all the seven films that we have produced,\r\n\r\nthey  will  see very few shots of Ministers.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  prepared to take the Member for  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nalong and show her that one of our instructions  is\r\n\r\nthat  we do not want Ministers in the films. People\r\n\r\ndo  get tired seeing Ministers doing this and  that\r\n\r\nin films.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked, in a very broad sense, about the\r\n\r\nmisuse of propaganda media. These include the  News\r\n\r\nDivision, the News Services and so on. All  she  in\r\n\r\ndicated  was that we have not given the problem  of\r\n\r\nChinese  education  and  the  People's  Association\r\n\r\nenough play over the radio. We feel that enough  of\r\n\r\nit  has  been  said. If the Member for  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nwould  like to look at some of the scripts, she  is\r\n\r\nquite welcome to do so.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\narguing  over  the amount. I say the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nfailed to achieve what it has set out to achieve-to\r\n\r\nmake the public understand Government policy enough\r\n\r\nto  appreciate it. The fact that trouble has broken\r\n\r\nout  in  the quarters that I have mentioned - I  will\r\n\r\nnot  repeat it - shows that the attempt to  make  the\r\n\r\npublic understand has\r\n\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I make the procedure clear to\r\n\r\nthe   Member   for  Queenstown?

But  in  the meanwhile, I will  just  touch\r\n\r\nlightly on\r\n\r\nthe  matter and say that if it is a case of wanting\r\n\r\nthe  truth to be out, then it is only fair that the\r\n\r\nradio  should give a very fair report of  all  that\r\n\r\nhas happened !in this Assembly, instead of giving a\r\n\r\none-sided version over Radio P.A.P. But for a civil\r\n\r\nservant  to be pressured by the Minister  to  write\r\n\r\nthings  like that - you see, Sir, we understand  the\r\n\r\nposition  and we are not blaming the civil  servant\r\n\r\nat  all. We know what is exactly happening. Let  it\r\n\r\nbe clearly understood that when we say these things\r\n\r\nat  the  present moment, it is not that we want  to\r\n\r\nattack  the  civil servants. We are  attacking  the\r\n\r\nMinisters   behind   those  civil   servants,   the\r\n\r\nMinisters  who  force these civil  servants  to  do\r\n\r\nthings which they normally would never want to  do.\r\n\r\nAs everybody knows, we agree with the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprinciple,  which  the Prime Minister  himself  has\r\n\r\nenunciated,  that  the  civil  service  should   be\r\n\r\nneutral  and not only be neutral, Sir, but also  be\r\n\r\nvery  polite;  and in the writing of  any  letters,\r\n\r\npoliteness should be the keynote with the civil ser\r\n\r\nvants. That was one of the points raised yesterday,\r\n\r\nSir,  about  the  Central  Complaints  Bureau.  The\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy of civil servants was at one  time  the\r\n\r\nmain  complaint of P.A.P. Assemblymen and branches.\r\n\r\nThis led to the formation of the Central Complaints\r\n\r\nBureau. Therefore, if civil servants write letters,\r\n\r\nlet  the  Ministers behind them not force  them  to\r\n\r\nwrite  letters  that  may be  construed  that  they\r\n\r\nthemselves   are  entering  the  political   arena.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  any civil servant should go  into  the\r\n\r\npolitical  arena, then he would have  to  take  the\r\n\r\nconsequences. I am sure the Minister would not like\r\n\r\nthat  to happen.

I would just like to  follow  up\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Queenstown has  said  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  a  civil  servant  taking  sides  in\r\n\r\npolitical issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not like the P.A.P.

Sir, we realise that the  majority\r\n\r\nof  the people in the civil service are working for\r\n\r\ntheir  living.  In  so  far  as  their  duties  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  they  want to carry  them  out  to  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction   of   the   people   in   government,\r\n\r\nirrespective of what political Party is in  office.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir, we are disturbed to note that there  are\r\n\r\none  or two here and there who, so to say,  bend\r\n\r\nbackwards  to  please the Ministers. Sir,  we  feel\r\n\r\nthat  to  some extent it is understandable where  a\r\n\r\ncivil  servant  is  told to write  letters  with  a\r\n\r\ncertain   amount  of  political  overtone,  putting\r\n\r\nforward  the views of the Party in power. But  when\r\n\r\nit  comes to a civil servant who, as I  said,  bends\r\n\r\nbackwards  to  please the Ministers in  office  and\r\n\r\nperforms functions for which he is not in the first\r\n\r\nplace  paid,  and, secondly, performs duties  which\r\n\r\nare  in  contradiction  to  the  governing  General\r\n\r\nOrders  which  are  binding  on his  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice, then we feel it is time that we tell  such\r\n\r\ncivil  servants in quite plain and simple  language\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. Government is not going to  be  in\r\n\r\noffice for ever and ever -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Let us go on to the principle of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did point out, Sir, that I am not\r\n\r\ngoing to take the sort of line the P.A.P.

Nevertheless, I feel  it\r\n\r\nis  important  that  members of the  civil  service\r\n\r\nought  to  realise that no matter what pressure  is\r\n\r\napplied  by  those in power, they have a  duty  and\r\n\r\nthey will be within their rights in performing this\r\n\r\nduty  and be neutral and non-political. All that  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  say is this, Sir, that we do not want  to\r\n\r\nsee civil servants performing P.A.P. functions.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to see P.A.P. Ministers hiding behind\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants and letting the civil  servants\r\n\r\ncarry  out P.A.P. propaganda.

Now  I  want  to\r\n\r\nstress  specially that the Head of the Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDivision  should  keep his neutrality  because  the\r\n\r\nradio  broadcast cannot only be heard by the people\r\n\r\nhere  but can also be heard by the people in Malaya\r\n\r\nand the whole of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to raise one point. On Sunday, there\r\n\r\nwas  a radio programme reviewing the debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse  on merger. But in this review, the views  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis were unfairly treated. As Head\r\n\r\nof  the  Broadcasting Division, he  should  comment\r\n\r\nfairly  on  the  whole  debate  and  other  affairs\r\n\r\nconducted in this House. He should not be one-sided\r\n\r\nand   in   favour  of  the  Party  in  power.   The\r\n\r\ncommentator was, as far as I know, the Head of  the\r\n\r\nNews  Division,  Li  Vei-Chen.  The  Head  of   the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Division  must  try  to  avoid   this\r\n\r\nsituation;  otherwise, the neutrality of Government\r\n\r\nservants  will  not be maintained. I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  it was the Government's directive  to  the\r\n\r\nHead of the Broadcasting Division t, allow the Head\r\n\r\nof  the News Division to make such an unfair review\r\n\r\nof  the debate which was broadcast to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation. Therefore,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat   in  future  the  Head  of  the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDivision  should not make any unfair  criticism  or\r\n\r\ncomments  on the debate in the Assembly, especially\r\n\r\non the merger question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice one\r\n\r\nthing. When it comes to debating subjects like  the\r\n\r\nradio and films, vague general statements are  made\r\n\r\nlike  \"The Ministry has failed.\" What are the facts\r\n\r\non  which  you form that opinion? If you  just  say\r\n\r\nthat  the moon is made of cheese, you will have  to\r\n\r\ngive  a reason for saying so. Similarly, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa  Chu  Kang says that the  report  of  the\r\n\r\nmerger\r\n\r\ndebate  over the radio last Sunday was  unfair  and\r\n\r\nunjust.  Why?

I have some\r\n\r\ncopies here and one of the early letters reads,  'I\r\n\r\nam directed by the Minister to refer to your letter\r\n\r\n...'.  This referred to the invitation to the forum\r\n\r\nsent  to  the  Member for Queenstown. It  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear that this forum was at my suggestion. In view\r\n\r\nof   the   fact  that  merger  has  become - a   very\r\n\r\ncontroversial   and  important   question - I   did\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  various political  personalities  be\r\n\r\ninvited.  The  letter, as such, was  brief  and  it\r\n\r\nasked,  \"Would you come to the forum?\" Because  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown or some of his colleagues had\r\n\r\nshown  great reluctance to enter the arena, in  the\r\n\r\nnext  letter  it  started off with,  'I  have  been\r\n\r\ninstructed by the Minister to refer to your  letter\r\n\r\nof the 5th October . . . .'. It is quite clear that\r\n\r\nthese  letters were written to various  individuals\r\n\r\non  the instructions of the Minister concerned, and\r\n\r\nthat  the  civil servant was merely a  vehicle  for\r\n\r\ntransmitting  this invitation.

I think the rather  vague\r\n\r\nhints  about the P.A.P.

Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, a sum of $42,000 will be spent in\r\n\r\n1962  in connection with National Day Celebrations.\r\n\r\nI  feel  it is normal expenditure, but I  think  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  even more beneficial and  better  if  we\r\n\r\nabolish National Day celebrations in Singapore. One\r\n\r\nof  the  reasons is that the P.A.P. Government  and\r\n\r\nthe Alliance Government in the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  on  merger in a Greater  Malaysia  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the White Paper. Would  it  not  be\r\n\r\nout  of  place for Singapore to celebrate  National\r\n\r\nDay   celebrations?  What  sort  of  National   Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations?  Would it be Singapore  National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations or other National Day celebrations?  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  time  for us now to  create  a  true\r\n\r\nNational Day which will be celebrated by the entire\r\n\r\npeople  of  Malaysia. A vote has been provided  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  celebrate her own  National  Day  in\r\n\r\n1962,  but then in 1964 the big question will arise\r\n\r\nwhether we are going to celebrate National Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a difference in the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  celebrations carried  out  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  those carried  out  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  position of the  people  in  both\r\n\r\nterritories. To my mind, we should save this amount\r\n\r\nof   $42,000  and  spend  it  on  other   essential\r\n\r\nnecessities  which  would  benefit  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, U.M.N.O. has participated in\r\n\r\nNational Day celebrations, although originally  we\r\n\r\nwere opposed to the displaying of flags. It is not\r\n\r\nmy  intention  to support any Party,  but  I  feel\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a  show of strength  between  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  the Barisan Sosialis  when  the  time\r\n\r\ncomes  to celebrate National Day. Each Party  will\r\n\r\ntry  to  demonstrate its strength in the  hope  of\r\n\r\nconvincing those present that one is stronger than\r\n\r\nthe  other  with  an  eye to  forming  the  future\r\n\r\ngovernment. As far as the P.A.P. is concerned, the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  proposals are going ahead.  If  Malaysia\r\n\r\ncelebrates  National  Day, a conflicting  position\r\n\r\nwill  arise. For instance, in 1964, the Federation\r\n\r\nMilitary Forces, the Federation Regiment  and  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Regiment  or the Malaysian  Regiment  which\r\n\r\nwill be formed will take part in the parade in the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. But if it is also  held  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - I do not know what the defence  position\r\n\r\nwill  then  be - I think the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwill also take part. In addition, the question  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Anthem will arise. If we  celebrate,\r\n\r\nwe  will certainly not forget our National Anthem,\r\n\r\nbut  then  the question will arise  as  to  a  new\r\n\r\nNational Anthem for Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Culture will clarify the\r\n\r\nexact position with regard to this item.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is\r\n\r\nMalaysia, obviously there will be many changes  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world. National Day, the National\r\n\r\nAnthem  of Singapore, Merdeka Day, and so on  will\r\n\r\nactually have to fit into the context of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nObviously Malaysia National Day will have priority\r\n\r\nover  all  other functions. Therefore, I  want  to\r\n\r\nkeep it open and cannot state here and now whether\r\n\r\nNational  Day will be abolished. But National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations will definitely take on  a  different\r\n\r\ncharacter,  so  long as National Day  is  a  State\r\n\r\ncelebration, and what we\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncall  the  National  Anthem  will  become  a  State\r\n\r\nanthem. So the character of these celebrations will\r\n\r\ncertainly  change - but  in  what  way  and  in  what\r\n\r\ndegree, it is too early for me to say. But I  quite\r\n\r\nagree  with the Member that National Day  certainly\r\n\r\ncannot  have  the importance that  we  give  to  it\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me say one thing: the purpose\r\n\r\nof  National Day is not only a State festival,  but\r\n\r\nis  also  used as a means of driving  home  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious communities in Singapore the concept  of  a\r\n\r\ncommon identity, of a common purpose. Even after we\r\n\r\nget  Malaysia,  we  will have to  do  something  to\r\n\r\ndramatise   by   way  of  popular  participation - as\r\n\r\nNational  Day  seeks to do - the sense  of  a  common\r\n\r\nidentity,  of  people getting together  to  declare\r\n\r\ntheir  faith,  their willingness, their  readiness,\r\n\r\nand  their  determination to become a nation.  That\r\n\r\nfunction can be taken over if and when they  decide\r\n\r\non  a  Malaysia  National Day or Malaysia  Day,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case  the date would certainly not  coincide\r\n\r\nwith  June 3rd but with the day when Malaysia comes\r\n\r\ninto being. So until such time as that happens,  we\r\n\r\nhave to keep on with our National Day celebrations,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  hope  would  become  progressively   less\r\n\r\nimportant  in  scope,  less and  less  national  in\r\n\r\ncharacter,  and  become  more  and  more  a   State\r\n\r\nfunction and a State celebration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Committee of Review, I hope they  will  bye\r\n\r\nable  to relax their blanket ban on books, so  that\r\n\r\nmore  publications from all over the world may come\r\n\r\ninto Singapore. The Prime Minister himself has said\r\n\r\non   many  occasions  that  he  would  prefer  open\r\n\r\ndiscussion  to  inhibition and  ban  on  books  and\r\n\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nLet  him  really live up to his words - let  all  the\r\n\r\nbooks  that the people want come in.

Assemblymen, a lot of improvement has\r\n\r\nalready taken place in the department. There is not\r\n\r\nso  much  bureacracy now. There is hardly any  more\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy. But we are still wondering  when  they\r\n\r\nwill  release  their stranglehold on the  grant  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights to people who have been  in  the\r\n\r\nforefront of the anticolonial struggle.  A  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople,  because of their not having  been  granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship, have not been able to get jobs. For  a\r\n\r\ngovernment that professes the socialist  creed,  to\r\n\r\ndeny   citizenship  rights  to   people   who   are\r\n\r\nprogressive and socialist in outlook is  definitely\r\n\r\nnot  the  correct thing to do. A number  of  people\r\n\r\nwanted   jobs   as  teachers  or  jobs   in   other\r\n\r\ndepartments, but because their citizenship had been\r\n\r\nheld  up, and because it is the requirement of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government that all applicants  must  be\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, therefore, these  people  were\r\n\r\ndenied a chance to get jobs in the Government.  Not\r\n\r\nonly jobs in the Government, Sir, but also work  as\r\n\r\nseamen.  I  understand  that certain  people,  just\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  delay  in  their  being  granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights, have not been able to go to sea\r\n\r\nand  get jobs as seamen. I hope the Government will\r\n\r\nlook  into this and reorientate its policy so  that\r\n\r\nall  the people who have been most forward in their\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle will  be  given  their  due\r\n\r\nelementary and basic human rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Member for Queenstown has just now claimed\r\n\r\nthat  we ban all publications coming from China  or\r\n\r\nother iron curtain countries. In the first place, I\r\n\r\nmust deny this entirely.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publications from Communist countries, especially\r\n\r\nthose  from China, have not been altogether banned.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Queenstown also says that all books\r\n\r\nor  publications on socialism are  not  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncome  into  Singapore. This allegation is  baseless\r\n\r\nand  not  factual. By his making  such  a  baseless\r\n\r\nallegation,  we can see that in the past,  when  he\r\n\r\nwas  Parliamentary Secretary in my Ministry, he did\r\n\r\nnot  get  himself  to understand  the  work  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Perhaps what he was interested  in  were\r\n\r\nyellow  publications, because I remember that  when\r\n\r\nwe  banned some yellow publications this  year,  he\r\n\r\nasked me why I should ban them. He said he did  not\r\n\r\nsee any reason why they, should be banned. That  is\r\n\r\nwhat he told me at that time. Of course, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown is a doctor. Maybe he could have  a\r\n\r\ndetached view of such publications, as though he is\r\n\r\ntreating  his  patients  without  any  discernable\r\n\r\nemotion. But we are not concerned with whether the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown is a doctor or not.  Because\r\n\r\nhe  has  long experience, he is less likely  to  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  undesirable  publications.  But  to\r\n\r\nyoung  people in general, it is necessary to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  their  mental and spiritual  health  are  not\r\n\r\ncorrupted. Of course, to the Member for Queenstown,\r\n\r\nsuch  publications pose no question at all.  I  can\r\n\r\ntell   him  further  that  when  we  banned  yellow\r\n\r\npublications, the Member for Nee Soon, who was  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health,\r\n\r\nalso  said that these should not be banned. So from\r\n\r\nthe  allegation  he made just now, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  is  perhaps  only  interested  in  free\r\n\r\nimportation and sale of yellow publications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, it was a pity the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown did not give the Minister for Finance  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  speak.  He was referring  to  socialist\r\n\r\npublications.  I  can  tell the  Member  that  such\r\n\r\npublications have not been banned. All  progressive\r\n\r\npublications  are welcomed by us. Maybe  he  cannot\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between  Communist  publications   and\r\n\r\nsocialist publications. We\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  banned  many  publications  of  a  Communist\r\n\r\nnature.  Our  policy in this respect is  generally\r\n\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nAll publications in praise of the Communist way of\r\n\r\nlife  and  advocating  unconstitutional  means  to\r\n\r\noverthrow  the  government and publications  of  a\r\n\r\npurely  propaganda  nature  must,  of  course,  be\r\n\r\nbanned and will continue to be banned. But we will\r\n\r\nnot  ban classical works by Marx and Lenin. If the\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang does not know about this,\r\n\r\nthen  he  is  not  clear about  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.   Even  in  the  case   of   Communist\r\n\r\npublications  we  consider each case  as  its  own\r\n\r\nmerit  whether it should or should not be  banned.\r\n\r\nFor  example, some publications have been sent  to\r\n\r\nUniversity  professors. If they  can  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese  publications will not be  abused,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  consider their cases and allow them to  have\r\n\r\nthe books.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, I ask them to consider the Report\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Review Committee of the  P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nReview  Committee has made recommendations to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and these have been accepted.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe     recommendations     concerns     socialist\r\n\r\npublications.   It   is   recommended   that   all\r\n\r\nliterature and songs imported from other countries\r\n\r\nwill be allowed as long as they do not incite  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  do  unconstitutional  things  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, and as long as they benefit the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore socially and intellectually. That is our\r\n\r\nattitude  in regard to censorship of publications.\r\n\r\nWe  can say that our system of censorship is a bit\r\n\r\nmore  lax  than that in the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nBut  it must be understood that in deciding on our\r\n\r\npolicy  of  censorship, we must also consider  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Federation of Malaya, because Malaya\r\n\r\nand  Singapore are only separated by the  Causeway\r\n\r\nand the chances of circulating publications in the\r\n\r\nFederation  are  very great. Books circulating  in\r\n\r\nSingapore can easily go into the Federation. At  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  we are trying to struggle  for  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation, we must try to stop all acts\r\n\r\nand  influences which are detrimental to our fight\r\n\r\nfor  merger  and  to  the building  of  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nconsciousness,   although  the  intermingling   of\r\n\r\ncultures  should  be encouraged  between  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I can tell the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nthat when he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, he did not pay attention\r\n\r\nto  certain facts. It is this. Some books had  been\r\n\r\nbanned by the Lim Yew Hock Government. But when the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. took  office,  these  banned  books   were\r\n\r\nreviewed and some of them were released. Since June\r\n\r\n1959,  wheat  the  ban  on books  published  by  53\r\n\r\npublishing companies was reviewed, some 8,500 books\r\n\r\nhave been released by the P.A.P. Government. So  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  clearly that the allegation made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown is groundless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship and the\r\n\r\nCitizenship   Registry,  I  will  say   this.   The\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  Citizenship  Registry   is\r\n\r\nalways  in our minds. We always try to improve  the\r\n\r\nwork  of the Registry and we have done a great deal\r\n\r\nin   this  respect.  I  can  tell  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  if he does not know about  this,  that\r\n\r\nall   genuine  nationalists  have  not  had   their\r\n\r\napplications    for   citizenship   refused.    All\r\n\r\nprogressive people whose citizenship was denied  by\r\n\r\nthe  Lim Yew Hock Government have, during our  term\r\n\r\nof  office, had their cases reviewed by us and many\r\n\r\nof  these cases have been approved. Therefore, such\r\n\r\nallegations  are not based on facts.  There  is  no\r\n\r\npoint for me therefore to reply to them one by one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  was not prepared to speak,  but  after\r\n\r\nhearing  the  Minister for Home  Affairs,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere is something which is not quite true. He says\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  now  having  discussions  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya on merger. Since merger is now\r\n\r\nin  view, he is afraid that certain books  will  be\r\n\r\ncirculated  in  the Federation of Malaya.  On  this\r\n\r\npoint,  I  will say we know that the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has banned books published by 53 publishing\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Any book published by any of  these  53\r\n\r\npublishing  companies  will be  banned.  Since  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government   is   negotiating   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government on merger, perhaps  this  may\r\n\r\nmaterialise. The P.A.P. Government is always trying\r\n\r\nto comply\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwith  the many policies and laws of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya. It has taken steps to ban certain books\r\n\r\nand  has  also lifted the ban on certain books.  I\r\n\r\nthink in the earlier period perhaps there was such\r\n\r\na  practice, but if it is still the practice, then\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid the P.A.P. type of merger  will  not\r\n\r\ntake  place  easily,  because,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs, these books  will  he\r\n\r\ncirculated in the Federation of Malaya. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya will oppose the inflow of\r\n\r\nsuch books into their territory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not want to\r\n\r\ninconvenience  you,  Sir, but since  the  Minister\r\n\r\nused  Mandarin,  I too want to  reply  to  him  in\r\n\r\nMandarin.  He  said  I could  not  understand  the\r\n\r\naffairs and the administration of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs. I want to say that it is because  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it  too  well that  I  have  left  the\r\n\r\nMinistry!   There  are  many  things  inside   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  which  cannot be  disclosed  to  outside\r\n\r\npeople.  When I was there, I saw all those  things\r\n\r\nwith my own eyes. If these things are disclosed to\r\n\r\nthe  public of Singapore, then I do not think  the\r\n\r\npublic  will  let  them  escape  so  easily.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  mentioned just now  certain  things\r\n\r\nrelating to the anti-yellow culture campaign.  But\r\n\r\nI  want to tell the Minister for Home Affairs that\r\n\r\nit is most important that one must not pretend. If\r\n\r\nanything  needs to be countered, then counter  it.\r\n\r\nIt  should  not be said that anything relating  to\r\n\r\nthe anatomy of the human body is something yellow,\r\n\r\nand  therefore to be countered. Perhaps  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister was a bachelor, he had different views on\r\n\r\ncertain things. He was entitled to his own  views.\r\n\r\nBut if he had been an older man, perhaps his views\r\n\r\nwould not have been so contradictory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs also says that the\r\n\r\nban  on  many books has been lifted and that  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  allowed to be imported into Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  and the Minister for Finance always talk about\r\n\r\nMao  Tse-tung,  that Mao says this  and  Mao  says\r\n\r\nthat.  But has the Minister for Home Affairs  ever\r\n\r\nallowed books written by Mao Tse-tung to be\r\n\r\nimported into Singapore for us to see.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  read? As true non-Communist, Socialists,  they\r\n\r\nshould  allow  certain books to  be  imported  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  should  also  allow  books   from\r\n\r\nvarious countries, other than America and the Right-wing  countries  to  come into Singapore.  If  they\r\n\r\nthink  they  can win the ideological  battle,  then\r\n\r\nthey  should allow free competition of  thought  by\r\n\r\npermitting  these  certain  books  to   come   into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to touch upon what the\r\n\r\nMinister   says   about  the  anti-yellow   culture\r\n\r\ncampaign. There is a book called Huo Tih Hui I (The\r\n\r\nReminiscences   of  Fire).  This  book   has   been\r\n\r\nclassified  under the category of \"yellow  books.\".\r\n\r\nMay I ask him whether this book is really yellow or\r\n\r\nred or white? Or what colour is it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  first,  I   want to tell  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  that it is only because we are  a  non-Communist Socialist Party that we have no  duty  to\r\n\r\npropagandize  for the Communists  or  to  propagate\r\n\r\nCommunism   on   their  behalf.  The   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  should enumerate facts to  substantiate\r\n\r\nhis  allegations. When we have reviewed these books\r\n\r\nwhich  are  nothing but propaganda  for  Communism,\r\n\r\nthen, of course, we will ban them. It does not mean\r\n\r\nto say that we are siding with any particular side.\r\n\r\nI  can  tell him that many books from Formosa  have\r\n\r\nbeen  detained, although we have not disclosed this\r\n\r\nto  the local Press. In the same way, many American\r\n\r\nbooks,  since  they were entirely of  a  propaganda\r\n\r\nnature, were also banned. There are two ways to  go\r\n\r\nabout it: one is to publish in the Gazette the  ban\r\n\r\non  these  books. The other way is to  detain  them\r\n\r\nwithout  publicity. If the books are few in number,\r\n\r\nthen  we usually detain them. Such publications  as\r\n\r\nAmerica  Today  or The World today  or  books  from\r\n\r\nFormosa, The New World and The Present Continent of\r\n\r\nRed   China,  are  all  detained.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  says  that  when he  was  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to me, my views on certain  things  were\r\n\r\ndifferent from those I hold now, because I was then\r\n\r\na  bachelor.  But  I want to tell him  about  these\r\n\r\nbooks  which  he  deems not to be  \"yellow\"  books.\r\n\r\nThese   are   novels  exploiting  sex,  crime   and\r\n\r\nimmorality for base ends.

We must not make it easy for certain\r\n\r\nbooks  to be circulated in the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nto  embarrass the Government there. If we  want  to\r\n\r\nhave  merger with the Federation of Malaya, we must\r\n\r\nnot  take  any step or measure which will  put  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya  in  a  very   embarrassing\r\n\r\nposition. Therefore, the censoring of books  cannot\r\n\r\nbe carried out in isolation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it being 8 p.m. Mr Deputy Speaker left the\r\n\r\nChair  of the Committee and took the Chair of the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to\r\n\r\nreport  that  the  Committee  of  Supply  has  made\r\n\r\nprogress  on the Main Estimates, and ask  leave  to\r\n\r\nsit again tomorrow, 13th of December.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Tomorrow then.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"-\r\n\r\n[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
