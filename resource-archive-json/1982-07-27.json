The law requires that applications for liquor licences be submitted to the Board not less than 30 days before the date of the meeting of the Board. This was because it would take about that length of time for the licence applications to be processed. The applications have to be cleared with other Government authorities, such as the Police and the Environmental Health Department. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the practice of publishing notices of the quarterly meetings of the Board in the Government Gazette has been discontinued.

We are aware that some hawkers generate less refuse than others because of their different business or trade. However, the $10 per month levy is very much lower than the $20 per month minimum charge on non-domestic premises for the daily refuse removal and disposal. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two stages in the collection of refuse from HDB Hawker Centres for disposal. First, the HDB collects and removes the refuse to a bin centre. The service and conservancy charges imposed by the HDB is partly to pay for this service and these charges will remain unchanged.

One of our first tasks therefore is to carefully determine the staging programme and time-table to be adopted for the construction. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing maximum relief to traffic congestion is a major consideration. But there are other equally important factors. One, for instance, is our objective of maximizing the development potential of our Central Area and the reclaimed land in Marina South. And whilst the Member for Kebun Baru has rightly identified the north-south corridor as deserving top priority from the standpoint of traffic congestion, it is the east-west line - not the north-south line \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> - that is expected to carry the most passengers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, engineering considerations must be taken into account. For example, the first section of the line should be linked to the depot. We also have to spread investment over a number of years in a way that would not overheat the economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me add that regardless of which of the two lines comes into operation first, it does not mean that we have to complete the first line before commencing work on the second line. The staging programme may well be staggered in such a manner that part of the second line could come on-stream shortly after the first line is completed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now studying the matter more carefully, and hope to have more positive answers within a month or two. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Increase in contributions)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour what were the compelling reasons for the latest increase in the contributions to the Central Provident Fund exacted from employees and employers and if he realizes that in the cases where the employer does not implement the NWC award the employee will suffer a reduction in his wages. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson regards CPF contributions as an exaction. The Oxford English Dictionary gives the following definition of the word \"Exaction\":- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The action of demanding or requiring more than is due or customary; an illegal or exorbitant demand; extortion; an arbitrary and excessive impost.' \n  <br> \n  <br>As the Member is a lawyer, one must assume that he chooses and uses his words with care and deliberation. If so, he clearly does not understand how Singapore's economy works, and how CPF contributions play a pivotal role in our economic growth. I cannot possibly dispel his ignorance of the subject within the time at my disposal. I can only try my best. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of growth of an economy, that is, how fast new jobs are generated and people's incomes increase year by year, depends to an important degree on capital formation. This means the construction of new factories, installation of new plant and equipment, expansion of infrastructure - roads, ports, telecommunications, etc. building of houses and so on. These desirable facilities do not fall like manna from heaven. They do not come about because politicians preach compassion and talk about a caring society. They have to be paid for in hard cash. Of course, a government heading for bankruptcy can borrow from foreign banks in the Euro-market, for instance, at exorbitant rates of interest. Worse still, the government can print notes and the result is runaway inflation. Some governments do both these things and the country runs into big trouble. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government does not resort to trickeries of this kind. We know that capital formation must come out of savings by people and entrepreneurs. That is why over the years, rates of CPF contributions have proportionately been increased even as we have increased wages. The result has been a high rate of economic growth and an increase of both incomes and savings. That is to say, both take-home pay and CPF contributions have increased. This has made it possible for Singapore to achieve what Professor Walt Rostow called \"the take-off into self-sustaining economic growth\". Very few Third World countries have achieved this take-off. The reasons are manifold but two common features are found in these unhappy countries. First, a lack of effective government and second, an abundance of political opportunists. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, gross fixed capital formation in Singapore was $11,158.1 million out of a gross domestic product of $27,279.5 million, or 40.9%. This compares with 32.0% for Japan, 31.8% for South Korea, 17.8% for the UK and 18.2% for the US, just to take a few examples. Third World countries generally register 15% or less and hence their poor rates of economic growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public housing programmes would not have been possible on the scale achieved but for CPF savings. 69% of Singaporeans are decently housed in HDB \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> estates. Further, accumulated CPF funds have allowed large numbers of Singaporeans to own their homes. No less than 228,459 families, or 64% of those living in HDB estates, are proud home-owners. As at the end of 1981, home-owners have withdrawn $3,175 million from their CPF contributions to pay for instalments on home purchases. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the Member's question, where the employer does not implement the NWC wage increases, the employee will suffer a reduction of wages, 1% to be exact. Employers who cannot give wage increases are of two kinds. They may be inefficient or uncompetitive. It is better that they close down and release workers to those who can afford to pay better wages. Or they may be in what the Japanese call \"sun-set industries\", that is, industries in which most firms are uncompetitive for one reason or another. Here again, the solution is to let the sun set quietly and as painlessly as possible. The workers so displaced can easily get new jobs elsewhere provided our economic growth is sustained at a high rate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson does not understand that in an economy short of labour as a result of fast economic growth, wages must rise and employers who cannot afford to pay higher wages should either improve on their performance or give way to more efficient employers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to the Hon. Minister for his long speech in answer to my question. As I understand the Minister, the compelling reason for this increase was the need to find money for the improvement of the economy of the country. But surely is there not another consideration and, that is, the capacity or the ability of the wage earner to give up so much of his earnings towards the CPF? A man who is earning $500 a month today is giving up $110 of his income every month. That is a hefty proportion. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, let me have your supplementary question, please. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister not think that the ability or the capacity of the wage earner to give up a hefty portion of his wages should also be taken into consideration? And will what is left of it be sufficient for him to meet the rising cost of living? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson obviously was not listening carefully to my answer. The CPF contribution is a saving. The employee is not giving it up. I have explained earlier that this saving is necessary for security purposes -for his old age and to help him to own a home. Without CPF savings, this home ownership scheme would not have been possible. Singapore will not have achieved the housing programme that we have achieved so far. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister please say whether or not consideration has been given to whether the wage earner will be able to save that amount without suffering a reduction in his living standard for the present? May I ask the Minister whether it is not like telling a starving man, \"Look, you can't have the bread today. We are going to keep the bread for you for tomorrow.\" Tomorrow may never come for him. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not see the point. Nobody is starving in Singapore. As to his point about whether, in working out the rate of CPF contributions, the Government has taken into account the ability of the employee to save, my answer is yes, that has been taken into account. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>COMMITTEE ON PROBLEMS OF THE AGED</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Objectives and programmes)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Health the objectives and programmes of the Committee which was formed recently to study the problems of the aged and to state the types or areas of problems that will be looked into by this Committee, and whether community or civic organizations in constituencies can be of any assistance to this Committee and, if so, what are the specific areas where such cooperation can be made. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Howe Yoon Chong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the objectives of the \"Committee on Problems of the Aged\" are outlined in its Terms of Reference and are in two parts. Firstly, the Committee will study the general problems affecting the increasing numbers of people over 60 years old in our population, their repercussions to our society, and to recommend measures to prevent, ameliorate, and deal with those problems. Secondly, the Committee will focus particular attention on eight specified areas and make recommendations to deal with them; viz, how to - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) change accepted ideas and attitudes of society towards old age; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) change entrenched practices towards compulsory retirement; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) adjust employment patterns and create more job opportunities for older people; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) enable older workers with reduced incomes to continue to lead a normal active life; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) provide medical examinations to monitor the physical and mental health of the older people; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) foster greater filial piety and responsibility so that children and relaives will support and look after their parents and elders; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) grant assistance and encouragement to charitable and religious organizations to set up homes for those aged people who cannot look after themselves and have no one to depend on; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) consider legislation to require certain religious institutions to be licensed, and in so doing to stipulate that they must run homes for the aged as well as to ensure that all homes for the aged are properly run. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Terms of Reference are comprehensive and hence the programmes of the Committee must attempt to cover every facet of the problems related to the increasing numbers of older people in our community. In the 1980 Census some 7.2% of the population are above the age of 60 years. Improvements to our economy, social welfare, and medical services have, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> raised life expectancy and by the year 2000 the over-60 age group will comprise more than 10% of the population. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory retirement requires a person to stop work at a cut-off age irrespective of his physical condition and competence to make further contributions in his job.,Continuing advances in medical science and technology will extend the life expectancy of many senior citizens to 80 years and beyond. The Committee will conduct studies on how our citizens should prepare for old age. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal for the Committee will be to permit the average citizen not to remain a work-horse all his life, but to suggest that he should make plans on how and when he should slow down long before he is due to retire. At an appropriate stage in his life he should be able to decide that he need not necessarily put in the full 42 hours each week till he reaches 60 years, but rather that in his own long term interests he can work shorter hours or opt for a lesser work load. His surplus or spare hours can be spent on activities from which he derives joy and satisfaction or on making contributions to the community. Psychologically an active mind keeps an active body, while an active body in turn nurtures an active mind. A person in enforced idleness will decline rapidly in mind and body. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has laid down certain guidelines to get on with its work. It welcomes recommendations and representations from community and civic organizations, knowledgeable professionals and experts on the subject of old age, as well as from members of the public, on the general problems of the increasing numbers of older people in our society and also on the eight specific areas that I have outlined. Those who wish to put forward their views to the Committee can do so in writing or in the form of a memorandum. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our citizens should be advised to prepare for old age long before they face the problems. In this respect the Committee will look into recommendations for improvements to our maternity and child welfare service, school health and preventive and public health services which cover \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the first of the three segments of a person's life span. During this segment of life from birth to the age of 18 years, the foundations of a person's physical well-being will be decided. Should adequate attention have been paid to child nutrition and welfare, immunization procedures and preventive measures against diseases to ensure healthy growth, and should proper physical education, training, and health education and physical exercises be encouraged in schools, then our citizens will at an early age form the habit of keeping physically fit throughout life. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second segment covers the person's working life from the age of 19 to 55 or 60 years. During this period, the citizen's responsibilities will gradually increase as he forms his family, acquires a home, brings up and educates his children, and strives to improve his earnings to provide beyond the necessities of life. Should he be taught the virtues of filial piety, he would demonstrate this by his own example and should his three-tier family be living together, his children will have the benefits of a closely-knit entity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he approaches 50 years of age his children would have completed their education and obtained employment on their own. His responsibilities towards the family will begin to lessen and his burden becomes lighter. He can begin to plan in terms of the third segment of his life from 55 years and beyond. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's main concern is with this third segment of life when most of the problems of old age citizens can arise. If more preparations had been made in the earlier two segments, the chances are that the problems can be reduced to manageable proportions. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society is in the process of transition from the old to the new. Under the old dispensation, most of our people had to struggle very hard to earn low wages, to eke out a subsistence level of livelihood, to raise their children, and to maintain a family. There was not much time or money to spare to think in terms of providing for old age. Many worked up to 60 years and even beyond to keep body and soul \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> together. Having suffered from the ravages of poverty, malnutrition, illness and disease in their early lives, many of our older citizens are at a stage of life when their need for medical, financial, and other welfare attention and assistance will increase in the next 20 years. The Committee will be investigating these areas to suggest how best attention and assistance should be provided. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new dispensation, with the efforts of the Government in various fields of maternity and child welfare, better education, better employment opportunities, higher incomes, and better medical and social welfare services, life expectancy has been extended. But in our modern urbanized and industrialized society, increasing affluence has brought with it problems of pollution of various kinds, stress and strain both at home and in the workplace, increasing numbers of motor vehicles, and fast lifestyles as well as undesirable eating habits, drug addiction, etc. These have counter-acted the benefits of modern medical science and advances in technology, and today more and more of our people are suffering from serious often incurable illnesses long before they get to the third segment of life. These illnesses include cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diseases of the respiratory system, and other new illnesses that are constantly being discovered by medical science, plus accidents on our roads, at the workplace, and at home. It may be necessary for the Committee to pay attention to these problems. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee includes representatives from the NTUC, the Employer's Federation, the Chambers of Commerce, the Ministries of Health, Social Affairs, Trade and Industry, and Labour as well as well-known social workers. They will all help to identify the problems and make recommendations. However, the problems of the aged are not new or peculiar to Singapore. Hence, rather than reinventing the wheel, the Committee plans to seek advice, to collect information and to learn from the experiences of other countries like UK, US Australia, and Japan. These will go a long way towards assisting the Committee in its deliberations. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of Japan in dealing with problems of their old age citizens may be of particular significance. Mr Wee Mon Cheng, our former Ambassador to Japan, can make invaluable contributions not only from his personal knowledge of the Japanese society but also to establish contacts to obtain information, official documents, and published materials of the Japanese experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our senior consultant physicians in the Ministry of Health have been looking after many of our older people in the community. Their experience will be invaluable to the Committee not only on how best to deal with health problems but, more importantly, how to avoid or prevent them before they become very serious. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has set itself the target to complete its work in one year. Its recommendations will involve many Government Ministries and will require the cooperation of a wide range of public and private sector organizations including the NTUC, the Employers' Federation, the Chambers of Commerce and Industry, professional and welfare associations, religious groups, and other community and civic organizations. The scope of the Committee's enquiry is so wide that it prefers not to spell out the specific areas where it would like recommendations, suggestions and assistance from the Government bodies, public organizations, community and civic groups, or for that matter from Members of Parliament and their constituencies. The Committee welcomes views and suggestions from those who are able to make representations to it and I can assure the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan that the Committee will carefully study any representation that he may care to make. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Mechanization of cleansing operations)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Liew Kok Pun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Liew Kok Pun</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Housing and Development Board has examined the feasibility of mechanizing the present labour-intensive method of cleaning the common corridors of its flats. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yock Suan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Develop ment Board has conducted studies to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of machines to perform estate cleansing operations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies have identified two major areas where mechanization can be intro duced.

In September 1981, the National Computer Board (NCB) was established to carry out the statutory functions recommended by the Committee on National Computerization. Funds were provided by the Ministry of Finance for the implementation of the Civil Service Computerization Programme in the fiscal year 1982 covering computer projects in the Ministries of Communications, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Environment, Finance (that is, the Customs and Excise Department), Health, Home Affairs, National Development, Trade and Industry, Social Affairs and Education. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computerization projects in the various Ministries are progressing satisfactorily. The NCB staff, with the cooperation of the Ministries and the Departments' officers, have studied the operational systems and procedures in the respective Ministries to establish the detailed requirements for computer hardware and software. To date, three public tenders have been called for the supply of computer hardware for the Department of Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Meteorological Service Department. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem encountered in carrying out the Civil Service Computerization Programme is the acute shortage of senior and experienced computer personnel in Singapore. At present, there are about 1,200 computer professionals in Singapore as compared to an estimated demand of 1,500 to service both the public sector and the private sector. The demand for computer personnel is projected to increase to 5,800 by 1990. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of training schemes have been worked out to increase the supply of trained computer personnel. The Computer Science Department of the National University of Singapore (NUS) has increased its intake by over 50% since 1980. The Institute of Systems Science (ISS) has been set up at the NUS to train graduates to be systems analysts. The Japan-Singapore Institute of Software Technology (JSIST) and the Centre for Computing Studies (CCS) at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic will increase the supply of programmers/analysts. The National Computer Board has also set up the Systems Education Centre (SEC) as its own training arm. This centre will provide practiceoriented training for working computer professionals. In addition, the NCB has awarded 12 undergraduate and five postgraduate scholarships tenable in reputable universities this year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to provide the specific answers to the second part of the question. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An estimated 1,200 business establishments have installed computer facilities.

Half of the oil which is consumed in Singapore is used to generate electricity. We have no oil wells of our own. We have to import and pay the going market price for every drop of oil that we use. In 1981, the PUB spent $803 million on fuel oil, $206 million or 35% more than in 1980. Unfortunately, oil is a depleting natural resource. Barring periods of temporary glut, as at present, we can expect the price of oil to rise relentlessly. There is no way that we can prevent the rise in oil price and therefore of our electricity tariff. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, however, contain the effects of rising oil price by adopting correct policies: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Becoming more efficient in our generation of electricity and less wasteful in our daily use of electricity in homes, offices and factories; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Upgrading our skills so that we can produce better quality and higher-valued exports to pay for higher priced oil and electricity; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the long term, diversifying to alternative sources of energy, such as coal, for the generation of electricity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we must never do. We must never pretend that we can, by some fiscal or budgetary magic, restrain the increases in the price of oil or electricity by resorting to subsidies. To subsidize consumption is to inflate demand. The subsidies inevitably become an unbearable burden. When the subsidies are removed, as they must be at some stage, there will be a sharp jump in price leading to social and economic disruption. This has happened so often in other countries that I do not need to belabour the point. The sound, economically sensible way is to allow oil price increases to be passed on to the consumers as soon as possible. Increase in electricity tariffs will then be more gradual and consumers will be better able to adjust their consumption and their budget. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>PUB's Present Electricity Tariff System</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board is guided by this sound principle in its electricity tariff policy. I shall now elaborate on how the principle is applied by the PUB. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generation of electricity requires fuel oil, manpower and plant equipment. Manpower costs form a relatively small part of the cost of running this capital-intensive operation. Once the plant and equipment are installed, changes in the cost of electricity generation come primarily through changes in fuel cost. This is reflected in the PUB electricity tariff schedule, which has two parts, the basic tariff and the fuel adjustment charge. Manpower and equipment costs and the basic fuel price are recovered through the basic tariff which is based on a fuel oil price of $260 per tonne, equivalent to US$18 per barrel. The basic tariff is not changed when fuel prices increase. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases in fuel oil prices are recovered through the fuel adjustment charge. When fuel oil price goes up, the fuel adjustment charge is moved up in accordance with a fixed formula stipulated in the Public Utilities (Tariffs for Electricity) Regulations, 1972, enabling this cost increase to be recovered equitably from all classes of consumers. To assist Members, I have circulated a note (Annex 1) (Cols. 79 - 90) containing some illustrations on how the fuel adjustment charge works. [Copies distributed to Hon. Members] \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820727/19820727-HA-0420079.htm\">Annex 1 - PUB ELECTRICITY TARIFF SYSTEM (Cols. 79 - 90)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to touch on the two types of prices in the oil market. First, there is the official or posted price, which is declared by the oil companies or producers for the purpose of determining the price charged for oil supplied on a contract basis. Second, there is the spot price, quoted for individual cargoes of oil purchased without any long-term contract. The spot price depends on the immediate supply and demand position and fluctuates widely. At the height of the oil crisis in 1979-80, the price for crude oil in the spot market exceeded US$40 per barrel at one stage while during the recent glut, it fell to as low as US$28 per barrel. In recent weeks the spot price has risen to US$33 per barrel, which is close to the official price of US$34 per barrel. Oil transacted in the spot market forms only a small portion of the total oil traded. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB purchases its fuel oil from oil companies in Singapore under 5-year contracts with the prices pegged to posted prices and not to the spot market prices. Price of fuel oil to PUB is therefore more stable than would otherwise be the case. Thus, when the spot market for oil went above US$40 per barrel in 1980, PUB was paying the much lower price of US$27 per barrel. Correspondingly, when spot prices fall below the posted prices, PUB has to take delivery of its oil supply at the posted price in accordance with its contract. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB's long term contracts for fuel oil have served us well. Because PUB's suppliers have an obligation to try their very best to meet our requirements, we avoided disruption to our oil supply during the oil crisis in 1973-74 and 1979-80. Unlike some countries, we did not have to ration the use of electricity. Also, we were spared from having to pay the astronomical spot market price at the time, which would have taxed our financial resources. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel oil prices under PUB's long-term contracts are varied as and when the posted price of fuel oil is adjusted in accordance with the official price of crude oil as announced by the producer countries. Hence, PUB's fuel oil cost can go up during the term of the contract and PUB has to recover this cost-increase through the fuel adjustment charge which I described earlier. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1973, the PUB has recovered the cost of oil price increases on five occasions, in November 1973, January 1974, May 1979, August 1979 and March 1980. Posted prices have actually moved up more than five times since 1973 but PUB has allowed small increases to accumulate before adjusting the tariff. To do this, PUB has a Fuel Equalization Reserve. This is actually a buffer fund. When the fuel adjustment charge is greater than the actual fuel price paid by PUB, the difference is transferred to the reserve. When it is the other way around, the reserve is drawn down until it is exhausted, at which point the fuel adjustment charge has to be raised. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no one is happy when tariffs are increased, the PUB practice has worked satisfactorily. Consumers have adjusted to the higher price of oil and of electricity. We have become more efficient in our usage of energy. In 1973, every 1% increase in our GDP required 1.6% increase in electricity supply. By 1981, every 1% increase in GDP required only 0.75% increase in electricity supply. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>New System of Electricity Tariff</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the existing system of passing on fuel oil cost increases has served us well, it can be further improved. Instead of accumulating a number of fuel oil price increases before making a large adjustment of electricity tariff at irregular intervals, fuel oil price increases can be passed on automatically at shorter intervals, i.e. every three months. And if fuel oil prices fall in any three-month period, the benefits can be passed back immediately to the consumers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system of three-monthly automatic adjustments of tariffs is more equitable as consumers will be charged the prevailing fuel oil price paid by the PUB. Tariff changes will be smaller on each occasion although the cumulative increase will be the same as under the present practice. It will be easier for consumers to adjust their budgets. Moreover, when fuel oil cost declines with market conditions, consumers can enjoy a reduction in electricity tariff. The principle is the same as that followed in the pricing of petrol sold at the pumps. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because oil prices are now more stable, this is an appropriate period to make the change. Consumers will have time to get used to the new system. The PUB will therefore implement this system as from 1st August 1982. The fuel oil price used to compute the fuel adjustment charge for the months of August to October will be based on the prevailing fuel oil price paid by the Board in the months of May to July. The fuel adjustment charge for November to January will be based on the fuel oil price for August to October. And so on. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Changes to the Fuel Adjustment Charge</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now explain the effect of the new system on the fuel adjustment charge. The \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> current fuel adjustment charge was fixed in March 1980, corresponding to a fuel oil price of S$390 per tonne or US$27 a barrel. Since then, the actual fuel oil price paid by PUB has risen to S$458 per tonne or US$32 a barrel. For over two years consumers have been charged electricity tariff based on outdated fuel costs. The PUB has been able to provide consumers with this benefit because there were sufficient funds in the Fuel Equalization Reserve. This reserve came from: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the difference between fuel oil price charged and the fuel oil cost paid in the first few months after the last revision; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) better fuel efficiency; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) favourable exchange rate due to appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher fuel oil costs over the last 18 months have been paid for through withdrawal from the Fuel Equalization Reserve. Without an increase in the fuel adjustment charge, the reserve will be exhausted by the end of this year. Consumers will therefore have to pay the current fuel oil cost in the electricity tariff. Because of the savings arising from improvement in power generation efficiency, the PUB does not have to charge consumers the full fuel oil price of S$458 per tonne. Instead, the PUB intends to recover a cost of S$430 per tonne. The fuel adjustment charge will be increased from 4.29 cents to 5.61 cents per kWh, an increase of 1.32 cents per unit. For households, the final increase is one-third of this increase in the fuel adjustment charge. I will explain how this will come about. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Gradual Removal of Promotional Tariffs</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of PUB's policies to encourage efficiency in electricity usage is to gradually phase out the system of promotional block rates under which tariffs decrease with increasing consumption. This system was inherited from the era of cheap oil price, when utilities all over the world gave incentives to big consumers in order to obtain economy of scale and to optimize the usage of installed capacity. As with other utilities elsewhere, we should now discontinue this practice. However, we intend to do it very gradually. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> We have already begun to restructure the tariff schedule in the revisions in 1979 and 1980 when the tariff blocks were reduced in number. PUB intends to further reduce the tariff blocks together with the change in the system of recovering fuel oil costs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be necessary for me to go into the details of how PUB proposes to restructure the tariff in this part of the exercise, which will affect the industrial and other non-domestic users. The details can be found in the Annex 2 (Col. 79 - 90) which I will ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute to Members. [Copies distributed to hon. Members.] I would, however, like to highlight the following points: \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820727/19820727-HA-0420079.htm\">Annex 2 - PUB ELECTRICITY TARIFF SYSTEM (Cols. 79 - 90)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The revision of the tariff will enable PUB to reduce the basic tariff for low consumption blocks. Small and efficient consumers will benefit. For domestic households, the basic tariff will be lowered from 15.86 cents per kWh to 15 cents, a reduction of 0.86 cents per kWh. This will offset the increase in the fuel adjustment charge so that domestic consumers will have to pay an increase of only 0.46 cents per kWh or 2.3% more. The monthly electricity bill of the average HDB household will be increased by 57 cents, which is less than the price of half a packet of cigarettes or 1\ufffd cups of coffee without milk! \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Domestic consumers who use an exorbitant amount of electricity will not enjoy the full reduction in the basic tariff. Instead, they will be charged a higher basic tariff at the rate of 17.5 cents per kWh for consumption above 2,000 kWh a month. This is to discourage excessive use of electricity particularly for air-conditioning. The number of such domestic consumers is small (0.6% of the total). On 1st February 1983 this higher basic tariff will be increased further to 20 cents per kWh for consumption above 2,000 kWh per month. These domestic consumers are therefore given six months to adjust their consumption habits. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Financial Implications</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to brief the House on how the above revisions will affect PUB's \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> financial position. As at 1st January 1982, the PUB had $42 million in its Fuel Equalization Reserve. If the fuel adjustment charge is not raised, the Reserve would be exhausted by the end of the year and PUB would be faced with a deficit of $45 million for its electricity operations after meeting interest payments and servicing the repayment of its loans. With the raising of the fuel adjustment charge on 1st August, fuel oil cost actually paid after this date will approximate the fuel oil cost charged in the tariff. For the full year, PUB's financial position will be in balance. Any remaining balance in the Fuel Equalization Reserve will be used to defray quarterly imbalances between fuel oil cost recovered and fuel oil cost paid under the new system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring of the tariff schedule will have minimal effects on PUB's total revenue. In adjusting the schedule, the higher tariff for the larger consumption blocks are balanced by the reduction in tariff for the smaller consumption blocks. Because of rounding off, the restructuring will result in a marginal increase of 0.2% or $2.8 million in revenue in 1982. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Concluding Remarks</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB has taken great pains in the past to ensure that the burden on our consumers due to rising oil prices is eased as much as possible. Part of the increase in oil price is absorbed by improving the efficiency of electricity generation. If not for this improvement, PUB would have had to spend an additional $155 million in 1981. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past five years, the PUB spent $1.2 billion in capital development to expand and improve the electricity system. In the next five years, out of a total development budget of $3.2 billion, the PUB will spend $2.6 billion on electricity projects. Only 37% of PUB's development budget can be funded from internal sources. The other $2 billion or 63% will have to be financed from loans. Total outstanding loans of the PUB at end-1981 amounted to $1.1 billion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, fuel cost constituted 73% of total cost of electricity generation. Depreciation took up 13% and interest on loans 7%. The remaining 7% was for manpower, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> maintenance, property tax, and other expenses. The PUB will never have the means to subsidize oil price increases. Indeed the Board will be doing well if it can, through greater efficiency, absorb manpower and other cost increases. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate what PUB has done to minimize the burden of oil price increase to our consumers, we should note that the average electricity price over the past 10 years, from 1972 to 1981, increased by 177%, from 6.38 cents per kWh in 1972 to 17.70 cents in 1981. During the same period, fuel oil price to the PUB increased from $39 to $463 per tonne, an increase of 1087%. Annual manpower cost per employee increased by 174%. Gross fixed assets utilized by the Electricity Department increased from $759 million to $2.5 billion, an increase of 234% which resulted in higher charges for depreciation and interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Members that the PUB will continue to spare no efforts in its drive for higher efficiency so as to moderate, where possible, the rising cost of supplying electricity. The measures, which I have announced today, will ease the burden on consumers, particularly domestic consumers and help the PUB to fulfil its mission. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this ends my Statement and I shall be happy to answer any questions which Members may have. Much obliged, Mr Speaker. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that PUB meters are read only once in two months, PUB bills are therefore based on actual and estimated readings. Can the Hon. Minister explain how this new system of three-monthly adjustments in the electricity rates will affect the bills? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the tariff revision will result in an average Housing and Development Board household having to pay 57 cents more per month. This may be quite acceptable considering the fact that the last increase was in March 1980. However, the Minister in his opening remarks cautioned that oil is a depleting natural resource and that we can expect the price of oil to rise relentlessly. Can the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Minister enlighten the House on the steps the Public Utilities Board will take to mitigate the effects of future increases of oil price, and consequently electricity price, particularly on the lower income group? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to answer them first, Dr Tan? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. Sir, may I take advantage of the first question to give a little bit more information on how the new system will work. With the implementation of the revised tariffs on the 1st August 1982, the PUB will, first of all, read all meters in August so that the new rates will be applicable from the dates the meters are read. This is necessary because of the changes in the tariff structures. The system of three-monthly adjustments in the declared fuel oil price affects only the fuel adjustment charge. This charge is applicable to all units consumed, irrespective of consumer categories or levels of consumption. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB has looked into the practical aspects of implementing the new system and has decided that there is no immediate need to change the present practice of bi-monthly meter readings. Under the present practice, for the month the meter is not read the consumer's bill will be based on estimated consumption for the month. In estimating the consumption, the average of the consumer's consumption which is computed on his previous actual meter readings is used. Unless there is a sudden change in the consumer's consumption pattern, the estimated consumption should be quite close to his actual consumption. When a consumer's meter is read the next month, the bill will be automatically adjusted to reflect his actual consumption for the two months. Differences, if any, will be small, and on balance will even out for the consumer over a period of time. Consumers who read their own meters and submit their readings to PUB for billing will be charged the actual consumption for the month. PUB, as we all know, has instruction booklets on how to read meters and convenient pre-paid post cards to be used for sending meter readings to the PUB. The PUB would encourage consumers to read their own meters and would be very happy to make available these instruction \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> booklets and pre-paid post cards to Members of Parliament and consumers who would like to read their own meters. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also be interested to know that the PUB is undertaking a feasibility study to see if meters can be read on a remote basis using the telephone lines. A block of about 100 flats in Delta Avenue has been selected for a field trial. The flats will be installed with meters which have been modified to enable the meters to be read remotely from the PUB Headquarters using the telephone lines. The field trial will start next month and will last for one year. When the results of the field trial have been evaluated, we can then consider the use of this remote telemetering system on a wider basis. I shall now go on to the second question. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB is very conscious of the plight of the lower income group each time the tariffs are revised to recover the higher fuel oil cost. Adjustment of the fuel adjustment charge is applicable to all units of electricity consumed. However, wherever possible, the PUB has taken steps to mitigate the effects of increases on the lower income group. This is done, Mr Speaker, for example, in the present exercise. The final increase for households is only one-third the increase in the fuel adjustment charge. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one thing which, I repeat, we must never do, and that is, to subsidize consumption. This will inflate demand. Reduction of basic tariffs to domestic consumers will have to come from savings achieved by the PUB as a result of greater efficiency in its operations and higher productivity. In this connection, it is pertinent to compare our revised electricity rates with those of Hong Kong and Japan, two countries like ours, which also have to import the major part of their energy requirements for the generation of electricity. As from August, the PUB's electricity rates for domestic use will be 20.61 cents per kWh except for consumption above 2000 kWh per month. In Hong Kong the average domestic rate in 1981 was 22.69 Singapore cents per kWh, or approximately 10% higher than the PUB's new rate. In Tokyo the average domestic \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> rate in 1981 was 28.48 Singapore cents per kWh, or approximately 38% higher than PUB's new rate. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir there seems to be quite an array of tariff schedules covering different users. I was listening to the Hon. Minister but I did not get the rationale for the different rates charged for different users. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading page 2 of Schedule 1, the category called HT Industrial Tariff is charged the lowest rate of all. Between 1 and 100,000 kWh per month the rate is 15.61 cents and above 100,000 it is 14.61 cents. I notice that these are the lowest rates in all the tariff schedules. It seems to me therefore that we appear to be subsidizing this particular category. Furthermore, if we look at the last category HT Non-Industrial Tariff 16.11 cents per kWh per month, it is again rather low compared to the others. One particular category seems to benefit from the adjustment in the tariff rate, i.e. the users of less than 100,000 kWh per month under Non-Industrial Tariff. Presently they are paying 16.55 cents and under the new rates they will be paying 16.11 cents. Is there any particular reason why this group should be enjoying a reduction? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was afraid that somebody might ask that question in Parliament. So he will have to listen to my reply now. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply of electricity by the PUB is in different forms, depending on whether the electricity is used by a domestic household or by an industry. The tariffs which the Member for Whampoa referred to earlier are the High Tension Industrial Tariffs. When electricity is supplied from the PUB generating plants to the industries, it is supplied on a high tension basis and the industries themselves have to have their own generators by which to convert the high tension electricity into low tension electricity for their own use. The low tension electricity is the electricity which is used in domestic households. Therefore, there is the additional cost to the industries, when they buy electricity from the PUB, of converting it into a form which they can use. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the charges which the industries have to pay for the use of the electricity do not comprise only the charges which are listed in Schedule I and Schedule 11. As you can see from the explanatory notes (Annex 2), industries have also to pay what is called the maximum and declared demand charges for high tension electricity, and these will be doubled as part of the restructuring of the high tension tariffs. This affects only the large industrial and commercial users, These are charges for utilization of installed capacity and are meant to ensure that industrial and commercial firms use their electricity supply capacity efficiently. So the electricity which is charged to the domestic consumers, to put it in a nutshell, is not the same type of electricity which is supplied to industries. Is this clear? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Not quite, Mr Speaker. Sir, may I seek clarification. The Hon. Minister mentioned that the PUB supplies high tension electricity to the industries and they have to do a conversion at a cost to themselves. I fail to see why the PUB should be concerned that the industries have to incur a cost to use electricity. Surely what is pertinent to the PUB is the cost of supplying the electricity to the user, be it high tension or low tension. And the more pertinent point is, what is the per unit cost of supplying to the industrial users as compared to the domestic users? If the cost is the same, why not charge them the same rate? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid this is becoming a lesson in electrical engineering. However, the reason why the tariffs are not the same is that the cost to the PUB of supplying electricity is not the same. When we supply high tension electricity, there is a lower loss of electricity as it is transmitted through the distribution system, and when we transmit low tension electricity the loss is higher. Therefore, it costs the PUB very much more to supply low tension electricity to domestic households than to supply high tension electricity to industrial users. I hope this suffices for the moment. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, what about the category called Entertainment Tariff? Does it cost the PUB more to supply electricity to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> places of entertainment, or is it meant to discourage entertainment? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you can see again from Schedule I of Annex 2, the charge for Entertainment Tariff is very much higher than the charge which is levied on domestic households. This is to persuade those enterprises running places of entertainment to conserve energy. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Statement, the Minister stated that domestic consumers who use more than 2,000 kWh per month should pay a higher rate. I am of the opinion that it is unlikely that the basic rate of 20 cents will deter higher consumption. Can the Minister inform the House whether other steps will be taken to discourage wasteful consumption by these consumers? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Chong Boon has asked how the PUB can help to encourage those consumers who use large amounts of electricity to reduce their usage. There are some 2,900 domestic consumers who use more than 2,000 kWh per month. These 2,900 households who comprise 0.6% of a total of 483,000 domestic consumers use about 10% of total domestic consumption. The objective of introducing the higher basic tariff - actually it is 17.5 cents per kWh for the moment rising to 20 cents per kWh from February 1983 - is to discourage these consumers from using more than 2,000 kWh per month. They have six months to adjust their consumption rates. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB will be writing to large domestic consumers to advise them on how they can do an electricity consumption audit in their homes and how they can save energy. The facilities at the Energy Conservation Centre at the PUB building are also available to teach these consumers how to conserve energy usage. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this day and age, with energy an increasingly scarce and valuable commodity, no domestic consumer should use more than 2,000 kWh of electricity per month to meet domestic needs. I would urge large domestic consumers to reassess their pattern of consumption and bring down their usage to below 2,000 \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> kWh per month. If my verbal exhortations do not succeed, then PUB will have to consider increasing the basic tariff for high consumption even further to persuade the few large electricity consumers to reduce their consumption. I think this will be effective. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Chau Sik Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Chau Sik Ting (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with oil being a depleting natural resource, and the Minister mentioning coal as a possible alternative, does the PUB, in fact, intend to switch to alternative sources of energy? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the PUB has been studying the feasibility of using coal for the generation of electricity. The use of natural gas is another possibility which is being investigated. In the longer term there is no doubt that we have to diversify to alternative sources of energy to reduce our present total dependence on oil. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, several factors which we would need to consider carefully before committing ourselves to any particular course of action. The impact on our environment and the security of supply are, for example, two very important factors which have to be taken into account. The success of our industrialization programme is due in part to our ability to provide the necessary electrical power at competitive rates, and we need to ensure as far as possible that we maintain an efficient and reliable electricity supply. Oil, despite its uncertainties, has served us well in the past. In formulating our future policy to diversify, we need to be satisfied that we will not be worse off. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask whether the Minister will consider giving incentives to consumers who read their own meters?. I ask this question because it will save PUB a substantial amount of money by way of salaries for meter readers, if the PUB succeeds in teaching consumers how to read their own meters. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Tony Tan:</b> I will refer the Member's suggestion to the PUB for consideration. However, the problem may only be a \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> temporary one. If this experiment in remote telemetering succeeds, then meters will be read automatically every month and there will be no need for either the PUB or the consumers to do any reading. Everything will be taken care of by the computers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br>4.07 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>JUDGES' REMUNERATION</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Judges' Remuneration Act (Chapter 7 of the Revised Edition)\", \n  <br> \n  <br>presented by the Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>CHARITIES BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to make provision for the registration of charities, the administration of charities and their affairs and for purposes connected therewith\", \n  <br> \n  <br>presented by Mr Hon Sui Sen; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Parliamentary Pensions Act, 1978 (No. 24 of 1978)\", \n  <br> \n  <br>recommendation of President signified; presented by Mr Hon Sui Sen; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>TRUSTEES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Trustees Act (Chapter 40 of the Revised Edition)\", \n  <br> \n  <br>presented by the Minister for Law (Mr E.W.

But Parliament is supreme and the rule of law must always prevail in our Republic and, above all, in this House. The powers of this House and the privileges and immunities of hon. Members are set out in the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act enacted as long ago as 1955. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But besides privileges and immunities, hon. Members also have duties and obligations which, unfortunately, do not appear in the title of the Act. One such obligation is that required by section 31 which provides as follows: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member shall not in or before Parliament or any committee take part in the discussion of any matter in which he has a direct personal pecuniary interest without disclosing the extent of that interest and shall not in any circumstances vote upon any such matter.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a serious offence to contravene section 31 and a conviction under the section is punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both such fine and imprisonment. This is provided in section 35 (1) (c). \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Sir, that on the 17th day of March this year, the Member for Anson asked an Oral Question No. 1 on the Order Paper for the day and the question was: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What the policy of his Ministry [the Ministry of Home Affairs] is on applications from non-citizen spouses of Singapore citizens to live in Singapore with their spouses.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question and the answer by the Minister of State for Home Affairs are reported in Volume 41, No. 11, of our Official Report for the day, cols. 1033 to 1040. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked several supplementary questions and, whilst one was being answered, the Minister for Home Affairs rose on a Point of Order. His Point of Order was this. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote from col, 1037 of the Official Report:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Will he declare his direct personal pecuniary interest in his line of questioning? In other words, has he got cases of this nature representing non-Singapore citizens regarding application for permanent residence? How many cases has he got, acting as a lawyer outside this House or in the name of his firm \"J.B. Jeyaretnam and Company\"? Can he declare his interest?' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson replied, and again I quote -- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I have, as a Member of Parliament, raised about six matters concerning non-citizens who have married Singapore citizens and who have been asked to leave the country.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot speak for you, Sir, but the impression I got from the Member's answer was that he had raised these matters as a Member of Parliament and not as an Advocate and Solicitor. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs then produced a letter from the legal firm of J.B. Jeyaretnam &amp; Co. of which the Member is the sole proprietor. The letter read:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We act for the abovenamed who is a Malaysian citizen. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our client (not a voter) has been residing in Singapore for more than 10 years. On the 17th of May 1981, our client married Mr Latib Bin Ali who is a citizen of Singapore by birth at Johore Bahru by Muslim rites. She now resides with the husband . . . \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would urge you on compassionate and humanitarian grounds to grant our client an entry permit for permanent residence in Singapore. We would stress that our client's husband is a citizen of Singapore. As such if our client were to leave Singapore it would cause a break-up in the family . . .\". \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was dated the 5th February 1982. It was shown to the hon. Member and he said it was signed by his assistant. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister then produced an earlier letter from the firm in respect of the same client on the same matter signed by the Member himself. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member rose to explain, you, Sir, were kind enough to suggest that he referred to section 31 before he committed himself any more on the subject. The Member rose and said, in column 1039: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All I want to say is that this second letter that was handed to me was dated 30th May 1981. It is long before I became a Member of Parliament. It is dated 30th May 1981. Of course, it is my signature. But this signature on the letter dated 5th February 1982 is my \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> assistant's signature. It is about this that I was talking. But the letter dated 30th May 1981, of course it is my signature and I wrote that letter.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation, if any, was in my view unsatisfactory. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, on the 19th day of March 1982, the Member for Anson once again took part in the discussion of the same or similar matter in this House. This was in the debate in the Committee of Supply on Head Q of the Main and Development Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st April 1982 to 31st March 1983. This is reported in our Official Report, Volume 41, No. 13, at col. 1281. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member said:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My plea now this time is not for persons who think they are being wrongfully incarcerated in the drug rehabilitation centres but for the wives of Singapore citizens. I do not have to again, I hope, remind Members of this House that the right to marry a person of one's own choice is a personal right that belongs to the individual, and it finds expression in Article 16 of the Declaration of Human Rights to which we have subscribed.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson may have an explanation. If he has, hon. Members will be pleased to hear him. The Member is new in this House and may not have been conversant with all our Standing Orders, rules and regulations and the Act which sets out our powers, privileges and immunities. Perhaps he may wish to express his regrets in which case I will not proceed with the resolution. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, on a point of procedure. One other matter which was raised by the Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs has been referred to the Committee of Privileges. That matter is now before this Committee of Privileges. This Motion by the Minister for Law refers to speeches made by me on other dates not covered in the matter raised by the Minister of State. I ask whether this matter should not also first be referred to the Committee of Privileges for the Committee to report whether, in their view, there was a direct personal pecuniary interest which required me to disclose that interest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you are aware, I have already made my submissions and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> appeared before the Committee on the other matter which has been referred to the Committee, in which I have stated why, in my view, there was no direct personal pecuniary interest. So my question is whether this matter should not also be referred to the Committee of Privileges before the House debates this motion. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, these matters complained of took place on different days and on different subjects. There are two ways in which Parliament can deal with alleged breaches of privilege. One is to deal with the breach itself, as has been done in the other matter complained of, and the other, if it is more serious, is to send it to the Attorney-General. Sir, the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, section 20, says: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'20.-(1) For any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt, on the part of a Member, Parliament may - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) impose upon him a fine not exceeding the sum of one thousand dollars; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suspend him from the service of Parliament for the remainder of the current session of Parliament or for any part thereof; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) direct that he be reprimanded or admonished in his place by the Speaker.' \n  <br> \n  <br>and it sets out in section 21 the procedure in cases like this. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'21.-(1) If it is alleged or appears that any person has committed an offence mentioned in section 20 of this Act, Parliament may - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the offence is alleged to have been or has apparently been committed in the view of Parliament or in the precincts thereof when Parliament is sitting or in any committee, deal with the matter summarily, in the case of a Member, under the Standing Orders and, in the case of a stranger, . . . \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) refer the matter to any select committee for investigation, consideration and report to Parliament; or' \n  <br> \n  <br>This was what took place in respect of the other matter. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(c) if the offence is an offence mentioned in Part V of this Act, refer the matter to the Attorney-General with a view to the institution of criminal proceedings against such person.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence which we are dealing with today is an offence under section 31 of Part V of the Act and the procedure for such an offence is provided for in section 21 (c) - refer the matter to the Attorney-General \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> with a view to the institution of criminal proceedings against such person. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware, of course, of the provisions both in the Act and the Standing Orders of Parliament. The Hon. Minister has said that, being new, perhaps I was not aware. May I assure him that I was aware of the Standing Orders before I took my seat in Parliament. And I was aware, of course, of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. I am aware of the methods of dealing with this matter as set out in the section of the Act that has been referred to by the Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the methods is for it to be referred to a Committee of Privileges, and this is why I am asking whether this matter should not also be referred to the Committee of Privileges which is already seized of the other matter. The Motion before the House assumes that I had a direct personal pecuniary interest. My respectful submission is that the motion begs the question because unless this House is satisfied that there was a direct personal pecuniary interest that required me under the Act and under the Standing Orders to disclose, then it must follow that I was not in breach of the Standing Orders or the section of the Act. The question is, I repeat: was there a direct personal interest that I had which required me to disclose this interest? Sir, in my submission to the Committee and in my appearance, I have said why I had not, under the authorities and under the practice and precedents followed in the British House of Commons. May I pause here to say that I quoted these instances only because our Standing Orders themselves provide that in interpreting our Standing Orders, regard shall be had to the practice and precedents of the British House of Commons. And this is why I have raised this question -should it not, first of all, be decided whether there was a direct personal pecuniary interest which required me to disclose that? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not that I am loathe or reluctant to apologize or to express my regrets. If there is any reluctance, it is because I am myself not con- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> vinced at the moment that I was in breach of the Standing Orders or the section of the Act and, therefore, if I have to apologize or express regrets for something of which I do not think I am in breach, it would appear to be insincere. I would like to be shown that I was in breach, that it was quite clearly required of me under the Act and under the Standing Orders to disclose this personal pecuniary interest. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, we are not in Committee. If we were in a Committee considering whether or not there was a breach of privilege, we would have to decide. But this particular Motion, if passed, will go on to the Attorney-General and it is the Attorney-General who will decide whether there is a prima facie case against the Member, and it is the Attorney-General who will have to decide on the law and what is the meaning of \"direct personal pecuniary interest.\" It will take us nowhere to argue in this House as to what that phrase means. It is for the Attorney-General, if he thinks there has been a breach of the section or an offence, to send the case to court, and there the Magistrate or Judge will have to decide what is meant by \"direct personal pecuniary interest.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this House is concerned, we are not preventing the Member for Anson from speaking. The particular section does not. He can speak on the subject provided he declares his interest, whatever direct personal pecuniary interest means. The reason for this Motion is that the complaint against the Member is more serious than the one before the Committee of Privileges. It is more serious because, first, he was asked whether he had acted as an advocate and solicitor in any of these matters. His reply: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I acted for six cases but as a Member of Parliament.' \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shown a letter by his firm, he said it was signed by his assistant. Then he was shown another letter which was signed by himself, long before he became a Member of Parliament. But the fact is that he acted. He is the sole proprietor of his firm. He received money when he acts for his clients. So prima facie it is a receipt of moneys - direct, personal, pecuniary. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and before the votes were taken - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker</b> rose - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Barker. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I would like to give the Member another chance. He says he is prepared to apologize provided he is wrong. Is he prepared to say that he had no intention of misleading this House and if he did, he expresses his regrets.? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to the Minister. I am grateful to him. May I assure you and this House that the last thought in my mind in speaking in this House was to further my practice in any way whatsoever. I have, as I said in my memorandum to the Committee, spoken on a matter of State policy, on a policy of this Government which I found very hard to accept. It was purely as a Member of Parliament trying to discharge my duties to those who had elected me that I spoke and, may I assure the House and the Minister, it was certainly not with the intention of advancing my practice in the field of law. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain a little further, Mr Speaker, Sir, with your indulgence? As I understand it, I was not aware at that time but I have now come to understand that at Question Time a Member is not required to disclose his personal pecuniary interest even if he had one. That would appear to be the ruling in the British House of Commons. Be that as it may, I am not relying on that. Be that as it may, the question that I was asked was whether I was acting, at that moment of time, for anybody and I stated truthfully when I said that - because between the time that I was elected as a Member of Parliament and the time I spoke - I had seen persons (I said I remembered six or so) who had come to see me to complain about their wives being asked to leave the country. That was the only reason I spoke in Parliament. I did not have in mind any case in which I had acted and, of course, I was not aware of the letter written by my assistant. No doubt it was the same client for whom I had written a letter way back in May 1981. I had written that letter. But then I do not think I saw the person again, and then this letter written by my assistant was pro- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> duced. All I wish to say is that I accept that a letter written by the firm is my letter, notwithstanding that it does not bear my signature. There can be no quibble about that. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But concerning the question as to my intention in speaking, whether I had a motive, all I can do is to assure the House that it was not with that intention that I spoke, and it hurts me to think that there are people who think that I have come to Parliament to try and further my practice outside. May I tell the Members of this House and you, Sir, that my practice has suffered by my taking up the cause that I have been trying to take up for the last 10 years. It was not with the intention of furthering my practice that I have chosen to come into Parliament. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked whether I would apologize. If you, Sir, having considered the whole matter - because Standing Order 62 provides that the Speaker or the Chairman shall rule whether the Member is required to disclose his interest - if you rule that I should have in those circumstances declared my personal pecuniary interest, then of course I will accept that ruling and I will say sorry that I did not declare my personal pecuniary interest. But my only reason is that I did not think it was required of me and I still do not think it was. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, as the Speaker, I would not even know whether you have any direct pecuniary interest in any particular case. It was up to you to declare. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think the Member wants you to decide whether, on the facts as set out on what he said previously, he should have declared his interest in the matter, in that he had acted for this particular person relating to the same matter \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> As the Speaker here, I have to follow our Standing Orders.

Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very short Bill but it nevertheless introduces a welcome and useful change in the law concerning proceedings in tort which are maintainable against the estate of a deceased person. Under the existing subsection (3) of section 8 of the Civil Law Act, no such proceedings shall be maintainable unless either (a) the proceedings were pending against the tort-feasor at the date of his death or (b) the proceedings are instituted within six months of the personal representative of the deceased tortfeasor taking out representation. Thus, unless proceedings were instituted before the death of the tortfeasor, a person who has a claim in tort against his estate has a very short period of six months after the grant of representation to commence proceedings. That this six-month time limit can give rise to considerable hardship and injustice, especially in personal injury cases, has been recognised in the UK where the law has been changed by abrogating this rule, thus leaving claims against the estates of deceased tortfeasors to be governed by the general law of limitation. The normal limitation period for an action in respect of personal injuries is three years from the date on which the cause of action accrued. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to delete section 8(3) of the Civil Law Act so as to remove the restrictive effect of that subsection with regard to the institution of proceedings in tort against the estate of a deceased person. With the deletion of that subsection, the normal limitation period would apply to such proceedings. This change would be particularly beneficial to persons injured in road accidents who, through no fault of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> their own, may be unaware that the tortfeasor has died. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Prof S. Jayakumar]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>SOCIETIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.50 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Societies Act so as to empower the court, where proceedings are instituted by a registered society, to require it to furnish sufficient security for costs that might be incurred by the defendant in such proceedings. The court will be able to exercise such a discretion when it has reason to believe, on evidence before the court, that the society would be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if it should fail in its action. Upon failure to furnish such security, all proceedings against the defendant in the action may be stayed by order of the court until such time when the security is furnished. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge that costs will have to be paid in any civil litigation. The party that loses his case in court will normally have to pay the costs of not only his, but that of the other party. If the court's order is not observed then, as the law stands at present, any judgment against a registered society can only be enforced by writs of execution against the assets of the society. However, there are instances where the successful party has not been able to recover the costs from the plaintiff. This means that if a society institutes legal proceedings but it does not have the assets or funds to meet the costs of such proceedings, a defendant who \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> successfully defends an action brought against him by a society would be unable to recover his costs from the society. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an academic issue. We have the recent example of a political party, the Workers Party, which instituted defamation proceedings against an individual, Mr Tay Boon Too, a former Member of Parliament, and the Attorney-General (representing the former Department of Broadcasting). The plaintiff lost its defamation case against the defendants but did not fully pay the costs awarded to the defendants. Execution and garnishee proceedings taken by one of the defendants to realize a sum of about $25,000 as costs due to him showed that the plaintiff society had only $18.47 in its bank account. I think we are all familiar with the fact that an Order of Court was applied for and obtained for the appointment of an Official Receiver, in whose hands will be placed the assets of the party and who will be charged with the responsibility of getting the assets of the party and paying out its just and lawful debts. In spite of having such a paltry sum in its bank account and still being deeply in debt, that society nevertheless had again brought another defamation suit, as we know, against the Second Deputy Prime Minister, which, if it were to lose, would render it liable to pay another large sum of money in costs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Singapore must be protected from such acts of irresponsibility on the part of the societies or any of its officials acting on its behalf. Rights must be accompanied by responsibilities. The right to seek redress in our courts is open to all; but it must be accompanied by a responsibility to comply with the awards and orders of the court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amending Bill does not shut off or preclude any party from resorting to justice in accordance with the law. Although access to the courts must always be made available to all to pursue their just claims and grievances, we must ensure at the same time that defendants who have been successful in warding off unjustifiable and unreasonable claims and who have been unjustifiably dragged to court, should not be left without a hope of recovering the costs that they have been made to incur. The present, Bill seeks to prevent such \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> abuse of our legal process by a registered society instituting legal proceedings without a care as to whether it has the means to meet the costs of the legal action. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the requirement to furnish security for costs, the Bill also seeks to make certain officers of the society who approved the institution of legal action jointly and severally liable for the balance of any costs awarded to the successful defendant should the amount of security given be insufficient. This would also apply to any person who, on subsequently becoming an officer of the society, does not take reasonable measures to seek discontinuance of the legal proceedings. This will serve as an additional check against irresponsible acts by the officers of the society who use the society's name to initiate legal proceedings and will ensure that the court's award on costs will not be rendered meaningless as a result of the society's inability to pay. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which this Bill seeks to introduce will effectively check the abuse of the process of the court by irresponsible officers of a registered society and help to preserve the common citizens' respect for law and order as administered by the courts. Without such an amendment, any society may resort to law without a sense of responsibility towards its legal obligations to pay the costs of the defendant, if it were to lose the action. We have, as I said, already an example of such irresponsibility. This amendment will prevent further similiar acts of irresponsibility and abuse of our judicial process. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak, may I declare here - it is quite obvious to me - that I have an interest in that not only am I a member of the Workers Party and therefore I have an interest in this Bill but that my firm is also acting for the Party and for another plaintiff in this action against the Second Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I then carry on, having declared my interest? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State has outlined the reasons why it has been found necessary \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> to introduce this amendment, and he goes back to the one and only case of the Workers Party suit against Mr Tay Boon Too who was elected a Member of Parliament in 1972 and also against the then Department of Broadcasting. That action was commenced way back in 1972 (I stand corrected) and the beginning of 1973 against the Department. The matters were concluded in 1974 in the High Court when the High Court dismissed the action of the Party against both the defendants, Mr Tay Boon Too and the Attorney-General who was sued as nominee for the Department of Broadcasting. The Court holding, as against Mr Tay Boon Too, that we had not proved that he spoke those words of which complaint had been made and yet at the same time the Court holding that the Attorney-General succeeded in his defence of justification in that he had proved that all that was broadcast were the very words spoken by Mr Tay Boon Too at this public rally. Be that as it may, Mr Speaker, costs were awarded to be paid by the Workers Party, and in an appeal to the Court of Appeal the appeal was dismissed and costs were awarded to be paid for the appeal as well. As I said, that took place in 1975 or at the latest, I think, in 1976 before the Court of Appeal. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was done to try and prevent societies from instituting actions where they have not paid the costs until this year when the Party again commenced an action against the Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs) for what the Party considered defamation of it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may say so, the impression one is left with is that this Bill has been introduced solely for the benefit of the Minister and is directed against this particular society, the Workers Party, that I represent. This is a piecemeal legislation and, in my respectful view, Mr Speaker, Sir, is undesirable. We have not been given any instances of several cases of societies commencing proceedings against suitors, against defendants, and not being able to pay the costs which have led to the introduction of this Bill. The only reason that one is left with is that this Bill has been introduced because the Workers \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Party has seen fit to sue the Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs), The writ was filed on 1st February 1982 and the Bill was read for the First time on 25th March 1982. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the function of Parliament, if I may so humbly suggest, to legislate for the general good and benefit of all its citizens and not for the benefit of any one particular person or body nor should legislation be directed against one particular body or person. This is not the only time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Bill has been introduced and passed as a result of litigation in court. After the termination of the proceedings against Mr Tay Boon Too and the Department of Broadcasting, a Bill was introduced and passed which protected the Department of Broadcasting from payment of any damages for any incorrect reporting in its broadcasts; clearly intended to cover the situation that was the subject of the case against the Department brought by the Workers Party. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say again that it is an undesirable state of affairs when Parliament is asked to legislate for a particular person or against a particular party, and this is what it would appear to be. I do not know that it is even necessary for an Act to be passed. I do not know whether the Minister of State has looked at the Rules of the Supreme Court, because if he does I would suggest that he will find there, in one of the Orders, power in the courts themselves to order a plaintiff to pay costs where the plaintiff is a nominal plaintiff acting for the benefit of other person or persons and a society is, of course, a nominal plaintiff and it is acting for the benefit of its members. So there is already the power, as I see it, in the courts on the application of the defendant to order that a plaintiff provide security for costs before he continues with his action in court. I do not really know that we need an amendment to the Societies Act to bring that about when there is already the power in the court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks, by sub-clause (3) of clause 3, to apply this amendment retrospectively and, in particular, to the action brought by the Party against the Minister. It has been said that legislation must as far as possible not affect rights that have already accrued and on which parties have \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> begun or commenced action. For these reasons, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask that this House considers the Bill further. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself do not propose to vote on this. I have declared my interest. I shall abstain. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill to amend the Societies Act by requiring a society which commences an action in a court of law to give, at the discretion of the court, security for the costs of the defendant in the action. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill may seem to be aimed at curtailing the right of a society to sue in a Subordinate Court as well as in the High Court whereas any other legal person under the Companies Act or the Cooperative Societies Act is not similarly restricted. The short answer to this apparent anomaly is that a company or a cooperative society, being basically a business organization, considers carefully the financial costs and consequences before commencing a lawsuit. Likewise a natural person thinks of the likely effect on his pocket and his property before he even contemplates taking a legal action against another person. But a society registered under the Societies Act is a different kettle of fish entirely, particularly a society which operates with hardly any funds and possesses little or no assets of its own. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people who run such a society may have no compunction about suing others, left and right, regardless of whether the society has any grounds or not. Why, you may ask. The reason is that a society and its officers have nothing to lose but everything to gain by suing indiscriminately and irresponsibly. If the persons who are unfortunate enough to be targets of the unjustified lawsuit of such a society fail to defend themselves in court, they may end up paying damages to the society, to add insult to injury. If they defend themselves in court and succeed against the society, as they should, on a lack of merits of the society's case, they find that they cannot even recover their own costs from the society. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have refrained from speaking at all about the subject matter of the suit or the merits or demerits of that \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> action. That matter is now before the court. It is sub judice and I do not know if the hon. Member can speak about whether it is justified or unjustified in this House when the action is still pending before the court. It is for the court to decide and not for the Member here to say whether it is justified or not justified. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify this point. I am not referring, in particular, to the suit which is now before the court. I am talking about it in general terms which may affect other societies. May I be allowed to continue, Sir? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So long as you stick to your general terms. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Yes. If they defend themselves in court and succeed against the society, as they should, on a lack of merits of the society's case, they find that they cannot even recover their own costs from the society. This is not a hypothetical situation but it has happened in Singapore recently. People who have been inconvenienced by the need to engage a counsel to defend themselves against a society's frivolous or vexatious libel suit found themselves saddled with a bad debt even after their successful defence, because the society turned out to be a legal person of straw and could not pay the costs. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the amendment to the Societies Act, as proposed in the Bill, must be adopted by this House because a society is often run by persons of substantial worth financially, if not morally. The public impression is that a society is of good financial standing but when the truth is found out, as successful defendants of frivolous and vexatious libel suit by one society, it is too late. To make matters worse, the officers of such societies under the present Act are not liable in any way for the judgment debts incurred by a society in this irresponsible manner. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to plug, what I consider, a lamentable loophole in the existing law. Far too often, up to now, this loophole lends itself to cynical and merciless exploitation by the unscrupulous, unprincipled and unethical officers of societies as \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> against other persons who cannot shelter behind the fictitious but legal personality of societies. Irresponsible officers of paper societies will now be assuredly forced under the Bill to think of the possible financial consequences to themselves before they freely sue others in the name of their societies. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is needless to add further to what I have said. My main consideration in supporting this Bill is that a society with a legitimate cause of action will still be able to sue as freely as before and that the members of the public are henceforth protected from prosecution and harassment by a society without any legitimate cause of action. It is imperative that the right of a society to sue be regulated by the State when the officers of the society are slap-happy on lawsuits and do not respect the right of citizens - if they have done no wrong - to enjoy a peace of mind. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs) (Mr S.

I know of no political party in the world which has been put in the hands of a Receiver and no politician has accomplished this miraculous feat. What I am here for is to make it quite clear to the hon. Member for Anson that this Bill has nothing to do with retrieving me from a lawsuit which he has taken against me, since he has made reference to this particular case. I did not make any reference. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just remind him that as far as I am concerned, I need no legal protection against his miraculous capacity to misread the law and take action against people, without knowing his law. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the points raised by the Member for Anson. But before I do so, I think we should place on record certain important aspects of his response. I think we should place on record that he has never denied that his party instituted proceedings. He has never denied that he lost the proceedings. He has never denied that his Party refused to comply with the Orders of the court on costs, and he has not denied that notwithstanding the deliberate non-compliance with orders for costs in one proceeding, his society, nevertheless, proceeded to institute yet another proceeding . . .let's disregard who was the other party. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs) has already replied to his first point, namely, that the Member for Anson has the impression that this legislation is directed against his political party and designed for one particular pending suit. Anyone who reads the amending Bill, and one does not have to be a lawyer to understand this, anyone who reads the amending Bill will see that it covers all societies which come under the ambit of the Societies Act. That is my first observation - that it is a complete untruth to say that this legislation is directed against one party. Any other society which falls within the purview of the proposed section 35A (1) will be covered by the intent and purport of this amending Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he has asked whether I could point to other instances where other societies have been as delinquent and as contemptuous of court orders as his society has been. Mr Speaker, Sir, my answer to that is this. It is his party, his society, through its wilful disregard for properly obtained orders of the court, which has shown the way for possible abuse and misuse of our judicial process, of our legal process and of our system of administration of the law. We do not have to wait for other perpetrators of the same kind of abuse of our court process before we introduce this legislation. Fortunately, the majority of societies, to the best of my knowledge, have paid due regard to our legal and judicial process. But now we have a society which has repeatedly not complied with the orders of the court and comes, nevertheless, with an institution of another proceeding. If this legislation is not passed, that society will be able to institute yet a third, a fourth and other proceedings against other defendants and thereby open the way for other societies to follow suit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he asked that the principle of legislation should be that legislation must be for the general good of society. May I inform him that that is what this Bill is all about. Is it in the interest of our society that a registered society be permitted to abuse our judicial process, to disregard properly obtained orders of the court? The approach which the society seems to adopt is to treat our legal system \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and our court process as a Las Vegas casino where the judicial process is regarded as a roulette wheel, where approach to litigation is made in a gambling manner, to drag a defendant each night in a pot-luck fashion and, when he fails, to sneak out without paying and to come back another night with another defendant in tow to try his luck again. This cannot be in the interest of our society. This is a reprehensible, irresponsible attitude for anyone, more so for a political party which claims that it will provide an alternative government, and all the more abhorrent when perpetrated by a member of the noble profession of Advocates and Solicitors. We cannot have our courts subjected to such abuse. We will uphold the dignity of our courts and the judicial process. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he has asked whether I am aware of the Rules of the Supreme Court because in his view this amending Bill is not necessary at all for there is ample provision in the law to meet the intent. Let me say that not only was I aware of the Rules of the Supreme Court but we had also sought the expert opinion of the Attorney-General who advised us that the existing provisions would not be adequate and that this - \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Order 23. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Order 23 and the rules thereunder. Let me say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we are not only aware but we have taken the precaution of being advised by the Attorney-General. Given a choice of having to choose between the opinion of the Attorney-General and the expert opinion of the distinguished Member for Anson, I accept, of course, the opinion of the Attorney-General who has researched this matter and not given it on the spot. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only rise to reply to the wild allegations that have been made against my party and me in the speeches. First of all, it has been suggested that we are in contempt of court. If we are in contempt of court, the Minister knows what the remedy is. This is the first time I have heard it suggested that a defendant who is unable to pay the costs that have been ordered against him is committing a contempt of court and that \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> he should thereafter be debarred from bringing fresh proceedings. This is new to me. It is not contempt of court, as I understand it. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it has been suggested that we are abusing the judicial process. I do not know how we are abusing the judicial process. Mr Speaker, Sir, again, it is not, as I understand it, an abuse of judicial process for a man, even though he has lost one suit and has not paid the costs, to bring another suit, if he thinks he has a case. It is not an abuse of judicial process. If it is an abuse of judicial process, again the Minister knows that there are remedies. The courts will deal with them, if they are an abuse of judicial process. So let us have an end to all these allegations that we are in contempt of court and abusing judicial process. My Party, right from the beginning, has endeavoured to pay full regard to and uphold the dignity of the court. My Party is not the one which has been committing contempt of court.

Members. The L-shape design will not only maximize the acreage of the sea-front land available, but will also avoid encroaching on the existing sea-front. This reclamation, to be carried out in three phases, is expected to be completed by 1991 at an estimated cost of $380 million for Phase 1, $554 million for Phase 11 and $835 million for Phase 111. About 70 million cubic metres of imported fill material will be required. Opportunity will also be taken to dredge the area shown coloured blue on the same plan to provide for a berthing basin. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation at Pulau Sakra and Pulau Bakau will cover an area of approximately 139.5 hectares of the foreshore and seabed around these two islands as shown coloured pink on the plan marked as \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 8/82\", a copy of which is also displayed in the Library of this House. This reclamation, to meet the demand for land for industrial use, is expected to be completed by 1985 at an estimated cost of $140 million. Approximately 10 million cubic metres of fill required for this reclamation will be obtained by dredging the shallow areas around these islands, as shown coloured blue on the same plan. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the reclamations will be undertaken by the Jurong Town Corporation as agents of the Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves:- \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed off Tuas, Jurong, containing a total area of approximately 600 hectares as shown coloured pink and the dredging of the seabed as shown coloured blue on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/82\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed around Pulau Sakra and Pulau Bakau containing a total area of approximately 139.5 hectares as shown coloured pink and the dredging of the seabed as shown coloured blue on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 8/82\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>COMPLAINT BY THE MEMBER FOR</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ANSON</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I rise on a point of order. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your point of order, Mr Jeyaretnam? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it relates to proceedings in this House and what was said by the hon.

It was not, to quote the Member, \"found necessary to differentiate in the implementation date\" for the \"Professional and Upper Divisions of the Civil Service and those in the lower Divisions.\" The Professional Services Review Committee was set up to specifically look at the salaries and terms and conditions of service for the Administrative and Professional Services. The Committee came out with its recommendations which were accepted by Government and announced in this House on 3rd March 1982. In accordance with the long established practice adopted by the Finance Ministry and accepted by the various civil service unions, implementation was with effect from 1st April 1982 which is the first of the month following the official acceptance and announcement of the recommendations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also announced in this House at the same time that the revisions for the Administrative and Professional Services were announced, that all the other services would be reviewed by the Finance Ministry which expected to be able to complete the whole task by the end of June 1982. I am happy to say the Finance Ministry was able to keep to this target despite a very tight schedule and having to negotiate its proposals with several civil service unions. In accordance with the established practice, the implementation dates for all these were the first of the month following official acceptance and announcement of the proposals, or agreement with the unions concerned where negotiations with the unions where necessary. The dates of implementation for services other than the Administrative and Professional and excluding the SAF are as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n         1st April 1982                        No. of Officers\r\n\r\n         Division IV grades                         13,935\r\n\r\n         Daily Rated grades                         10,532\r\n\r\n         Senior Police Officers                        534\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Sub-total      25,001\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n         1st May 1982                          No. of officers\r\n\r\n         Education Service                           19,139\r\n\r\n         CPIB Senior Officers                            31\r\n\r\n         Narcotics Senior Officers                       14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Sub-total       19,184\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n         1st June 1982\r\n\r\n         All other services and\r\n\r\n         grades in Divisions I,\r\n\r\n         II and III                                  28,123\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Sub-total       28,123\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TOTAL:                         72,308\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen from this that both the Division IV and Daily Rated grades shared the same implementation date of 1st April 1982 as the Administrative and Professional Services and there was no discrimination, intended or otherwise, between the upper and lower divisions as the Member for Anson attempts to make out. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>TAXI DRIVERS' VOCATIONAL LICENCES</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Oral Test)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Therefore only those who satisfy all these requirements will be given taxi vocational licences. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspiring taxi drivers are required to speak some simple English because many people in Singapore speak the language. Chinese applicants are in addition required to know some simple Mandarin because it is our policy to promote the use of Mandarin instead of dialects. Mandarin is not relevant to Malay and Indian applicants. The oral Mandarin test is a simple test and very simple daily Mandarin conversation is required. This test does not pose a problem to the majority of the Chinese applicants. More than 90% of the applicants who have been interviewed by the ROV passed the test. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ALLOCATION OF FLATS IN ANSON CONSTITUENCY</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr J.B.

The completion dates for these units were, however, spread over a period of 4 months.

The Auditor-General has been consulted and has raised no objections to the PUB appointment of its auditors. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820727/19820727-HA-0420079.htm\">PUB ELECTRICITY TARIFF SYSTEM (Cols. 79 - 90)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br>  \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
