This is  a  new\r\n\r\nproject  for pig farming in Singapore  as  we  are\r\n\r\nencouraging the development of pig farming into  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  enterprise. I have  gone  through  the\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions attached to the application\r\n\r\nform.  It  is  clearly stated that  the  applicant\r\n\r\nshould  put  up  the building and  all  facilities\r\n\r\nincluding  multi-storey piggeries  on  the  5-acre\r\n\r\nland  and  maintain a production of 1,000  porkers\r\n\r\nper  acre per annum. Therefore, this project  must\r\n\r\ninvolve  at least a capital of $\u00ab million or  even\r\n\r\nmore. As such a big capital is required. I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  even  if pig farmers in Singapore  have  the\r\n\r\ndesire    and   the   practical   experience    of\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  this project,  they  have  very\r\n\r\nlittle  chance  of  doing  so  because  they   are\r\n\r\nindividual smallholders without big capital. I  am\r\n\r\nvery  disappointed over the fact that the Minister\r\n\r\ndoes  not  take  into  consideration  the  present\r\n\r\ncondition of pig farmers in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore, whereby provision could be made to give\r\n\r\nthem  a  chance  to participate in  this  project.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  sincerely  urge  the  Minister   to\r\n\r\nconsider if the Government can set aside a portion\r\n\r\nof  this land for the small pig farmers? Moreover,\r\n\r\nI  propose that Government be responsible for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  multi-storey piggeries and  all  the\r\n\r\nother  necessary facilities, including  pig  pens.\r\n\r\nThis  piggery can then be subdivided into  smaller\r\n\r\nunits  which  will be suitable for the  small  pig\r\n\r\nfarmers. Such pig farming units can be rented  out\r\n\r\nto   the  pig  farmers  or  sold  to  them  on  an\r\n\r\ninstalment basis. This will enable the pig farmers\r\n\r\nto  benefit from the project, and at the same time\r\n\r\nhelp  them to develop their pig rearing in  a  far\r\n\r\nbetter environment. Sir, if this can be done 1  am\r\n\r\nsure the farmers will deeply appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nannouncement  in increases in prices  for  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  fiats made by the Minister on 30th November\r\n\r\nlast   year  came  as  a  stunning  blow  to  many\r\n\r\nprospective   flat   owners.  With   the   current\r\n\r\ninflation, the increase in prices is an additional\r\n\r\nburden to the ordinary wage earners. Sir, you will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that before one decides to  apply  for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of a Housing Board flat, he will have\r\n\r\nto ascertain whether the price of the flat and the\r\n\r\ninstalment  payments  allowed  fit  in  with   his\r\n\r\nfinancial resources. He will then decide on either\r\n\r\na  three-, four- or five-room flat and the  period\r\n\r\nof  repayment,  whether it is in  10,  15,  or  20\r\n\r\nyears. Many applicants who have applied for  flats\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three years ago have based their decision\r\n\r\non  these  assumptions. But the increase  of  more\r\n\r\nthan   50  per  cent  in  prices  will  entail   a\r\n\r\ncorresponding  increase in the monthly  instalment\r\n\r\npayment.  Such  a  move by the Housing  Board  has\r\n\r\nindeed  caused  a  major upset  in  the  financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances of these prospective flat owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not in disagreement with the reasons\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Minister but I am questioning  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  this considerable  increase  in\r\n\r\nprices  is  being  imposed. In his  statement  the\r\n\r\nMinister stated that the cost of providing public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing  has risen considerably. These  are  facts\r\n\r\nthat  cannot  be  disputed.  But  why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  prices be spread over a  period  of,\r\n\r\nsay, eight years, thereby gradually increasing the\r\n\r\nburden rather than a sudden blow. By doing so, the\r\n\r\nprice  of a three-room flat will only be increased\r\n\r\nat  the  rate of $500 each year. Moreover, such  a\r\n\r\nscheme will apply to a lesser number of applicants\r\n\r\nat  any one time. It will be gradual. Probably the\r\n\r\nMinister   feared   that  the   private   property\r\n\r\ndevelopers  will take advantage of  this  and  use\r\n\r\nthis  as an excuse for raising the prices of their\r\n\r\nproperties.  Sir,  prices  of  properties  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector have been increasing by leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds over the last eight years, which is several\r\n\r\nhundred per cent more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on another problem\r\n\r\nfaced by applicants for Housing Board flats.  Many\r\n\r\napplicants have been waiting for their  flats  for\r\n\r\nas  long as three years. Since the Board is unable\r\n\r\nto  meet  the needs of these applicants many  have\r\n\r\nresorted  to  unauthorised occupation  of  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  rented  from  the  flat  owners   or\r\n\r\ntenants. Unfortunately, the Housing Board  took  a\r\n\r\ndim view of these happenings, and eviction notices\r\n\r\nwere served on the owners or tenants. Notices read\r\n\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You are hereby requested to evict so-and-so and\r\n\r\nresume  proper  occupation of your  flat,  failing\r\n\r\nwhich  legal action will be served to recover  the\r\n\r\nsaid property.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  where can these people go to for alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation,  if  the Housing  Board  itself  is\r\n\r\nunable    to   provide   them   with   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation because of the length of time in the\r\n\r\nconstruction of flats. They are all ordinary  wage\r\n\r\nearners and they are in no position to find  cheap\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation in the  private  sector\r\n\r\nunless  they  want to live in shacks  in  squatter\r\n\r\nareas.  I am not encouraging or condoning breaches\r\n\r\nof Housing Board regulations, but in situations of\r\n\r\nthis  nature sympathetic consideration  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  in  order to alleviate the plight of  these\r\n\r\napplicants  for  Housing  Board  flats.   May   I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, suggest that unauthorised occupiers  of\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats, who have registered for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurchase  or  rental of Housing  Board  flats,  be\r\n\r\npermitted on compassionate grounds to stay in such\r\n\r\nflats until they have been allocated flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Sir, you may\r\n\r\nrecall the announcement that was made in September\r\n\r\nlast   year  regarding  the  restriction  on   the\r\n\r\npurchase   of   residential  properties   in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  It stated that non-citizens,  permanent\r\n\r\nresidents, and companies incorporated in Singapore\r\n\r\nor   abroad  must  obtain  permission   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  buy  houses.  This  announcement,\r\n\r\nthough  rather belatedly, was welcomed  as  it  is\r\n\r\nintended   to   curb  speculation  in  residential\r\n\r\nproperties  with  a view to assisting  our  middle\r\n\r\nincome group of citizens, who are not eligible  at\r\n\r\nthe  present moment to purchase HDB flats, to  own\r\n\r\nprivate houses as part of the Government's overall\r\n\r\nhome ownership policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the announcement in last September,\r\n\r\nthere was a complete silence on the subject.  Some\r\n\r\nof  the  permanent residents and non-citizens  who\r\n\r\nwish  to  buy houses genuinely for their own  use,\r\n\r\nhoping to make their home in the Republic, are  at\r\n\r\na  loss  as to where their applications should  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted,  or  how  to  go  about  obtaining  the\r\n\r\nnecessary permission. Some of them have  tried,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, and they have been going around from  one\r\n\r\ndepartment  to another. Some of them  are  in  our\r\n\r\ncivil  service  and industry and  other  services.\r\n\r\nMany  of them are making a useful contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe progress and prosperity of this country. There\r\n\r\nis  no  doubt  that  we wish them  well  and  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  their  continued  contributions   and\r\n\r\nservice.  Therefore,  I will  be  pleased  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister could kindly inform the House as to  when\r\n\r\nwill  he  introduce legislation relating  to  this\r\n\r\nannouncement   last  September  to  regulate   the\r\n\r\npurchase  of local residential property. And  will\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  also indicate the reasons  for  the\r\n\r\ndelay  in enacting this piece of legislation,  and\r\n\r\nwhether the delay is a deliberate measure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am still on the subject of home\r\n\r\nownership, I wonder if the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  could elaborate on a recent announcement\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will be building houses  for\r\n\r\nour  middle-class citizens. Would  he  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  as  to  who  will be  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nproject?  Where  and when will  this  middle-class\r\n\r\nhousing estate be constructed? How many units will\r\n\r\nbe  built annually? What will be the terms of sale\r\n\r\nand  whether  there  will  be  any  income  limits\r\n\r\nimposed on the purchase of these houses? I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  not only members of the middle-income public\r\n\r\nare  thrilled by the announcement, but  also  some\r\n\r\nMembers of this House are just as anxious to  hear\r\n\r\nmore about this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Sir, I rise in support\r\n\r\nof  my  colleague, the Member for  Bukit  Panjang.\r\n\r\nSir,  though  we  cannot deny the commendable  job\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  Primary  Production  Department  on\r\n\r\nagriculture  over the decade, we must  admit  that\r\n\r\nsometimes  it does make silly decisions.  Although\r\n\r\nwe  are not discussing the merits and demerits  of\r\n\r\nthe  Department  at this juncture,  I  cannot  but\r\n\r\npoint Out to the Minister one or two mistakes made\r\n\r\nby  the  Department recently. One  mistake,  which\r\n\r\nappeared  somewhat shameful on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  was  that sometime  ago  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction   Department  ordered   the   feedstuff\r\n\r\nmerchants  to  decrease the  price  of  feedstuff.\r\n\r\nHowever, later the merchants not only ignored  the\r\n\r\norder but also jacked up the price further. Surely\r\n\r\nthe  Department could have studied the supply  and\r\n\r\ndemand  of feedstuff before placing an order,  and\r\n\r\nthen the order could be made firm and effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another mistake was the decision to lease out the\r\n\r\nplot of land, as mentioned by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang, only to big-time farmers for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  pig rearing. This is another evidence that the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department is in favour of big-time  farmers only. Ordinary farmers,  I  believe,\r\n\r\nare  frightened  by the rules and  regulations  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of this proposed pig farm. In  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  I think it is basically wrong  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the big-time farmers only, for this  is  in\r\n\r\nviolation of the fundamental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciples of democratic socialism which our Party\r\n\r\nadvocates.  It is the small-time farmers  that  we\r\n\r\nshould look after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that land is scarce in\r\n\r\nSingapore and we have to make use of air space  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  agriculture. Surely  the  Government  can\r\n\r\nbuild   standard   multi-storey   pigsties    with\r\n\r\ninfrastructure provided and let them  out  to  our\r\n\r\nsmall-time farmers to enable them to make a living\r\n\r\nout  of pig rearing. I think this is more workable\r\n\r\nand  beneficial  to  our farming  community  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   I  will,  therefore,  urge  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  to give serious consideration  to  this\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to touch on a very small point on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  on  land  acquisition.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment policy has caused dissatisfaction among\r\n\r\nthose property owners who have been affected by it\r\n\r\nbecause  they felt that the compensation  was  not\r\n\r\nonly  inadequate but also unfair as the  offer  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  was made to them nearly  four  years\r\n\r\nafter they were informed of the acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has started\r\n\r\nacquiring   houses  for  urban   renewal   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency since 1969, and the owners were asked\r\n\r\nto   submit   claims  for  compensation   to   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Lands. In  compliance  with  the\r\n\r\nnotice, all affected house owners submitted claims\r\n\r\nfor  compensation through their certified  valuers\r\n\r\nin  1970.  But after that, nothing was heard  from\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Lands. However, in 1974, four\r\n\r\nyears   after   the  submission  of  claims,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Lands has just made up his mind to\r\n\r\nannounce  his offer of compensation to the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned. Sir, you will agree with me that  there\r\n\r\nis a world of difference in land prices as well as\r\n\r\nthe  purchasing  power of money between  1970  and\r\n\r\n1974.  There  is no need for me to  illustrate  or\r\n\r\nelaborate on this. They felt that the Commissioner\r\n\r\nhad  taken unfair advantage by delaying the matter\r\n\r\nfor four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  as  the claims for compensation  had  been\r\n\r\nforwarded to the Commissioner since 1970. Why  was\r\n\r\nit  necessary  to  take  four  years  to  pay  the\r\n\r\ncompensation? Besides this unnecessary delay,  the\r\n\r\ncompensation offered by the Commissioner of  Lands\r\n\r\nwas only half of what they claimed four years ago.\r\n\r\nNo  doubt, there is provision for appeal  if  they\r\n\r\nfeel that the compensation is inadequate. But  let\r\n\r\nus  be frank about it. How many people would  like\r\n\r\nto  go to court and appeal against the Government?\r\n\r\nGoing  to  court and fighting a case  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is one thing, there is also  the  legal\r\n\r\nexpenses,  the  time  spent  in  court,  and   the\r\n\r\ninconvenience caused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister: is four  years  the  usual\r\n\r\nlength  of  time  that the Commissioner  of  Lands\r\n\r\nneeds  to determine the offer of compensation  for\r\n\r\nacquisition of houses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

The  fact  of\r\n\r\nowning  a  home or staying in one at a  reasonable\r\n\r\nrent  is  satisfaction  of a  basic  physical  and\r\n\r\nsocial need of the people and the achievement of a\r\n\r\nsense  of  security. This is a basic need  of  the\r\n\r\nmiddle income group as much as it is a basic  need\r\n\r\nof  the lower income group. Where this need  could\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied by their own efforts a few years ago\r\n\r\n(that  is, the people in the middle income group),\r\n\r\nthe  dramatic rise in the value of houses  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  has  removed  hopes   of   their\r\n\r\nrealising this need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing restriction, Sir, on the sale of\r\n\r\nprivate  property to non-citizens was enforced  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  last year to lower the  steep  rise  in\r\n\r\nproperty  values,  so that home ownership  may  be\r\n\r\nspread  among the different categories of  workers\r\n\r\nin   our  society.  The  restriction  has  had   a\r\n\r\ndampening  effect  and property values  have  been\r\n\r\nsaid  to  fall by 15 to 25 per cent of  values  in\r\n\r\nAugust  last year. However, prospect of a  further\r\n\r\nsignificant  decline in property values  does  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  be real in view of the steep  rise  in\r\n\r\nprices  and costs of building materials,  services\r\n\r\nand  labour.  The  present  property  values  seem\r\n\r\nalready  grounded upon real cost of materials  and\r\n\r\nconstruction  and appear unlikely to fall  further\r\n\r\nsignificantly.  This notwithstanding,  the  middle\r\n\r\nincome group generally cannot afford the prices of\r\n\r\nhouses  in  the  private sector  today,  as  these\r\n\r\nprices remain beyond their financial resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation makes it important for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to start programming for ownership  of\r\n\r\nHDB  homes by the middle income group. The  middle\r\n\r\nincome      group     comprises     professionals,\r\n\r\nadministrators, and executives both in the  public\r\n\r\nand  private sectors upon whom, as the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  admitted last year, the security and progress\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  depends. The  middle  income  group\r\n\r\nwould be assisted in some measure towards buying a\r\n\r\nhome from the private sector if a portion of their\r\n\r\nsavings  in  the Central Provident Fund  could  be\r\n\r\nused  by  them  for  this purpose.  However,  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion  was  turned down by  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for Labour a few days ago in the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe Estimates for his Ministry. As long as all our\r\n\r\nworkers  can  find in the meaning of hard  work  a\r\n\r\npractical  realisation of their basic  aspirations\r\n\r\nrelating  to true necessities and sound  luxuries,\r\n\r\nour  nation will continue, I think, to survive and\r\n\r\nprosper  by  the loyalty, skill and dedication  of\r\n\r\nthe middle income group workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will be able to state a\r\n\r\nfavourable answer to me on this issue as  much  as\r\n\r\nto the hon.

There  are\r\n\r\nreasons for such a move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this will help small farmers to\r\n\r\nalleviate their economic difficulties. At present,\r\n\r\npig  farmers  in  the  rural areas,  for  example,\r\n\r\nSembawang and Jurong, Bukit Panjang, and Nee Soon,\r\n\r\nare faced with the same difficulties. In order  to\r\n\r\ncomply with the regulations of the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  in  other  words  they  should   not\r\n\r\npollute the water resources, they must construct a\r\n\r\ndrain round the pig farms to ensure that there  is\r\n\r\nproper drainage of the filthy water. But it  costs\r\n\r\na  few  thousand dollars to build  such  a  sewage\r\n\r\nsystem.  This  is quite beyond the  means  of  the\r\n\r\nsmall farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the building of pig farms will increase\r\n\r\npig  production. We know that because of the  high\r\n\r\ncost  of animal feed, small farmers were not  able\r\n\r\nto  carry on with pig farming, and hence there was\r\n\r\na  shortage in the supply of pigs. The result  was\r\n\r\nthat  pig prices went up by 300 per cent from  $50\r\n\r\nto  $220 per picul. This will increase the  burden\r\n\r\non   the   consumers.  So  long  as  the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department could let out the pig  farms\r\n\r\nat  low  rentals  to the small  farmers,  and  buy\r\n\r\nanimal  feed  in bulk and sell it to  the  farmers\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a reduction in prices  of  animal\r\n\r\nfeed.  Thus,  there will be a balance between  the\r\n\r\nsupply and demand of pigs to bring down prices  of\r\n\r\npork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to prevent pollution in the farming\r\n\r\nareas  where  there  are  modern  pig  farms   and\r\n\r\nfacilities,  the  pig  farmers  can   be   grouped\r\n\r\ntogether in a collective farm so that the  problem\r\n\r\nof pollution will not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Member for Jurong said that in\r\n\r\ndrafting  such  a project, the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment seems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  look  after the interests of the  big  farmers\r\n\r\nbecause they are able to put in $1 million  or  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  capital, but for the small  farmers  even\r\n\r\n$10,000  is quite beyond their means. Sir, letting\r\n\r\nout  such pig farms to the small farmers will  get\r\n\r\nrid  of  the monopoly of the big farmers  so  that\r\n\r\nmore  and  more pig farmers can take part  in  pig\r\n\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister could accept\r\n\r\nsuch   suggestions,  namely,  that   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department builds pig farms  and  then\r\n\r\nsell  or  rent them out to farmers, I believe  the\r\n\r\nsmall farmers in the rural areas will be grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  has touched on Head LG subhead  AA  3008,\r\n\r\nwould the Member for Telok Blangah like to join in\r\n\r\ntoo?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  has  helped me solve a number of very  knotty\r\n\r\nproblems  connected  with the resettlement  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to $506 million to be given as a\r\n\r\nloan  to  the Housing and Development Board  under\r\n\r\nsubhead   AA   3008   and  the  appropriation   of\r\n\r\n$10,552,000  to the Resettlement Department  under\r\n\r\nsubhead AA 3006, $30 million is to be given  as  a\r\n\r\ncontribution under subhead AA 2730 to the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board for the financial year 1974.\r\n\r\nThis  totals up to $546,552,000. Sir,  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  doubling this appropriation would  not  even\r\n\r\nsave  the  Housing and Development Board from  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  that  it  is facing  in  building  the\r\n\r\nrequired  number of housing units for  our  needs.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Housing and Development  Board  has\r\n\r\nbeen   accorded   world-wide   acclaim   for   its\r\n\r\nachievements, it has not been able to satisfy  our\r\n\r\nneeds,  the  local  needs. I  believe  it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  we  do not have the means to  build  more\r\n\r\nflats than at present but because the planning and\r\n\r\nprogramming of our housing requirements have  gone\r\n\r\nhaywire.  Perhaps, the Minister being  an  amiable\r\n\r\nman  has allowed himself to give in too easily  to\r\n\r\npressures  by  other Ministries and the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.   As   it  is,  the  people  affected   by\r\n\r\nresettlement, although eligible for priority, have\r\n\r\nto   wait   for  years  before  they  are  offered\r\n\r\nalternative   accommodation.   There   are   other\r\n\r\ncategories  of persons who are also  eligible  for\r\n\r\npriority accommodation. The latest addition to the\r\n\r\npriority list is ex-national servicemen. If we  go\r\n\r\non adding to this list of priority cases, then the\r\n\r\nday  will come when normal applicants for  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats may have to wait a decade before  they\r\n\r\nare allocated flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  if the Minister is not careful, one of these\r\n\r\ndays,  the  Minister for Health, who is  not  here\r\n\r\nnow,  is going to ask for priority for people  who\r\n\r\nundergo voluntary sterilization. As it is, we have\r\n\r\nnow two queues - one for persons with priority and\r\n\r\nthe other for persons without any priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain what I mean by bad planning and\r\n\r\ninadequate programming. I can best illustrate this\r\n\r\nby  quoting examples from my own constituency.  By\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1971, part of Pulau Brani was  to  be\r\n\r\nused by MINDEF and the other part was appropriated\r\n\r\nfor PSA. A survey was made and residents were told\r\n\r\nthat  they  had to move out, but no Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats  were  set  aside nor  planned  for  orderly\r\n\r\nresettlement. They had been asked to register  for\r\n\r\nareas  of their choice. Many of them wanted  flats\r\n\r\nin  Telok Blangah, but upon registration when they\r\n\r\nrequested  that they be registered  for  flats  in\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah, they were told that they would have\r\n\r\nto   register   for  Henderson  area   which   had\r\n\r\napparently been set aside for them. However,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Henderson flats were balloted, only a handful\r\n\r\nof  them were allotted flats there. Again, in 1972\r\n\r\na  few  households were allocated flats  far  away\r\n\r\nfrom Telok Blangah, resulting in undue hardship to\r\n\r\nthe persons affected. It took almost two years  to\r\n\r\nresettle  about  half  the households  from  Pulau\r\n\r\nBrani.  Meanwhile, the school on  the  island  was\r\n\r\nclosed,  quite rightly, as the student  population\r\n\r\nhad  decreased  and the remaining islanders  found\r\n\r\nthemselves practically marooned on the  island  as\r\n\r\nthe  sampan-ferrying  facilities  were  disrupted.\r\n\r\nSir,  to-date almost 2\u00ab years after being informed\r\n\r\nthat  they  would be resettled, a large number  of\r\n\r\nhouseholds  are  still on the island  without  any\r\n\r\nbasic  communal or social service such as schools.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the houses on the island, which are  not\r\n\r\nbrick  and mortar houses but built on stilts  with\r\n\r\nplanks and attap or zinc roofing, are in a serious\r\n\r\nstate of disrepair. They need constant repair  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance. Once indication was given  that  they\r\n\r\nwould be resettled soon, neither the chief tenants\r\n\r\nnor the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse-owners  were  prepared to  incur  additional\r\n\r\nexpenses on repairs. Partially abandoned huts also\r\n\r\npose many health and fire hazards. This is what  I\r\n\r\nmean  by improper planning and programming  before\r\n\r\nurban renewal is undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, resettlement is not a pleasant business\r\n\r\nthough  it  is sometimes necessary. Let  me  liken\r\n\r\nresettlement  to  surgery for  the  removal  of  a\r\n\r\ncancerous growth with which you are very familiar.\r\n\r\nSir,  when  a surgeon needs to perform a  surgical\r\n\r\noperation, he will have all his instruments ready,\r\n\r\nthe theatre prepared, a ready bed in the ward, and\r\n\r\nassurance  of  an adequate supply  of  blood  made\r\n\r\navailable,  before  even  deciding  to  wheel  the\r\n\r\npatient  into the theatre. And during surgery,  he\r\n\r\nwill use a sharp scalpel and make a firm deft one-stroke incision. He does not go about it using  an\r\n\r\nold  razor  blade, nor after having  gone  halfway\r\n\r\nthrough the operation look for a hospital  bed  or\r\n\r\nlook for a supply of blood when the patient begins\r\n\r\nto bleed. This is what the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard is doing today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> After such a gory description of\r\n\r\nresettlement, perhaps the Minister would  like  to\r\n\r\nreply!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, may I first deal with the question of commercial pig farming which has been\r\n\r\nreferred to by three Members of Parliament? First,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Bukit  Panjang  has  given  some\r\n\r\ndetails  about  the proposals,  which  were  quite\r\n\r\nright. There are eight 5-acre lots of land located\r\n\r\noff  Bah Soon Pah Road which were recently offered\r\n\r\nfor   commercial  pig  farming.  Members  may   be\r\n\r\ninterested to know that of the lots offered  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  seven tenders, some wanting more  than\r\n\r\none  lot. The whole object of this exercise, which\r\n\r\nis  a  pilot scheme, is to increase the supply  of\r\n\r\npigs  for  the market. The Members have  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should  build  these  multi-storey structures and rent them out to the smaller\r\n\r\nfarmers. The Member for Sembawang went further  to\r\n\r\nsay  that the Primary Production Department should\r\n\r\nbuy the feed in bulk and sell them to the farmers.\r\n\r\nNext, he will suggest that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department should rear the pigs\r\n\r\nfor them! I think all these three Members know, if\r\n\r\nthey are active in their constituencies, that  the\r\n\r\nwork  done  by  the Primary Production  Department\r\n\r\nover  the years has been to help small farmers.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  propose  to go into the details.  But  to\r\n\r\nallege  that we are only helping the rich  farmers\r\n\r\nand that it is not in accordance with the policies\r\n\r\nof  our  own  Party, is not fair. They  have  also\r\n\r\ngrumbled  about  the silly mistakes  made  by  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department, one of which was to\r\n\r\nlet  out  these lots of land. Only time will  tell\r\n\r\nwhether  this  is  a silly mistake.  Assuming  the\r\n\r\nproject  is  successful, we  may  then  go  on  to\r\n\r\nsmaller projects. But for the moment, in order  to\r\n\r\nbe  successful we think that the project ought  to\r\n\r\nbe a substantial one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also surprised that the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  blamed for evicting small  farmers\r\n\r\nfrom  the catchment areas. The Members should have\r\n\r\ntaken  this  point  up when the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment was being discussed in this House.  It\r\n\r\nis  the  Ministry of the Environment  that  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge   of  pollution,  and  it  is  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board that is building the reservoir  in\r\n\r\nKranji.  The question is whether they want  enough\r\n\r\nfresh water or enough pigs. So where the pig farms\r\n\r\npollute  some  of the streams, we move  them  away\r\n\r\nfrom the streams. Hence, this pig farming project.\r\n\r\nBut  they  have got to decide what they want.  And\r\n\r\nsometimes the Government decides this for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh grumbled about the\r\n\r\nincreases  in  prices of Housing  Board  flats.  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  go into the details as to the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy the prices have gone up. He just wants to know\r\n\r\nwhy  we did not spread this over a period of eight\r\n\r\nyears  so that the blow would not be so heavy.  It\r\n\r\nis not easy to spread it over eight years. Because\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know what will happen in  eight  years\r\n\r\ntime!  Perhaps the prices will have to go up again\r\n\r\nat  the  end of this year or next; I do not  know,\r\n\r\nbut I hope not. But to plan for so long and spread\r\n\r\nit over eight years is not a practical solution to\r\n\r\nthe problem of rising prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then said that because of the shortage\r\n\r\nof  flats, unauthorised subletting should  not  be\r\n\r\ninterfered  with.  The Member will  remember  that\r\n\r\nsometime last year or early this year, the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board announced that  sublettings\r\n\r\nwould  be  allowed.  A three-room  flat  could  be\r\n\r\nsublet,  so  could a four-room or  five-room  flat\r\n\r\nprovided  there are not many occupants already  in\r\n\r\nthe  flat. I would suggest to the Member  that  he\r\n\r\nadvises  his  constituents who have  sublet  their\r\n\r\nflats to regularise the position because it is  no\r\n\r\nlonger illegal to sublet Housing Board flats.  And\r\n\r\nthey  can go further; they can even sublet Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats to non-citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Keat wanted to know when\r\n\r\nlegislation  will  be  ready  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  statement  made last  September  about\r\n\r\nforeigners owning land, and whether the  delay  is\r\n\r\ndeliberate. I can assure him that it is not.  What\r\n\r\nis  the  point  of delaying this legislation?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment gets no benefit from this.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nsimple  legislation and we have had several drafts\r\n\r\ndrawn up by the Attorney-General. The Member  will\r\n\r\nbe  happy to know that a final draft is now before\r\n\r\nGovernment, and the Bill will be introduced at our\r\n\r\nnext  meeting  of  Parliament,  after  the  Budget\r\n\r\nsession.  Meanwhile, the Registrar of  Titles  has\r\n\r\nreceived  quite a few applications from foreigners\r\n\r\nto  purchase  land. These applications  are  being\r\n\r\nprocessed by a committee and replies will be given\r\n\r\nsoon.  Anyone who does not know whom to apply  to,\r\n\r\nshould apply to the Registrar of Titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah grumbled about land\r\n\r\nacquisition. He made some good points. One  is  on\r\n\r\ndelays  in  issuing awards. There have  been  some\r\n\r\ndelays  of  up  to four years, which  I  agree  is\r\n\r\nunfair. But I had on several occasions in the year\r\n\r\nbefore  last  directed those in  charge  to  issue\r\n\r\ntheir awards as soon as possible and at the latest\r\n\r\nwithin  a  period  of six months.  But  there  are\r\n\r\ndifficulties in cases where a large piece of  land\r\n\r\nhas  been  acquired  and there  are  thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople on the land,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in  cases where there are several  owners.  A\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  those present on the land  takes  some\r\n\r\ntime. But the Member can rest assured that I  have\r\n\r\nalready directed and the Land Collectors are doing\r\n\r\ntheir best to expedite the issue of awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also talks of appeals, saying that\r\n\r\nappeals  are no good because they cost  money  and\r\n\r\nwho  wants to appeal against the Government. Well,\r\n\r\nsome  people do. Is the Member suggesting  that  I\r\n\r\namend  the  Land Acquisition Act  to  get  rid  of\r\n\r\nappeals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Kim Keat and Serangoon Gardens\r\n\r\nwant  to  know  more details about  middle  income\r\n\r\nhousing.  I only hope some other Members  opposite\r\n\r\ndo  not  accuse  them of not being  for  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople. The Housing and Development Board and  the\r\n\r\nUrban  Redevelopment  Authority  will  jointly  be\r\n\r\nconstructing  about  1,500  to  2,000  residential\r\n\r\nflats  per  year  for sale to  the  middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup,  that is to say, those who are not eligible\r\n\r\nfor  HDB housing. Six sites have been selected  to\r\n\r\nprovide  about 3,200 units of flats in  the  first\r\n\r\nfew  years. The first lot of flats is expected  to\r\n\r\nbe   ready  in  1976  and  more  details  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced  shortly.  The six  sites  proposed  for\r\n\r\nthese  houses are at Tanjong Rhu, on the reclaimed\r\n\r\nland  in  front  of the Singapore  Swimming  Club,\r\n\r\nabout  760  units; Upper Thomson  Road  about  240\r\n\r\nunits;  Farrer  Road about 600 units;  East  Coast\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land  about 900 units;  Mount  Pleasant\r\n\r\nabout  320 units; and Braddell Road, near Braddell\r\n\r\nRise,  about  400  units.  A  joint  company,  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Urban Company (Proprietary)  Limited,\r\n\r\nhas    been   incorporated   to   undertake    the\r\n\r\nconstruction  and sale. Obviously  there  must  be\r\n\r\nlimits to the incomes of those wanting to purchase\r\n\r\nthese  flats. At the moment, if a person's  income\r\n\r\nexceeds  $1,500  a  month, he  cannot  purchase  a\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flat. Perhaps it would be  fair  to\r\n\r\nallow  those  earning,  say,  between  $1,500  and\r\n\r\n$2,500  or  $3,000  to purchase these  new  middle\r\n\r\nincome houses. Of course, they must be Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens and, further, they must not own  any\r\n\r\nother property. If they already own a house,  then\r\n\r\nthey  will be prohibited from buying any of  these\r\n\r\nnew flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also wants an\r\n\r\nanswer  from me about the use of Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  savings for middle income housing.  The  CPF\r\n\r\ndoes  not  come under my Ministry, and whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  it is desirable to allow intending purchasers\r\n\r\nof  middle income housing to draw their CPF monies\r\n\r\nis  a matter over which I have no jurisdiction and\r\n\r\non which I have no comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah alleges that\r\n\r\nplanning  has gone haywire in my Ministry.  If  it\r\n\r\nhas,  God  help  Telok Blangah.  He  compares  the\r\n\r\nexercise in Pulau Brani with that of a surgeon who\r\n\r\ndoes  not prepare at all but goes in with a  blunt\r\n\r\nscalpel. The \"surgeon\" in Pulau Brani is  not  the\r\n\r\nHousing   Board  or  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. It is the Ministry of Defence and the\r\n\r\nPort of Singapore Authority. They have gone to the\r\n\r\nisland to develop it and my Ministry has been left\r\n\r\nto  pick up the parts. We do not want Pulau Brani,\r\n\r\nand we never pushed the Member's constituents out.\r\n\r\nOthers  did  it.  But we are supposed  to  provide\r\n\r\npublic housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> You are the instrument!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We are not the knife. We are supposed\r\n\r\nto  provide housing as quickly as possible because\r\n\r\npressure  is put on us by the Ministry of Defence,\r\n\r\nwho  are in a hurry to get in, and by the MP,  who\r\n\r\nis  in a hurry to get houses for his constituents.\r\n\r\nAll  I  can  say is: be patient. We are doing  our\r\n\r\nbest. It is not easy to build Housing Board flats.\r\n\r\nIt  is not like producing motor cars, chickens  or\r\n\r\neggs.  We  are increasing the number of flats  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  so many demands spread throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland.  So  it  is not fair to  allege  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of those entitled to priority is increasing\r\n\r\nto  such a great extent that no one else will have\r\n\r\na chance. The number does not exceed ten per cent,\r\n\r\nwhether it includes the Army, the Police or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  civil servants.

I  am  aware of  the  Housing  Board's\r\n\r\nrecent  policy  to  allow  subletting  to  certain\r\n\r\ncategories of applicants. In fact, I have assisted\r\n\r\nquite  a number of these people to regularise  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was referring to is the group of\r\n\r\nunauthorised   occupiers  who  cannot   meet   the\r\n\r\nrequired stipulations, in other words a flat owner\r\n\r\nhas  more  than three children to a room  and  the\r\n\r\nunauthorised  occupiers  number  more  than   four\r\n\r\npersons to a room. These are the people who are in\r\n\r\na   desperate  position  because  while  they  are\r\n\r\nwaiting  for a flat to be allocated,  maybe  in  a\r\n\r\nyear  or  two years from now, they are  unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  any other form of alternative accommodation.\r\n\r\nSo  my request to the Minister is whether he would\r\n\r\nask  the  Housing Board to consider relaxing  this\r\n\r\nrule?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I were to ask the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  to relax that rule, the whole of Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nwill  be  turned into one big slum.

I\r\n\r\nmerely mentioned that, in view of the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  Labour having turned down the  request\r\n\r\nfor   the   release  of  Central  Provident   Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions for the purchase of property in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  by people not qualified  for  HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  the decision by the Minister, such as  the\r\n\r\none  released just now, was very much  wanting.  I\r\n\r\nwas,  in  fact,  not  seeking  an  answer  on  the\r\n\r\nprovident fund from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, may I say that the answer given by the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  indeed been favourable,  and  I  am\r\n\r\ngratified for it and I am sure that a large number\r\n\r\nof people in the middle income group are similarly\r\n\r\ngratified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development said  just  now\r\n\r\nthat  he  does  not agree to the  construction  of\r\n\r\nflatted  pig farms for renting purposes.  He  also\r\n\r\nsaid that the next thing I would ask is to get the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department to rear pigs for the\r\n\r\nfarmers. This is not my intention at all.  But  if\r\n\r\nit  is  the intention of the Minister to  get  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department  to  rear  pigs,  I\r\n\r\nthink it will be most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I appreciate that water pollution comes\r\n\r\nunder  the  portfolio  of  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  I  think the present  problem  is  a\r\n\r\npolicy for the Government to implement. If we have\r\n\r\nmodern  flatted pig farms made available to  small\r\n\r\nfarmers  on a renting basis, it will help a  great\r\n\r\ndeal in reducing water pollution. Irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhich Ministry is responsible for water pollution,\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate  result  is  the  same.  With  these\r\n\r\nflatted farms we can cut down water pollution, and\r\n\r\nthat  is the Government's intention. So this is  a\r\n\r\nplan  to  be  welcomed. In any case,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned to reconsider this matter.  If\r\n\r\nit cannot be done at the present stage, perhaps he\r\n\r\ncan  consider it at the second or third  stage  so\r\n\r\nthat when this plan is implemented we will be able\r\n\r\nto have flatted farms available for small farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, as the Minister has rightly\r\n\r\nput  it, whether or not the Bah Soon Pah farm will\r\n\r\nsucceed  only  time will tell.

As far as I know, some of these farms\r\n\r\nare  situated quite far away from the  reservoirs.\r\n\r\nEven then the farmers have been asked to implement\r\n\r\ncertain  measures which cost a lot of money,  such\r\n\r\nas  building septic tanks. It would cost something\r\n\r\nlike  $10,000  to $20,000 to build a septic  tank,\r\n\r\nand  I do not think any of these small farmers can\r\n\r\nreally afford it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what the Government could do is to\r\n\r\nconsider  a  comprehensive plan.

Therefore, by  developing  such\r\n\r\nkind  of  facilities  on a collective  basis,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can definitely cut down the  cost,  and\r\n\r\neven  if it asked the farmer to contribute to some\r\n\r\nextent, I am sure they will be prepared to do  so.\r\n\r\nAt  the moment, they seemed to be at the mercy  of\r\n\r\nthe  inspector going around.

I think he understood\r\n\r\nthat. He said that we should do something. We  are\r\n\r\ndoing something. Hence, these five-acre lots which\r\n\r\nwe  have offered, and which he has criticised.  We\r\n\r\nare not against the poor farmers, in spite of what\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jurong says. We can still have pigs\r\n\r\nnear  the catchment area provided the streams  are\r\n\r\nnot  polluted, which means that the pig farms have\r\n\r\nto  be moved. If there is available land, they can\r\n\r\nmove    there.   When   Seletar   Reservoir    was\r\n\r\nconstructed,  it  was Government  that  built  the\r\n\r\ncesspits.  The  Member  should  have  raised   his\r\n\r\nquestion  with  the Minister for the  Environment.\r\n\r\nHis  inspectors go round and check  on  pollution,\r\n\r\nnot  mine.  But  we  are doing  our  best  not  to\r\n\r\neliminate  the poor farmers, but in the process  I\r\n\r\nthink  the backyard farmer will be pushed out.  He\r\n\r\nis  not really a farmer.

In  my  dealings\r\n\r\nwith  this  particular Department,  I  have  often\r\n\r\nfound  them to be quite inflexible and insensitive\r\n\r\nto human problems. I had on a number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccasions to go there concerning notices  for  the\r\n\r\ndemolition  of illegal structures or  unauthorised\r\n\r\nchange  of  use of premises. Despite my pleas  for\r\n\r\nextension  of time, the officers have displayed  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  lack of sympathy by flatly  refusing  to\r\n\r\ngrant  an extension in a number of cases. Yet,  in\r\n\r\none  particular  case, after my  constituents  had\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  obtain  a letter  from  a  particular\r\n\r\nMinister  -  incidentally it was not the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development - the extension of  time\r\n\r\nwas   immediately  granted.  So   one   gets   the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the  department  seems   to   be\r\n\r\npractising double standards. They seem to consider\r\n\r\nthat  the  request is based not  so  much  on  the\r\n\r\nmerits of the case but on who puts it up. From the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  I  have received, some  of  the  staff\r\n\r\nwould  appear to be rather off-handed in attending\r\n\r\nto   members  of  the  public.  I  give  them  the\r\n\r\nallowance, as this is a fairly new department.  It\r\n\r\nmay  well  be  that the staff are not sufficiently\r\n\r\nwell-oriented to provide courteous service, and  I\r\n\r\nwould appreciate the Minister's attention in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only wish\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister if he will inform the House of\r\n\r\nthe  achievements of the Bases Economic Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment, and the progress made so  far  in  the\r\n\r\nconversion  programme. I need not stress,  in  our\r\n\r\nland-scarce  State, the vital role played  by  the\r\n\r\nBases    Economic   Conversion    Department    in\r\n\r\nexpeditiously redeploying land, formerly  occupied\r\n\r\nby British bases, to economic use.

But   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  since the 1st April,  1973,  been\r\n\r\nfunctioning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas a division of the Land Office  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Law. I hope it is not being suggested\r\n\r\nthat   civil  servants  in  the  Department   were\r\n\r\npreviously inflexible and that since coming to the\r\n\r\nLand Office things have changed. But the policy is\r\n\r\nthe  same  and,  since 1972,  the  Department  has\r\n\r\nhandled  a  total of 149 enforcement  cases  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  the  subject  of  representations   by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament. Of these, 100 cases  were\r\n\r\ndealt  with  departmentally -  35  representations\r\n\r\nfrom  Members of Parliament for extension of  time\r\n\r\nto  permit voluntary demolition were all approved,\r\n\r\nand   65   cases,  18  of  which  involved   minor\r\n\r\nalterations  and  contraventions,  which  did  not\r\n\r\nviolate  the  planning  or building  by-laws  were\r\n\r\nregularised. The remaining 49 cases were rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy appears to me to be flexible. Seven\r\n\r\nappeals against decisions of the Land Office  were\r\n\r\ndealt   with  by  the  Licensing  Committee  which\r\n\r\nauthorised  regularisation  in  four   cases   and\r\n\r\nrejected  the other three. Of the 42 appeals  made\r\n\r\nto  me,  38  have to be rejected, three have  been\r\n\r\nregularised,   and  one  case   is   still   being\r\n\r\nprocessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that out of these 149 cases, 77\r\n\r\ncases  were from the Chia Keng and Simbang  areas.\r\n\r\nSimbang  is  a  catchment area, and  most  of  the\r\n\r\nappeals    that   were   turned   down   concerned\r\n\r\nunauthorised  structures, mainly pigsties,  within\r\n\r\nthe  immediate  vicinity of the  catchment  areas,\r\n\r\nthus  adding to pollution problems. At Chia  Keng,\r\n\r\nmost  of the appeals encountered concerned illegal\r\n\r\nmotor  workshops or illegal and unsightly  dumping\r\n\r\nof  junk  on  State land. Enforcement  action,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, had to be vigorously pursued in this area,\r\n\r\nwhich  would  otherwise have become a  centre  for\r\n\r\nillegal   workshops  and  factories.   Enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers have the unpleasant task of ensuring that\r\n\r\npolicy objectives are successfully implemented and\r\n\r\nnot  frustrated  by violations  of  conditions  of\r\n\r\ntemporary   occupation  licences.   Only   limited\r\n\r\ndiscretionary   power   is   allowed   to   Senior\r\n\r\nEnforcement   Officers   in   regard   to    minor\r\n\r\ninfringement for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod of time that could be granted to carry  out\r\n\r\ndemolition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Keat wants to know details of\r\n\r\nthe  work  done  by the Bases Economic  Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment. The planning work involves both short-term  and  long-term planning. Short-term planning\r\n\r\nhas,  as  the  main objective, the  evaluation  of\r\n\r\nclaims  and  the  allocation of facilities  handed\r\n\r\nback to the Singapore Government to ensure optimum\r\n\r\nutilisation of land and buildings. In the case  of\r\n\r\nvacant land or land used for farming purposes, the\r\n\r\nimmediate  objective was to prevent  encroachment.\r\n\r\nWherever  possible, such facilities were converted\r\n\r\nto  commercial or industrial uses. Thus, the Naval\r\n\r\nDockyard which was transferred to the ownership of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government on 1st December,  1968,\r\n\r\nwas converted to commercial use, and the Sembawang\r\n\r\nShipyard  (Pte.)  Ltd, has now  developed  into  a\r\n\r\nmajor  thriving  ship-repair yard. Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nweapons  and radio repair facilities of the  Naval\r\n\r\nDockyard  were  converted  into  an  international\r\n\r\nservice  centre, and the Singapore Electronic  and\r\n\r\nEngineering  (Pte.)  Ltd.,  wholly-owned  by   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government, was formed to  operate  the\r\n\r\nfacility. The Loyang Boom Defence Depot  with  its\r\n\r\npier,   slipway,  warehouse  and   machine   shop,\r\n\r\nequipment  and  buildings, provided the  necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities  for the establishment of  an  offshore\r\n\r\nsupport base for oil drilling operations in South-east Asia. Various facilities at the air-bases  at\r\n\r\nSeletar   and   Changi  have  been   utilised   in\r\n\r\nconnection  with the development of the  aerospace\r\n\r\nindustry.  And, as the Member will  know,  Sentosa\r\n\r\nitself   is   being  developed  by   the   Sentosa\r\n\r\nDevelopment Corporation into a tourist resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term planning proceeded simultaneously.\r\n\r\nPlans for the redevelopment of the entire areas to\r\n\r\nfit in with the overall Master Plan for the island\r\n\r\nwere  prepared  by  the  Planning  Department   in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the Bases Economic  Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment.  These  long-term  plans   are   being\r\n\r\ncontinually  reviewed, revised and implemented  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the overall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimetable for the redevelopment of the areas. Thus\r\n\r\nformer Defence lands which fall within the general\r\n\r\nareas of Telok Blangah, Woodlands, Ang Mo Kio  and\r\n\r\nChangi   Village,   are  being   integrated   with\r\n\r\nadjoining  State land, or private land  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen     acquired    to    enable    comprehensive\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Changi and Telok Blangah redevelopment\r\n\r\nschemes  are  underway,  and  proposals  for   the\r\n\r\nnecessary   land  acquisition  to  implement   the\r\n\r\nWoodlands and Ang Mo Kio New Town development  are\r\n\r\nbeing  undertaken. The Senoko area  of  the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase  has  been  levelled off by the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  for  redevelopment as  an  industrial\r\n\r\narea.  Seventeen acres of land at the  Naval  Base\r\n\r\nare  being  developed by the JTC to provide  about\r\n\r\n660  units  of housing. Perhaps I have  given  the\r\n\r\nMember sufficient information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just\r\n\r\nlike to clarify that my complaint of inflexibility\r\n\r\nis  more  on the question of extension of time.

Before an estate is declared open for\r\n\r\nbooking,  relatives and associates  of  developers\r\n\r\nbook  the  houses in advance. So when  the  actual\r\n\r\nadvertisement comes out in the papers the property\r\n\r\nis  already three-quarters booked. What little  is\r\n\r\nleft  open to the public is grabbed by speculators\r\n\r\nwithin  the first hour or two. The genuine  house-buyer  who shows interest in any property is  told\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  to wait for someone to  cancel  his\r\n\r\nbooking.  This  is where the speculators  make  an\r\n\r\ninstant  profit. What measures does  the  Minister\r\n\r\nintend  to  take  to stop this  racket?  Too  many\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public have been made suckers  by\r\n\r\nthese  unscrupulous capitalists.

It is very dangerous for the subtenants  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  those  buildings. The  Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the PWD must go and check  on  those\r\n\r\nbuildings to find out whether they will stand  for\r\n\r\nlong or not. If they agree that the buildings will\r\n\r\nnot last long, they should ask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  owner to repair them. Otherwise, they  should\r\n\r\ndemolish the buildings, take the land and  put  up\r\n\r\nnew  buildings. Many tenants have been complaining\r\n\r\nof  leaks here and there, they have no other house\r\n\r\nto  go to, and the owners do not want to carry out\r\n\r\nrepairs. The Minister must look into the matter to\r\n\r\nsee  if  something could be done about  these  old\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, private housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers are at liberty to sell their houses  to\r\n\r\nwhom  they  like,  whether relatives,  friends  or\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public. They are not even  obliged\r\n\r\nto  advertise their housing development; they  can\r\n\r\nsell  their  houses by private negotiations.  Some\r\n\r\npeople merely register their intention to buy many\r\n\r\nhouses,  of course hoping that prices will  go  up\r\n\r\nand  then  resell. Is it advisable that we  should\r\n\r\nstop  this  practice?  Intending  purchasers   are\r\n\r\nsubject to the market forces of supply and  demand\r\n\r\nas in any other commodities, and control of prices\r\n\r\nof houses cannot be a good measure. What we can do\r\n\r\nis   to   encourage  the  construction   of   more\r\n\r\nresidential  units by giving incentives,  such  as\r\n\r\nhigher   densities   and  exemption   of   certain\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charges. The Member's  suggestion  to\r\n\r\nhave  legislation enacted to deal with this matter\r\n\r\nis   certainly   not   going  to   encourage   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of housing units. In fact,  it  would\r\n\r\nbe  unwise  for Government to interfere  with  the\r\n\r\nfree   enterprise  system.  If  such  control   is\r\n\r\nattempted,  houses are likely to be  sold  in  the\r\n\r\nblack  market,  making it even more difficult  for\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public to buy houses in  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket.  It  is  also likely that private  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopers  will build less residential  units  if\r\n\r\nthey are subject to such control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards old houses, I take it that the Member\r\n\r\nis  referring  to  houses  which  are  under  rent\r\n\r\ncontrol.

For example,\r\n\r\nbefore approving the plan, the Planning Department\r\n\r\ncan  find out how much the building will cost  and\r\n\r\nhow  much the developers are going to sell it. The\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department can investigate on all  these\r\n\r\nmatters and put a ceiling on the selling price  in\r\n\r\nrelation to cost. The Planning Department has  the\r\n\r\npower  to  approve any project.  If  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment  turns  down  a  project,  a  developer\r\n\r\ncannot  put up any building. Therefore, developers\r\n\r\nmust  keep  proper records of a building  project,\r\n\r\nhow  much  it costs and so on, and only then  will\r\n\r\nthe  Planning Department consider it for approval.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know whether the Minister will consider\r\n\r\nmy suggestion and take action on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the same\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  and  I have said that  it  interferes\r\n\r\nwith  the  business of the private developers.  If\r\n\r\nplanning  approval is going to be made subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of the buildings, are we to go  further\r\n\r\nand say that a developer should sell his buildings\r\n\r\nat  a certain price, and allow him to make only  5\r\n\r\nor  10  per  cent profit? We might  not  have  any\r\n\r\nprivate  developers  around.  But  if  it   is   a\r\n\r\nsituation  where we want to control the amount  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment, then we could go into the question of\r\n\r\ncosts. In fact, a Statistical Unit is being set up\r\n\r\nby  my Ministry, with the help of the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  to  computerise not  only  the  various\r\n\r\ncomponents  of our building capacity but  also  to\r\n\r\ngive   details   at  any  time  of  the   building\r\n\r\nconstruction   industry.

No notices  of\r\n\r\neviction   were   also  given  to  the   residents\r\n\r\naffected.  As  in  the case of  urban  renewal  in\r\n\r\nKampung  Ubi  last year, the Member of  Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  that constituency was not consulted. This has\r\n\r\ncaused  confusion, and has created the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  the work has no system at all. What is  most\r\n\r\nregrettable is that the residents affected by  the\r\n\r\nresettlement   are  holders  of   Singapore   blue\r\n\r\nidentity  cards and they have been  staying  there\r\n\r\nfor   many  years.  They  own  these  houses  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they  have  not been  offered  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats.  Some  of these blue  identity  card\r\n\r\nholders were born in Singapore. Because they  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  birth certificates and they cannot remember\r\n\r\nthe  dates  of their birth, they were  given  blue\r\n\r\nidentity cards by the Government. These people  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  alternative accommodation in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  the  notice of resettlement compels  them  to\r\n\r\nleave  but the Government does not offer them  any\r\n\r\nalternative   accommodation.   This   has   caused\r\n\r\nconfusion among the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask this question. If these\r\n\r\npeople  are  not  given the right  to  alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation  in  Singapore, what  about  letting\r\n\r\nthem   live  on  rafts  in  Singapore  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters?  Will they be given permission to live  in\r\n\r\nrafts in Singapore waters?

It  will  be very  surprising  if  it\r\n\r\nhappens.  On humanitarian grounds, the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  not  shirk its responsibility towards  the\r\n\r\npermanent residents holding blue identity cards if\r\n\r\ntheir   houses   are  affected  by  re-development\r\n\r\nprojects.

One advantage is that a citizen\r\n\r\nis  entitled to low-cost accommodation.  There  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  long list of applicants, more than 80,000\r\n\r\nwanting to purchase flats and about 25,000 wanting\r\n\r\nto rent. Last year we built about 23,000 units. So\r\n\r\nobviously  our capacity to build is  not  adequate\r\n\r\nenough  to  meet all demands. It is for this  good\r\n\r\nreason that we are unable to provide accommodation\r\n\r\nfor  those who are not our citizens. Citizens come\r\n\r\nfirst. However, to relieve the hardship of certain\r\n\r\ndeserving cases, the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nhas allocated BECD or British reverted quarters at\r\n\r\neconomic  rentals  to  permanent  residents.  More\r\n\r\nrecently,  Housing  Board flat  owners  have  been\r\n\r\npermitted  to sublet one or two rooms to permanent\r\n\r\nresidents who are eligible as sub-tenants, so that\r\n\r\nthose  with  blue identity cards are  not  exactly\r\n\r\nhomeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complains that not one of the MPs\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang Serai, Kampung Kembangan and  Kampung\r\n\r\nUbi  has  been consulted on resettlement.  In  the\r\n\r\npast  I have on many occasions seen all three  MPs\r\n\r\nto  try and help iron out some of the problems  in\r\n\r\nthe  Perseverance Estate. The MP himself  is  well\r\n\r\naware,  having been in this House, of Government's\r\n\r\nacquisition of large tracts of land in the estate.\r\n\r\nThe  first phase of development at the Jalan Eunos\r\n\r\nestate bounded by Paya Lebar Way, Jalan Eunos, the\r\n\r\nextension  of  Sims Avenue and  Paya  Lebar  Road,\r\n\r\nfalls  partly  within the Kampung Ubi Constituency\r\n\r\nand    partly   within   the   Kampung   Kembangan\r\n\r\nConstituency.   Resettlement   of   the   affected\r\n\r\nresidents  is  now in progress. Construction  will\r\n\r\ncommence in about three months' time after all the\r\n\r\naffected  buildings  have been  cleared  from  the\r\n\r\nsite.  The Housing and Development Board  proposes\r\n\r\nto  build  the  following flats within  the  first\r\n\r\nphase  of  development: about 700 two-room  flats;\r\n\r\n1,350  three-room flats; 550 four-room  flats  and\r\n\r\n380 five-room flats, at a total estimated cost  of\r\n\r\n$50.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I did not\r\n\r\nmean to ask about those who applied for HDB flats.\r\n\r\nI was referring to those people with blue identity\r\n\r\ncards   whose   houses   are   affected   by   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment project.

However, in recent months  it  is  the\r\n\r\nconsensus  of  the  travelling  public  that   the\r\n\r\ncondition   of   road  surfaces  seems   to   have\r\n\r\ndeteriorated  rather  badly.  It  could  well   be\r\n\r\nanother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindirect  measure  to  discourage  car  ownership!\r\n\r\nExcept  for  the  so-called VIP roads,  pot-holes,\r\n\r\nuneven  surface, protruding manhole  culverts  and\r\n\r\npoor  patchy repairs are to be seen all  over  the\r\n\r\nisland.  I am not so worried about the comfort  of\r\n\r\npeople  travelling in cars but rather the question\r\n\r\nof road safety. I think poor roads are quite often\r\n\r\nthe  cause of road accidents. Repair work  appears\r\n\r\nto  progress too slowly. For example, one  section\r\n\r\nof  Yio Chu Kang Road collapsed months ago, and in\r\n\r\nthe  process  it  \"swallowed\" a car.  Fortunately,\r\n\r\nnobody was hurt. Up till today, I am sorry to say,\r\n\r\nnothing has been done. The road has still not been\r\n\r\nrepaired  and  the  traffic has  to  be  re-routed\r\n\r\nthrough   Seletar  Hills  estate,  and   all   the\r\n\r\nresidents  there are suffering the air  and  noise\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps I should join in the chorus,\r\n\r\nSir.  The  poor  condition  of  road  surfaces  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  due  to  the  following  factors.   The\r\n\r\nfrequent  opening up of roads for  the  laying  of\r\n\r\nservices   by  the  various  service  departments,\r\n\r\nwater,  gas, electricity, the Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard  and  others, thus undermining the stability\r\n\r\nof  the roads; spillage of fuel oil from vehicles,\r\n\r\nespecially    public    buses,    thus     causing\r\n\r\ndeterioration of the road surfaces; a high density\r\n\r\nof  traffic nowadays subjecting the roads to  very\r\n\r\nsevere  stresses and abrasive actions. For heavily\r\n\r\nused  roads  with  high  density  traffic,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to resurface the roads with a  new  coat\r\n\r\nof  bituminous premix once in every five years  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a good riding surface. The PWD itself has\r\n\r\na  yearly programme for the resurfacing of  roads.\r\n\r\nHowever, owing to the limited funds allocated, the\r\n\r\namount of resurfacing work that can be done cannot\r\n\r\ncover   all   the  roads  that  normally   require\r\n\r\nresurfacing. Consequently, only the very bad roads\r\n\r\nare given priority in the programme. But there are\r\n\r\ncertain  roads  under this priority  scheme  which\r\n\r\neven  the PWD cannot resurface, because a  service\r\n\r\ndepartment  may have notified the PWD that  it  is\r\n\r\nabout  to  dig up that road in a few  months,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore it would be a waste of time and costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask all Members of Parliament to help in\r\n\r\nthis  way?

They live in different  parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and all I ask of them is their help.

Gotong royong more recently has improved.\r\n\r\nI  remember  gotong  royong  in  one  constituency\r\n\r\nwhere,  after  the first week-end, everybody  went\r\n\r\nhome  and  the  Public  Works  Department  had  to\r\n\r\ncomplete the work and it cost more. Since then,  I\r\n\r\nam glad to say, matters have improved, and we have\r\n\r\nhad  several  gotong royongs. But  it  means  that\r\n\r\nMembers  must work.

In other words, can  the\r\n\r\ncontractor give a guarantee of the quality of  his\r\n\r\nwork  for at least six months, or a year,  failing\r\n\r\nwhich the contractor has to make good the defects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it really depends on who the\r\n\r\ncontractor  is. Sometimes the work is  done  by  a\r\n\r\nunit  within the Department itself. The  PWD  goes\r\n\r\naround repairing roads too. But when new roads are\r\n\r\nbeing   built,  sometimes  by  a  contractor   and\r\n\r\nsometimes  by  a  housing developer,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nguarantee that the road will last for at  least  a\r\n\r\nyear, not six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the case in Sixth Avenue. One-third of\r\n\r\nthe  road  was  built  by  the  private  developer\r\n\r\nthrough a contractor, and the other two-thirds  by\r\n\r\nthe  PWD.  The  one-third  built  by  the  private\r\n\r\ndeveloper  was  always collapsing. It  is  strange\r\n\r\nbecause  one-third of the road was always full  of\r\n\r\nholes and the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  were  all right.  So  I  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nreason, and the reply was that the PWD built  two-thirds   and   the  private  developer  one-third.\r\n\r\nFinally  we  completed that road and  charged  the\r\n\r\nprivate developer $54,000.

We have a lot of  people\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  this  voluntary  gotong  royong\r\n\r\nproject. These gotong royong roads are of  a  much\r\n\r\nhigher  standard than those undertaken by  private\r\n\r\ncontractors. They last longer. I believe that  our\r\n\r\nrural  MPs  also took part in this  gotong  royong\r\n\r\nproject.  As this project was carried  out  during\r\n\r\nthe  school days, students from the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Nanyang University and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  also took part in this gotong  royong\r\n\r\nproject,   although  they  do  not  live   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency.

The position now is that once\r\n\r\na road has been dug and resurfaced, no one can dig\r\n\r\nthat  road  again  without the permission  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  the  Public  Works  Department.  But\r\n\r\nsometimes this happens and they ask. \"What happens\r\n\r\nif  a  water-main  bursts, or  an  electric  cable\r\n\r\nbursts?\"  I say, \"Get permission.\" Unless  we  are\r\n\r\nstrict  with  them,  everybody  thinks  the   road\r\n\r\nbelongs  to them and they dig it as and when  they\r\n\r\nplease.  But there is this Roads Action  Committee\r\n\r\nand  it  has done some good work, though we  still\r\n\r\nhave some trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another nuisance, of course, is that when a road\r\n\r\nis dug and levelled again, there must obviously be\r\n\r\na  hump.  Otherwise it collapses and  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrench, and this takes time to level up. Sometimes\r\n\r\nthe fill put in by the contractors is no good.  So\r\n\r\ninstead  of a slight depression, there  is  a  big\r\n\r\nhole.  But  it  is  the duty of the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment to only resurface the road after it has\r\n\r\nbeen  levelled, with a hump if you  like,  by  the\r\n\r\ncontractor doing the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  thank the Minister for his reply.

Now, sad to say,  we  have\r\n\r\nacquired a reputation that is the reverse of  what\r\n\r\nwas said at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of some of the roads is deplorable and\r\n\r\ndisgraceful  to the tourist. Take,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nVictoria Street and North Bridge Road. These roads\r\n\r\nwere  dug up by a contractor sometime ago for some\r\n\r\npurpose,  god  knows what! With  so  much  digging\r\n\r\ngoing  on, sometimes one wonders whether they  are\r\n\r\ndigging for oil! Anyway the condition of the roads\r\n\r\nat  present is best seen to be believed. The  pot-holes  have  never been repaired.  The  patch-work\r\n\r\ntype of repairs carried out is so badly done, that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not last even a few days. Is  there  any\r\n\r\nsupervision of a road contractor's job? Is there a\r\n\r\ntime  limit given to the contractor before payment\r\n\r\nis  made? Are there any penalties imposed for poor\r\n\r\nworkmanship?  These  are  two  examples   of   the\r\n\r\ncondition  of main roads, and there are  countless\r\n\r\nothers.  If  one drives along Upper Thomson  Road,\r\n\r\none will be bumping and bumping all along and will\r\n\r\nsoon  be  tired out. Upper Thomson Road  has  been\r\n\r\ncommonly called the shock absorber test road.  All\r\n\r\nwe  see nowadays is `tax up quality down'. This is\r\n\r\nParkinson's  law in reverse. The  more  taxes  are\r\n\r\nimposed  on cars, the worse will be the roads  for\r\n\r\nthe motorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Orchard Road, opposite Lido Cinema, a\r\n\r\nbeautiful pedestrian walk was constructed sometime\r\n\r\nback   purposely   for   the  Commonwealth   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Conference. The same walk has now  been\r\n\r\ndemolished  and  made into another  type  of  walk\r\n\r\ncalled  a pedestrian mall. With the high  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaterials and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkmanship, with inflation setting  in,  is  this\r\n\r\nmall really necessary? Are we going into grandiose\r\n\r\nschemes  at  great  cost,  just  to  serve  a  few\r\n\r\npedestrians,  who  are quite  comfortable  walking\r\n\r\nalong  the present pedestrian ways? Could not  the\r\n\r\nmoney be used for more useful projects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to acquire land at great cost for road\r\n\r\nwidening  schemes.  We cut into  the  frontage  of\r\n\r\nshops and houses, and what happens after that?  Of\r\n\r\nlate,  about  a  quarter o a road  lane  is  taken\r\n\r\neither  for  pedestrian use or  tree  planting.  I\r\n\r\nmyself do not understand what it is all about. Now\r\n\r\nin  Stamford Road small flat stone walls have been\r\n\r\nput,  and  they are always being knocked  down  by\r\n\r\ncars.  I do not know for what purpose these  small\r\n\r\nflat stone walls have been put along the road.  In\r\n\r\nRobinson   Road   trees  have  been   planted   on\r\n\r\npedestrian walks. They are not only an obstruction\r\n\r\nbut  can  also damage roads and buildings, besides\r\n\r\nlittering the road with dead leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus lanes have been introduced to ease traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  in  the  central areas  of  the  City.\r\n\r\nRather  than  help, they cause traffic congestion,\r\n\r\nstretching  for miles at a time. A  better  system\r\n\r\nis, therefore, called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain housing estates, after the Government\r\n\r\nhas  taken over the frontage and the surfacing has\r\n\r\nbeen  done,  the  owners of the houses  have  been\r\n\r\nasked to pay $1,000 each. As the work carried  out\r\n\r\nwas  simple and did not involve much material  and\r\n\r\nmanpower,  cannot the Government  lower  the  fees\r\n\r\nchargeable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At certain junctions, traffic lights are not\r\n\r\nfunctioning  well. Can the Government do  anything\r\n\r\nabout  the  lights damaged in accidents which  are\r\n\r\nnot repaired for weeks at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again some roundabouts have been removed to be\r\n\r\nreplaced  by  traffic lights. Can  the  department\r\n\r\ngive reasons for this kind of spending?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to roads, if the Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard wants to lay the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncables  or do some other work, they will  dig  and\r\n\r\nput in the cables. After they have levelled up the\r\n\r\nroad,  the Electricity Department will come in  to\r\n\r\ndig  it  up  again to lay their own cables.  After\r\n\r\nthey  have levelled up the road, then the Sewerage\r\n\r\nDepartment will come iii to dig it up again.  What\r\n\r\nis  all  this?  Why incur unnecessary expenditure?\r\n\r\nThis is a very bad way of expending money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will come\r\n\r\nback  to  the  topic of road signs. Earlier  on  I\r\n\r\nemphasised  that there was a need for  improvement\r\n\r\nin  the erection and placing of road signs at  the\r\n\r\nproper   places   in   order  to   effect   better\r\n\r\nobservation of the road signs and so give the road\r\n\r\nusers  adequate notice. I have said that  the  \"No\r\n\r\nEntry\"   signs  are  sometimes  placed  in  rather\r\n\r\ninconspicuous   corners,   and   frequently   dual\r\n\r\ncarriageways have been turned into a dangerous two\r\n\r\nseparate-lane traffic where you have  cars  coming\r\n\r\nstraight  on when they should really be  going  in\r\n\r\nthe  other  direction. This is  particularly  true\r\n\r\nwith  the road junction at Havelock Road  and  Kim\r\n\r\nSeng  Road  where  a  number of serious  accidents\r\n\r\noccurred recently and to which ample publicity had\r\n\r\nbeen given in the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I think deserves attention\r\n\r\nis the safety of road workers and road users. Road\r\n\r\nrepairs can be seen going on all the time, and yet\r\n\r\ninsufficient  warning is given to road  users  and\r\n\r\nthat   road  workers  themselves  are  not   given\r\n\r\nadequate   protection.   Here   I   would   stress\r\n\r\nparticular importance on the insistence  that  all\r\n\r\nroad  workers must wear luminous jackets. This  is\r\n\r\nmade  compulsory for road workers in many advanced\r\n\r\ncountries.  In  Singapore, particularly  for  road\r\n\r\nworkers at night, I think it would be advisable to\r\n\r\nimpose  this regulation. It is very dangerous  for\r\n\r\nroad workers to work at night. They pave roads  in\r\n\r\nthe face of constant danger from road traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier on I had\r\n\r\ngiven answers to most of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the Member for Anson. Perhaps  I\r\n\r\nshould  confine my reply to some of  the  specific\r\n\r\npoints  which he raised but not dealt with  by  me\r\n\r\nearlier.  As  I  have said earlier  on,  the  poor\r\n\r\ncondition of some of our roads is generally due to\r\n\r\nthe  digging up of these roads for the  laying  of\r\n\r\nthe    various   services   to   cater   for   our\r\n\r\nrequirements. This results in uneven road surfaces\r\n\r\nwhich  can be properly resurfaced only after  time\r\n\r\nis allowed for the soil to settle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resurfacing of North Bridge Road has now been\r\n\r\ncompleted, and work on Victoria Street, which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson referred to, is now in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of Thomson Road is being widened and improved\r\n\r\nto  serve a dual carriageway. Other parts  of  the\r\n\r\nroad  have been dug up for the laying of  services\r\n\r\nto  serve  the new housing estates in  that  area.\r\n\r\nOnce housing estates are built, the residents need\r\n\r\nservices and the roads have to be dug up.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe inconvenience to motorists using Upper Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad is, in fact, unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also referred to the\r\n\r\npedestrian  mall. Just before the meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   Prime  Ministers'   Conference   in\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1971,  work  was undertaken  to  improve\r\n\r\nOrchard   Road   and  to  provide  footpaths   for\r\n\r\npedestrians,  as  this is an  important  and  busy\r\n\r\nroad.  At  that  time  there  were  no  plans   to\r\n\r\nconstruct what the Member has referred to  as  the\r\n\r\npedestrian mall. However, this concept of the mall\r\n\r\nwas  initiated  in late 1971. It serves  the  dual\r\n\r\npurpose  of  keeping the canal along Orchard  Road\r\n\r\nand Stamford Road clean and pollution free as well\r\n\r\nas  providing  ample  space  over  the  canal  for\r\n\r\npedestrians to walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planting of trees and shrubs alongside walks\r\n\r\nprovides shade and greenery and follows the policy\r\n\r\nof  making  Singapore a garden city. But sometimes\r\n\r\nthings  go  wrong.  The  Member  has  referred  to\r\n\r\nRobinson  Road. Now there is a new bus lane  along\r\n\r\nRobinson  Road  and we should  have  a  place  for\r\n\r\npassengers or bus commuters to wait for  the  bus,\r\n\r\notherwise  they will all converge on to the  road.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have a little sidewalk between  the  shop-house in front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   the   bus  lane.  This  sidewalk  does   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  have the same width  all  along  that\r\n\r\nroad. It depends on the width of the road and what\r\n\r\nis in front or adjacent to it. In order to provide\r\n\r\nsome shade along this road for people waiting  for\r\n\r\nbuses, pong pong trees were planted as they do not\r\n\r\ngrow  to great heights. Of course, with the  high-rise  buildings coming up, it is only  during  the\r\n\r\nfew hours around noon that the sun shines down. If\r\n\r\nthe Member is right that the trees prove to be  an\r\n\r\nobstruction, they will be removed. But  the  trees\r\n\r\nhave already been planted, and I think it would be\r\n\r\na  waste  of time and money to pull them  out  and\r\n\r\nreplant them somewhere else. I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nwe leave them alone and see what the future holds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complains about the $1,000 cost\r\n\r\nwhich  each  of his constituents had  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nroads  along  their houses. This is  the  practice\r\n\r\nwhen we build a road. The frontagers pay according\r\n\r\nto  the length of the road along their boundaries.\r\n\r\nRecently, of course, prices have gone up  and  the\r\n\r\ncost of materials and labour has increased. May  I\r\n\r\npoint  out  that frontagers may pay in instalments\r\n\r\nif  there  are  difficulties in  paying  the  full\r\n\r\namount outright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member also complained about\r\n\r\nroundabouts.  Roundabouts can only handle  traffic\r\n\r\nup  to  a  certain limit. If the  traffic  is  too\r\n\r\nheavy,  congestion  must  occur.  Some  of   these\r\n\r\nroundabouts have been replaced by light-controlled\r\n\r\nintersections  with  sufficient  approach   lanes,\r\n\r\nwhich  not  only  permit a much larger  volume  of\r\n\r\ntraffic to flow but can be regulated to allow  for\r\n\r\npedestrian crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng complained about our\r\n\r\ntraffic  signs,  \"No Entry\" signs  in  particular,\r\n\r\nfound  in the wrong place or facing the wrong  way\r\n\r\nand this causes accidents and confusion. There are\r\n\r\nso  many signs all over Singapore. Sometimes  they\r\n\r\nare  put  facing  the right direction  but  turned\r\n\r\naround by some rascals. I am not saying that  this\r\n\r\nis always the case, but this has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would  suggest to the Member that  whenever  he\r\n\r\nsees  a  sign which is not satisfactory, he brings\r\n\r\nit  to the attention of my Ministry. I myself have\r\n\r\nhad  occasion  to  redirect  certain  signs  along\r\n\r\nHavelock Road which were not facing exactly in the\r\n\r\nright  direction. When there are  more  than  four\r\n\r\nlanes or four roads, Sometimes you might even have\r\n\r\nsix  or  seven  lanes, meeting  at  one  junction,\r\n\r\nputting  up  signs  or lights  can  be  difficult.\r\n\r\nComing from one direction one might be looking  at\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  light and think one has the  right  of\r\n\r\nway,   seeing  green  instead  of  red.  This   is\r\n\r\ndangerous. But wherever this occurs we do our best\r\n\r\nto redirect the traffic lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the night work which the Member\r\n\r\nreferred  to,  I  agree with him  that  when  road\r\n\r\nworkers  work at night they should put on luminous\r\n\r\nuniforms.  Most of them do, but not  all.  As  for\r\n\r\nwarning signs, every department that digs  a  road\r\n\r\nhas  to  have warning signs telling people who  is\r\n\r\ndigging it, whether it is the PUB, PWD, etc. But I\r\n\r\nagree  with him that sometimes these warning signs\r\n\r\nare  placed  too  near  the  site  where  work  is\r\n\r\nprogressing; so that if a motorist comes along  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have sufficient warning  that  work  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on.  I  agree  that sometimes  these  signs\r\n\r\nshould  be put up, say, 100 or 200 yards away  for\r\n\r\nthe  motorist  to  see  before  he  comes  to  the\r\n\r\nparticular obstruction, along the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis  reply.

I  believe\r\n\r\nthere  are  too many signs inappropriately  placed\r\n\r\nand   that   his  Ministry  should   hold   itself\r\n\r\nresponsible for making sure that these  signs  are\r\n\r\nplaced correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second point, I was asking\r\n\r\nwhether his Ministry would make it compulsory  for\r\n\r\nall  road  workers  to  wear luminous  jackets  at\r\n\r\nnight.

It is a question of asking  the\r\n\r\nMember  for his assistance and to point out  where\r\n\r\nthese  wrongly  placed  signs  are,  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncorrect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, trees\r\n\r\nhave   been  planted  along  certain  roads.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, in Robinson Road there is a reserved bus\r\n\r\nlane  specially  for the buses.  And  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsidewalk  which  is  about  five  feet  wide  with\r\n\r\ncircular  holes.  At first, I  thought  they  were\r\n\r\nconstructing a pedestrian walk for the  safety  of\r\n\r\npedestrians which should be very good. But soon  I\r\n\r\nfound  that  trees were planted in  the  plots  of\r\n\r\nearth  that  were  encircled for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nbeautifying  the place. Even at Bras  Basah  Road,\r\n\r\ntrees  have  been  planted along the  roadside.  I\r\n\r\nwould   like   to  ask  the  Minister   how   many\r\n\r\npedestrians can appreciate these trees, when  they\r\n\r\nare  so  busy  trying to leave their  offices  for\r\n\r\nhomes.  Nobody has the pleasure or time  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe scenery or the beauty of the trees. So I would\r\n\r\nlike   the   Minister  to  investigate  into   the\r\n\r\nusefulness  of the trees planted by  the  roadside\r\n\r\nbecause this would endanger the safety of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npedestrians.  There  is  no  more  space  for  the\r\n\r\npedestrians  to walk as the trees  have  taken  up\r\n\r\nmuch  space and buses are running along the  road.\r\n\r\nWe should have proper places to plant trees.

With  regard  to  my\r\n\r\nsecond  point, I think the Minister has not  given\r\n\r\nme  an  answer  as  to whether he  would  make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for all road workers to wear  luminous\r\n\r\njackets at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am sorry. We will certainly\r\n\r\nconsider  it  and  make it  compulsory  if  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable. At the moment, it really depends on the\r\n\r\ntype of work and on which part of the road work is\r\n\r\nbeing  done.  For instance, when white  or  yellow\r\n\r\nlines in the middle or along the side of the  road\r\n\r\nare  painted in the middle of the night, obviously\r\n\r\nthese  workers need luminous clothes, and this  is\r\n\r\nthe  position at present. But if the workers  pack\r\n\r\nup,  say,  at  about  6 p.m.,  they  do  not  need\r\n\r\nluminous  clothes. On the other hand, there  might\r\n\r\nbe  urgent work such as the breakdown of a pipe in\r\n\r\nthe middle of the road which has to be repaired at\r\n\r\nnight;  then  I would agree with the  Member  that\r\n\r\nproper  clothes should be worn so that the workers\r\n\r\ncan be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not seen any signs in Tanglin pointing in\r\n\r\nthe wrong direction, and not even in Kim Seng.

Although   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has speeded up the work of housing,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of the increase in our population,  there\r\n\r\nare  more  and more applicants wanting to purchase\r\n\r\nor  to rent flats, with the result that demand has\r\n\r\noutstripped  supply in housing. We all  know  that\r\n\r\nRome  was not built in a day, and it is much  less\r\n\r\nto  mention the rebuilding of the central district\r\n\r\nand  the  task of improving the living environment\r\n\r\nof the people. This task is more arduous and of  a\r\n\r\ngreater  magnitude  because we  are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  enough  flats or houses  for  the  people\r\n\r\neither for purchase or for rent. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable   that   certain   sections   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation have to live in the rural areas in  old\r\n\r\ndilapidated attap houses made of plank  and  zinc.\r\n\r\nIt does not mean that they do not realise the fact\r\n\r\nthat dwellings in the rural areas are not hygienic\r\n\r\nand can easily catch fire. But in order to have  a\r\n\r\nroof over their heads, they are forced to live  in\r\n\r\nsuch  attap or wooden houses in order to scrape  a\r\n\r\nmeagre  living. These attap or wooden  houses  are\r\n\r\nold  and dilapidated. They are unauthorised houses\r\n\r\nbuilt long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to say that these attap houses\r\n\r\nshould be allowed to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  I  am  trying  to say is that  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Division had erred in the  implementation\r\n\r\nof  policy  in  respect  of  demolition  of  these\r\n\r\nhouses. We know that the Building Control Division\r\n\r\nhas  to carry out the work of demolition of  these\r\n\r\nhouses.  This  is understandable. What  is  to  be\r\n\r\nquestioned  is the manner and way this  demolition\r\n\r\nsquad  carried  out their duty. We are  not  happy\r\n\r\nwith the discourtesy, rudeness and the ferocity of\r\n\r\nthese enforcement officers. I would like the House\r\n\r\nto note their undesirable attitude when they carry\r\n\r\nout their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the making of laws in any country must have\r\n\r\nreference to the social custom of that country. In\r\n\r\nother  words, justice must be tempered with humane\r\n\r\nfeeling. If everyone is law-abiding, there will be\r\n\r\nuniversal  peace  and courts of law  will  not  be\r\n\r\nneeded. They could be moved into the museum. Human\r\n\r\nnature being what it is, there are people who  are\r\n\r\nprone to commit offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for offences of putting up unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures,  even  a  very strict  judge  will  be\r\n\r\nlenient  to the culprits. In other words, he  will\r\n\r\ntemper justice with humane feeling. In demolishing\r\n\r\nan  unauthorised structure, the official must  all\r\n\r\nthe   more   be   lenient.  Due   to   extenuating\r\n\r\ncircumstances  they  were  forced  to  build   the\r\n\r\nunauthorised  structures.  Maybe,  the  family  is\r\n\r\ngrowing,  and so they have to enlarge their  home.\r\n\r\nWe  should  adopt  a sympathetic attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthem.  I  fully support the principle  that  these\r\n\r\nunauthorised  structures should  be  pulled  down.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  I  have  received  a  lot  of  unusual\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from my constituents.  The  demolition\r\n\r\nsquad   officers  sent  by  the  Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision  behaved as though they  were  gangsters.\r\n\r\nThey went and demolished an unauthorised house  in\r\n\r\nmy constituency. Of course, I am not voicing their\r\n\r\ngrievances,  but  I  would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that these civil servants are wrong  in\r\n\r\nadopting a rude attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot  all the complaints are perfectly true, but  I\r\n\r\nfeel  there  must be some basis for lodging  them.\r\n\r\nSir, a person who puts up an unauthorised building\r\n\r\nknows  that he is in the wrong. He can only  plead\r\n\r\nwith  the  authority.  He  dares  not  resist  the\r\n\r\nauthority.  He  is  not guilty of  murder,  theft,\r\n\r\nrobbery, or any such crime. On the other hand,  we\r\n\r\nsee  the enforcement officers going around pulling\r\n\r\ndown  the  houses. They go in a big  group,  armed\r\n\r\nwith  parangs and axes, and frighten the residents\r\n\r\nin  the  whole village and cause resentment  among\r\n\r\nthem.  The  demolition squad sometimes go  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of assaulting the residents. Whether or not\r\n\r\nthere  is any basis for the allegation, I hope  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  investigated into by the  Minister.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we have to uphold law and order.  On  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,  we  should  see  to  it  that   the\r\n\r\nenforcement officers should also abide by the law.\r\n\r\nThey  should not resort to assaulting the  people.\r\n\r\nSir, I hope the enforcement officers despatched by\r\n\r\nthe  Building Control Division could be reeducated\r\n\r\nso  as  to  re-orientate  their  attitude  towards\r\n\r\nresidents who live in unauthorised houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, grouses have been made in\r\n\r\nthis  House time and again by Members representing\r\n\r\nthe  rural  constituencies concerning  the  rather\r\n\r\ntedious and time-consuming procedures involved  in\r\n\r\ngetting  approval  to effect  urgent  repairs  and\r\n\r\nminor  alterations  to attap  houses  and  similar\r\n\r\nstructures. I believe some attempts have been made\r\n\r\nto  simplify the procedures, but as far as I know,\r\n\r\nthe  delay in granting permission still exists.  I\r\n\r\nhave  heard of recent cases involving a change  of\r\n\r\nroofing   from  attap  to  corrugated  iron.   The\r\n\r\napplicants were asked to engage the services of an\r\n\r\narchitect. Sir, this seems to me rather ridiculous\r\n\r\nand  it also imposes unnecessary financial strains\r\n\r\non  these poor people. In any case, as most of our\r\n\r\narchitects  are  more  interested  in  big   fish,\r\n\r\nperhaps there is a real difficulty in getting  the\r\n\r\nservices of an architect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th March, 1973, the Minister stated, and\r\n\r\nI quote from Hansard, Vol. 32, col. 883:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.., the Building Control Division will shortly\r\n\r\nbe  issuing  a booklet on the do's and  don'ts  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  activity  to inform the  public  of  the\r\n\r\nprocedures  to be taken before any building  works\r\n\r\nare carried out.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the Department's definition of\r\n\r\n\"shortly\" is one or two years. I quote again  from\r\n\r\nthe same paragraph, in which the Minister stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide on-the-spot service and advice to the\r\n\r\npublic, sub-offices have been established at Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  District  Office (Rural West),  Serangoon\r\n\r\nDistrict Office (Rural Central) and at the  former\r\n\r\nMidwives' Maternity Centre (Rural East)  in  Jalan\r\n\r\nEunos.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  far  as  I  know,  this so-called  on-the-spot\r\n\r\nservice does not really give much service at  all.\r\n\r\nWhen  we go and talk to them, they do not seem  to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  give  much  guidance.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint that I have received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, perhaps I should deal with the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar first, as he  quoted  more\r\n\r\nserious allegations. All I want to reassure him is\r\n\r\nthat  we have a demolition squad whose duty is  to\r\n\r\ndemolish  houses,  not  human  beings.   The   one\r\n\r\nparticular case which the Member is harping on  is\r\n\r\nthis.  There was an incident, I think, it  was  on\r\n\r\nthe  17th  January  this year, when  a  demolition\r\n\r\nsquad  comprising some 15 labourers supervised  by\r\n\r\none  officer  went  to a house in  Lorong  Gambir.\r\n\r\nThere  was an altercation. It was alleged  by  the\r\n\r\ncomplainant  that she, her husband and  her  niece\r\n\r\nwere assaulted. These allegations have been denied\r\n\r\nby  the officer and the labourers concerned.  They\r\n\r\nadmitted there was a scuffle. I do not propose  to\r\n\r\ngo  into the facts here because, subsequent to the\r\n\r\nincident,  a  complaint was lodged at  the  police\r\n\r\nstation.  Surprisingly  enough,  the  complainants\r\n\r\nhave not gone to court. They could have taken  the\r\n\r\ncase  by  way of a private summons, but they  have\r\n\r\nchosen  not  to  do so. Instead,  the  Member  has\r\n\r\nwritten  to me asking for an inquiry, and this  is\r\n\r\nbeing done. As long as the inquiry is on, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  I  should  take  this  matter  further   in\r\n\r\nParliament  if  I  am to be fair  to  the  parties\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demolition is not a pleasant business and very\r\n\r\nfew  people like to work for the demolition  squad\r\n\r\nbecause they have been assaulted many times.  That\r\n\r\nis  the natural reaction. If the squad moves in to\r\n\r\ndemolish  somebody's home, he is there  to  defend\r\n\r\nit,  whether authorised or unauthorised. Sometimes\r\n\r\nwe  have  the police to stand by. But  people  get\r\n\r\nexcited and one is liable to go off the rails,  as\r\n\r\nit  were, if one's house is being demolished  even\r\n\r\nby the Government. It is a very unpleasant matter.\r\n\r\nStrict  instructions have gone out  to  demolition\r\n\r\nsquads to be as nice as is possible. But it is not\r\n\r\npleasant   or  enjoyable  to  demolish  somebody's\r\n\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu complains about the\r\n\r\npromises  I  have made and never kept.  There  are\r\n\r\nthese  three centres. He himself admits that,  but\r\n\r\nhe says they are no good. Well, at least they have\r\n\r\nbeen set up, and we can take it a step further  by\r\n\r\nimproving conditions in these centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for application for repairs to\r\n\r\ntemporary  houses  is  quite  simple  really.  The\r\n\r\napplicant  submits an application form  obtainable\r\n\r\nfrom  the Building Control Division, together with\r\n\r\nthree  copies of the sketch plan and three  copies\r\n\r\nof  the  site plan, which is obtainable  from  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department  at a fee  of  $2.  No  prior\r\n\r\nplanning  permission  for  the  repairs  need   be\r\n\r\nobtained. An architect's plan for a change of roof-covering is not normally required, but is required\r\n\r\nwhen the proposed change involves the roof trusses\r\n\r\nof  a  permanent building. For example, the Member\r\n\r\nreferred  to the case of the roof changing  of  an\r\n\r\nattap  house  to  corrugated  iron.  What   is   a\r\n\r\ncorrugated  roof  doing  on  an  attap   building?\r\n\r\nNaturally  a  corrugated iron roof  must  have  an\r\n\r\narchitect's  plan, in case it falls on  somebody's\r\n\r\nhead.  This is the reason. It becomes a  structure\r\n\r\nof  a permanent nature. It is not just a matter of\r\n\r\nchanging the roof, but what it comprises. Changing\r\n\r\nfrom  attap to zinc or zinc to attap is all right.\r\n\r\nBut  the moment you have corrugated iron, that  is\r\n\r\nanother matter altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> On the last point made by the\r\n\r\nMinister,  there  does seem  to  be  inconsistency\r\n\r\nbetween  the Minister and his department.

A computerised area of traffic  control\r\n\r\nis  a  control system in which a central  computer\r\n\r\nplays  a  major role in controlling  the  flow  of\r\n\r\nvehicular traffic, especially in the busy areas of\r\n\r\nthe   City.   This  system  will  reduce   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  by  the creation of a  more  efficient\r\n\r\nlinking  of signals, having regard to the  traffic\r\n\r\nsituation  at  any given time,  and  also  by  the\r\n\r\ndiversion  of  traffic  where  space  capacity  is\r\n\r\navailable  on alternative routes.

Such  schemes  will  arise\r\n\r\nfrom  recommendations of the Road Transport Action\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  the Minister for  Communications\r\n\r\nhas had occasion to refer to during the course  of\r\n\r\nthis  debate. Members may remember him  mentioning\r\n\r\nthe  construction of fringe area car parks and the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  material  and better  equipment  for\r\n\r\ntraffic control. If I may just take one item,  the\r\n\r\nfringe area car parks. This means the construction\r\n\r\nof several car parks on the outskirts of the City,\r\n\r\nwhere  owners  of cars can park their  cars,  jump\r\n\r\ninto  a bus or mini-bus and come to town, and also\r\n\r\ngo  back from work in the evening, take their cars\r\n\r\nand  go off. This means that no cars can come into\r\n\r\ntown,  except with a special licence, and that  we\r\n\r\nmust  build car parks on the outskirts,  not  just\r\n\r\nhalf a dozen but probably 15 or 16 car parks. Very\r\n\r\nfew  are  already in existence. For instance,  the\r\n\r\ncar  park at the National Stadium is ideal for the\r\n\r\npurpose.

I do not think I need bother the Member\r\n\r\nwith   further   details,  as  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications  has already said  that  before  we\r\n\r\nimplement  the  scheme,  public  suggestions   and\r\n\r\nrecommendations  will  be  invited.  We  are   not\r\n\r\nrushing into the scheme. We are being very careful\r\n\r\nabout  it because it is quite, perhaps I can  call\r\n\r\nit, a drastic measure.

This is a right move. Sir, you  may  be\r\n\r\naware  that  in the Shenton Way area  and  in  the\r\n\r\nother  parts  of the Central Business District,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  mammoth  buildings are  springing  up.\r\n\r\nDuring the lunch break thousands of office workers\r\n\r\ncan  be seen hunting for meals within their means,\r\n\r\nas   the   canteens  required  by   the   Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment  are not yet operating in  these  large\r\n\r\nhigh-rise office blocks. There are, of course,  in\r\n\r\nthese  office blocks posh restaurants which  begin\r\n\r\noperation as soon as possible. But office  workers\r\n\r\ncannot afford to patronise these restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is the Planning Department's requirements\r\n\r\nfor  canteen space for workers in high-rise office\r\n\r\nbuildings  adhered to by the developers?  If  they\r\n\r\nare, then as soon as even partial occupation takes\r\n\r\nplace,   the  canteen  facilities  must  be   made\r\n\r\navailable.    If    the   Planning    Department's\r\n\r\nrequirement  is not adhered to, why not?

The  canteens  or\r\n\r\nrestaurants in large buildings are operated  on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis.  Sometimes  the  ownership   or\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the restaurant or canteen  changes\r\n\r\nhands  several times because business  is  not  as\r\n\r\ngood as expected. It is difficult for us to compel\r\n\r\nthe  developers or owners of buildings to  operate\r\n\r\nor  continue to operate and maintain a canteen  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  enough business for  the  canteen,\r\n\r\nresulting in heavy financial losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The park in Seletar Reservoir  has\r\n\r\nexcellent facilities for children. Most parks  for\r\n\r\ninstance,   the  one  opposite  the  Istana,   the\r\n\r\nMacRitchie  Reservoir, the Peirce  Reservoir,  the\r\n\r\npark   at   Newton,  are  completely   devoid   of\r\n\r\nfacilities  for children. Where can  the  children\r\n\r\ngo?  We  must  attract  our  children  to  healthy\r\n\r\nplaces,  like  parks, by providing facilities  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  play,  rather than discourage  them,  by\r\n\r\nplanting too many bushes everywhere. Further,  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board should ensure  that\r\n\r\nevery  available  vacant  ground  in  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates be made use for the children's benefit. It\r\n\r\nis  an  ancient belief - give the children a place\r\n\r\nto  play,  and you end up with healthy and  robust\r\n\r\ncitizens.  An  idle  mind in an  idle  body  is  a\r\n\r\ndevil's   workshop.  Housing   estates   with   no\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  can only be an ideal breeding  ground\r\n\r\nfor drug addicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some parks stone benches have been provided.\r\n\r\nWhat use are these if they have no back rests  and\r\n\r\narm  rests?

Some trees are allowed to grow  wild\r\n\r\nalong  roadsides and buses travelling by the  side\r\n\r\nbrush against them. This is a source of danger  to\r\n\r\npassengers travelling in the buses. I quote Napier\r\n\r\nRoad! Holland Road as an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, some trees are so big that their\r\n\r\nbranches obstruct the street lights. This  becomes\r\n\r\na  source  of danger to pedestrians and  motorised\r\n\r\ntraffic along the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  was thinking of his grandchildren! But  let\r\n\r\nme  assure  him  that  the  Parks  and  Recreation\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the  PWD is aware  of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide amenities for children in our public parks\r\n\r\nand  other open spaces. There are plans to develop\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  at the Central Park and Kampung  Java\r\n\r\nPark,  and  other recreational activities  at  the\r\n\r\nEast  Coast Park to attract not only children  but\r\n\r\ngrandfathers  like the Member for Anson.  However,\r\n\r\nit   is   not  always  possible  to  construct   a\r\n\r\nplayground,  specially set aside for children,  in\r\n\r\nevery  park or open space as this depends  on  the\r\n\r\nsite,    space,    location,    surrounding    and\r\n\r\nenvironment.   For  instance,  the  Orchard   Park\r\n\r\nopposite  the  Istana  is too  small  an  area  to\r\n\r\ncontain  a  children's playground. The  design  of\r\n\r\nthis  park  is  primarily  aesthetic  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfunctional  for  the  benefit and  convenience  of\r\n\r\noffice  workers, shoppers and others, rather  than\r\n\r\nchildren, who wish to take a rest from their daily\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has also\r\n\r\nprovided  very extensive sporting and recreational\r\n\r\nactivities  in its housing estates.

In Queenstown  a  sports\r\n\r\ncomplex costing $5 million was built and, in fact,\r\n\r\nanother swimming pool complex costing more than $3\r\n\r\nmillion is now under construction, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  pool  which has already been  built.  In  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh more than $10 million had been spent on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a park, a swimming pool complex and\r\n\r\na  running track. Another swimming complex costing\r\n\r\nmore than $3 million is now under construction off\r\n\r\nMountbatten   Road  to  serve  the  residents   of\r\n\r\nMountbatten, Tanjong Rhu and Kallang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benches are generally provided with back rests at\r\n\r\nall  public places. In a few parks like  those  in\r\n\r\nBras  Basah  and Kampung Java, stone benches  have\r\n\r\nbeen  provided. I am told that this is a variation\r\n\r\nto  blend with the landscape design. I am inclined\r\n\r\nto  believe that stone benches were built in order\r\n\r\nthat  they could last. Wooden benches do not  last\r\n\r\nas  they  are easily broken. Anyway, benches  with\r\n\r\nback  rests  are being constructed in the  Central\r\n\r\nPark  and  Labrador Park. Many people, of  course,\r\n\r\nvisit the parks for a stroll and relaxation for  a\r\n\r\nshort duration and do not really sit there for too\r\n\r\nlong.  But  there  are others  who  sleep  on  the\r\n\r\nbenches. They are not bothered with the park. They\r\n\r\nwant  a  place to rest for several hours. This  is\r\n\r\nwhat we want to discourage. If someone sleeps on a\r\n\r\nbench  for several hours, he is depriving  someone\r\n\r\nelse of a seat. He is taking three or four places.\r\n\r\nHence,  some  benches  have  been  built  with  an\r\n\r\nobstruction or hump jutting out in the  middle  so\r\n\r\nthat if a person sleeps on it, he is going to have\r\n\r\na crooked back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member will agree that the primary\r\n\r\npurpose of planting trees on the roadside  and  in\r\n\r\nother open spaces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to ensure their proper and healthy growth.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, trees require regular pruning  and\r\n\r\ninspection, especially those which are  likely  to\r\n\r\ncause  obstruction  to traffic or  street  lights.\r\n\r\nFrom  time to time, a tree poses a hazard to  life\r\n\r\nor  property. But when we are aware of this, these\r\n\r\ntrees are pruned, removed or replaced with smaller\r\n\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the more we hear and see\r\n\r\nabout  the  wonderful things being done,  such  as\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities being provided for the new\r\n\r\ntowns,  the more those of us from the rural  areas\r\n\r\nfeel  that we are being totally neglected. We feel\r\n\r\nvery  jealous.  While those  in  urban  areas  are\r\n\r\nasking  for benches, parks or swimming  pools,  we\r\n\r\nfrom  the rural areas have to come here year after\r\n\r\nyear  begging for a little bit more money to build\r\n\r\nroads.  We  do not even have metalled  roads.  The\r\n\r\ncontrast is there I am afraid. This is one  aspect\r\n\r\nwe  should not really overlook at all because  the\r\n\r\npopulation  in  the  rural areas  is  still  quite\r\n\r\nlarge. And I cannot see why all the money is going\r\n\r\ninto  the  satellite and new towns,  when  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  we are not even getting enough to  build\r\n\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I first reply to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan Kayu? The fault cannot really be placed\r\n\r\non  anybody.  This  is  part  of  the  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  When this town first came up,  it  was\r\n\r\nthe  central  area that was developed.  Hence  the\r\n\r\nbuildings,  and the roads. And slowly  development\r\n\r\nhas  spread  from the central area.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nhousing estates which the Member referred to were,\r\n\r\nin fact, rural areas before. Toa Payoh was one big\r\n\r\nsquattered  area.  But  now  Toa  Payoh  has  been\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and  people  are  living  there   quite\r\n\r\nhappily. We do our best to provide these amenities\r\n\r\nlike  parks, benches and schools. I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas have been completely  left  out.\r\n\r\nUnder  the Urban and Rural Services, most  of  the\r\n\r\nmoney goes to the rural areas because much more is\r\n\r\nneeded  there, and not much has to he done in  the\r\n\r\nurban  areas because the urban areas have  already\r\n\r\nbeen developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  do  our  best  to  spread  around  the\r\n\r\naffluence that we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nis  struggling against l1istory. This is almost as\r\n\r\nold  as the Bible. The Bible says \"To the rich  it\r\n\r\nshall  be  given. From the poor it shall be  taken\r\n\r\naway.\" The Chinese equivalent is Tze yu chin shang\r\n\r\ntien huah nah yu shyer chung sung tang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, on the point made by the\r\n\r\nMinister concerning the development of new  towns,\r\n\r\nhe said that Toa Payoh used to be a rural area. On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  there are certain  rural  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are resettlement areas, e.g., areas in  the\r\n\r\nDeputy   Speaker's  constituency.  I   think   the\r\n\r\nresettlement areas are going to be permanent rural\r\n\r\nareas.  For such permanent rural areas, surely  we\r\n\r\nshould   do  something  such  as  providing   some\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities since they are  not  going\r\n\r\nto  be  bulldozed away within the next one or  two\r\n\r\nyears.  If  such  resettlement  areas  are  to  be\r\n\r\ndesignated   on  a  fairly  permanent   basis   as\r\n\r\nagricultural areas, then I think we ought to  give\r\n\r\nthem  a bit more recreational facilities. This  is\r\n\r\nmy point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, we are doing our best to give the\r\n\r\nrural areas as much as we can. It does not mean to\r\n\r\nsay  that  Jalan  Kayu is going  to  remain  rural\r\n\r\nforever.  To  give  him an instance,  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  is now building in Woodlands. Why not Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu? Why not Lim Chu Kang? The day will come.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, may I say that the rural areas  will\r\n\r\nnot be permanently rural.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the\r\n\r\nMinister  replied to the Member for Anson  on  the\r\n\r\nplanting  of  trees by the roadside which  entails\r\n\r\nthe employment of workers to look after the trees.\r\n\r\nSince the Government has to spend so much money on\r\n\r\nthe  workers  to look after trees  and  shrubs,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister whether  he  would\r\n\r\nconsider  using  the money to  plant  fruit  trees\r\n\r\ninstead  so  that  we  can  enjoy  the  additional\r\n\r\nbenefit of an income from the fruits. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime this income to our country will reduce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure on foreign supplies of fruits.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister would consider this suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am just wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister is aware that most  of  the\r\n\r\nopen  spaces at Toa Payoh New Town are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nbadly  water-logged  due  to  very  poor  sub-soil\r\n\r\ndrainage.  Most of these open spaces remain  soggy\r\n\r\nfor days after a rainfall. This really defeats the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  providing  open  spaces.  The  people\r\n\r\ncannot  even run about on a proper turfed area.  I\r\n\r\nwas just wondering whether the Minister would look\r\n\r\ninto  this  because I have spoken to  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  officer  many times and I have  written  in\r\n\r\ntoo.  So  far nothing has been done, and I believe\r\n\r\nthe  condition  has  remained the  same  for  many\r\n\r\nyears. I hope some action could be taken soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I deal with the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar first? The planting of fruit trees  on\r\n\r\nroads  may  eventually be implemented.  But  as  a\r\n\r\nfirst  step,  fruit  trees are  being  planted  in\r\n\r\nenclosed   open   spaces,  school  grounds,   some\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and mainly  in  MINDEF  camps,\r\n\r\nwhich means one cannot steal the fruits. The Parks\r\n\r\nand Recreation Division has also plans to set up a\r\n\r\nfruit orchard on an 8-acre site on reclaimed  land\r\n\r\nat  the  East  Coast Park where various  types  of\r\n\r\npopular local fruit trees will be grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Kim Keat, yes, I am aware of\r\n\r\nthe  water-logged condition of some parks  at  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  In fact, when I visited the Games  Village\r\n\r\nduring the SEAP Games or around that period, I was\r\n\r\nsurprised  to find that after perhaps an  hour  or\r\n\r\ntwo  of  rain some of the open spaces were flooded\r\n\r\nand  it took some time before the water could seep\r\n\r\nthrough. I have already asked the Housing Board to\r\n\r\nlook  into it, and I will chase them again on  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

The\r\n\r\npark  itself  is in an area which is  not  heavily\r\n\r\npopulated and, moreover, Farrer Park is just  near\r\n\r\nby.
