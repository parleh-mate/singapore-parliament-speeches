P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nAssembly  adjourned  yesterday,  I  was  mentioning\r\n\r\nabout  the  Government's  efforts  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nliving conditions of the people in the rural areas.\r\n\r\nI  quoted  two  very outstanding  efforts  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection,  namely, the road development  plan  and\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Development Panel. Besides these efforts\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to improve  the  lives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  Sir,  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has\r\n\r\nintroduced the Factories Bill which is designed  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the welfare of the working people  in  the factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is evidence to prove that the Government\r\n\r\nis quite earnestly endeavouring to bring prosperity\r\n\r\nto  the  people of Singapore. The hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar, Sir, referred in his speech - I  quote\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times of 23rd April:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Referring to the Labour Front Government, he said\r\n\r\nthe  party had never grown up from what it was when\r\n\r\na  group  of individuals got together to  fight  an\r\n\r\nelection  and got the surprise of their lives  when\r\n\r\nthey  became  Ministers. They never recovered  from\r\n\r\nthe shock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  think all these achievements of the Labour Front\r\n\r\ngo  on  to  prove  that the Labour Front  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment - \"the ship\" he referred to is  safe  and\r\n\r\nsound, and that it is sailing along smoothly in the\r\n\r\nbest interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the Government is endeavouring to do\r\n\r\nthat, the P.A.P. does not want to do anything about\r\n\r\nthose  achievements. They are  only  interested  to\r\n\r\nknow when the elections will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that the P.A.P. is not interested in the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of the people; it is only endeavouring  to\r\n\r\nseek  power. We know this; the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nknow it; and I am happy indeed that there are signs\r\n\r\nto indicate that the people have realised fully the\r\n\r\nimplications of the Member's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government cannot easily give way to the\r\n\r\npolitical passions of the P.A.P. It cannot give  up\r\n\r\nits  duty  to  the public. If the hon. Member  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the  ship is sinking, and if the  Member  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  anything  to make  it  safer,  I  would\r\n\r\ninvite him to join the Labour Front. Failing  that,\r\n\r\nI would request him to mind his own business in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and not try to meddle in the business of the\r\n\r\nLabour Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member also mentioned the over-optimism of his Party's achievements in the\r\n\r\nforthcoming Legislative Assembly elections. Sir, if\r\n\r\nonly  the  P.A.P. knew its weakness, it  would  not\r\n\r\nboast  so  much. I am hopeful that even the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar  will  admit  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicies  have  antagonised the people  to  a  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable   extent.   Workers,    farmers    and\r\n\r\nhawkers - everybody   in   Singapore - are   completely\r\n\r\nfrustrated.  The  P.A.P. is  gradually  losing  its\r\n\r\nfaith  in  the  coming elections. The people,  too,\r\n\r\nhave  completely lost confidence in the P.A.P.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  wise  policy of  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been responsible for  winning  over\r\n\r\nall  the Chinese middle and primary school students\r\n\r\nwho once backed the P.A.P. to its side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working population of Singapore are also\r\n\r\ndissatisfied with the P.A.P. Sir, the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  always  tried  to   foster   good\r\n\r\nrelationships   between  the  employers   and   the\r\n\r\nemployees.   It  has  been  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\npromotion  of genuine trade unionism in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOnce, the P.A.P. said the same thing. That was when\r\n\r\nthey were not in power either in the Assembly or in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council. They had been  responsible  for\r\n\r\ntelling  workers  to demand more money  and  better\r\n\r\nconditions of service. But today what do  we  find?\r\n\r\nThey  shun trade unionism and they try to make  use\r\n\r\nof the workers for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  own  interests.  Sir,  I  am  not  making  a\r\n\r\nguesswork of the whole thing; I have solid proof of\r\n\r\nthis, and I think the people of Singapore also have\r\n\r\nevidence to prove this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first act of the P.A.P. Councillors in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council against trade union interests was\r\n\r\nthis:   when   the  City  Council   Labour   Unions\r\n\r\nFederation  started  negotiations  with  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the City Council very willingly  accepted\r\n\r\nbut  when it found that the Unions were not  toeing\r\n\r\ntheir  line,  it  decided to  send  its  agents  to\r\n\r\nindividual  workers to split the  unity  which  was\r\n\r\nexisting   in   the  City  Council  Labour   Unions\r\n\r\nFederation.  As a result, P.A.P. agents  went  into\r\n\r\nindividual  houses of the labourers and asked  them\r\n\r\nto  accept the proposals put forward by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nCouncillors.  Sir, I think this is a very  bad  act\r\n\r\nand  I do not think for a moment that this kind  of\r\n\r\ntrade union policy is good for this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is evidence to show that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  tried  to  split the trade union  movement  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and to disrupt its unity. Sir, I  am  now\r\n\r\nreading  a  press release which was issued  by  the\r\n\r\nInformation Bureau of City Hall, dated 22nd  March.\r\n\r\nIt states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Chairman of the Labour Sub-Committee, Mr Ong\r\n\r\nPang Boon, is happy to announce that 70 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  redundant  workers in the City Gas  Department\r\n\r\nhave today accepted the Council's ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this was an attempt to break \"black legs\"  in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  movement, disrupting  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement in Singapore. This is undemocratic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Yellow unions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I do not think that in the history\r\n\r\nof the Labour Front Government, it has ever engaged\r\n\r\npeople  to  go  out  and  see  workers  against   a\r\n\r\nrecognised trade union. We have kept our faith with\r\n\r\nthe   working  people,  but  today  the   so-called\r\n\r\nchampions  of  labour in Singapore  are  trying  to\r\n\r\ndisrupt   the  healthy  trade  union  movement   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also allegations which I received\r\n\r\nfrom City Council employees that P.A.P. agents  are\r\n\r\npropagating communalism among the workers.  I  have\r\n\r\nheard it said and workers complain to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  that  the  Chinese members of the trade  unions\r\n\r\nhave  been told, \"These 8,000 Indian employees have\r\n\r\ngot  an independent country and they can very  well\r\n\r\ngo off, and we are going to stick firm to our terms\r\n\r\nand  if  we  win the day we will see that  we  will\r\n\r\nreplace them with Chinese and Malay labour.\"  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think,  Sir,  this is a very healthy  sign  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This happened in the Naval  Base;  this\r\n\r\nhappened in the Harbour Board; and this will happen\r\n\r\nwherever  the  P.A.P. has influence  in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, Sir, is proof to show that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  completely  failed in its policy  towards  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement in Singapore. Sir, the P.A.P. can\r\n\r\nonly  fool  some people some time but  they  cannot\r\n\r\nfool  all  the people all the time. The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, particularly the trade union people, now\r\n\r\nrealise  that all the empty promises all the  empty\r\n\r\npolicies which the P.A.P. normally urge before they\r\n\r\nget  into  power, will not be fulfilled  when  once\r\n\r\nthey  get  into power. This is a solid and concrete\r\n\r\nexample of its policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, I think the P.A.P. trade union\r\n\r\npolicy is to enslave the trade union people  on  to\r\n\r\nits  side and make them work as slaves. I  do  hope\r\n\r\nthat  those trade union people in the City Council,\r\n\r\nin  the  Harbour Board and in the Naval  Base,  who\r\n\r\nhave  suffered under the P.A.P. trade union policy,\r\n\r\nwill realise where their loyalties should lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard it said that even if the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngets  a  few  seats  in  the  Assembly  to  form  a\r\n\r\ngovernment, it is not preared to form a government.\r\n\r\nIt  is afraid of forming a government and face  the\r\n\r\npeople. It prefers to continue in opposition and to\r\n\r\ndo the same kind of talking as it is used to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the activities of the P.A.P. in recent months\r\n\r\nhave  resulted in a genuine fear among the minority\r\n\r\ncommunities  in  Singapore. Recently,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders in the City Council asked a minority\r\n\r\nmember - an Indian member - to pack up all his  things\r\n\r\nand  go  to  India if he so wishes. The P.A.P. has\r\n\r\ntried  to  meddle with the Malays. Sir,  very  many\r\n\r\nminority community members have approached  me  and\r\n\r\nposed me questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to  their  future in Singapore. I have  assured\r\n\r\nthem   that   under   a  Labour   Front   Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment, they have nothing to fear. But they are\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied. They are not satisfied  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  tactics  of  the P.A.P. in  its  treatment  of\r\n\r\nminorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that genuine fear can be seen in writing if\r\n\r\none  goes  outside the Victoria Memorial Hall.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Indian  Congress has  called  out  at  a\r\n\r\npublic  meeting demanding reserved  seats  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  I  do  not personally  support  reserved\r\n\r\nseats  in  this  Assembly because  I  believe  that\r\n\r\ncommunalism  has  no  place in Singapore.  But  all\r\n\r\nthese demands have now come out as a result of  the\r\n\r\nfears of the minority communities in Singapore if a\r\n\r\nfuture  government which is opposed  to  them  gets\r\n\r\ninto power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, Sir, I have to reply to some of\r\n\r\nthe remarks which the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nhas made. Unfortunately he is not here to listen to\r\n\r\nme but I do hope that he will read my statements if\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers publish them. Sir, the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nhas referred to the sad sights he has seen in which\r\n\r\nthe junior ministers of the Government throw stones\r\n\r\nat  the sinking ship to make it sink faster. I have\r\n\r\nalready  told this Assembly, Sir, that  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  ship  is safe and sound; it is not  sinking.\r\n\r\nAnd  I would assure him that my relations with  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters and Party members are very, very cordial,\r\n\r\nand  I  would  serve  my Party  and  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nloyally  and  faithfully for ever. I  have  been  a\r\n\r\nfront-line soldier in the struggle for freedom  for\r\n\r\nthis   country  for  so  many  years,  and  I  have\r\n\r\nundergone  several sacrifices in the best interests\r\n\r\nof  the  people. I think the Member  has  tried  to\r\n\r\nthrow  a spanner into the works and to disrupt  the\r\n\r\nunity  which we have achieved among us. Had it  not\r\n\r\nbeen  for  the  fact that the P.A.P. leaders  waged\r\n\r\nconstant war on individual leaders of the Front and\r\n\r\npoisoned its members against the Front, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould not have survived. The P.A.P. today, divorced\r\n\r\nfrom  the  anti-British supporters  of  the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nmembers and subversive elements is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworth its name, and all their hopes of winning  the\r\n\r\n51  seats  in the Assembly will remain nothing  but\r\n\r\nempty dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.19 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whenever the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar speaks in this House, we\r\n\r\ncan  always rely on hearing something new. The  day\r\n\r\nbefore yesterday, the hon. Member gave us a lengthy\r\n\r\ndiscourse  on  how to catch votes.  He  gave  us  a\r\n\r\nbrilliant  analysis  of why,  as  he  alleged,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  was on its way out. He  accused  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front, Sir, not of not doing enough for  the\r\n\r\npeople - he has admitted many times in the past  that\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front has done a lot of good things - but\r\n\r\nhe  accused the Labour Front of failing to  capture\r\n\r\nthe imagination of the people. Now therein lies the\r\n\r\nfundamental difference between us and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member believes in firing the imagination\r\n\r\nof  the  people  to  catch  votes.  He  even  cited\r\n\r\nexamples of action which his Party has taken in the\r\n\r\nCity  Council,  like the removal of  the  mace  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  the firing of crackers. Why, even the  ex-Chief  Minister goes about brandishing hammers  all\r\n\r\nover  the  place,  and  he  has  got  his  henchmen\r\n\r\nshouting   slogans,  `We  are  leftists!   We   are\r\n\r\nleftists!' - as if leftist is a pass-word to  gaining\r\n\r\naccess  to this Assembly. `We are leftists! We  are\r\n\r\nleftists!'  by  people  who  depend  on  trade  and\r\n\r\ncommerce  for their livelihood, who depend  on  the\r\n\r\nflow  of  trade;  they go about  shouting  `We  are\r\n\r\nleftists, we are leftists'! And brandishing hammers\r\n\r\nall  over Singapore! All very well indeed,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsay,  to  fire the imagination of the  people,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  then?  Will the people eat slogans?  Do  they\r\n\r\nlive  on  slogans?  Do  they  live  on  strings  of\r\n\r\ncrackers?  Do they earn their livelihood by  waving\r\n\r\nhammers  in public places? We, Sir, do not  believe\r\n\r\nin  these  empty  things.  In  fact,  that  is  the\r\n\r\nfundamental difference between us and the P.A.P. or\r\n\r\nthe    ex-Chief   Minister's   hammer   brandishing \"heroes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in serious work. We believe in doing\r\n\r\nthings  for  the  people, in  providing  education,\r\n\r\nhousing,  medical  facilities,  in  broadening  the\r\n\r\nbasis of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy,  so  that these slogan - calling  people  of\r\n\r\ntoday will find jobs tomorrow when their ardour for\r\n\r\nwaving hammers and shouting slogans has cooled  off\r\n\r\nand hunger gnaws at their insides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time the people of Singapore are told\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  It  is  time the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nrealise that dark clouds are already looming on the\r\n\r\neconomic horizon. It is time they realise that  all\r\n\r\nthis  shouting of \"isms\" is not going to fill their\r\n\r\nstomachs.  It  is time they realise  that  if  they\r\n\r\nfollow this talk of right, left, left, right,  they\r\n\r\nare  very  soon going to left, right,  left,  right\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  destruction! Just as Hitler's  army\r\n\r\ngoose-stepped itself out to oblivion.  It  is  time\r\n\r\nthe  people  realise, Sir, that the  only  possible\r\n\r\n\"ism\" in Singapore is \"practicalism\", or \"realism\",\r\n\r\nif you like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, Sir, is the purpose of our politicians? Is\r\n\r\nit  to  gain  seats for themselves in  the  elected\r\n\r\nAssembly?  Is it to fill their pockets? Is  it  the\r\n\r\nlust  for power? The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar,\r\n\r\nSir, says that it is to capture the imagination  in\r\n\r\norder to catch votes. Then let the people beware of\r\n\r\nsuch  politicians. For my part, Sir, I am proud  to\r\n\r\nsay that I am a businessman by vocation and that  I\r\n\r\nam  not  a politician, because there is nothing  so\r\n\r\ndangerous as a professional politician who will  go\r\n\r\nto  any length to retain his seat. He will not stop\r\n\r\nat anything. He will lie, he will plot, even betray\r\n\r\nhis  Party,  his  loyalty, just to keep  his  seat,\r\n\r\nbecause to him it means his livelihood - he needs his\r\n\r\nseat to earn his so many hundred dollars or so many\r\n\r\nthousand dollars if he becomes a Minister. But does\r\n\r\nit do any good to the country?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party, Sir, stands for Singapore, not for the\r\n\r\nreactionaries,  not  for the  revolutionaries - these\r\n\r\nare  hackneyed words, Sir, that can be  twisted  by\r\n\r\npoliticians as they please - words which really  have\r\n\r\nno  meaning  in  an  entrepot trading  centre  like\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Sir, we believe in good government.  As\r\n\r\nan example that anyone in Singapore can see - all the\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and committees - we have not stuffed\r\n\r\nthem with people just because they are loyal to the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front. We have put people on  these  boards whom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe consider are capable of running those boards and\r\n\r\nundertakings,  not caring whether  they  belong  to\r\n\r\nwhatever Party, whether they are in the opposition,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  wave  hammers,  or  go  about   with\r\n\r\nlightning banners, or go about with torches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an example which is fresh in the\r\n\r\nmind   of   everyone  in  Singapore.  The   Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund - a few days ago we read that the City\r\n\r\nCouncil was floating a loan of $30 million  and  it\r\n\r\nwas  said  that  the  Central  Provident  Fund  has\r\n\r\npromised its support. Sir, if the Government wished\r\n\r\nit,  it  could  have put pressure  on  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund not to lend its money to  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and  thereby prove  to  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore that the Central Provident Fund Board has\r\n\r\nno  faith in the City Council. But for the sake  of\r\n\r\ngood  government,  we, Sir, do not  stoop  to  such\r\n\r\nlevels of pulling strings behind the scenes. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  pack the boards with our Labour Front members.\r\n\r\nWe  let the boards operate of their own free  will.\r\n\r\nEven,  Sir,  against pressure from the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  a  few months back for the  Beehoon  Co-operative Society, asking me to put pressure on the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board - I point-blank refused to\r\n\r\ndo so. It is true, Sir-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\nclarification,  Sir - I  certainly  have   not   been\r\n\r\nputting  pressure on the Minister because  pressure\r\n\r\nwould not do any good, but it was persuasion on  my\r\n\r\npart to see whether he would see the right path  to\r\n\r\nfulfil a promise made by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thanks to the Member, Sir, for\r\n\r\nclarification - \"persuasion\"  can  be   in   inverted\r\n\r\ncommas.  But, Sir, I have not made such  a  promise\r\n\r\nbecause in fact legally I have no right to ask  the\r\n\r\nBoard  to fulfil any promises I make. Otherwise  it\r\n\r\ncould mean I could make promises to so many people:\r\n\r\n\"vote  for me and I will get all the money for  you\r\n\r\nfrom the Industrial Promotion Board.\" If we come to\r\n\r\nthat  stage, Sir, then I say that Singapore is  not\r\n\r\nworth  living in, and therefore I refuse to meddle.\r\n\r\nWhen I set up a board, I say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlet the board work according to its own conscience.\r\n\r\nWe  heard  criticism  yesterday  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  delays and  I  have  all  along\r\n\r\npersonally  been  sympathetic with  the  criticism,\r\n\r\nbecause  I myself have fought the S.I.T. for  five\r\n\r\nyears during my political career, over delays.  And\r\n\r\nI  say  that  just  because a board  is  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of a particular Minister, that is no excuse\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister to defend it. If that board  does\r\n\r\nthings wrong, let it get public criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Abolish it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

We will go to the people, Sir, telling  them\r\n\r\nhonestly  what the future is, and what  the  remedy\r\n\r\nfor  the  future  is, and how far that  remedy  can\r\n\r\nsucceed,  and what are the pitfalls in the  future.\r\n\r\nIn  these  days,  Sir, of dishonest, power-seeking,\r\n\r\nbudding dictators, this may sound unbelievable, but\r\n\r\nit is true. We are not going to thrust ourselves on\r\n\r\nthe  people  with lies and slogans  to  fire  their\r\n\r\nimagination.  We are going to be frank  and  honest\r\n\r\nwith  them. If they still wish to choose  dishonest\r\n\r\nslogan-shouting fanatics, it is their funeral. They\r\n\r\ncan  have the choice and they are welcome to it.  I\r\n\r\nfor  my part, Sir, am entirely against politics  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  today, with all the dishonesty  that  is\r\n\r\ngoing on in politics today. And it is not only  our\r\n\r\nmisfortune, Sir, that politics are dishonest; it is\r\n\r\nthe  misfortune  of  many other countries  in  Asia\r\n\r\ntoday, where there are politicians who are out  for\r\n\r\npower and for personal gain. I, Sir, quote what the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Republic of Pakistan said on  23rd\r\n\r\nMarch. This is what he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Pakistan is riddled with insincerity, disloyalty\r\n\r\nand  lack of consistency. Self is universally above\r\n\r\nservice.\"-\r\n\r\n<br><br>How true also of Singapore-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All that matters is the craze to make money or\r\n\r\ngain power.\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And I can tell the House one thing: the man who\r\n\r\nholds my seat in the Ministry of Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry can make a fortune if he wishes to; and\r\n\r\nperhaps there are many who are after it just for\r\n\r\nthe sake of making money.

That is a lie. Stability  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  word. This Government is quite stable. It  has\r\n\r\ncarried  on for two years and it is going to  carry\r\n\r\non  for  another year. But it will not, if  as  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister said we find that our  purpose  for\r\n\r\ngoverning is over. We are not going to occupy those\r\n\r\nseats  if we are not wanted. Instability here means\r\n\r\ninstability created by these budding dictators  who\r\n\r\nshout their heads off with leftism, rightism, this-ism, that-ism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The paramount need\" - I quote again, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of Pakistan, \"The paramount need  of  the\r\n\r\nmoment  is  sound  and stable political  conditions\r\n\r\nwithin  the  country,  and  unless  we  have   such\r\n\r\nconditions, it is futile to hope that we can  bring\r\n\r\nabout balanced economic conditions.\" Hear, hear,  I\r\n\r\nsay!   \"Politicians  are  perpetually  engaged   in\r\n\r\nunprecedented political manoeuvring.\" How true!

You have the hammer-waving\r\n\r\nex-Chief   Minister  calling   loudly   for   trade\r\n\r\nrepresentation in China - an issue that is calculated\r\n\r\nto  arouse the emotions of the Chinese people: `Our\r\n\r\nmotherland,  our  fatherland, we  must  have  trade\r\n\r\nrepresentation.'  Naturally they will  support  the\r\n\r\nman who says, `We must have trade representation in\r\n\r\nChina.'   Then   somebody  else  starts   shouting,\r\n\r\n`Minority  seats for the Indians' and so  on.

He\r\n\r\ndoes not state that the Chinese Government's policy\r\n\r\nis  to purchase direct from producing countries and\r\n\r\ntherefore since we have nothing of our own to  send\r\n\r\nto  China she is not going to buy from us more. The\r\n\r\nonly  profit will be to China to sell more consumer\r\n\r\ngoods to us, goods which are not costed, which  are\r\n\r\nproduced  with  cheap labour, like  the  eggs,  and\r\n\r\ndumped  on our market.

Mr Sutherland expressed another hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Industrial Promotion Board should develop\r\n\r\nnow  into  something bigger than what he called  \"a\r\n\r\npilot scheme\". Sir, let me remind him that I wanted\r\n\r\nto set up something bigger from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nThis Board is just an apology, because I could  not\r\n\r\nget the bankers and insurance companies to come  in\r\n\r\nand  participate with Government on  a  fifty-fifty\r\n\r\nbasis  for industrial development. If the hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland can use his good offices I will be  very\r\n\r\nhappy  to  sit down and discuss and find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans of enlarging this proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis suggested\r\n\r\nthat the Labour Front has gone all-out to achieve a\r\n\r\nlot  during its fourth year, and he asked why could\r\n\r\nit not have done this before? Perhaps, Sir, that is\r\n\r\nlack  of understanding. There are many things which\r\n\r\nneed  a  lot  of  time in planning,  and  when  the\r\n\r\nplanning stage is finished, then only can you bring\r\n\r\nit  to accomplishment. And therefore the first  few\r\n\r\nyears  have  got to go into planning these  things.\r\n\r\nWhen  things are ready, they appear on  the  stage.\r\n\r\nThe  appearance on the stage is always at the  last\r\n\r\nminute. The planning takes a much longer time  than\r\n\r\nthe showing on the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

He was not aware,  Sir,  of\r\n\r\nthis portion in the White Paper which was published\r\n\r\nwhen  the  All-Party Delegation returned - perhaps  I\r\n\r\nmay quote it for his benefit:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We recognised, however, in our discussions on\r\n\r\nthis   subject  that  international  law  made   it\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  create  an  `international  person'\r\n\r\nresponsible  only  for certain specific  fields  of\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs  of any one territory,  with  the\r\n\r\nresult   that   so  long  as  the  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  remained responsible  in  international\r\n\r\nlaw  for  the  external affairs of Singapore,  they\r\n\r\ncould  be  held  ultimately  responsible  for   any\r\n\r\nagreements made by the Singapore Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And so on; then it continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We therefore agreed, particularly in order that\r\n\r\nthe  exercise  by the Singapore Government  of  the\r\n\r\npowers  delegated to them should not be  called  in\r\n\r\nquestion by other Governments with whom they  might\r\n\r\nnegotiate,  that  the Constitution  should  provide\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore Government would act in  these\r\n\r\nmatters   with   the   assent  of   Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We therefore agreed that the Constitution should\r\n\r\ncontain a provision on the following lines:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty's Government to have the conduct of\r\n\r\nexternal  defence and external relations,  provided\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  of the State  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nacting with the assent of Her Majesty's Government,\r\n\r\nshall  have  the  power  to  initiate  and  conduct\r\n\r\nmatters ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That,  Sir, is part of the agreement.

Fish is the cheapest  form\r\n\r\nof  protein  that could be made available  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  general.  People like  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown could probably go and buy more expensive\r\n\r\ntypes of proteins like pork or mutton or beef,  but\r\n\r\nthe  poor people have to depend largely on fish for\r\n\r\ntheir  proteins.  And therefore it is  Government's\r\n\r\nduty  not to restrict activities just for the  sake\r\n\r\nof safeguarding the livelihood of 4,000 inefficient\r\n\r\nlocal  fishermen. It is Government's  duty  to  see\r\n\r\nthat the catching of fish-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Has the Government done anything?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

It is true,\r\n\r\nthat the supplies of fish are thereby increased  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  price of fish comes down but  people  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  can  now  get a type of protein  which  is\r\n\r\navailable at prices which they can afford to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> They are inefficient because -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the habit has arisen\r\n\r\nof  unseemly interruptions. If the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  thinks he has been misunderstood,  then\r\n\r\nhe  can rise, and I am sure the Minister will  give\r\n\r\nway    for   an   explanation.   But   a   murmured\r\n\r\ninterruption, I think, is disorderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, he said that the training\r\n\r\nscheme we have cannot succeed because of inadequate\r\n\r\nsalaries,   and   he  suggested  pre-sea   training\r\n\r\nschools. Sir, pre-sea training schools are a costly\r\n\r\naffair,  and I do not think that we have the  right\r\n\r\nkind of material for those schools yet. But we  are\r\n\r\nplanning  to  have courses in our  village  schools\r\n\r\nnow,  schools in the rural areas, on fisheries,  on\r\n\r\nagriculture  and so on. That is being prepared  now\r\n\r\nand I hope it can be put into operation shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as regards the salaries paid by the Japanese\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  local trainees, he  said  they  were\r\n\r\ninadequate.  That  is not so; those  salaries  were\r\n\r\nfixed  by  the  Apprenticeship Training  Committee.\r\n\r\nHowever, for his enlightenment, I will quote  these\r\n\r\nfigures, Sir, to show the type of material we  have\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.  The  total  number   of   trainees\r\n\r\nrecruited  in 1957 was 170; the number of  trainees\r\n\r\nresigned  after less than one month,  41,  or  24%;\r\n\r\nnumber  of  trainees resigned after one month,  26, 15%; number of trainees resigned after two to three\r\n\r\nmonths, 28, 16%; number of trainees resigned  after\r\n\r\nfour  to  six months, 19, 11 %; number of  trainees\r\n\r\nresigned  after  seven  to twelve  months,  4,  2%;\r\n\r\nnumber  of trainees still in service, 52, 32%;  but\r\n\r\nout  of  the 52 trainees still in service, 33  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in service for only one month, 13 for periods\r\n\r\nranging  from two to six months, and six  only  for\r\n\r\nperiods  exceeding six months. In other words,  out\r\n\r\nof  a  total  of 170 trainees recruited,  only  six\r\n\r\ntrainees, or 3\u00bd%, can be said to have taken on the\r\n\r\nidea of serious training for these offshore fishing\r\n\r\nprojects. The wastage is 96\u00bd%. Now, Sir, with  this\r\n\r\ntype of material-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.  The  reasons for these mass resignations  are\r\n\r\nentirely  due to the fact that they are  not  given\r\n\r\nproper training and not given the proper type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  work that they are supposed to be training for.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said yesterday, they were used as deck-hands\r\n\r\nand  similar  work - is  that  the  proper  type   of\r\n\r\ntraining?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That, Sir, is not so.\r\n\r\nWhenever   somebody  is  inefficient,   he   blames\r\n\r\nsomebody  else. It is like using \"colonialism\"  for\r\n\r\nhiding inefficiency. When you have nothing else to\r\n\r\noffer  the  people, you say, Colonialism,  leftism,\r\n\r\nthis-ism, that-ism, that is all! It is not so, Sir.\r\n\r\nThese people do not want to work. That is true, and\r\n\r\nnothing that we do about it is going to make  them.\r\n\r\nSir,  these people go out to the sea. First  voyage\r\n\r\nthey  go  out, they come back and say,  \"We  cannot\r\n\r\nstand  the sea, we cannot stand the sea; the  China\r\n\r\nsea  is too rough.\" If that is the type of trainees\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to  have  in  Singapore,  God  help\r\n\r\nSingapore, I say, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to produce hardier types of\r\n\r\nyoungsters - youngsters who will fight to keep  their\r\n\r\nplace  in  the  world. This  is  not  the  type  of\r\n\r\nmaterial  and  that is why I say that  we  want  to\r\n\r\nstart  with the villagers in the rural areas, teach\r\n\r\nthem  the  fundamentals of fishing, of  agriculture\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  And  then give them the  training - not\r\n\r\nthese people. Even if you pay them a higher salary,\r\n\r\nyou will not get the right type of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the industrial front, hon.

For  items  on  this\r\n\r\napproved list, whenever they are purchased  by  any\r\n\r\nof  these bodies, they are forced by compulsion  to\r\n\r\nbuy  only local manufactures. Formerly they  had  a\r\n\r\nchoice.  A circular had been issued by the ex-Chief\r\n\r\nMinister saying preference must be given, but  from\r\n\r\nmy experience - from bitter experience - I have learnt\r\n\r\nthat  that  \"preference to be  given\"  remained  on\r\n\r\npaper - no  real  preference  was  given.  Heads   of\r\n\r\ndepartments,  Sir,  have  been  prejudiced  against\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufactures. I have checked certain items of local\r\n\r\nmanufacture  and found that they are comparable  in\r\n\r\nquality  and  price,  and that  the  factories  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of  producing to capacity to meet  demand,\r\n\r\nand  there can therefore be no excuse for heads  of\r\n\r\ndepartments now to say that they will not buy them.\r\n\r\nIf  they have any real excuse on any item they  can\r\n\r\ncome  to me and put their case before me, and if  I\r\n\r\nfind  that they are justified I will remove it from\r\n\r\nthe  approved  list.

That  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue. The Speech is filled with solid facts of what\r\n\r\nlegislation  we are going to bring to  this  House,\r\n\r\nwhat  we are going to do in this last year  of  our\r\n\r\noffice. Comparing with past speeches, this may seem\r\n\r\nto  be  a  fruitful one as the Member for  Ponggol-Tampenis  pointed out, but as I said, planning  had\r\n\r\nto be undertaken and this is the result of previous planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given a solid example of what we\r\n\r\nare  doing  in the field of encouraging industries.\r\n\r\nThe   other   one  of  course  is  the  point-blank\r\n\r\nstatement  in  the  Speech that pioneer  industries\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  being drafted. I can  assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse that that legislation is in the draft now and\r\n\r\nshould  be before this House in the course  of  the\r\n\r\nnext  three  or  four months, I should  say - I  hope\r\n\r\nearlier.  That  legislation  would  mean,  in   the\r\n\r\nlayman's  language, \"tax holidays\" - what period  and\r\n\r\nwhat  type  of  \"holidays\"  I  am  not  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndisclose at this moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Member for Serangoon asks, \"More\r\n\r\nhome-grown  food - what are you  doing  about  that?\"\r\n\r\nSir,  what  we have done about it I will tell  him.\r\n\r\nThe  rate of inoculation of poultry, from 3,000,000\r\n\r\nper  year in 1955 has gone up to 7,000,000 per year\r\n\r\nlast  year, and now the House is going to be  asked\r\n\r\nfor  a  further  sum for the Veterinary  Department\r\n\r\nwhich  will make the rate of inoculation go  up  to\r\n\r\n11,000,000  or 12,000,000 per year. That  is  solid\r\n\r\nwork.  It  means that the farmer can  rest  assured\r\n\r\nthat he will not lose large numbers of his stock in\r\n\r\nthe hazards of diseases beyond his control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1955, Sir, when this Government took over,\r\n\r\nthe poultry production rate was 5,000,000 per year.\r\n\r\nLast  year  it  was 22,000,000. As I said  the  day\r\n\r\nbefore  yesterday  in answer  to  a  question,  the\r\n\r\nprices of poultry and eggs have come down by  about 30  per cent in the last three years. Pigs - we  were\r\n\r\nimporting -  60  per cent we were importing  before;\r\n\r\ntoday  we  are exporting. All this, Sir, shows  the\r\n\r\nattention given to growing more food. And on top of\r\n\r\nthat now, Sir, the Rural Development Panel is being\r\n\r\nset   up  and  that  panel  will  co-ordinate   all\r\n\r\nactivities  connected  with the  rural  areas  - the\r\n\r\nnecessary  road-making, assistance  to  farmers  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  forms, and so on. Once that  panel  gets\r\n\r\ngoing, you will see the rural areas receiving  much\r\n\r\nmore  attention  than they have in  the  past.  The\r\n\r\nwhole  question  is  one of finance,  Sir;  finance\r\n\r\nplays  a  very big part; one would like to do  many\r\n\r\nthings  but one can not do all those things because\r\n\r\nof lack of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the entrepot trade is not going to remain for\r\n\r\never.  That  I have told this House time  and  time\r\n\r\nagain, even though the Member for Telok Ayer  might\r\n\r\nsay  that he has said it before me. It is  true.  I\r\n\r\ncan  see the clouds looming ahead and I have warned\r\n\r\nthis  House many times. I warn the House and I warn\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore not to rely on the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  only. It is not going to last. It has lasted\r\n\r\nyou a hundred years, you are lucky; it is not going\r\n\r\nto  last  another hundred years, even though  civil\r\n\r\nservants  might  say, `We have  survived  the  last\r\n\r\nhundred years and we will continue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  survive.' I say that that trend of thought is\r\n\r\ndwelling in the past. They do not understand  what\r\n\r\nthe  future is; they cannot accommodate themselves\r\n\r\nto  the developments, political and otherwise,  of\r\n\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion was made, `Why do we not cut down\r\n\r\ncosts  by mechanising the Harbour Board?' That  is\r\n\r\nbeing done. The Harbour Board is being mechanised,\r\n\r\nand  I think the hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew, who  is  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  that Board, would know about  it;  and\r\n\r\nextensions  are being made to the Harbour  Board's\r\n\r\nberthing space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a suggestion was made to encourage local\r\n\r\nshipping.  Now  we  have  in  His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Speech  a paragraph  which  says  that\r\n\r\ndiscussions   are   going  on  with   neighbouring\r\n\r\ngovernments to allow local masters to have  bigger\r\n\r\nscope  for  operation. In fact  these  discussions\r\n\r\nhave been going on for more than a year. But I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  we cannot rely on ourselves alone  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter   because  these  ships  ply  between   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya, Singapore and  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories, and we have got to get the  agreement\r\n\r\nof  all these three governments before we can move\r\n\r\nin this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion was that we should try to\r\n\r\nencourage   local   shipping  - that   is   locally\r\n\r\nregistered, locally owned ships. Now, Sir, that is\r\n\r\nnot  easily possible. Firstly, even if we do, most\r\n\r\ncountries  would insist that their cargoes  should\r\n\r\nbe  carried  in their bottoms - their own cargoes - we\r\n\r\nhave  no  cargoes of our own to carry in  our  own\r\n\r\nbottoms. If we say tin and rubber must be  carried\r\n\r\nin our bottoms, the Federation is going to say \"in\r\n\r\nour bottoms, not yours; it is our tin and rubber\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the surprising suggestion from\r\n\r\na  businessman, Sir, that perhaps - this  Government\r\n\r\nis  a  bad  government; the Member for Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\nsays  this is a bad government - the next government\r\n\r\nmight  consider legislating that all coastal trade\r\n\r\nshould be carried in our ships. What is the length\r\n\r\nof  coast we have, Sir? We are only a tiny  island\r\n\r\nof 225 square miles. Our ships\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill go round and round the island? We cannot even\r\n\r\ndo  that because there is the Causeway. We  cannot\r\n\r\nlegislate for our ships to carry coastal trade  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  because that is the  Federation's\r\n\r\ncoast,  not ours. How can you legislate for  going\r\n\r\ninto other territories? If you do that and say our\r\n\r\nships  must  carry the trade, they  are  going  to\r\n\r\nbring in counter legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is an example of half-baked political\r\n\r\nideas   without  proper  debate,  without   proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the problems, and  that  is  what\r\n\r\nthe  country is going to fall for hook,  line  and\r\n\r\nsinker    in    the    next   elections - half-baked\r\n\r\npoliticians with half-baked theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Perhaps we could establish trade missions.'\r\n\r\nTrade  missions are a costly business, Sir, If  a\r\n\r\nMinister  goes to another country and spends  $800\r\n\r\nto   attend  a  ministerial  conference  like  the\r\n\r\nColombo    Plan   Conference - in   a    ministerial\r\n\r\nconference,   Sir,   other  countries   too   send\r\n\r\nministers - and incidentally we get an advantage out\r\n\r\nof it by getting something free from Australia, by\r\n\r\nsaving several hundred thousand dollars due  to  a\r\n\r\nrice deal with Thailand - he is asked, `Why did  you\r\n\r\nspend  $800?' This in spite of the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nsame  hon. Member could go gallivanting round  the\r\n\r\nworld  as  a Member of the Legislative Council  of\r\n\r\nthe  old  days without any responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is their attitude, Sir - miser-like - shall I\r\n\r\nsay Scrooge-like - I think that is the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First, of course, I must\r\n\r\ndiscover  whether  the  Minister  is  using  those\r\n\r\nexpressions  in  relation  to  a  Member  of   the\r\n\r\nAssembly.

It hurts me as much to  say\r\n\r\nit, but we must face the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Promotion Board should not\r\n\r\nrequire stringent securities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand so on, the Member for Serangoon suggested. But,\r\n\r\nSir, we are trustees of public funds; it is not our\r\n\r\nmoney. If the I.P.B. feels that a risk is not worth\r\n\r\ntaking,  it is up to it. If the money is  lent  and\r\n\r\ndoes  not come back, the same hon. Member will  say\r\n\r\n`Why  was  money  lent to so and so the  taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney?'  Sir, naturally the Board has  got  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  what  money it lends is not given merely  for\r\n\r\nthe asking. And I strongly support it. These Boards\r\n\r\nshould  not be used for political purposes  because\r\n\r\nif  they are the Party in power can make sure  that\r\n\r\nit  can buy all the votes through these Boards. And\r\n\r\nthe  same thing about beehoon, Sir,I say the  bee-hoon industry \r\n\r\n- the  way they put forward their proposals - they\r\n\r\ndo  not deserve any assistance from the Board,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Board  has  now put to them counter-proposals,\r\n\r\ntelling  them  what to do in order  that  they  can\r\n\r\nqualify for the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on \"vacant land\". The Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim Choon Mong) said that there is a  lot  of\r\n\r\nvacant  land and that Government should  set  aside\r\n\r\nsome  of  it  and allow farmers to develop  but  as\r\n\r\neveryone  knows, Sir, the problem is that once  you\r\n\r\nlet anybody occupy land that is set aside for later\r\n\r\ndevelopment  for  hospitals or schools  he  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to get out when it is wanted back. You  give\r\n\r\nhim a contract - everything typed neatly, signed, and\r\n\r\nso  on - which says that he is temporary and no  more\r\n\r\nand when after five years you tell him, \"Sorry,  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  build a hospital; will you go?\", he  will\r\n\r\nrun  to  the Opposition politicians to put pressure\r\n\r\non  the  Government.  That  is  what  is  happening\r\n\r\nhere - like  the  case of the illegal attap  huts  in\r\n\r\nKampong   Amber - and  then  you  do  not  get   your\r\n\r\nhospital,  you do not get your school, because  the\r\n\r\nland  is not available. The occupant will say, \"Put\r\n\r\nme on another piece of land. Give me compensation.\"\r\n\r\nAll with the tax-payers' money, mind you, for which\r\n\r\nthe politicians are acting as trustees!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a suggestion that more experimental\r\n\r\nroads  should  be  built. I  agree,  Sir.  More  of\r\n\r\neverything should be done. It is only a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfinding the money. If we come to this  House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  raise taxes, there will be a howl, \"Why do you\r\n\r\nraise taxes and why do you need so much money, this\r\n\r\nand  that?\"  Well, if you are not  going  to  raise\r\n\r\ntaxes,  then you cannot get more of everything.  It\r\n\r\nis  just  simple  logic, but of course  maybe  some\r\n\r\nMembers  here are not accustomed to logic. They  go\r\n\r\nmore for emotional issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"Deep-sea fishing licences were turned down.\"\r\n\r\nThat  was  the  allegation made by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon. That is not correct, Sir. These licences\r\n\r\nhave  not been turned down. I have got the figures.\r\n\r\nSir,  when we opened up this deep-sea fishing joint\r\n\r\nproject with the Japanese, the first lot was to  be\r\n\r\nonly  three  licences  for  approva4l  as  a  pilot\r\n\r\nscheme.   When  we  found  that  the   scheme   was\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  we  threw it open  to  all  applicants\r\n\r\nprovided that they complied with certain conditions\r\n\r\nwe laid down. Since then, 16 applications have come\r\n\r\nin. Out of those 16, when correspondence took place\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Ministry  and them,  asking  them  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  those conditions,  only  four  showed\r\n\r\ninterest.  The  rest just backed out.  Out  of  the\r\n\r\nfour,  two were approved, one has been refused  and\r\n\r\none  is  still  under consideration.  So  not  many\r\n\r\nlicences have been refused! These are facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not much progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Well, not much progress\r\n\r\nbecause out of 16, only four showed interest - 25 per\r\n\r\ncent. The rest were frivolous applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggested, \"Let us follow others if the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no original ideas.\" The tax  holiday\r\n\r\nis  not something borrowed from the Federation,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member suggested. In fact, in my statement  to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly on 7th November, 1956, I said this:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government is investigating the question of\r\n\r\nmaking   tax   concessions  to   industries   whose\r\n\r\nexpansion   or  establishment  it  is  desired   to\r\n\r\nencourage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was 7th November, 1956. The fact that we could\r\n\r\nnot get on with it was because income tax is a Pan-Malayan  subject and we have got to  keep  in  line\r\n\r\nwith the Federation. Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is not something that we have borrowed from the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Rather it is something  that  we  have\r\n\r\nbrought  out  ourselves  and  which  is  now  being\r\n\r\nadopted on a Pan-Malayan basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an `advice section' in the Ministry which\r\n\r\ngives  advice  to  all those who  ask  for  it.  If\r\n\r\nanybody is interested in getting advice he  can  go\r\n\r\nthere  and  he will be given all the assistance  he\r\n\r\nrequires; the Industrial Promotion Board also gives\r\n\r\nassistance.  I  personally,  Sir,  give  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nassistance  and  advice to  many  people  who  come\r\n\r\nasking   about   the   possibilities   of   opening\r\n\r\nindustries.

R.\r\n\r\nLazarous), one wonders if he became a Member of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. whether he would be in the Left or the Left-Right  or  the  Right-Left or the  Left-Left-Right.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we  might  even  see  him  bringing  in  a\r\n\r\n\"hammer\"  to  this House one of these  days - if  you\r\n\r\nwill  permit  it,  Sir, which I am  sure  you  will\r\n\r\nnot - but he can use it outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the nominated Member Mr Tan Siak Kew said\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the Industrial  Promotion  Board,\r\n\r\n\"There  is  a  danger  of spoon-feeding  industries\r\n\r\nwithout   ascertaining  the  bona  fides   of   the\r\n\r\nenterprises or the sponsors.\" That is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexactly  what I say, Sir, that we should  stop  any\r\n\r\nspoon-feeding and that is why I tell the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon,  Sir, that we should not  put  political\r\n\r\npressure  but  that  we  should  see  whether   the\r\n\r\nindustries  are capable of establishing  themselves\r\n\r\nif given a helping hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member also said, \"Do not meddle in\r\n\r\nthe  entrepot  trade.\" Now,  Sir,  it  is  not  our\r\n\r\nintention to meddle in the entrepot trade. In fact,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  want to do is to help the entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nand  we have in the past, in many instances, helped\r\n\r\nthe  entrepot  trade  considerably.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nMembers  must  have read in this  morning's  papers\r\n\r\nthat  three  ships  which  were  detained  by   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  for so long have been  released.  That\r\n\r\nwas  as a result of strong representations made  by\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry.  Likewise, in the  past,  some  other\r\n\r\nships were detained and again we took the matter up\r\n\r\nstrongly  with  them.  There were  also  impossible\r\n\r\nbarter  trade  recommendations  or  proposals  last\r\n\r\nNovember  and  we  took  it up  strongly  with  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Consulate  and  told  them,  \"This   is\r\n\r\nimpossible.  You will kill all the trade.\"  In  the\r\n\r\nend  we  got  them  to  agree  to  scale  down  the\r\n\r\nproposals  so that the trade could continue.  These\r\n\r\nthings go on behind the scenes, Sir. We do not  put\r\n\r\nloudspeakers  outside the Ministry  like  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  does and blare it all out. Neither  do  we\r\n\r\nissue  bulletins  every day like the  City  Council\r\n\r\ndoes, \"$10 for the relief fund or this or that.\" If\r\n\r\nwe  do  that,  Sir, I am sure that a lot  of  paper\r\n\r\nwould  be  required and our estimate for stationery\r\n\r\nwill go up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to Australian timber duties. There was a\r\n\r\nproposal to increase import duties in Australia  on\r\n\r\nMalayan   timber.  There  again  we   made   strong\r\n\r\nrepresentations through Mr Leembruggen who was the\r\n\r\nMalayan Deputy-Commissioner then, though we do  not\r\n\r\nknow the outcome of it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian Apple and Board is another example.\r\n\r\nWe   been   fighting  constantly  with   Australian\r\n\r\nGovernment regarding this Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copra from the Philippines is a recent example.\r\n\r\nWhen  supplies from Indonesia were cut off, I  took\r\n\r\nthe matter up with the Secretary of State and said,\r\n\r\n\"We  must  have  dollars  to  buy  copra  from  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines.\" Then getting his agreement, I took it\r\n\r\nup  again  with the Federation because  the  dollar\r\n\r\nquestion  is  Pan-Malayan. When I was up  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  \"spending  public funds\" on  travelling  up\r\n\r\nthere  for  the E.C.A.F.E. Conference, I  took  the\r\n\r\nmatter  up and got the Minister to agree and  there\r\n\r\nwas a joint statement issued by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of relaxation of duties when\r\n\r\nIndia  put into the preferential category  what  so\r\n\r\nfar  had been treated as non-preferential. That was\r\n\r\nin  1955  when I went up to New Delhi with the  ex-Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall) and later on to\r\n\r\nBangalore for the E.C.A.F.E. Conference. I took  it up personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the things, Sir - there are a lot of\r\n\r\nthings - you  cannot do by correspondence.  You  have\r\n\r\ngot  to have personal contact and if Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  are  going  to  take a \"skinflint\"  attitude\r\n\r\nabout  it,  well,  then  we  will  not  have  these\r\n\r\nbenefits. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rice exports, Sir. \"The merchants were in\r\n\r\ndifficulties because the 21-day period of exemption\r\n\r\nfor the export of rice was found to be inadequate.\"\r\n\r\nWe said, \"We will give another 21 days.\" And so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Colombo, payments were stopped by the Ceylon\r\n\r\nfinancial  authorities  for shipments  of  chillies\r\n\r\nmade  by local Indian merchants. I took it up  with\r\n\r\nthe  representative here and then gave  letters  of\r\n\r\nintroduction  to  the  Indian Chamber's  delegation\r\n\r\nwhich  went there and as a result we got the  money\r\n\r\nreleased.  These are some of the things, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nwe have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction in copra freight rate, Sir. The\r\n\r\nNominated Member Mr Tan Siak Kew will bear me  out\r\n\r\non  this, that I took this matter up with a leading\r\n\r\nmember of the Conference when we were having  lunch\r\n\r\ntogether    and    the    Ministry    then     made\r\n\r\nrepresentations.

Treasurer  who later, at the request  of  the\r\n\r\nPress, passed it on to them to copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Straits Times came to put the words of\r\n\r\nthis  petition into my mouth I do not know. It  may\r\n\r\nhave  been  the enthusiasm of the reporter  or  for\r\n\r\nsome reason best known to the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, I should like\r\n\r\nto  point  out  that it is the Party to  which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar belongs which  does  not\r\n\r\nfulfil promises. We can see ample proof of this  in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council where the employees are in revolt\r\n\r\nagainst a Party which claims to be the \"champion of the workers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.14 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not indulge myself in the\r\n\r\npolitical  \"isms\" of this House. However,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike,  at  the  risk of repetition, to  say  a  few\r\n\r\nthings  about the achievements of the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nespecially after the attack by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nAyer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) that the Government has done\r\n\r\nnothing  during  the  past three  years.  Once  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew)  told\r\n\r\nme - he rather seems to be an expert on Marxism - that\r\n\r\nif  you  tell  a  lie often enough the  people  who\r\n\r\nlisten to that lie will be inclined to believe  it.\r\n\r\nWell, I am not quoting any lie; I am merely quoting\r\n\r\nfacts and figures to show what the Labour Front has\r\n\r\ndone.  Perhaps  people  might  forget  about  these\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Coalition Government came into power,\r\n\r\nthere have been many outstanding achievements which\r\n\r\nstick   out   a   mile.  We  have,  for   instance,\r\n\r\nMalayanisation in which all the posts of  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries to the various Ministries are now  held\r\n\r\nby   local   persons   who  have   been   appointed\r\n\r\nirrespective  of whether they are  members  of  any\r\n\r\npolitical    Parties   or   have   any    political\r\n\r\naffiliations or of race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent, in 1957, more than $50 million on\r\n\r\neducation - an increase of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover 40 per cent over the expenditure for 1956. The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  readiness to grant financial  aid  to\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University, as announced by  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Minister,  is  another  proof  of  our\r\n\r\nsincerity  towards  Chinese  culture  and   Chinese education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other achievements, such as the\r\n\r\nShop Assistants Employment Ordinance and the Clerks\r\n\r\nEmployment Ordinance whereby the workers now  enjoy\r\n\r\nlimited  hours of work, extra pay for overtime  and\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave  for the women workers.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso  the  other  major achievement in  citizenship\r\n\r\nwhereby all aliens who have hitherto not been given\r\n\r\nthe chance or right to take part in the affairs  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  are now given such right  both  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and the Government. Trade unions  for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time  in the history of Singapore  have\r\n\r\nbeen given the absolute right to strike. These  are\r\n\r\nbut  a few of the achievements and I would like the\r\n\r\npeople   to  know,  as  I  said  at  the  risk   of\r\n\r\nrepetition, such worthy achievements of the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  and  we  will go to the next elections  with\r\n\r\nthose achievements in front of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hearing the speech of the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark (Mr A. R. Lazarous), I was rather amused.  At\r\n\r\none time it sounded to me as like an overture to an\r\n\r\napplication  for membership in the  P.A.P.  At  the\r\n\r\nnext  moment,  I  thought it was a censure  on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leader (the Member for Tanjong Pagar in this\r\n\r\nHouse) and at another moment, I thought that he was\r\n\r\na  spokesman for the City Council in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  surprised at all in view of the  mental attitude of that Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to more mundane matters that have been put\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House. Sir, the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lee Choon Eng) and the Member for Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\n(Mr  R. Jumabhoy) touched on the question  of  the\r\n\r\nomission  of  the Tamil language in the  Governor's\r\n\r\nSpeech.  Well,  the Governor's  Speech  is  only  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of  broad  policy.  It  does  not   give\r\n\r\ndetails.  But to set at rest the minds of the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers referred to and especially the minds of the\r\n\r\nIndian public in the Colony, I give the assurance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, as far as this Government is concerned, Tamil\r\n\r\neducation  enjoys equal status with all  the  other\r\n\r\nthree,  namely,  Malay, Chinese and  English.  Now,\r\n\r\nTamil  teaching  in  the  primary  English  schools\r\n\r\nstarted  in 1952. There were then only eight  full-time  teachers teaching that language in 32 primary\r\n\r\nEnglish schools. This year, Tamil is taught in  110\r\n\r\nschools  by  53 full-time teachers; almost  all  of\r\n\r\nthem  being  trained either in India or in  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe  number of pupils learning Tamil as  a  subject\r\n\r\nfor  five  days of the week during school hours  is\r\n\r\nnow 5,926. Now, I will give the comparative figures\r\n\r\nof  the  number  of pupils in the  various  schools\r\n\r\nduring the period under review. As I said, in 1952,\r\n\r\nthere  were  only 32 schools teaching  Tamil.  This\r\n\r\nyear, we have 110. The number of pupils in 1953 was\r\n\r\n1,228  with seven teachers. In 1958, we have  5,926\r\n\r\nwith  53  teachers. In addition, we  have  Saturday\r\n\r\nTamil  classes being conducted in several  schools.\r\n\r\nAttendance  and  progress at these  Saturday  Tamil\r\n\r\nclasses are very satisfactory indeed, although some\r\n\r\nparents  are  reluctant to send their  children  to\r\n\r\nTamil  classes held on Saturdays mainly because  of\r\n\r\ntransport difficulties or some parents prefer their\r\n\r\nchildren to be taught Tamil at home. In 1957  also,\r\n\r\na  common  Tamil  language paper  was  set  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  Primary  VI  pupils  to  assess  the\r\n\r\nprogress  made in the teaching of Tamil in  primary\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools. The paper set was  of  Grade  III\r\n\r\nstandard  in Tamil. Out of 343 candidates  who  sat\r\n\r\nfor  that  examination in November 1957,  142  were\r\n\r\nsuccessful. Now, Tamil classes were also  conducted\r\n\r\nfor  pupils in English secondary schools. They  are\r\n\r\nnow  being  conducted at Beatty School and  Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution and these have carried on since 1956. I\r\n\r\nhave  still  more figures about Tamil education  to\r\n\r\nprove  that the Government has not left  out  Tamil\r\n\r\neducation at all. It is treated at par with all the\r\n\r\nother  three  languages and that is the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also touched on the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  an architectural course in the  Colony.\r\n\r\nWell, I advise the Member for Queenstown who is not\r\n\r\nhere to go to the Singapore Polytechnic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   he   will  be  given  the  syllabus  for   an\r\n\r\narchitectural   course.   We   are   providing   an\r\n\r\narchitectural  course in the Singapore  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nand the degrees awarded by the Polytechnic will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)\r\n\r\nstressed  the importance of vocational schools  for\r\n\r\nchildren.  In view of the large number of  children\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and  the  large  number  who  cannot\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  a secondary education, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  now  in the planning stage an artisan  school.\r\n\r\nOverage  pupils  or  pupils  who  cannot  go  to  a\r\n\r\nsecondary  grammar  school or  those  from  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  who  do  not  have  satisfactory  academic\r\n\r\nqualifications  will be given an intensive  artisan\r\n\r\ncourse  to  fit them to take up a trade after  they\r\n\r\nhave  passed  the examination set  by  the  artisan\r\n\r\nschool.  This will be a pilot scheme  for  a  Trade\r\n\r\nTraining  Centre  which I  propose  to  set  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the coming years. Of course, the Trade\r\n\r\nTraining Centre will be a very costly affair and it\r\n\r\nneeds  a  lot  of  planning as  regards  costs  and\r\n\r\nteachers  and  it will be several years  before  it\r\n\r\ncomes into existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the few facts as I have expressed them,\r\n\r\nas  there are indeed very few comments on the  work\r\n\r\nof my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.24 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to take up the time of the Assembly  any\r\n\r\nlonger  than  is necessary but there are  just  two\r\n\r\npoints I wish to touch on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns the matter of law and order and\r\n\r\nin  particular the police. It is my impression that\r\n\r\nall  hon.  Members would be agreed on  two  things:\r\n\r\nfirstly,  that  the  present  level  of  crime  and\r\n\r\nlawlessness  in  Singapore gives  grave  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern; secondly, that if this state of affairs is\r\n\r\nto be successfully tackled there is only one way of\r\n\r\ndoing  it and that is through the joint efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe  police and the public working in co-operation.\r\n\r\nWhat  hon.  Members have concentrated  on  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate and in the debate which we had yesterday  on\r\n\r\nthe   two   Bills  which  were  approved  are   the\r\n\r\nshortcomings of the police which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey claim to militate against the development  of\r\n\r\nthis  co-operation. I shall, Sir, be dealing  with\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  specific points in a minute  but  I\r\n\r\nshould like to say at the outset that I have  been\r\n\r\nfrankly disappointed that in all the comments that\r\n\r\nhave been made in the course of the debate on this\r\n\r\nmotion as well as on the Bills there has not  been\r\n\r\none  word  of credit, one word of commendation  or\r\n\r\none  word of encouragement for a body of  men  who\r\n\r\nare  faced  with as formidable a task  as  perhaps\r\n\r\nfaces any police force in the world and who by and\r\n\r\nlarge as a force are working night and day to  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  their  ability and with  a  considerable\r\n\r\nmeasure   of  success  despite  the  limited   co-operation they receive, striving to do their  duty by their fellow-citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng)\r\n\r\nwho  I  am  sorry to see is not in his place  drew\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  reference  in  the  Governor's\r\n\r\nSpeech  to  the  morale  of  the  police   and   I\r\n\r\nunderstood  him not to understand what was  meant.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  I  could draw attention  to  one  example\r\n\r\nwhich  took  place recently when a police  officer\r\n\r\noff  duty  walking along a road saw two  gangsters\r\n\r\nmaking  an  attack with acid bombs. He gave  chase\r\n\r\nand  single-handed he tackled them  despite  being\r\n\r\nattacked  himself and burned by a bomb  thrown  by\r\n\r\none  of  these  gangsters  and  he  succeeded   in\r\n\r\nachieving the capture of one of these two men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there are shortcomings in the police, we\r\n\r\nshall  certainly do our best - and I speak for  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner on this also - to remedy them. If there\r\n\r\nare  black sheep, we shall do our best to discover\r\n\r\nthem and weed them out. Above all, we shall do our\r\n\r\nbest to break down this barrier between the police\r\n\r\nand  the public and my hon. friend the Member  for\r\n\r\nSeletar  (Mr M. P. D. Nair) has already  detailed\r\n\r\nsome of the measures we have taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be idle to pretend that\r\n\r\nshortcomings  do not exist and that there  are  no\r\n\r\nblack  sheep to be found but if you took any other\r\n\r\ncommunity, any other body of persons in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday, do hon. Members not think that the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition or even worse would be found? Let  us  at\r\n\r\nleast  maintain a sense of proportion in this  and\r\n\r\nlet us think how many persons in Singapore outside\r\n\r\nthe  police  share responsibility for the  present\r\n\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said of secret societies. As a\r\n\r\nrelative newcomer to Singapore, I cannot vie  with\r\n\r\ncertain others in my knowledge of these bodies but\r\n\r\none  thing  is  very  apparent  and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nalarming  extent  to which these secret  societies\r\n\r\nhave   extended  their  tentacles  into  so   many\r\n\r\nactivities  in Singapore. If these tentacles  have\r\n\r\npenetrated  the police force, as the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nclaimed, is that altogether so surprising when  it\r\n\r\nis   clear   how   widely  they  have   penetrated\r\n\r\nelsewhere?  The  hon. Member for Changi  suggested\r\n\r\nthat it is the deliberate policy to recruit secret\r\n\r\nsociety  or  ex-secret society  members  into  the\r\n\r\npolice  force.  That,  Sir, I  emphatically  deny.\r\n\r\nWhatever  may have been the position in the  past,\r\n\r\nthat  is certainly not true today. Moreover, there\r\n\r\nis  no  direct recruitment to the C.I.D.,  as  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  implied.  All  entrants  today   are\r\n\r\nrecruited  to the uniformed branch of  the  force,\r\n\r\nand  only after they have completed their training\r\n\r\nand  preliminary service are they  considered  for\r\n\r\nservice   with  the  C.I.D.  There  are  certainly\r\n\r\nopportunities  for corruption in the  C.I.D.,  but\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner is very alive to these risks and\r\n\r\nto  the  advisability of making regular transfers,\r\n\r\nand  there  have,  in  fact,  been  a  number   of\r\n\r\ntransfers in that branch recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hon. Member suggested that the lack of\r\n\r\ninformation from detectives in the C.I.D. was  due\r\n\r\nto  their secret society connections. Another hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  however,  complains because  disciplinary\r\n\r\naction  is  taken against those who are not  doing\r\n\r\ntheir   jobs.  He  claims  that  this  is  causing\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction. It seems to me, Sir,  that  these\r\n\r\ntwo accusations cancel each other out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was urged by the hon. Member for Changi to\r\n\r\nrecruit more Chinese into the force. My answer  to\r\n\r\nthat,  Sir,  is  that  we  welcome  every  Chinese\r\n\r\nrecruit  we can get. The hon. Member also  invited\r\n\r\nme  to make a comparison with the police force  in\r\n\r\nHongkong. That, Sir, I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind  a  very invidious task, but I will say  this:\r\n\r\nthat  I think both forces are confronted with  very\r\n\r\nexceptional and very formidable tasks and that,  to\r\n\r\nthe  best of their ability, they are tackling those\r\n\r\ntasks  courageously. It may be that  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nsomething  to learn from Hongkong. It may  also  be\r\n\r\ntrue  that  Hongkong has something  to  learn  from\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  it may interest the  hon.  Member,\r\n\r\nwhom  I  am glad to see back in his place, to  know\r\n\r\nthat  when I arrived in Singapore, among  those  to\r\n\r\nmeet me on the quay was the Commissioner of Police,\r\n\r\nHongkong,  who was down in Singapore to learn  what\r\n\r\nhe could from the Singapore police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I reiterate that this\r\n\r\nproblem of lawlessness is one on which we have  all\r\n\r\ngot  to pull together. If there are faults with the\r\n\r\npolice,  we will try to remedy them. If  there  are\r\n\r\nfaults with the public, let us try and remedy  them\r\n\r\nalso,  but above all, let us try and approach  this\r\n\r\nproblem  in  a  constructive and not a  destructive\r\n\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only other matter on which I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch  was a remark dropped by the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar in the course of his speech to  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  He  will  perhaps forgive  me  if  I  have\r\n\r\nforgotten his exact words, but he indicated that if\r\n\r\nhe  and  his  friends won the next  election,  they\r\n\r\nintended  to  govern,  and  if  they  received  any\r\n\r\nobstruction  from  the civil  service,  then  swift\r\n\r\nretribution  would follow. Sir,  I  hope  that  all\r\n\r\npolitical Parties will always subscribe to what  is\r\n\r\na   fundamental  principle  in  the  working  of  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  administration-that the public  service\r\n\r\nmust   be   immune  from  all  forms  of  political\r\n\r\ninfluence,   political  pressures   and   political\r\n\r\nthreats. Whichever Party wins the next election and\r\n\r\nforms a government will inherit a hard-working  and\r\n\r\nan  honest and loyal public service. It is the duty\r\n\r\nof  the public service to carry out the policies of\r\n\r\nthe  government in power at the time; it  is  their\r\n\r\nduty  to  deal  with  the  day-to-day  minutiae  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  business within the  framework  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy laid down by the government; and it is  also\r\n\r\ntheir duty to advise their elected Ministers on the\r\n\r\nproblems that come up and to give that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvice  to  the best of their ability;  and  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the  hon.  Member that  the  present  civil\r\n\r\nservice  will  always subscribe to  and  carry  out\r\n\r\nthose   duties.  I  do,  in  all  earnestness   and\r\n\r\nsincerity,  appeal  for  the  maintenance  of  this\r\n\r\nprinciple,  that  there should  be  no  attempt  to\r\n\r\nundermine the integrity of the civil service, since\r\n\r\nI feel it would be a sorry day for Singapore if-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Point of order, Sir, I take it\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Secretary considers  that  his  remarks\r\n\r\napply  equally to the civil service  of  the  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  and  that  they should  carry  out  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Party which is entrusted  with  the\r\n\r\nadministration of local government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> If the hon.

Member levelled at officers of  the\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust are completely without foundation\r\n\r\nand  are,  in my opinion, unworthy of a  Member  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the Trust whom the hon. Member has\r\n\r\nchosen to calumniate are men of integrity who  have\r\n\r\nworked   unselfishly  in  the  interests   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation of Singapore. Their technical  skill  is\r\n\r\nof  a  high  order. The buildings which  they  have\r\n\r\nerected will stand as a permanent memorial to them.\r\n\r\nThe  Government thinks so highly of their  services\r\n\r\nthat it is prepared to offer them a full career  in\r\n\r\nthe  new Housing Authority if they are prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  it.  What  I  am  afraid  of  is  that  the\r\n\r\nintemperate attack of the hon. Member may make them\r\n\r\ndoubt  the advisability of doing so. Recent  events\r\n\r\nin  the  City Council must already have given  them\r\n\r\npause  to  think.  It would be a tragedy  if  these\r\n\r\nofficers  were to leave because it would mean  that\r\n\r\nthe   building  activities  of  the   Trust   would\r\n\r\nvirtually cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accuse these officers of corruption, \"grabbing\"\r\n\r\n(whatever  that  may mean), and  self  interest  is\r\n\r\nquite   inexcusable.  To  do  so  under  cover   of\r\n\r\nprivilege is worse. At no time has any evidence  of\r\n\r\ncorruption  or  the like ever been adduced  against\r\n\r\nthese  officers either to the Minister  or  to  the\r\n\r\nCorrupt Practices Bureau. The hon. Member,  who  is\r\n\r\nso free with his general accusations, certainly has\r\n\r\nnever  done  so.  I challenge him  now  to  produce\r\n\r\nevidence to substantiate his accusations. If, as  I\r\n\r\nsuspect, he cannot do so, I call on him to  retract\r\n\r\nat  once  and  offer his apologies to the  officers\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also challenge him to give the name of the\r\n\r\nmember of the Board of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrust  who  stated that the officers of  the  Trust\r\n\r\nwere  capricious  in the movement of  the  boundary\r\n\r\nlines  of planning zones. If he cannot or will  not\r\n\r\ndo  so, I call on him to offer his apologies to the\r\n\r\nBoard of Trustees whom he has involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member's accusations of obstructionism\r\n\r\nare  equally  unjust. I have been a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard of Trustees for considerable periods over the\r\n\r\npast  6  years  and  have  now  a  fairly  intimate\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the  workings  of  the  Trust.   The\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department of the Trust is  an  efficient\r\n\r\nbody    which   has   worked   under   considerable\r\n\r\ndifficulties. Planning during that period has  been\r\n\r\nsubject  to  many  restrictions, principal  amongst\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the preparation of the Master Plan.  But\r\n\r\nthe  officers of the Planning Department have  been\r\n\r\ninvariably  helpful to all who  wished  to  develop\r\n\r\nland  and  have  gone out of their  way  to  assist\r\n\r\narchitects  and  their  clients.  There  have  been\r\n\r\ndelays. These were inevitable when staff was  short\r\n\r\nand  working at full stretch. It will interest hon.\r\n\r\nMembers to learn that in 1956 (the last information\r\n\r\nI  have), the Planning Department dealt with  1,347\r\n\r\napplications. That is no mean achievement.  I  have\r\n\r\nseen   or  heard  no  evidence  of  obstructionism.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,  being busy men and human, the  members\r\n\r\nof  the  department may possibly have  given  short\r\n\r\nshrift   to  humbugs  and  people  who  sought   to\r\n\r\ncircumvent the rules. On the contrary, I have  been\r\n\r\nimpressed by the trouble which the officers of  the\r\n\r\nTrust,  and the Planning Committee, which  consists\r\n\r\nof   the  Chairman  of  the  Rural  Board   and   4\r\n\r\nunofficials, take over applications. Much  time  is\r\n\r\ndevoted to explaining the reasons for decisions  to\r\n\r\napplicants,   their  lawyers  and  architects,   in\r\n\r\ncommittee. No plan is rejected except by the  Board\r\n\r\nof  Trustees  as  a whole. I speak from  experience\r\n\r\nwhen I say that consideration of plans takes up  an\r\n\r\ninordinate  amount of the time of  the  Board.  The\r\n\r\nBoard  consists of a majority of unofficial members\r\n\r\nwho  represent the views of the City  Council,  the\r\n\r\nRural Board and the population as a whole, together\r\n\r\nwith senior officers of the Government and the City\r\n\r\nCouncil. On many occasions I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  heard  the views and feelings  of  applicants\r\n\r\nexpressed   at   Board  meetings  by   unofficials.\r\n\r\nInvariably they have had a fair hearing  and  on  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  occasions the plans have been  referred\r\n\r\nback for further consideration. In short, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department of the Trust works efficiently\r\n\r\nand  fairly  and  without  wilful  obstruction   of\r\n\r\nlegitimate demands. I call upon the hon. Member  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  his  accusations  to  the  Board   of\r\n\r\nTrustees,  or  failing that, to  apologise  to  all\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member made reference to one-room housing\r\n\r\nin  Hongkong and suggested that we follow the  same\r\n\r\nmodel  here, implying that we have taken no  action\r\n\r\nin  this connection. We also have made enquiries in\r\n\r\nHongkong and officers of the Trust have visited the\r\n\r\nschemes there. What the hon. Member failed to  make\r\n\r\nclear  was  that  these  one-room  flats  are   for\r\n\r\nrefugees  from China and were built as a  temporary\r\n\r\nsolution to an extremely urgent problem. They serve\r\n\r\ntheir  purposes very well in Hongkong but they  are\r\n\r\nnot  quite  suitable for Singapore. The  Trust  has\r\n\r\nalready designed a rather better one-room flat with\r\n\r\nkitchen  and  bathroom accommodation  built  in.  A\r\n\r\ntrial  block of these flats will be started in  the\r\n\r\nnear  future and it is hoped will prove successful.\r\n\r\nIf so, more will be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly the hon. Member mentioned the P.W.D. and\r\n\r\nP.W.D. costs.  I am not prepared to  embark  on  a\r\n\r\ndiscussion of P.W.D. costs at this time. The matter\r\n\r\nhas   already   been  explored  by  the   Estimates\r\n\r\nCommittee and doubtless will be explored further. I\r\n\r\nam  however  anxious to do everything  possible  to\r\n\r\nreduce  costs  of  buildings  generally.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember took me to a block of flats recently to show\r\n\r\nme what could be done for prices which he said were\r\n\r\nconsiderably below those of the P.W.D. I am neither\r\n\r\nan  architect  nor  a builder and  have  no  expert\r\n\r\nknowledge of these matters. In the circumstances, I\r\n\r\nam  reluctant to express an opinion. I am even more\r\n\r\nreluctant to use the cover of privilege to  express\r\n\r\nopinions  which  might  be misinterpreted  or  hurt\r\n\r\nfeelings. My views on the design and workmanship of\r\n\r\nthe flats which I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaw,  by comparison with those constructed  by  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D.,  have been conveyed to the Minister  and  I\r\n\r\nshall be prepared to repeat them, if called upon to\r\n\r\ndo so, to the Estimates Committee. I am afraid that\r\n\r\nit  is not a matter of unconditional agreement with\r\n\r\nthe views expressed by the hon. Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter on which I should like to\r\n\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my capacity as Financial Secretary, I am\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  a  certain extent  with  the  credit\r\n\r\nworthiness of Singapore and consequently the credit\r\n\r\nworthiness of the City Council. That is  my  reason\r\n\r\nfor touching on the affairs of the City Council  in\r\n\r\nthis debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council is about to float a loan of $30\r\n\r\nmillion   for  the  further  development   of   its\r\n\r\nelectrical,  gas  and  water  undertakings.  If  it\r\n\r\ncannot  float  this  loan, these undertakings,  and\r\n\r\nconsequently  the  development of  Singapore,  must\r\n\r\nsuffer. It has been promised support by the Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  but  it  also  hopes  to  persuade\r\n\r\nholders of another City Council loan which is about\r\n\r\nto be redeemed, to convert into the new loan and it\r\n\r\nhopes   to   obtain  support  from  other   private\r\n\r\nprovident funds, and possibly from members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the present floatation, the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  will continue to require loan  capital  in\r\n\r\nlarge quantities for some years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council will not obtain the funds it\r\n\r\nrequires  unless  its  policies,  organisation  and\r\n\r\nmethod  of running its business command the respect\r\n\r\nand confidence of the subscribing public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for me to attempt to assess in this\r\n\r\nplace the effect which recent events must have  had\r\n\r\non   this  confidence.  I  merely  ask,  with  such\r\n\r\nsincerity  and  earnestness as I can command,  that\r\n\r\nthe  City Council should bear in mind the  need  to\r\n\r\npromote  confidence in itself in the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\ninvesting  public, - and this includes the  Board  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central Provident Fund - if it wishes to  obtain\r\n\r\nthe  funds  for  the development which  it  rightly\r\n\r\nregards as so important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course\r\n\r\nof this debate, the hon.

Land use and control as envisaged  in\r\n\r\nthe  Master Plan has been scorned and described  as\r\n\r\narbitrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Improvement Trust has been accused\r\n\r\nof obstruction while the integrity of its staff has\r\n\r\nbeen disparaged in the most uncalled for manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation in respect of the new Development\r\n\r\nand  Housing  Authority  has  admittedly  taken   a\r\n\r\nlongish  time,  but that has not prevented  housing\r\n\r\ngoing ahead more rapidly this year. The legislation\r\n\r\nis  in  its final draft stages and will come before\r\n\r\nthis  House  at  an  early sitting - in  about  June.\r\n\r\nEarlier  introduction of this legislation has  been\r\n\r\ncomplicated  by  the  fact  that  since   the   new\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and Housing Authority  will  not  have\r\n\r\nplanning  functions, as in the case of the  present\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement  Trust,  it  has  also  been\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide for the establishment of a new\r\n\r\nPlanning  Authority  to  be charged  with  planning\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.   Two  Bills,   therefore,   will\r\n\r\nshortly be introduced. Basically, however,  it  can\r\n\r\nbe  said  that delay in introducing legislation  or\r\n\r\ncreating  the  new  Authority  has  not  in  itself\r\n\r\nimpeded progress in the provision of housing. Had a\r\n\r\nnew  Authority been created earlier, this would not\r\n\r\nhave  helped the situation which depended basically\r\n\r\non  the resettlement of families before more houses\r\n\r\ncould be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unfortunate single factor impeding the\r\n\r\nrapid  provision of housing so urgently needed  for\r\n\r\nthe  low  income groups of our population has  been\r\n\r\ndue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the fact that almost all the urban and suburban\r\n\r\nsites required for public development have been and\r\n\r\nare  occupied  by families who, if  evicted,  would\r\n\r\nsuffer  great  hardship. As a  consequence,  public\r\n\r\nhousing  and other development has inevitably  been\r\n\r\nslowed  down - and in some cases has come to a  stop.\r\n\r\nIt  was not until the Government established a Land\r\n\r\nand Resettlement Authority to overcome this problem\r\n\r\nby  properly  providing alternative  accommodation,\r\n\r\neither  by  rehousing  or  resettlement,  that  any\r\n\r\nheadway  could be made in the provision  of  houses\r\n\r\nfor the general public. The Resettlement Department\r\n\r\nup to date has:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquired 19 areas for resettlement and allocated\r\n\r\nfarms - altogether   3,870  acres   have   been   so  allotted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed 16 areas of Crown land amounting to several thousand acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapped and designed a further 12 areas amounting to 4,680 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settled 1,235 old families and 1,032 new\r\n\r\nfamilies.  A  further 2,000 vacant  lots  are  now ready for allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In the last year, approximately $1,800,000 was used\r\n\r\nto this end, while a further $2 million is included\r\n\r\nin the Estimates for this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards public housing, only 1,274 housing\r\n\r\nunits  and 70 shops were completed in 1957; whereas\r\n\r\n4,815 housing units were completed in the two years\r\n\r\n1955 and 1956. Now that the Resettlement Department\r\n\r\nis  succeeding in resettling families,  more  rapid\r\n\r\nstrides are being made with low cost housing and at\r\n\r\nthe  present  moment  the situation  is  much  more\r\n\r\nsatisfactory in that a further 4,971 housing  units\r\n\r\nand  127  shops are under construction.  A  further\r\n\r\nbuilding programme - Programme No. 9 - providing for  a\r\n\r\nfurther  3,500 ordinary dwellings, 95 cottages  and\r\n\r\n95  shops  will shortly come before the  House  for\r\n\r\nfinancial approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As may be seen, therefore, despite difficulties,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  succeeded  with  resettlement  and\r\n\r\npublic  housing.  In fixing rents,  Government  has\r\n\r\nalso taken into account the needs of the low income\r\n\r\ngroups  in  order to bring S.I.T. homes within  the\r\n\r\nreach  of  ordinary working families.

The immediate development of 34 acres  to\r\n\r\nprovide  accommodation for 186 families has already\r\n\r\nbegun. The lots have been surveyed and 40 lots have\r\n\r\nbeen  pegged  out. This means that  allocation  can\r\n\r\nproceed  within  a  week  or  so.  A  third   Malay\r\n\r\nsettlement at Ayer Gemuroh is also under  way.  The\r\n\r\npresent Kampong Ayer Gemuroh occupies an area of 21\r\n\r\nacres.

Members\r\n\r\nwill  have  an  opportunity shortly  of  expressing\r\n\r\ntheir  views on the final provisions of the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  when  the planning legislation  comes  before\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Singapore Improvement Trust, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  accusations of delays and obstruction.\r\n\r\nRegarding  planning approval by  the  S.I.T.,  this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation  has also suffered from  shortages  of\r\n\r\nstaff  which in the past may have caused delays  in\r\n\r\nthe consideration of plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> The situation today,\r\n\r\nhowever, is much happier than in the past. There is\r\n\r\nonly  one  plan in the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nwhich was received prior to the 1st of March, 1958.\r\n\r\nEvery other application received before the 1st  of\r\n\r\nMarch,  1958, has been dealt with. On  an  average,\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. receives about 150 plans each month for\r\n\r\nconsideration. Plans are, in fact, now being  dealt\r\n\r\nwith expeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of houses or buildings which\r\n\r\ncan  be  constructed per acre, densities  are  laid\r\n\r\ndown  in the Master Plan and take into account  the\r\n\r\nproper use of land and availability of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  etc, over  the next  20  years.  Clearly\r\n\r\nproper  control to prevent the reversion to  slums,\r\n\r\nto  safeguard against haphazard development and  to\r\n\r\nensure cohesion and use of available services is  a\r\n\r\nfundamental necessity. The provisions of the Master\r\n\r\nPlan were made public in 1956 and objectors had  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  stating  their  views,   including\r\n\r\nquestions of density.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusations of corruption in the S.I.T. are\r\n\r\nmore  serious.  The  hon.  Member  who  made  these\r\n\r\naccusations also referred to two specific instances\r\n\r\nof   which   he  described  as  futile  delays   or\r\n\r\nobstruction. His disappointment in matters in which\r\n\r\nhe  was personally concerned can be understood, but\r\n\r\nan  attack on the integrity, of the S.I.T. on  such\r\n\r\ngrounds is unwarranted-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> That is the police evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In  one  case  a\r\n\r\nplanned  roundabout required a building to  be  set\r\n\r\nback - this  was  in the interest of better  highways\r\n\r\nand  traffic  flow, in the other case,  an  ancient\r\n\r\nmonument  had first to be dispensed with  owing  to\r\n\r\nits   dilapidated  state  of  repair   before   new\r\n\r\ndevelopment could proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards corruption, general accusations without\r\n\r\nsubstance  are  not good enough.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLocal Government has not received a single specific\r\n\r\nallegation from the hon. Member concerned. It would\r\n\r\nbe relevant to enquire if he has placed his special\r\n\r\nknowledge at the disposal of the Commission dealing\r\n\r\nwith  corruption  or the Corrupt Practices  Bureau.\r\n\r\nUntil  proof of any general or specific  corruption\r\n\r\nhas   been   established,  his  accusations   stand\r\n\r\nrefuted.    Certainly   disappointment    or    the\r\n\r\ndisapproval of development projects which  are  not\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of Singapore does not  constitute\r\n\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The  \"ism\" in which I believe is \"realism\".\r\n\r\nFor  the  last  61  years, Sir,  I  have  lived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In the old days, we had no Party leaders\r\n\r\nbut  what  we  had  were community  leaders.  These\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders,  when they assembled  together,\r\n\r\nhad  a  sense of believing and trusting each  other\r\n\r\nfor  the  welfare  of the country and  the  people.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  are  being given the chance  of  having\r\n\r\nParty  leaders  and  when  we  gather  under   such\r\n\r\nleadership,  we do not have the sense of  believing\r\n\r\nand trusting each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the criticisms which have been thrown\r\n\r\nat my Ministry with which I am concerned, they have\r\n\r\nbeen  fully answered by my Minister.

It is apparent  to  the\r\n\r\nsmallest  child  that  these  promises  cannot   be\r\n\r\ncarried out in so short a time that is left for the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  heard  on  Tuesday  the   P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\narrogant   boast   that  they  will   capture   the\r\n\r\nGovernment during the next general elections. I for\r\n\r\none  do not believe that Government will fall  into\r\n\r\nthe  hands of the P.A.P. So far, they have  managed\r\n\r\nto  fool a section of the people. They have  misled\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and the students by shouting  slogans\r\n\r\nlike,  \"Down with colonialism!\" Today, in the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the workers have awakened to  the  truth.\r\n\r\nThey  find that the P.A.P. can be more hard-hearted\r\n\r\ntask  masters  than the colonial officials.  Today,\r\n\r\nthe  workers  have found the truth.  Tomorrow,  the\r\n\r\nstudents will see the light. They now know what the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. really stands for - a Left-wing  organisation\r\n\r\ndedicated  to  the destruction of our Island  Home.\r\n\r\nThe  leaders of the P.A.P. have proved in times  of\r\n\r\ncrisis  to  be shiftless whenever there was  action\r\n\r\ntaken  against the extremist elements in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWhere  were  the Right-wing leaders of the  P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nSir,  I  regret to note that the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) is not here to hear what I\r\n\r\nhave  to  say,  as I have the facts that  even  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar at the time of crisis  was\r\n\r\nhaving  his golf vacation in the Cameron Highlands,\r\n\r\nfar away from the place of disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, the P.A.P. has fooled many  people\r\n\r\nin the past; they cannot fool them any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I said that I would speak on the\r\n\r\nincidence  of  crime.  During  `Operation  Dagger',\r\n\r\nhundreds of people have been arrested just  because\r\n\r\nthey  have tattoo marks on their bodies. That  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  to show that they are members of  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties.  I am not protecting members  of  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties. Despite these arrests, even the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief   Secretary   (Mr  E.  B.  David)   admitted\r\n\r\nyesterday in this House that crimes have increased.\r\n\r\nNow  the police would be the first to admit that  a\r\n\r\ntattoo mark does not necessarily mean membership of\r\n\r\na  secret  society. Many innocent people have  been\r\n\r\nput  in  fear  just because of `Operation  Dagger'.\r\n\r\nMany   in  their  ignorance  have  suffered  untold\r\n\r\nhardships by disfiguring themselves just to  remove\r\n\r\nthe  tattoo marks from their bodies and a few  have\r\n\r\ndied  after applying acid on these marks. This  has\r\n\r\nshown clearly that the police have been barking  up\r\n\r\nthe wrong tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I would like to read\r\n\r\nfrom column 10 of the Governor's Speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government pledges itself anew to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the people of Singapore,  to  raise\r\n\r\ntheir  level of living and to use this last Session\r\n\r\ntowards achieving these ends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  can Government tell us how it will carry  out\r\n\r\nthis  pledge? Will it proscribe the P.A.P. who have\r\n\r\nsaddled the people of Singapore with the threat  of\r\n\r\nstrikes  in  the City Council? Will the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthese  extremist  elements  be  sent  to  join  the\r\n\r\nbackseat-drivers of the People's  Action  Party  in\r\n\r\njail?

Let  Government\r\n\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also deeply shocked at the speech made by the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary (Mr T. M.

Several hours have  been\r\n\r\nabsorbed  by  a number of speeches. What  have  you\r\n\r\nheard,  Sir?  A  lot of time was  taken  in  chest-thumping and trumpet-blowing for his Party  by  the\r\n\r\nleader  of  the P.A.P. - the reason I  suppose  is\r\n\r\nthat  he  has no one else here to blow his  Party's\r\n\r\ntrumpet-the  usual  tirade and dismal  warnings  of\r\n\r\ndestruction   and  doom  for  the   Parties   which\r\n\r\nconstitute  the Government. One would have  thought\r\n\r\nhe  was  addressing the hundreds of eager listeners\r\n\r\ngathered  from those who flock to the City  Council\r\n\r\ngalleries.  The  Government for which  he  predicts\r\n\r\ndoom  has steered courageously - with the welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  its  teeming population  always  at\r\n\r\nheart - through  troubled seas. The passage  is  like\r\n\r\ncrossing the English Channel.

Bouquets though  sparing\r\n\r\nhave  been  handed  to us by some  Members  on  the\r\n\r\nopposite   side.   An   hon.  Member,   though   an\r\n\r\nexpatriate,  who by his very profession  and  daily\r\n\r\nexperience,  knows  and  feels  the  pulse  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  economic  world,  has  offered   his\r\n\r\ncommendations - and   a  Member   of   the   Liberal-Socialists  in  all  honesty  has  said   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, \"Give credit where credit is due.\"  But\r\n\r\nhe was immediately contradicted by his Party Member\r\n\r\n(the  Member  for Telok Ayer) - of course,  any  mud-slinging  from  this hon. Member is understandable.\r\n\r\nHe  says  that the Government has achieved  nothing\r\n\r\nbut  when  faced with realities of the Government's\r\n\r\ngood work he grudgingly glosses them over with  the\r\n\r\ntrite phrase that we are paid to do our duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking of the Governor's reference to the\r\n\r\ninevitable merger with the Federation of Malaya, he\r\n\r\nsays  that he is tired of its repetition. I  wonder\r\n\r\nif  the hon. Member realises how tired every one in\r\n\r\nthis House is of listening to his reiterations that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is composed of an elected minority,\r\n\r\nand how flat that sounds today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the Member for Telok Ayer\r\n\r\ninferred  that  in the field of health,  Government\r\n\r\nhas achieved nothing. Surely he is not blind to the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Government has been  able  to  add\r\n\r\nnearly 2,000 beds in its term of office and, by way\r\n\r\nof  comparison, may I remind him that from 1946  to\r\n\r\nthe  end of 1954 at a time when I think he  sat  in\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Council only 340 beds were added by\r\n\r\nthe previous Government?

I  could enumerate a number  of  other\r\n\r\nrapid advances in the Health Ministry: the addition\r\n\r\nof  mobile dispensaries, floating dispensaries  for\r\n\r\nthe  islanders, and so forth, in keeping  with  our\r\n\r\npromise to bring the health services to the people.\r\n\r\nAlso,  during our term of office, we have  won  the\r\n\r\ncoveted  Kettering Shield awarded to a Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountry  which gives the best infant service.  But,\r\n\r\nof  course, to the Member for Telok Ayer,  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each elected Member on the Government Front\r\n\r\nBenches  and those Back Benchers who will face  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  in  the  next  elections  can   do   so\r\n\r\nfearlessly, and with pride and satisfaction in  our achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  in moving this Address to His  Excellency\r\n\r\nremarked   that   constitutional  developments   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  were a challenge to the people  to  make\r\n\r\ndemocracy work and if democracy is going to work in\r\n\r\nSingapore  we  shall  need  a  higher  standard  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  leadership than the Opposition  has  so\r\n\r\nfar  been able to produce - at least in this  debate.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been a saddening experience for the lovers\r\n\r\nof  democracy to listen to the extraordinary  hotch\r\n\r\npotch, the  sayoh rampai or chup-chye dishes  they\r\n\r\nhave served of confused and muddled scraps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence by and large in the\r\n\r\nOpposition  of  any attempt to do any  work  before\r\n\r\nthis sitting, or even to know the facts.

I  might even suggest that  where  we\r\n\r\ncould   have  been  attacked,  we  have  not   been\r\n\r\nattacked. Probably they have not taken the  trouble\r\n\r\nto look for the suitable points of attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy is not an easy form of government, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker - but the hardest form. In  order  to\r\n\r\nsucceed in democracy, you must have at least  three\r\n\r\nessentials  and  one is a fairly high  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving. We have got that in Singapore. Then we must\r\n\r\nhave  an  efficient civil service to  transmit  the\r\n\r\npolitical    decisions   into    the    field    of\r\n\r\nadministration, and thank God we have an  efficient\r\n\r\ncivil  service in Singapore. The third  requirement\r\n\r\nis  the very highest qualities of character in  the\r\n\r\npeople and in their leaders because democracy means\r\n\r\nthat  you  have got to accept unpleasant facts  and\r\n\r\ndeal  with  them and vote if necessary  for  higher\r\n\r\ntaxes on your own income and that is what people do\r\n\r\nnot like to do. These three essential bases we have\r\n\r\ngot  in  Singapore  but we by no  means  have  them\r\n\r\npermanently  and certainly they could  be  lost.  I\r\n\r\nshall  be  saying  a word about the  civil  service\r\n\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already had a number of words about our\r\n\r\nnational  wealth  and how it is exposed  to  forces\r\n\r\noutside  which cannot be controlled and we need  in\r\n\r\nour  leaders - if  we  are going to  have  democratic\r\n\r\nleaders - a  capacity  for  hard  work,  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and commonsense which have not  been\r\n\r\neasily  found  in  many of the  speeches  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a number of speeches about the City\r\n\r\nCouncil and the suggestion from one Member that the\r\n\r\nCity  Council is in danger because the P.A.P. were\r\n\r\nin control. The fact is of course that the PAP, are\r\n\r\nnot  in control of the City Council. Nobody  is  in\r\n\r\ncontrol; that is where the danger lies. There is no\r\n\r\nParty  which  is able to run the City Council.  All\r\n\r\ncan have a veto but none can have a policy and that\r\n\r\nis a very dangerous situation indeed. If it came to\r\n\r\nbe so in this Assembly after the next elections, it\r\n\r\nwould  mean  disaster for Singapore. Any particular\r\n\r\nParty may have wrong policies and do great harm but\r\n\r\nit is better to have even a Party with bad policies\r\n\r\nruling the country than to have no rule at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall.  The  tragic breakdown of democracy which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  taking  place progressively in  France  is  a\r\n\r\nclear  indication of the danger that we  too  could\r\n\r\nrun  into  here  if  we cannot  get  our  political\r\n\r\nsituation  put  into order. I  do  not  regard  the\r\n\r\nevents   in  the  City  Council  myself   as   very\r\n\r\nsignificant  or menacing. Somebody said  in  horror\r\n\r\nhow  two City Councillors leaving were actually  in\r\n\r\ndanger from the excited crowd of people outside and\r\n\r\nhad  to be escorted out to their cars, as if it was\r\n\r\na new thing; but it is not a new thing. It happened\r\n\r\nin  the  old City Council. I think it was over  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the delimitation of taxis when a couple\r\n\r\nof City Councillors had to be escorted out to their\r\n\r\ncars because there was a small crowd outside making\r\n\r\nhostile gestures at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  have  done a  great  deal  of  free\r\n\r\nadvertising  for the P.A.P. in the course  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate.  The  debate has turned  far  more  on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. than  on any other subject, as  though  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was the big bad wolf coming to eat them  all\r\n\r\nup.  I  do not think that the P.A.P. is a  big  bad\r\n\r\nwolf and I do not think that it is going to eat  us\r\n\r\nall  up  either. It is not my job to give publicity\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P. They are just a Party like any other\r\n\r\nParty.  If  they succeed, it is because  they  work\r\n\r\nhard  and maintain unity. If they fail, it will  be\r\n\r\nbecause they have stopped working hard and  do  not\r\n\r\nmaintain unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just take one point from the P.A.P. leader (the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar). He made one remark  that\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Mr Sutherland had praised  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  that  this  praise  was  the  most\r\n\r\ndamning thing that could be given to the Government\r\n\r\nbecause  it came from a banker. I do not  agree  at\r\n\r\nall.  Any  Government in Singapore which wishes  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  its  task must hope  for  the  general\r\n\r\napprobation  and  confidence  of  the  banking  and\r\n\r\ntrading houses. I have here an interesting magazine\r\n\r\ncalled Far East Trade. If the P.A.P. Members  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  borrow it from me, they can see that  the\r\n\r\nworld  of  commerce and finance looks at  Communist\r\n\r\nChina  from a purely practical point of view.  They\r\n\r\nexpress no views as to the moral value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Communist form of government but they  are\r\n\r\ncertainly not intimidated because the government is\r\n\r\nCommunist. They consider it purely from  the  point\r\n\r\nof  view  of whether they can effectively do  trade\r\n\r\nwith  China  and that is the sort of Government  we\r\n\r\nwant in Singapore. It is when people look at us and\r\n\r\nsay, \"Singapore is the place through which and with\r\n\r\nwhich we can trade with confidence,\" that our trade\r\n\r\nwill  grow prosperously and that there will not  be\r\n\r\nsome  ridiculous  breakdown  which  will  stop   us\r\n\r\ntrading and increasing our profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate has gone on for a considerable time,\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, but I must deal with one or two\r\n\r\nmatters.  I  am  the  acting  Minister  for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment, Lands and Housing. There have been some\r\n\r\nattacks  on  the S.I.T. which have been dealt  with\r\n\r\nalready but I feel that I shall be shirking my duty\r\n\r\nif  I  did not reply to them in my own way as well.\r\n\r\nWe heard suggestions of things being wrong with the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. which  were based on misinformation - failure\r\n\r\nto find out what the current facts are - and my hon.\r\n\r\ncolleague   the   Assistant  Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands  and  Housing  (Mr  Tan   Theng\r\n\r\nChiang)  gave facts. Although there may  have  been\r\n\r\ndelays  in 1950, 1954 or 1956, the state  today  is\r\n\r\nthat not one plan has been with the S.I.T. for more\r\n\r\nthan  seven  weeks,  that  is  to  say,  since  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of March. All other plans have been dealt\r\n\r\nwith.  That  is the fact but hon. Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are  not prepared to deal with  the  current\r\n\r\nfacts. They prefer to go back far into history  and\r\n\r\nthus  create confusion and waste the time of  other\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) went\r\n\r\nso  far  as  to call for a Commission  of  Inquiry.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr Deputy Speaker, here is the Report of the\r\n\r\nInquiry  Commission into Allegations of  Corruption\r\n\r\nagainst Members of the Legislative Assembly  or  of\r\n\r\nthe Public Service, or against Members or Employees\r\n\r\nof  the  City Council or other Statutory Bodies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  together  with  a  Statement   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It  was  appointed  in   April   last\r\n\r\nyear - just a year ago - and the report has been in his\r\n\r\nhands  now for some little time. I do not find  his\r\n\r\nname amongst those who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngave   evidence  to  that  Commission  of   Inquiry\r\n\r\nalthough presumably he had the facts then.  He  has\r\n\r\nnot  just  learned them but he sat  back  thinking,\r\n\r\n\"Let this Commission pursue its course and find  no\r\n\r\ntruth  in  the allegations. I will ask for  another\r\n\r\nCommission  as  soon  as this  one  has  reported,\"\r\n\r\nunless  indeed I am wronging him and he is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  anonymous people who appeared under the  tides\r\n\r\nof  \"People  suffered the high  rates  of  interest\r\n\r\npreyed by Pawnbrokers of Singapore\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Not like you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> -or \"An Umpire of Justice\" or \"There\r\n\r\nis  no  smoke  without a fire\". In  any  case,  his\r\n\r\nevidence was not identifiable if he gave it and was\r\n\r\ndismissed by the Commissioner as being worthless if\r\n\r\nhe did give it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam)\r\n\r\nled  the attack on the S.I.T. The Member for Changi\r\n\r\n(Mr Lim Cher Kheng) I think joined in as well  and\r\n\r\nhe also attacked the C.I.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sure, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Now, when a member of the public,\r\n\r\nparticularly  an  elected  representative  of   the\r\n\r\npeople,  has  reason to believe that  something  is\r\n\r\nwrong  with  some  statutory  body  or  with   some\r\n\r\nGovernment   department,  he  has   a   clear   and\r\n\r\nunquestioned  duty to bring his suspicions  to  the\r\n\r\nnotice of those who are responsible for cleaning up\r\n\r\nwhatever  is wrong. He is not required  to  produce\r\n\r\nproof  which could go into a court of  law.  He  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  say, \"I have good reason  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  so and I think that  it  should  be\r\n\r\nlooked   into.\"   People   have   sometimes    made\r\n\r\nallegations  about the Public Works  Department  or\r\n\r\nother departments to me.

In the Ministry of Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing, no allegations have been  made\r\n\r\nwhatsoever by the Member for Pasir Panjang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> They are not on record if they have\r\n\r\nbeen made but if, however, he will make them giving\r\n\r\nsome  reasonable guide as to who did what, to whom,\r\n\r\nwhen  and where, then they can be examined. In  the\r\n\r\nChua  Commission which was the proper body  sitting\r\n\r\nfor  a  year, his name does not appear amongst  the\r\n\r\nwitnesses nor indeed is the S.I.T. mentioned as far\r\n\r\nas  I  recollect  by anybody at all.  Despite  this\r\n\r\nwidespread suspicion alleged against it, no  member\r\n\r\nof the public appears to have alleged against it at\r\n\r\nall   in  spite  of  the  publicity  given  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioners in an endeavour to get people to come\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have these hon. Members made their reports to the\r\n\r\nCorrupt    Practices   Investigation   Bureau    in\r\n\r\nconfidence and secrecy, hiding themselves  so  that\r\n\r\nthey need not get into trouble? Well, if they have,\r\n\r\nthey  can  say  so. Have they informed  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor?  Apparently not. In  other  words  they\r\n\r\nhave conducted themselves in the way that the Elias\r\n\r\nCommission remarked:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is unfortunate that neither the Police nor the\r\n\r\nCorrupt   Practices   Investigation   Bureau   were\r\n\r\nafforded  the opportunity of investigating  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  the  rumours said to have been  prevalent  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt  and  illegal  practices  during  the  Bye-Elections. The result was that the rumours remained\r\n\r\nrumours, without   the   searching   light    of\r\n\r\ninvestigation  being focussed  on  them,  and  they\r\n\r\nsurvived  and  were  repeated  in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly, and were repeated to us. We have inquired\r\n\r\ninto them, but in seeking the origin of the rumours\r\n\r\nwe  were  met on several occasions with  the  reply\r\n\r\nthat  the rumour had been recounted to the  witness\r\n\r\nby  a  stranger, or had been casually overheard  by\r\n\r\nthe witness being discussed between strangers in  a\r\n\r\nbus or other public place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  the time of this House has been taken up  with\r\n\r\nallegations on that level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations were also made against the P.W.D. that\r\n\r\nthere  was  corruption there. Almost my first  task\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was made Minister and reluctantly took  my\r\n\r\nseat  in the ministerial chair was to study a  file\r\n\r\ndealing  with what appeared to be corrupt practices\r\n\r\ninvolving an officer of the P.W.D. and a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  present elected Assembly. I went into that  as\r\n\r\nfully as I could and spent a great deal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  time  on  it. In the end, it was impossible  to\r\n\r\nbring  anything more than a cloud of suspicion.  It\r\n\r\nwas not possible to go any further - no smoke without\r\n\r\na  fire  perhaps but not enough to  take  any  firm\r\n\r\naction  on. The officer concerned has now left  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D.  The  Assemblyman is still sitting  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Without reliable support in the  way  of\r\n\r\nevidence, it is not proper that allegations  should\r\n\r\nbe  made  public  and people's names  brought  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute.   General   allegations   without   some\r\n\r\nindication  of  who  did what, when  and  why  mean\r\n\r\neither  that  the accuser himself is  involved  and\r\n\r\ntherefore dare not be specific because he  will  be\r\n\r\nimplicating himself; or else they mean that  he  is\r\n\r\ntalking nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by no means impossible, in my opinion, that\r\n\r\nthere  are  or  have been in the P.W.D. or  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nofficers whose conduct has not been above reproach.\r\n\r\nIt   may  well  be  so  in  any  country,  in   any\r\n\r\ndepartment, that somebody gets in who should not be\r\n\r\nthere. When he is found out, out he goes. But vague\r\n\r\ngeneral  overall attacks of this sort do  not  hurt\r\n\r\nthe  wrongdoers. What they do hurt is  the  general\r\n\r\npublic  service. They dangerously damage  the  good\r\n\r\nand honest officers and they camouflage and conceal\r\n\r\nany  criminals  there  may be  because  by  casting\r\n\r\nsuspicion  on  everybody, they completely  fail  to\r\n\r\nspotlight  and  isolate  anybody  who  actually  is\r\n\r\nwrong;  and the criminal can sit back and laugh  to\r\n\r\nhimself and say, \"Ha, ha, that pure man on the next\r\n\r\ndesk is now being accused. Maybe, they cannot catch\r\n\r\nme.\"  Attacks  of  this sort do serious  damage  to\r\n\r\nmorale  and in every way tend to encourage and  not\r\n\r\nto discourage corrupt practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to another allegation which I think I must\r\n\r\nrefute.  \"The P.W.D. buildings were incredibly  (or\r\n\r\nunbelievably or unimaginably) expensive.\" This  was\r\n\r\nan  allegation which has been made in this Assembly\r\n\r\nfrequently  and I think it was at the end  of  1956\r\n\r\nthat I pressed again and again in this Assembly  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Let  us have this taken up in the  Estimates\r\n\r\nCommittee.

They had on it the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh  Chew  Chua)\r\n\r\namongst   others   who  himself  was   formerly   a\r\n\r\ncontractor  and  should be in a position  to  know.\r\n\r\nThey  had  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon\r\n\r\nTeck)  who is well-versed in building problems  and\r\n\r\nwho  is  himself working on very large  development\r\n\r\nprojects. The Estimates Committee on page 3 of  its\r\n\r\nReport found that further study should be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  matter but that as far as they could see,  the\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of the P.W.D. buildings was not  solely\r\n\r\ndue  to  higher standards but might be due  to  the\r\n\r\nfact   that   there  was  a  restricted   list   of\r\n\r\ncontractors; and they found nothing else.  On  page\r\n\r\n33,  one  hon.  Member  tried  to  compare  popular\r\n\r\nbuildings - one-storeyed houses - sold for $30,000 each\r\n\r\nincluding  land, sanitation, roads  and  everything\r\n\r\ncomplete  and he said, \"How does that compare  with\r\n\r\n$38,000 for a government bungalow?\" And the  answer\r\n\r\nhe  got from the Director of Public Works was  that\r\n\r\nthe  houses  he was praising were extremely  poorly\r\n\r\nbuilt, \"flashy\" but badly finished inside and would\r\n\r\nnot  last  more than a few years before  they  gave\r\n\r\ntrouble. There was a proposal that we should go and\r\n\r\ncompare  buildings  erected by the  P.W.D. and  by\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise and I went to have a look  at  a\r\n\r\nblock  of  flats  built by private  enterprise  and\r\n\r\nanother one built by the P.W.D. There did not  seem\r\n\r\nvery much to choose between them. The one built  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D. had for its contractor a Member of this\r\n\r\nAssembly and unfortunately the standard of his work\r\n\r\nwas  not very good. There was endless trouble  with\r\n\r\nit.  Probably, he would have had the contract taken\r\n\r\naway  from him except that there was great pressure\r\n\r\nat   that  time  on  the  P.W.D. to  complete  the\r\n\r\nbuildings in order to get people out of hotels-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of order.

In any case, these arguments\r\n\r\nabout  whether  the  P.W.D. flats  are  a  bit  too\r\n\r\nexpensive are all relatively minor matters  because\r\n\r\nthe  main work of the P.W.D. is not building flats.\r\n\r\nThat  is the S.I.T.'s job. The main bulk of  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nbuilding is in quite other types - schools and large\r\n\r\nbuildings  of that sort. This attack on the  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nconcluded with a challenge to a debate in public on\r\n\r\nthe question of P.W.D. costs. I do not know how you\r\n\r\ncan  debate  in public on P.W.D. costs  because  it\r\n\r\nwould not be a matter of debate; it is a matter  of\r\n\r\ngetting  the plans and the bills of quantities  and\r\n\r\ngetting them all down and comparing the comparative\r\n\r\ncosts  and  all the practical details of  surveying\r\n\r\nwhat  actually went into the building and what  you\r\n\r\ngot for your money. It could not be debated. It  is\r\n\r\na   matter  of  arithmetic  and  calculation.   The\r\n\r\nEstimates  Committee is the place where that  could\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Private developers have  done  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of work in Singapore and it is very essential\r\n\r\nthat there should be ample private development  but\r\n\r\nthere is some ground for thinking that a good  deal\r\n\r\nof  private  development is of an  undesirably  low\r\n\r\nstandard.  The  report which I had made  and  which\r\n\r\ncost $8,000 is not a report on public buildings. It\r\n\r\nis  a  report on the standards at present or  which\r\n\r\nare  likely  to  appear in the  future  in  private\r\n\r\nbuilding  and whether anything should  be  done  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the standards are maintained;  and  if\r\n\r\nsomething should be done, what should be done. That\r\n\r\nis  the  nature of the report which I have got  and\r\n\r\nthe suggestion that I was wasting $8,000 on getting\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D. to  report  on  itself  is  of  course meaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, before I reply to the\r\n\r\nvarious points raised by the Opposition, may I move\r\n\r\na motion under Standing Order 7 (11),\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items of\r\n\r\nbusiness set down for this day be exempted from the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon\r\n\r\nMong)  while touching on this challenged the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) to table such\r\n\r\na  motion.

I warned the Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - and in their heart of hearts they  believe\r\n\r\nit  is  true - and yet they played party politics  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. I told them, \"Please, hon.  Members\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly, do realise that the fight  ahead\r\n\r\nof  us is a very stiff fight. It is not a fight  of\r\n\r\nthe   Parties  represented  in  this  Assembly   at\r\n\r\npresent. It is a fight of democratic forces against\r\n\r\nCommunist forces in Singapore. Are we to be foolish\r\n\r\nenough  to  play  party  politics  and  allow   the\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  happiness  of  the  people  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry to be jeopardised?\" I appeal to them, \"When\r\n\r\nwe  go  forward  to the general elections,  let  us\r\n\r\nfight   hard,  but  fight  wisely,  otherwise   the\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements with their new fronts - the  old\r\n\r\nfronts  having  been denied to them  by  Government\r\n\r\naction - will do all they can to capture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  prize or the fruit that we have all worked  so\r\n\r\nhard  to  achieve.\" Quarrel among ourselves  if  we\r\n\r\nlike - that  is democracy - but in the big  thing  that\r\n\r\nlies ahead of us never forget that we face the same\r\n\r\ndanger. The security of this new State of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat is to come into being is in jeopardy if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  wake up in time to meet the threat that is  at\r\n\r\npresent mustering all their resources to throw  all\r\n\r\ntheir forces into the general elections. But I  say\r\n\r\nthis  (I have been asked to name a date although  I\r\n\r\nneed  not  have  to name a date) - the  date  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections will be dependent  on  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is satisfied that subversive forces  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to capture the Government  of  the  new\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore, but we will not go beyond  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution. I say, \"Blame me as  much  as\r\n\r\nyou  want but who am I when I have the security and\r\n\r\nthe  happiness of the people of Singapore at stake?\r\n\r\nThey are greater than this Government here which is\r\n\r\nnot  more concerned with being returned at the next\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections.\" We would be happy to surrender\r\n\r\nthis   Government   to  any  democratic   form   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  if they will meet this threat  strongly\r\n\r\nand boldly and not dilly-dally. Sometimes, they are\r\n\r\ncomrades and sometimes they are not comrades. We do\r\n\r\nnot  like that, Sir. Come out boldly on your  stand\r\n\r\nand say, \"We are for this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from the Member for Tanjong Pagar that\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition is a sinking ship. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know; I have not seen any water leaking in yet.\r\n\r\nThen   he   tries  to  teach  us,   to   teach   me\r\n\r\nparticularly, Sir, who have been working  hard  for\r\n\r\nthe good of the people of Singapore since 1948, how\r\n\r\nto suck eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he touched on the fire victims, \"Ha,\r\n\r\nlet  us appeal to the masses. Let us capture  their\r\n\r\nimagination.  Let  us exploit, shall  we  say,  the\r\n\r\nsufferings  of  the  people.  Let  us   make   this\r\n\r\nsuffering  the  basis  of a  grand  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nmasses.\"  He  said, \"We the P.A.P. do this  and  do\r\n\r\nthat.

Sir, in this Assembly as Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare,  I  say  that  all  political\r\n\r\nParties and all sections of the people in times of,\r\n\r\nshall  we say, emergency and distress of this kind,\r\n\r\nshould  rise  above  party  politics  and  help  to\r\n\r\nameliorate  the sufferings of the poor. The  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore rose to the occasion and  donated  so\r\n\r\nmuch  money,  clothing and goods, and  as  much  of\r\n\r\nother things. They did all these things not because\r\n\r\nof  the antics in the City Hall, but because  today\r\n\r\nthey are the citizens of Singapore and they realise\r\n\r\nit.  It  is their responsibility to ameliorate  the\r\n\r\nsufferings of their fellow-citizens not because  of\r\n\r\nwhat  one Party said or what another Party  did.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that even the Workers  Party  tried  to\r\n\r\ncash in on the sufferings by selling sweets outside\r\n\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, the Member for Tanjong Pagar is fond of\r\n\r\nissuing threats - wonderful! \"You want to fight, come\r\n\r\non.  I am not afraid of you. If you do not do this,\r\n\r\nwatch out!\" Sir, we on this side of the House  have\r\n\r\nbeen doing all we can quietly - without show, without\r\n\r\nwanting  to  seek publicity and without  having  to\r\n\r\nissue,  shall we say, a press release almost  every\r\n\r\nday. We do it quietly. We regain the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. We regain the confidence\r\n\r\nof the people outside Singapore and yet just by one\r\n\r\nsilly  utterance of a politician in this  Assembly,\r\n\r\neverything    is   damaged.

I met them last Saturday and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the discussion I told them  that  since\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  compulsory voting, we will  introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation. The Government has not yet decided  on\r\n\r\nthis,  but  the Labour Front part of the  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment is committed to introducing legislation.\r\n\r\nOur  coalition partners, the U.M.N.O., are  against\r\n\r\nit, and I respect their views. This is a matter  in\r\n\r\nwhich we should allow all sections of opinion, even\r\n\r\namong  Ministerial colleagues, to voice. I did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to touch on this subject, because the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Changi has a motion on the Order Paper, but  it\r\n\r\nis  clear  from the report in last Sunday's  papers\r\n\r\nthat  the  Labour  Front  has  been  committed   to\r\n\r\nacceding   to   the  wishes  of  the  organisations\r\n\r\nconcerned. We are not using anything as  an  excuse\r\n\r\nto  delay  the elections. We pointed  out  that  if\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting has to be introduced, it will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to have a few months more in  which  the\r\n\r\nelectorate can be educated. Compulsory voting, they\r\n\r\nsay, would be a good thing because we will then  be\r\n\r\nable  to  put  an  end  to so many  allegations  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt practice at election\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime.  The  Report  of  the  Elms  Commission  also\r\n\r\nsupports  compulsory voting and has  given  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy it should be introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party and the Liberal-Socialist Party have said that they will see to it\r\n\r\nthat   the  draft  constitution  will  not  contain\r\n\r\nanything  other than what has been  agreed  in  the\r\n\r\nreport. Surely they need not have to suggest  that.\r\n\r\nWe  went to London as an All-Party delegation.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not and do not  propose  to  claim\r\n\r\ncredit for having brought back the constitution. We\r\n\r\nsaid it was an All-Party effort, and because it was\r\n\r\nan All-Party effort, it is stated in the Governor's\r\n\r\nSpeech  that the draft constitution will be settled\r\n\r\nby the same delegation. There is no sinister motive\r\n\r\nin  bringing the delegation to London. Some  people\r\n\r\nhave  alleged that we are going there for something\r\n\r\nelse!  In a way, of course, I can understand  their\r\n\r\nqualms,  especially as they have not  yet  received\r\n\r\ncopies  of  the  draft  constitution.  I  have  not\r\n\r\nreceived  it  too,  but I have  been  assured  that\r\n\r\ncopies will reach us at the end of this month,  and\r\n\r\nas  soon  as  copies  are received,  they  will  be\r\n\r\ndespatched   to   the  members  of  the   All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer said he wanted early\r\n\r\nelections.  I  say this to him: if he really  wants\r\n\r\nearly elections, and as it is already in the Report\r\n\r\nof  the Constitutional Conference in London, he can\r\n\r\ntable a motion. No one is going to prevent him from\r\n\r\ndoing  it.  He  can table it and  achieve  what  he\r\n\r\nwants, instead of harping at every sitting that  we\r\n\r\nare a minority Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we have a number of motions on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper  to be settled today, I do not think I should\r\n\r\ntake  up  some  more time of hon.  Members  on  the\r\n\r\npolitical  speeches of Members of  the  Opposition,\r\n\r\nbut  I  would like to say this once again:  Let  us\r\n\r\nwake  up to the facts. Unless we work hard and work\r\n\r\nwell,  the people of Singapore are going to  suffer\r\n\r\nif subversive elements capture the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an Address be sent to His Excellency the\r\n\r\nGovernor expressing the thanks of this Assembly for\r\n\r\nhis  speech delivered on Wednesday, 9th  of  April, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 5 of 1958)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.

The Executive Service shall  be\r\n\r\nintermediate  in status between the  Administrative\r\n\r\nand  the Professional Services on the one hand  and\r\n\r\nthe  Clerical  and  lower services  on  the  other.\r\n\r\nMembers    of    the    service   will    undertake\r\n\r\nresponsibility for day-to-day execution of  routine\r\n\r\nmatters over a wide range of subjects. Their duties\r\n\r\nwill  include  inspection work, the enforcement  of\r\n\r\nlaws, the issue of licences and other documents  in\r\n\r\nconformity with regulations, and many other matters\r\n\r\nwhere  policy is clearly established. As a  result,\r\n\r\nhigher  graded officers should be freer to consider\r\n\r\nmatters  of  more  than  ordinary  difficulty,  and\r\n\r\nquestions of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schemes of service have been agreed with the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the Staff Side  and  have  been\r\n\r\nrecommended  for  approval by  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.  These schemes provide that  candidates\r\n\r\nwith  a  Higher  School Certificate  or  equivalent\r\n\r\nqualification will be eligible for admission to the\r\n\r\nservice.  For  the  first  three  years  after  its\r\n\r\nintroduction,  special provision is  made  for  the\r\n\r\nentry  of  serving officers and the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission has already advised the selection of 250\r\n\r\nof these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey has been made of the administrative,\r\n\r\nexecutive and clerical work of each department  and\r\n\r\nan establishment of posts for the Executive Service\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen drawn up. This is shown in Schedule A attached\r\n\r\nto  the  Sessional  Paper. In  this  connection  it\r\n\r\nshould be noted that there has been no increase  in\r\n\r\nthe total number of posts in the establishment as a\r\n\r\nresult of the creation of the Executive Service. It\r\n\r\nis  purely  a  matter of conversion.  331  existing\r\n\r\nposts  will  be  converted into 8 Senior  Executive\r\n\r\nOfficer  posts, 89 Higher Executive  Officer  posts\r\n\r\nand 234 Executive Officer posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to estimate exactly the cost of\r\n\r\nimplementing this scheme from the 1st  of  January,\r\n\r\nthe  date  which  has been agreed  with  the  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation,  but  it should be  of  the  order  of\r\n\r\n$6,000,  and this can be met from savings.  In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  token votes only  are  required  to\r\n\r\ngive legal sanction to the creation of the posts on\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of the Executive Service.

This will  involve\r\n\r\nthe division of existing staff, equipment and votes\r\n\r\nof  the  Rural  Board  between the  three  District\r\n\r\nCouncils and all necessary arrangements to this end\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  made,  so  that  the  District\r\n\r\nCouncils can assume full responsibility as soon  as\r\n\r\nthey  take  office. It will, however, also  involve\r\n\r\nthe   provision  of  additional  staff,  funds  and\r\n\r\nequipment. Hon. Members have always been aware  of,\r\n\r\nand have expressed their willingness to accept, the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the development of local government  by\r\n\r\nthe  replacement  of the Rural  Board  by  District\r\n\r\nCouncils would, at least in the early stages of the\r\n\r\nscheme,   result  in  increased  expenditure.   The\r\n\r\nadditional staff, funds and equipment which will be\r\n\r\nrequired in 1958 are shown in the Schedule attached\r\n\r\nto the Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 2 is set out a list of the new posts which\r\n\r\nwill be required to enable the District Councils to\r\n\r\nfunction properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendices A, B and C on pages 3 and 4 indicate\r\n\r\nthe  additional  funds  for recurrent  expenditure,\r\n\r\ndaily  paid  wages  and  equipment  which  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements for additional staff and\r\n\r\nequipment have been examined with great care in the\r\n\r\nTreasury,  and I can assure hon. Members that  they\r\n\r\nhave  been reduced to the minimum which we consider\r\n\r\nessential for the task in hand. There has  been  no\r\n\r\n'build-up'  or  extravagance in the compilation  of\r\n\r\nthe  estimates. The funds now sought will be  added\r\n\r\nto  the  existing Rural Board votes and apportioned\r\n\r\nin due course between the Councils along with these\r\n\r\nvotes.  Provision has been made for 9  months,  but\r\n\r\nquite  obviously the total sum thus  provided  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  required.

These  may\r\n\r\nseem  fairly large sums for one message but it must\r\n\r\nbe remembered that there has been no sitting of the\r\n\r\nAssembly  since 8th January and that  the  work  of\r\n\r\nGovernment must go on. Full explanations of all the\r\n\r\nitems  are  given in the message and my  colleagues\r\n\r\nand  I  will be happy to amplify these explanations\r\n\r\nif  this  is necessary. I should, however, like  to\r\n\r\ndraw  attention to one or two items of  outstanding\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with item 5, Sir, hon. Members will\r\n\r\nnote  with much regret that Dr Benham's  leave  of\r\n\r\nabsence from Chatham House expires in May. We  have\r\n\r\nbeen   singularly  fortunate  in  having  had   the\r\n\r\nservices of such a distinguished economist  as  Dr\r\n\r\nBenham for the past eighteen months, and I am  sure\r\n\r\nI  will  be  speaking for all the Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  when  I  say  how  sorry  we  are  that  his\r\n\r\nsecondment cannot be extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 6 to 19 make provision for the establishment\r\n\r\nof  a  Rural Development Panel. Government has been\r\n\r\nconcerned for some time that the activities of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and other bodies in connection with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  rural  areas  has  not  been   co-ordinated to the extent which they might have been.\r\n\r\nThis has not been due to any neglect on the part of\r\n\r\nthe authorities concerned but has resulted from the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there  has been a  great  expansion  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  activity in the rural areas  over  the\r\n\r\npast  two  years, and that attention has until  now\r\n\r\nbeen  entirely concentrated on launching individual\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has recently been considered by the\r\n\r\nEconomic Committee of the Council of Ministers  and\r\n\r\nit  has  been decided that the best way to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe required degree of co-ordination is to set up a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  panel with an official entitled  Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Commissioner as the executive  officer\r\n\r\nof  the  Panel. The task of this Panel will  be  to\r\n\r\nplan  and  co-ordinate  development  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  There will be a close liaison  between  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board and, later, the District Councils,  so\r\n\r\nthat  functions  of  the  various  bodies  do   not\r\n\r\noverlap. Later when plans have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  worked  out in detail, the Assembly  will  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  vote  such additional  sums  as  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired. In this connection, however, an assurance\r\n\r\ncan  be  given  that  no money will  be  wasted  on\r\n\r\nschemes which have not been considered in all their\r\n\r\nimplications. We have seen elsewhere the way  money\r\n\r\ncan   be   wasted   as  a  result  of   misdirected\r\n\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it is proposed to establish a close\r\n\r\nliaison  between  the Government  and  the  farming\r\n\r\ncommunities by the introduction of a small band  of\r\n\r\nfield  development or liaison officers  who,  after\r\n\r\ntraining   in  the  Land  Office,  and   with   the\r\n\r\nVeterinary,  Agriculture and Fisheries Departments,\r\n\r\nwill live among the farmers, pass on the advice  of\r\n\r\nthe  experts and inform Government of the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe various communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 33 to 51, Sir, concern items required for\r\n\r\nstepping  up of the war against tobacco  smugglers.\r\n\r\nThe  proximity  of  the Indonesian  islands  around\r\n\r\nSingapore   encourages  smuggling,  and   we   have\r\n\r\nevidence that certain of the ports in these islands\r\n\r\nare  being  used as bases for smuggling operations.\r\n\r\nAgain,  the  great  developments which  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace  recently in outboard motors have  given  the\r\n\r\nsmugglers  far  more  efficient  means  of  running\r\n\r\ncontraband  than  they have ever  had  before.  The\r\n\r\nincrease  in tobacco duty has given added incentive\r\n\r\nto the smugglers, who are now prepared to run great\r\n\r\nrisks  since the rewards of success are  so  great.\r\n\r\nThe  matter  is one of great importance  since  the\r\n\r\nvaluable  tobacco  revenue  is  in  danger.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to say just how much is being lost at the\r\n\r\npresent time but from information at my disposal  I\r\n\r\nestimate that it is about $2 million a year despite\r\n\r\nall  the  efforts of the Customs Department.  Steps\r\n\r\nare and must be taken to contain, and eventually to\r\n\r\neliminate,   smuggling.  It  is  not  a  short-term\r\n\r\nproblem; it is long-term. The incentive to  smuggle\r\n\r\nwill always be there as long as duty is imposed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the policy of the preventive branch\r\n\r\nof  the  Customs Department has been  revised.  All\r\n\r\navailable   men   are  deployed  on  anti-smuggling\r\n\r\npatrols. Ship-building programmes have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namended to provide faster small craft Use has  been\r\n\r\nmade  of  captured craft, which is a dangerous  and\r\n\r\nnot  very  satisfactory expedient. Now we  wish  to\r\n\r\ncarry  the  matter further and to obtain  funds  to\r\n\r\nbuild  further small craft which are essential  for\r\n\r\nclose  pursuit in shallow waters, and for the staff\r\n\r\nand equipment necessary to step up the campaign. At\r\n\r\na  later date I shall probably come forward with  a\r\n\r\nproposal to divert funds already voted for a  large\r\n\r\nlaunch, for the construction of still more launches\r\n\r\nof  the Kilat class and also a radar station  on  a\r\n\r\nstrategic  island to control all the approaches  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I trust that hon. Members will  support\r\n\r\nall these proposals which I regard as essential  to\r\n\r\nthe  successful  prosecution  of  the  war  against\r\n\r\nsmugglers. At the same time I should like  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to pay a further tribute  to  the\r\n\r\nexcellent work which the Customs officers are doing\r\n\r\nnight  in  and  night  out  in  all  weathers,   in\r\n\r\nconditions  of extreme discomfort and sometimes  of\r\n\r\nconsiderable personal danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any hon. Member would like to see the\r\n\r\nDepartment at work, I shall be happy to arrange it.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a rewarding experience to see local Customs\r\n\r\nofficers  planning  each  night's  operations   and\r\n\r\ncarrying them out with great success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 68 deals with a project to which publicity\r\n\r\nhas   already   been  given  by  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation. It represented a long-sighted policy the\r\n\r\nimmediate  aim of which is to give the  opportunity\r\n\r\nfor a secondary education to many of those who have\r\n\r\nfailed  to  gain admission to secondary schools.  I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt that my Hon.

During the\r\n\r\nJapanese regime, everyone trembled at the word\r\n\r\nKempetai; that word was a very dangerous one during\r\n\r\nthe Japanese time. Today, we are supposed to live\r\n\r\nin a world of freedom, and Singapore is considered\r\n\r\nthe most peaceful country in the East. But, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Government, under the guise of the Preservation\r\n\r\nof Public Security Ordinance, has made the people\r\n\r\nfear it more than they feared the Kempetai during\r\n\r\nthe Japanese regime, because of the powers given to\r\n\r\nthe police under this Ordinance. Under this\r\n\r\nOrdinance the people are frightened to death to\r\n\r\ncriticise either the Government or the police. How\r\n\r\ncan then a person develop his personality under\r\n\r\narbitrary detention without open trial?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse, apart from this, is that torture is\r\n\r\npractised by the police on detained persons. Every\r\n\r\ncountry or society must enact laws to protect\r\n\r\nitself from criminals and other evil-doers; and in\r\n\r\norder that such laws of the country are complied\r\n\r\nwith and maintained, Government has got to\r\n\r\nintroduce legislation to safeguard the interests of\r\n\r\nall shades of people, be they coloured or\r\n\r\nuncoloured. Such powers as arrest, search or\r\n\r\ndetention are given to the police, and as long as\r\n\r\nthese powers are properly exercised, they are the\r\n\r\nsafeguards of freedom and human rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, daily we experience or hear of many cases of\r\n\r\nabuses of power by some officials of the police\r\n\r\nforce. It was only yesterday when two Bills were\r\n\r\nintroduced that we hear Members of this Assembly\r\n\r\ncriticise the abuses, or are afraid that the powers\r\n\r\ngiven to the police may be abused. If such powers\r\n\r\ngiven to the police are abused, then arbitrary rule\r\n\r\ntakes place. It leads to the hater Gestapo or\r\n\r\nKempetai rule and then the country becomes a police\r\n\r\nstate. Like the Japanese rule, Sir, false\r\n\r\nconfessions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   put  on  through  Kempetai  methods  and  the\r\n\r\nKempetai methods are nothing but torture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During peace-time, a man can be sent to prison for\r\n\r\nthe  crimes that he has committed in the past.  But\r\n\r\nthe   Government  cannot  detain  any  person   for\r\n\r\nimaginary   offences  of  the   future   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expects  him to commit.  In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  is no civil war; there is no  national\r\n\r\nwar.  So we consider ourselves to be lucky to  live\r\n\r\nin a world of paradise. Apart from how lucky we may\r\n\r\nbe,   Sir,  we  have  the  Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance, which is in fact forced  on  us\r\n\r\nand passed by this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Ordinance, if the Governor in Council\r\n\r\nis  satisfied that a person is acting in  a  manner\r\n\r\nprejudicial  to  the security of the  country,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary  shall  make  an  order  for   the\r\n\r\ndetention  of that person for any period,  but  not\r\n\r\nexceeding two years. Such wide powers given by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  be carried  out  by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  alone. He is a single man and he  cannot\r\n\r\ncarry  out such orders single-handed. So the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  then  relies upon the police  force  and\r\n\r\ncalls upon the police force for the enforcement  of\r\n\r\nthese  rules, orders or instructions issued by  him\r\n\r\nunder   the   Preservation   of   Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Ordinance, Sir, the rules, orders or\r\n\r\ninstructions made by him are not even published  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government Gazette for the information of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Whatever is passed here  or  whatever  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  is published  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nGazette, and that is what the Government Gazette is\r\n\r\nfor - for  the  information of the public.  But  such\r\n\r\nthings are not published in the Government Gazette.\r\n\r\nSo,  Sir, the handing over of this blank cheque  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary has in some instances resulted\r\n\r\nin very, very grave abuses of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of Lim Chin Joo, Goh Boon Toh, Tan\r\n\r\nBok  Teng and Tan Juat Seng. I understand that  the\r\n\r\ngrievances  or  complaints of these four  detainees\r\n\r\nwere  circulated to the majority of, if not to  all\r\n\r\nthe Members of this Assembly. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  complaints I understand that  a  medical\r\n\r\nreport  by  a  private practitioner  was  attached.\r\n\r\nThese  complaints of torture, Sir, are  very,  very\r\n\r\ngrave  abuses of the law and a threat to  our  very\r\n\r\nexistence. Police officers engaged in the detention\r\n\r\nof  offenders should not be allowed to discard  the\r\n\r\ndetention skill, if they have any, and try  to  use\r\n\r\nmore  easy and tempting measures of torture to make\r\n\r\npeople  confess and so obtain the clues  that  they\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a lawyer, Sir, but I am told by some\r\n\r\nlegal  friends  that  the law of  evidence  of  the\r\n\r\ncourts  provides  that  a  confession  made  by  an\r\n\r\naccused person whilst in the custody of the  police\r\n\r\ncannot  be admissible in a court of law. The object\r\n\r\nof  this  law,  Sir,  is to safeguard  the  accused\r\n\r\nperson  from  being  subject  to  abuse  by  police\r\n\r\nofficers  for extortion and oppression to  get  the\r\n\r\ninformation required. I have known quite a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncases where the police often extort confessions, by\r\n\r\nundue  influence  of  torture  and  oppression.  To\r\n\r\nprevent such abuses, this law was enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, I cannot see how torture can be used to\r\n\r\nobtain confessions. Are we, Sir, going back to  the\r\n\r\nold  Japanese  regime,  when  we  feared  the  word\r\n\r\nKempetai? As I said earlier just now, Sir,  when  I\r\n\r\nintroduced this motion my memory brings me back  to\r\n\r\nthe  old, old days - 1942 to 1945. Now it appears  to\r\n\r\nme,  Sir, that people, instead of fearing the  word\r\n\r\nKempetai,  fear the word P.P.S.O. - the  Preservation\r\n\r\nof Public Security Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, even in this Ordinance I cannot find\r\n\r\nthe  word \"torture\" at all. I have gone through  it\r\n\r\nand  there is not a single word which says torture.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  how  is it possible  that  brutal\r\n\r\nmethods, as alleged, have found their way into  the\r\n\r\nadministrative system? If the allegations are true,\r\n\r\nthen  there is no doubt of the inevitable  collapse\r\n\r\nand destruction of our administrative machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we may say, Sir, the vital issue before\r\n\r\nus today is not of the torture. It is whether these\r\n\r\nallegations  are true or not, whether they  are  in\r\n\r\nfact true or not. In the case of Lim Chin Joo, Sir,\r\n\r\nI understand he is the brother of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  of  this Assembly who is now, I  think,  in\r\n\r\nChangi Gaol with him. The allegations were made  by\r\n\r\nLim  Chin  Joo  on  oath before a  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nOaths, and I think that they should be accepted.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, that a few days after he had sworn\r\n\r\nto his complaint, he was removed to Changi Gaol.  I\r\n\r\npresume  that it was only after his complaint  that\r\n\r\nhe  was  transferred to Changi Gaol.  Otherwise  he\r\n\r\nmight  be  confined in the Central  Police  Station\r\n\r\nlock-up for more torture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed, Sir, that this detainee was\r\n\r\nconfined  in the Central Police Station  for  about\r\n\r\nfive-and-a-half  months  in  all.  Soon  after  his\r\n\r\narrest  he  was kept in the Central Police  Station\r\n\r\nfor  48  days.  The Chief Secretary said  yesterday\r\n\r\nthat  a  man cannot be detained for more  than  six\r\n\r\nweeks,  which  is  only 42 days and  not  48  days.\r\n\r\nDuring this period he was not questioned at all. If\r\n\r\nthe  police did not intend to question him, why did\r\n\r\nthe  police  confine  him in  that  Central  Police\r\n\r\nStation  lock-up  for 48 days? The Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\ntold  us  yesterday,  while  introducing  the   two\r\n\r\namending Bills, that people are detained there  for\r\n\r\ninterrogation purposes. Then why was Lim  Chin  Joo\r\n\r\nnot questioned or interrogated at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, this appears to me a gross\r\n\r\ndisregard and misuse of the Preservation of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance. Not satisfied with this initial\r\n\r\nconfinement of 48 days, he was again removed to the\r\n\r\nCentral  Police Station on 15th November last  year\r\n\r\nfrom  Changi  Prison. There he was kept  until  the\r\n\r\n11th  or 12th of last month-it was only last month,\r\n\r\nSir - a period from 15th November until that date  is\r\n\r\nroughly about four months, to be precise, 116 days.\r\n\r\nWhy,  Sir, when the Chief Secretary said  a  person\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  confined for  six  weeks,  was  this\r\n\r\ndetainee  confined  in the first  instance  for  48 days?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I am just introducing my subject to\r\n\r\npoint  out  how  the  police confine  detainees  or\r\n\r\npersons  in the Central Police Station for torture.\r\n\r\nWhen  it comes to a certain stage or when it  comes\r\n\r\nto  the right time, I have documents with me  which\r\n\r\nrefer to torture and freezing treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total period during which this detainee was\r\n\r\nconfined in the Central Police Station was, in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance,  as I said, 48  days.  The  second\r\n\r\ninstance was 116 days, making a total of 164  days,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  roughly  five-and-a-half  months.   This\r\n\r\ndiscloses a shockingly long period for carrying out\r\n\r\ninvestigations. In the normal course of events, the\r\n\r\npolice  cannot  detain a person for  more  than  24\r\n\r\nhours  unless ordered by a court of law. Under  the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance,  section\r\n\r\n17 (3), a detainee can be confined in a police lock-up  for  about  16  days, 24  hours  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance  and  another  24  hours  in  the   second\r\n\r\ninstance, and then after investigation if the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary is not satisfied, another 14 days. I will\r\n\r\nread the relevant section:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Section 17 (3). No person shall be detained under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of  this section  f  or  a  period\r\n\r\nexceeding   twenty-four  hours  except   with   the\r\n\r\nauthority of a police officer of or above the  rank\r\n\r\nof  Assistant  Superintendent of Police  or  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of 48 hours in all:\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>which means a detainee can only be confined for  48 hours-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that if an officer of or above the rank\r\n\r\nof  Superintendent of Police is satisfied that  the\r\n\r\nnecessary enquiries cannot be completed within  the\r\n\r\naforesaid  period of 48 hours he may authorise  the\r\n\r\nfurther  detention of such person for an additional\r\n\r\nperiod  not  exceeding fourteen days and  shall  on\r\n\r\ngiving  such  authorisation  forthwith  report  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances to the Commissioner of Police.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this section a detainee can only be\r\n\r\nallowed  to be confined for 16 days, but the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  told us it is six weeks. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nhow he gets his six weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this section, Sir, you can now note that, as\r\n\r\nI just said, it is for 48 hours in the first place,\r\n\r\nthen  another  14  days.  When  he  was  originally\r\n\r\narrested on 22nd August, 1957, he was confined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the Central Police Station lock-up for about 48\r\n\r\ndays, then for four months, making a total of five-and-a-half months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

My motion is closely related to\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance, the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  It  refers to four detainees  who  were\r\n\r\narrested  under  this Ordinance,  and  I  think  in\r\n\r\nintroducing   my   motion  I   should   bring   the\r\n\r\npreliminary in - what this Ordinance is and how those\r\n\r\ndetainees  were arrested under it. Unless  I  quote\r\n\r\nthe  section  under  this Ordinance,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nindication  of how the detainees were arrested  and\r\n\r\nwhy  they were arrested.

Where then is the legal and moral\r\n\r\njustification for this detainee to be  confined  in\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Police Station for nearly five-and-a-half  months? Is this not abuse of the  application\r\n\r\nof  section  17  (3)  of the  Ordinance?

On\r\n\r\nthe following day the 16th of November, 1957, I was\r\n\r\nordered to leave my cell and was taken to Room  No.\r\n\r\n6  (the interrogation room). I was ordered to stand\r\n\r\nin  front of a fully opened air-conditioner and  to\r\n\r\nplace  both  my  hands on the said plant.  At  this\r\n\r\ntime, I was with a bare body from waist upwards. It\r\n\r\nwas  extremely cold and it was beyond my endurance.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, cold water was brought  in  and\r\n\r\nsprinkled  over my back and front chest. This  form\r\n\r\nof torture\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, the word \"torture\" is there - \"lasted for about 20 minutes.\" [Interruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H.

Thereafter, electric wires were  applied\r\n\r\nall over my body including my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  parts - in the medical term \"glans  penis\".\r\n\r\nAt  this  time, I was blindfolded with a  piece  of\r\n\r\ncloth  and I was unable to see the perpetrators  of\r\n\r\nthis electric shock treatment. The cold torture  as\r\n\r\nstated  in  paragraph 4 herein [which  in  fact  is\r\n\r\nparagraph 2 as I have just read] was repeated to be\r\n\r\nfollowed by the same electric shock torture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two forms of torture were alternately\r\n\r\nperpetrated  on me. I was blindfolded whenever  the\r\n\r\nelectric shock tortures were applied on me. In all,\r\n\r\nI  was  subject to the cold torture twice  and  the\r\n\r\nelectric  shock torture was applied four  times  on\r\n\r\nthe  same day and these alternate forms of  torture\r\n\r\nlasted for about two hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 18th day of November, 1957, some five to\r\n\r\nsix  persons entered my room. I was slapped  a  few\r\n\r\ntimes by some of them. I was ordered to take off my\r\n\r\nshirt  in  front  of the air-conditioner  and  cold\r\n\r\nwater  was brought in. It was sprinkled on my  body\r\n\r\nand poured on my head. This cold torture lasted for\r\n\r\nabout  15 minutes. I reported the torture inflicted\r\n\r\non  me  to  the prison doctor when he came  on  his\r\n\r\nrounds on the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or about the 20th day of November, 1957, my\r\n\r\nfather came on his weekly visit and I reported  the\r\n\r\naforesaid  tortures to him and told  my  father  to\r\n\r\nreport this matter to my solicitor. After my father\r\n\r\nhad  left, I was taken into the interrogation  room\r\n\r\nby  a  police officer and was ordered to  stand  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  the air-conditioner without a shirt  for\r\n\r\nabout  15 minutes. Then I was taken to my cell.  On\r\n\r\nthe same day, at about 2 p.m., I was again asked to\r\n\r\ncome  out from my cell by a police official. I  was\r\n\r\nordered to stand before the air-conditioner.  About\r\n\r\nfive  persons  were present at this time.  I  stood\r\n\r\nbefore  the fully opened air-conditioner for  about\r\n\r\n10  minutes.  I  was told that my former  solicitor\r\n\r\nwished  to  interview me. I was taken back  to  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. interview room. There I lodged a  complaint\r\n\r\nto my solicitor and also reported the tortures to a\r\n\r\nprivate  medical practitioner who was also  present\r\n\r\nin  the C.I.D. interview room at this time. Exhibit\r\n\r\nmarked `A' is a copy of the medical report made  by\r\n\r\nthe  private  medical  practitioner.  The  exhibits\r\n\r\nmarked `B' and `C' are copies of letters sent by my\r\n\r\nformer  solicitor to the Director of Special Branch\r\n\r\nand to the Chief Minister of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  what  Mr Lim Chin Joo has  filed  in  an\r\n\r\naffidavit  in  the presence of the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nOaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most agonising and monstrous part of the\r\n\r\nallegations,  as  I  have just read  out,  was  the\r\n\r\nelectric  current applied, amongst other  parts  of\r\n\r\nhis  body, on his private parts. Is that fair, Sir?\r\n\r\nMembers can refer to the doctor's report,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncopies  of  which,  as  I  said,  have  been\r\n\r\ncirculated  to quite a number of Members.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  read the medical report but some  of  the\r\n\r\nmedical  terms are not familiar to me but  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation of Members, I will say that the  report\r\n\r\nwas  made  out  by  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh  (L.M.S.).\r\n\r\nInternational Dispensary Limited, 4-6 Hill  Street,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  6, Tel. No. 36550: \"Medical  Report  of\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Chin  Joo, Date, 20.11.57 at  2.40  p.m.,\r\n\r\nPlace, C.I.D., Complained that he was shocked  with\r\n\r\nelectric   current - wire  attached   to   battery - on\r\n\r\n16.10.57  at  about 10 am. Examination,  amongst  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of items, No. 6-glans penis\". This  is  the\r\n\r\nmedical report to which I have just referred. Is it\r\n\r\nnot,  Sir, inhuman and most barbaric that this form\r\n\r\nof   torture   was  practised  on  a  detainee?   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  from an expert scientist  that  current\r\n\r\ntreatment  is  more receptive if  applied  after  a\r\n\r\ncertain degree of coldness. This I believe  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  Lim  Chin Joo was given  the  electric\r\n\r\nshock  treatment after the cold treatment. As  soon\r\n\r\nas  practical, this detainee reported, the tortures\r\n\r\ninflicted on him to the prison doctor when he  came\r\n\r\non  his  rounds, as I have just read out.  Then  he\r\n\r\ncomplained  again to his father and then  from  his\r\n\r\nfather  to his lawyer. After his lawyer, a  private\r\n\r\ndoctor was then summoned. Now in one of the letters\r\n\r\nsent  by  Mr  Lim  Chin Joo's  lawyer  dated  27th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1957 addressed to the Director,  Special\r\n\r\nBranch,  C.I.D.,  it quotes all  these  things.  It\r\n\r\nquotes  that Lim Chin Joo did not wish  to  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  an  identification parade asked for  earlier.\r\n\r\nThe  Hon. the Chief Secretary may like to know  why\r\n\r\nthis   detainee   refused  to  proceed   with   the\r\n\r\nidentification  parade.  How  could,  Sir,  a   man\r\n\r\nidentify any person when he was blindfolded  (as  I\r\n\r\njust  read  out) at the time when he was  tortured?\r\n\r\nThere   are  many  other  reasons.  In  the   first\r\n\r\ninstance, he may still be under police custody  and\r\n\r\nis   afraid  that  if  he  really  identifies   the\r\n\r\nassailants concerned, he may be subjected  to  more\r\n\r\ntortures.  Apart from this, the investigation  into\r\n\r\nthese  allegations was carried out  by  the  police\r\n\r\nofficers themselves who are, in fact, an interested\r\n\r\nparty. Could an interested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparty   carry   out   an  impartial   investigation\r\n\r\nespecially when their own reputation is  at  stake?\r\n\r\nThis  again  may be one of the factors.  Again,  it\r\n\r\nwill  seen, Sir, from paragraph 5 of Mr  Lim  Chin\r\n\r\nJoo's  complaint,  that he was blindfolded.  Is  it\r\n\r\npossible,  may I stress again, for  a  man  who  is\r\n\r\nblindfolded  and  cannot see anything  to  identify anybody?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will be surprised to know that in the\r\n\r\ncase of Mr Goh Boon Toh, it is entirely different.\r\n\r\nI  understand  that he asked for an  identification\r\n\r\nparade but in asking for this identification parade\r\n\r\nit  was refused by the police. Now, Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthis,  you may say in one case that the man refused\r\n\r\nto  identify  but  in  this case  it  is  just  the\r\n\r\nopposite.   Mr   Goh  Boon  Toh   asked   for   an\r\n\r\nidentification parade but the police  refused  him.\r\n\r\nWould  it serve any purpose, Sir, for a man to  ask\r\n\r\nfor an identification parade when it is refused?  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that Tan Bok Teng and  Tan  Juat  Seng,\r\n\r\nanother two of the detainees, had an identification\r\n\r\nparade  and  in  fact  identified  three  of  their\r\n\r\nassailants.  What  action has  been  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment? Nothing at all! So would it  serve  any\r\n\r\npurpose of having an identification parade  of  the\r\n\r\npolice officers themselves when action is not taken\r\n\r\nagainst those identified? Sir, the only way now  to\r\n\r\nrestore  the  confidence  of  the  people   is   to\r\n\r\nascertain   the   truth  or  otherwise   of   these\r\n\r\nallegations through an independent Tribunal.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid, you cannot say whether they are true or  not.\r\n\r\nSo  the  vital issue that is facing us  is  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are true or not and if we want to be  sincere\r\n\r\nabout wanting to know whether they are true or not,\r\n\r\nlet  us  throw  it open to a public  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry. When the facts come up, it is then  up  to\r\n\r\nthat  Commission to say whether they  are  true  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have before us complaints of torture by four\r\n\r\ndetainees - a barbaric form of torture,  I  may  say.\r\n\r\nHow  can  every one who is considered an honourable\r\n\r\nMember  in  this House ignore such complaints?  All\r\n\r\nthese  complaints are of a very, very grave nature.\r\n\r\nCan we ignore such complaints?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Goh Boon Toh, I understand that at\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  he was tortured, he was  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom T.B. Whether this allegation again is true  or\r\n\r\nnot,  I do not know but now when a man is suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  T.B. and is subjected to electric  and  cold\r\n\r\nfreezing  torture,  is this not barbaric?  Is  this\r\n\r\nfair, may I ask the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here a society that is called the Society\r\n\r\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Are these\r\n\r\ndetained  people  to  be  treated  far  worse  than\r\n\r\nanimals? So the policy of the Government as regards\r\n\r\nthe  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to\r\n\r\nAnimals  is just nothing but a window-dressing.  We\r\n\r\nmight  as  well  close down that society  if  human\r\n\r\nbeings are treated far worse than animals. We  have\r\n\r\nread,  Sir,  of cruelty to dogs in the local  press\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Russians sent a dog into outer space  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Sputnik  II.  It  received  the  widest   of\r\n\r\npublicity  and, if my memory serves me right,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe President of the Canine Welfare Association who\r\n\r\nis  now a City Councillor immediately sent a  cable\r\n\r\nto Russia protesting against the cruelty to the dog\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Is  there no one in Singapore  who  can\r\n\r\nchampion the cause of human beings at least?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Goh Boon Toh, he did not\r\n\r\ncomplain  of electric torture because  he  was  not\r\n\r\nsubjected to it. His complaint was only of the cold\r\n\r\ntreatment. Again for the information of  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  not received copies, I will read extracts  of\r\n\r\nhis  complaint. This is not as long as the previous\r\n\r\none:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are instructed that during interrogation, one\r\n\r\nof  the  Special  Branch officials  whom  the  said\r\n\r\ndetainee  could identify hit him several  times  on\r\n\r\nhis  head  and  another official placed  his  index\r\n\r\nfinger  around the region of the throat and pressed\r\n\r\nhis finger hard for about six to seven minutes.  At\r\n\r\nthis stage, he could hardly breathe.\".\r\n\r\nWas  the  police officer trying to choke  and  kill\r\n\r\nhim?  It is better to kill him outright rather than\r\n\r\nto allow him suffer such torture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The next day interrogation commenced at about 9\r\n\r\nam,  and was conducted by the same officials as the\r\n\r\nprevious day together with another new officer. One\r\n\r\nof  the interrogation officers was alleged to  have\r\n\r\ntold  the said detainee, \"I am going to put you  to talk\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich means that he was trying to force it on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am going to put you to talk and unless you\r\n\r\ntalk,  I  will  put  you into  that  freezing  cold\r\n\r\nchamber.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  this  not oppression? Is this not using  force?\r\n\r\nWhat else can we call it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Soon after the police officer's threat of a\r\n\r\nfreezingly  cold  plant he asked  the  detainee  to\r\n\r\nembrace the said extremely cold plant. The detainee\r\n\r\nwas  again  ordered to take off his shirt  but  was\r\n\r\nallowed to have his trousers on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Lucky enough!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He was bare from his waist upwards. While the\r\n\r\ndetainee  was  embracing the  cold  plant,  another\r\n\r\nofficer poured cold water on his back. This  prison\r\n\r\ntorture in the cold room lasted for about one hour.\r\n\r\nWhile  this  prison operation was in  process,  two\r\n\r\nofficers  who  were standing on each  side  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainee pressed their fingers on both sides of his\r\n\r\nribs for some time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  time  they  were not choking him.  They  were trying to dig between his ribs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The detainee complained to us that the cold was\r\n\r\nhumanly  unbearable  and  this  coupled  with   the\r\n\r\ncontinuous pressing on the sides of the  ribs  made\r\n\r\nthe   detainee  to  lose  consciousness.   He   was\r\n\r\nunconscious after such treatment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the two detainees, Tan Bok\r\n\r\nTeng and Tan Juat Seng, their complaints of torture\r\n\r\nhave  also  aroused the politicians in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, it  is rather surprising how  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  came  to  know about  it.  Questions  were\r\n\r\ntabled in the House of Commons by Mr Awberry,  who\r\n\r\nI  understand is a Member of Parliament and belongs\r\n\r\nto   the  Labour  Party,  in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\ntortures  experienced by these two detainees.  Such\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament, are, in fact, socialists.

The governing Party - the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front - claims to be a socialist Party.  What\r\n\r\nhas  it  done to look into the interests  of  these\r\n\r\nfour  detainees about their complaints of  torture?\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, what have the Liberal-Socialists  done,\r\n\r\nor  is  the word \"Socialists\" only attached to  the\r\n\r\nname  of that Party? Why call yourselves socialists\r\n\r\nwhen  you do not have that socialist policy? Again,\r\n\r\nSir,  what  has the leader of the P.A.P. done?

Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  these so-called socialist Parties,  what  has\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement in Singapore done? Nothing\r\n\r\nat  all.  This is a matter which is of  very  grave\r\n\r\nconcern. Apart from the socialist Parties here, the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement which claims to champion  the\r\n\r\ncause of workers has also done nothing. I can  only\r\n\r\nhope,  Sir, that all the trade unions in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntogether with the so-called socialist Parties  will\r\n\r\nrally  round this cause because these are startling\r\n\r\nallegations. To those of us who have lived  through\r\n\r\nthe  four years of Japanese or Kempetai rule,  this\r\n\r\nreminds us of similar ill-treatment by the Japanese warlords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, whether all these\r\n\r\nallegations are true or otherwise, I feel that I am\r\n\r\nnot competent to say so. I am not a lawyer; neither\r\n\r\ndo  I  know the actual facts of the cases.  What  I\r\n\r\nhave  now  quoted are all on paper and  from  these\r\n\r\npapers,  I make up my case. I consider it  my  duty\r\n\r\nthat  I  should  table this motion  and  bring  the\r\n\r\nmatter before this House. Sir, if these allegations\r\n\r\nare  untrue, then it is all the more necessary that\r\n\r\nGovernment  should hold this Commission of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nforthwith  to  tell  the world and  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore that all these allegations are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nuntrue.  It  is  far  more necessary  if  they  are\r\n\r\nuntrue. If they are true, then keep quiet. It is no\r\n\r\nuse,  Sir, just refuting and refuting on paper that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  true. As I said,  if  you  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to hold that Commission of Inquiry,  that\r\n\r\nwill  clearly indicate that those allegations  are,\r\n\r\nto  a  certain extent, true and that  that  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  you  are  not  prepared  to  hold  the\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry. The Commission  of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  asking for should be  an  independent\r\n\r\none - not consisting again of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolice  officers  or  Commissioners  of  Police  or\r\n\r\nanybody  attached to the Special Branch. Only  when\r\n\r\nthis  Commission of Inquiry is held and  the  facts\r\n\r\nand  report given, will we then be able  to  decide\r\n\r\nand  say whether these allegations are true or not.\r\n\r\nIn  the name of humanity and social justice, I hope\r\n\r\nthat  all Members in this House will give me  their\r\n\r\nfullest support in adopting my motion and whilst  I\r\n\r\nask for the adoption of this motion I would like to\r\n\r\nadd that the terms of reference be extended so that\r\n\r\nsuch  Inquiry  will also be able to  hear  evidence\r\n\r\nfrom  those  persons  arrested  by  detectives  and\r\n\r\nbrought to police stations or to the C.I.D. I  have\r\n\r\nheard many cases where persons have been brought in\r\n\r\nfor no reason and assaulted by detectives or police\r\n\r\nofficers. Again whether this is true or not, I have\r\n\r\nnot   seen   for  myself  but  there  are  numerous\r\n\r\ncomplaints  and when we do have this Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry,  I hope that the terms of reference  would\r\n\r\nalso include such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown who moved this motion  had  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount to say about the  Preservation\r\n\r\nof  Public  Security Ordinance. I do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nfollow  him  on that but I would only say  that  my\r\n\r\nHon, friend  the Chief Minister has already  given\r\n\r\nample  grounds for the existence of that  Ordinance\r\n\r\nand its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will however, if you will bear with me, Sir,\r\n\r\nrefer  to  two points regarding which I  think  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member was under a mis-apprehension. The first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  his reference to the right to detain a  person\r\n\r\nafter  his arrest for a maximum period of 16  days.\r\n\r\nThat is correct but that is the right of the police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  hold  the  man  for up to  16  days  without  a\r\n\r\ndetention order having been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also stated, Sir, that I had replied to a\r\n\r\nQuestion  yesterday to the effect that no detainees\r\n\r\nhad  been kept for questioning for a period  longer\r\n\r\nthan  six  weeks. I am afraid he must have misheard\r\n\r\nme  on  that  because I did inform him  that  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  cases,  they had been  detained  for  a\r\n\r\nlonger  period. In the particular case to which  he\r\n\r\nreferred,  the  main  reason  why  the  period  was\r\n\r\nprolonged  to that extent was because  a  complaint\r\n\r\nwas made and inquiries had to be conducted into the\r\n\r\ncomplaint before anything further could be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member finished his introductory\r\n\r\nspeech  by saying that he was not competent to  say\r\n\r\nwhether  these allegations were true or  false  but\r\n\r\nthe whole of his speech was based on the assumption\r\n\r\nthat they were true and the picture he drew was one\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think must have stirred the  emotions  of\r\n\r\neverybody  but it has validity only  if  there  are\r\n\r\ngrounds  for  thinking that these  allegations  are\r\n\r\ntrue  and therefore, Sir, I do submit to the  House\r\n\r\nthat this motion stands or falls by the question of\r\n\r\nwhether   or   not  these  allegations   have   any\r\n\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a full inquiry was conducted into each of the\r\n\r\nallegations made in these four cases and I  propose\r\n\r\nto  detail  to  hon. Members the results  of  these\r\n\r\ninvestigations but before I do so, I would like  to\r\n\r\nmake  one or two preliminary observations. Firstly,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  motion  does constitute  a  very  grave\r\n\r\nreflection not only on the police but also  on  all\r\n\r\nthe  other  officers including the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nand  the  Chief  Minister who have been  associated\r\n\r\nwith  accepting or rejecting the results  of  these\r\n\r\ninvestigations. It is therefore a matter  of  great\r\n\r\npublic importance that this Assembly should address\r\n\r\nitself   to  the  subject  of  this  motion   quite\r\n\r\nobjectively  and  impartially  and  not  allow  its\r\n\r\njudgment to be in any way swayed by emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation I should like to make, Sir, is that these allegations are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  against  individual  police  officers,  those\r\n\r\nwhose duty it has been to question the detainees on\r\n\r\nthe   dates   when   it  is  alleged   that   these\r\n\r\nmalpractices took place. Neither in the allegations\r\n\r\nnor elsewhere is there any evidence associating any\r\n\r\nother  police  officers with the behaviour  alleged\r\n\r\nand  any attempt to extend the accusations to  hold\r\n\r\nany particular section of the force responsible can\r\n\r\nonly  be  a matter of inference and I suggest  that\r\n\r\nhon.  Members should reflect very carefully  before\r\n\r\nconsidering that any such inference is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, thirdly, Sir, to refer to the\r\n\r\nprocedure    followed   in   investigating    these\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  It  has  been suggested  by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that  there is something  improper  and  in\r\n\r\nitself  a cause for disquiet that the investigation\r\n\r\ninto  these complaints has been conducted by police\r\n\r\nofficers.  This suggestion, Sir, is,  in  my  view,\r\n\r\nwholly    misconceived.   Wherever   and   whenever\r\n\r\ncomplaints or allegations are made that a crime has\r\n\r\nbeen  committed, whether the person  accused  is  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  public or a member of  the  police\r\n\r\nforce,  it is the duty of the police to investigate\r\n\r\nthe  complaint. That is one of their functions  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no other organisation charged with  that\r\n\r\nduty.  The  investigating officer takes  statements\r\n\r\nfrom  all the persons concerned and from any others\r\n\r\nwho   might  have  knowledge  of  the  fact.  These\r\n\r\nstatements  and  his  report  are,  in  appropriate\r\n\r\ncases,  forwarded to the Attorney-General who  then\r\n\r\ndecides   in  his  capacity  as  Public  Prosecutor\r\n\r\nwhether  a  charge  should be brought  against  any\r\n\r\nperson. If the complaint concerns the behaviour  of\r\n\r\na  member  of the police force and it appears  from\r\n\r\nthe  investigation that there has been a breach  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline, then it is the duty of the Commissioner\r\n\r\nto  decide whether disciplinary proceedings  should\r\n\r\nbe  initiated.  This  is the  procedure  which  was\r\n\r\nfollowed  in  investigating  these  complaints  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  hon.  Members  may  feel  regarding   the\r\n\r\nsubstance - the   truth   or   falsehood    of    the\r\n\r\ncomplaints - I do ask them to put out of their  minds\r\n\r\nany suggestion that there was something abnormal or\r\n\r\nsinister about the procedure adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in detailing the results of these\r\n\r\ninvestigations,  I  shall  be  referring   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Medical Officer and I  should  like  to\r\n\r\nexplain   now   that   the   Medical   Officer   is\r\n\r\nspecifically charged with the duty of seeing  every\r\n\r\ndetainee who is temporarily confined in the Central\r\n\r\nPolice  Station every working day. Wherever he  may\r\n\r\nbe when the Medical Officer makes his rounds, he is\r\n\r\nseen  by the Medical Officer. This arrangement  has\r\n\r\nbeen made not only to ensure that the health of the\r\n\r\ndetainees  is  properly looked after  but  also  to\r\n\r\nguard against any malpractices of the type alleged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to deal in detail with the\r\n\r\nfour  cases  in which these allegations  have  been\r\n\r\nmade.  Two  of these were brought to the notice  of\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Minister by a letter from a firm\r\n\r\nof  lawyers dated 25th September last year. In  the\r\n\r\nfirst   case,  it  was  alleged  that  while  being\r\n\r\nquestioned  on  18th  September - that  was  a   week\r\n\r\npreviously  - the  detainee had  been  tied  up  and\r\n\r\npunched,   that   the  police  officers   concerned\r\n\r\nadministered   some  tablets  and   that   he   had\r\n\r\ncomplained  of  the assault to the Medical  Officer\r\n\r\nwhen  he  saw  him the following day.  The  Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer confirmed that the complaint of assault had\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to  him that day and on  examining  the\r\n\r\ndetainee he had found three minor contusions.  This\r\n\r\nfinding  had  been reported the  same  day  to  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Superintendent in charge who  questioned\r\n\r\nthe   detainee   on  how  he  had  acquired   these\r\n\r\ncontusions  to  which the reply was that  they  had\r\n\r\nresulted  from a bout of horseplay with  a  fellow-detainee.  On  26th September, the  day  after  the\r\n\r\nlawyer wrote, a private practitioner was brought in\r\n\r\nby  the  lawyer to examine both detainees.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of the first detainee, he reported finding  a\r\n\r\nfew  abrasions on the left forearm and right wrist.\r\n\r\nIn  the  course of the investigations, a  statement\r\n\r\nwas  taken from this detainee in which he said that\r\n\r\nhe had also been assaulted on 22nd August - that was\r\n\r\nthe previous month - and that he had on that occasion\r\n\r\nbeen  subjected to electric shocks. He was in  fact\r\n\r\nexamined by the Medical Officer on 23rd August - that\r\n\r\nis the day following this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  alleged assault - and the Medical Officer  had\r\n\r\nfound no trace of any injury of any kind and it  is\r\n\r\nalso  to be noted that neither in his complaint  to\r\n\r\nthe  Medical Officer on 19th September nor  in  his\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to his lawyer on 23rd September  did  he\r\n\r\nmake any mention of this alleged electric treatment\r\n\r\nunless  the lawyer did not see fit to pass  it  on.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, seems a very strange omission. Following\r\n\r\nthe  lawyer's complaint, a statement was taken from\r\n\r\nthe  second detainee concerned. In this, he alleged\r\n\r\nthat  he had been subjected to assault and electric\r\n\r\nshock on six occasions. One of these was alleged to\r\n\r\nhave  been  29th August and he made a complaint  to\r\n\r\nthe  Medical Officer the following day. The Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer  examined him and again found no  signs  of\r\n\r\nany  injury to support the allegation. When he  was\r\n\r\nexamined   by  a  private  practitioner   on   26th\r\n\r\nSeptember - that   is  about  a   month   later   and\r\n\r\nsubsequent to the further alleged assault  on  19th\r\n\r\nSeptember - the  doctor  reported  that  some   small\r\n\r\nhealing  scabs were found on various parts  of  his\r\n\r\nbody. It was alleged in his complaint to his lawyer\r\n\r\nthat   this  assault  had  taken  place   on   19th\r\n\r\nSeptember.  The Medical Officer has testified  that\r\n\r\non  that day he visited this detainee while he  was\r\n\r\nbeing   questioned  and  that  he  noticed  nothing\r\n\r\nabnormal. He added in his statement that if  anyone\r\n\r\nwere  in pain or fear he was sure that he would  be\r\n\r\nable to detect it from his expression and would  at\r\n\r\nonce question him. At an identification parade, the\r\n\r\ndetainee picked out certain police officers whom he\r\n\r\nalleged  had  assaulted him. These were  among  the\r\n\r\nofficers   who   had  questioned   him   but   they\r\n\r\nemphatically denied the allegations of assault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third case, the detainee alleged that on 16th November, he was made to take his shirt off\r\n\r\nand  stand over an air-conditioner while cold water\r\n\r\nwas  poured down his back. He also alleged that  he\r\n\r\nwas subjected to electric shock. Two days later, he\r\n\r\ncomplained  to  the  Medical Officer  who  found  a\r\n\r\nnumber of scratches on different parts of his body.\r\n\r\nThe  Medical  Officer reported the matter  and  the\r\n\r\nsenior  officer thereupon interviewed the  detainee the same day and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasked  him  if he had been assaulted  to  which  he\r\n\r\nreplied,  \"No\". On 20th November - that is  two  days\r\n\r\nlater - his lawyer arranged for him to be examined by\r\n\r\na  private  practitioner. The report  made  by  the\r\n\r\nlatter - and  this is the report to  which  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember referred - stated that tiny linear scab  marks\r\n\r\nwere visible on a number of parts of his body.  The\r\n\r\nfollowing  day, he was examined by two  specialists\r\n\r\nat  the Department of Pathology in the presence  of\r\n\r\nhis  own  private doctor who confirmed the findings\r\n\r\nof  the private doctor. They also reported that the\r\n\r\nnail  of his left little finger showed an irregular\r\n\r\nfree  margin  about 1\u00bd millimetres long  while  the\r\n\r\nnails on all the other fingers were cut down to the\r\n\r\nbase.   Their   conclusions  in   regard   to   the\r\n\r\nlesions - that is the scab marks - were that they  were\r\n\r\ndeliberately  inflicted but  that  they  could  not\r\n\r\nexclude  the  possibility  either  that  they  were\r\n\r\ncaused in the manner alleged or that they were self-inflicted.  Two days later, the lawyers wrote  that\r\n\r\nthey wished to lay a formal complaint and asked for\r\n\r\nan  identification parade. Despite  what  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  said  in  regard to Lim Chin  Joo  and  his\r\n\r\ninability to identify the persons responsible,  his\r\n\r\nlawyers   were   instructed   to   ask    for    an\r\n\r\nidentification  parade. This  parade  was  arranged\r\n\r\nthree  days later. Just before it was to  be  held,\r\n\r\nthe  detainee said he did not wish to proceed  with\r\n\r\nthe  matter  and  was not prepared  to  attend  the\r\n\r\nparade.  He was then asked whether he would  attend\r\n\r\nthe  parade in order to assist the police  inquiry.\r\n\r\nHe  declined  to  do so and the following  day  his\r\n\r\nlawyers   wrote  confirming  that  they  had   been\r\n\r\ninstructed not to proceed with the matter  for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being  adding that if further  assaults  took\r\n\r\nplace  he  would wish to proceed on this  complaint\r\n\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint in the fourth case was made in a\r\n\r\nletter  from  the  detainee's  lawyers  dated  25th\r\n\r\nNovember.  In  this  it was  alleged  that  on  5th\r\n\r\nNovember  while this detainee was being  questioned\r\n\r\nhe  had been assaulted and that on 6th November - the\r\n\r\nfollowing  day - he was made to stand over  the  air-conditioning plant while cold water was poured down his back and extreme pressure was applied\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  his  ribs. It was further alleged in the letter\r\n\r\nthat  he  lost consciousness and that a doctor  was\r\n\r\ncalled  in  who  gave him four tablets  to  relieve\r\n\r\npain.  In  a  subsequent  statement,  the  detainee\r\n\r\nsomewhat modified this story by stating that he did\r\n\r\nnot  lose consciousness. He also stated that it was\r\n\r\nimmediately after he had had cold water poured down\r\n\r\nhis back that he was instructed to sit down, to put\r\n\r\non  his shirt and to leave the room. He stated that\r\n\r\nhe  did  so  and  met the Medical  Officer  in  the\r\n\r\npassage  outside. I mention this point specifically\r\n\r\nbecause the Medical Officer has testified that when\r\n\r\nhe  examined him his skin was absolutely dry and so\r\n\r\nwere  his  clothes. It is inconceivable  that  they\r\n\r\ncould have dried off in such a short space of time.\r\n\r\nThe  Medical  Officer's evidence in  this  case  is\r\n\r\nthis; that he made his usual rounds on this day and\r\n\r\nvisited this detainee in the interrogation room. He\r\n\r\ndid  not  meet him in the passage. He says that  he\r\n\r\nsaw  nothing abnormal in the room. The detainee was\r\n\r\nfully  clothed  and fully conscious  sitting  on  a\r\n\r\nchair.  He noticed however symptoms in the detainee\r\n\r\nwhich  pointed to tuberculosis and he  gave  orders\r\n\r\nfor  him  to  be  brought to his examination  room.\r\n\r\nThere he examined him alone; no one else was in the\r\n\r\nroom. The detainee made no complaint of any assault\r\n\r\nor  ill-treatment. As a result of his  examination,\r\n\r\nthe  Medical  Officer ascertained  that  he  had  a\r\n\r\nhistory of tuberculosis and had previously attended\r\n\r\nthe  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital for  treatment.  The\r\n\r\nMedical Officer then sent him to hospital to be  X-rayed but before doing so gave him four sulphatriad\r\n\r\ntablets  to protect him against secondary infection\r\n\r\nof  the  lungs. This is the origin of the story  of\r\n\r\nthe  tablets  to relieve pain. The Medical  Officer\r\n\r\nalso stated that he found no marks on his body such\r\n\r\nas  would  have been apparent if his ribs had  been\r\n\r\nconstricted in the manner alleged. The detainee was\r\n\r\nsubsequently asked why he made no complaint of ill-treatment  to the Medical Officer at that  time  or\r\n\r\nlater to the Medical Officer at Changi where he was\r\n\r\ntransferred two days later. He said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  afraid to complain  to  the  Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer  at that time because the door of the  room\r\n\r\nwas  ajar  and  there was a police  officer  within\r\n\r\nearshot.  The statement that the door was  open  is\r\n\r\nspecifically contradicted both by the  officer  who\r\n\r\nconducted  him  to  the room  and  by  the  Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer  who states that he himself shut  the  door\r\n\r\nfor  the very purpose that the detainee should  not\r\n\r\nbe  inhibited from talking freely to him. In  reply\r\n\r\nto  the  question why he had not complained to  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Officer at Changi, the detainee said  that\r\n\r\nhe  did  make a complaint. This statement is denied\r\n\r\nby the Medical Officer concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those, Sir, are the salient facts in the four\r\n\r\ncases in which these allegations have been made. In\r\n\r\nevery   case,   the   police   officers   concerned\r\n\r\ncategorically deny that any such ill-treatment took\r\n\r\nplace. I should also add that while they are  being\r\n\r\nquestioned, constant visits are made to the room by\r\n\r\nsenior  officers  at irregular intervals  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  never  observed any treatment of  the  nature\r\n\r\nalleged.  These  cases were, as I  have  explained,\r\n\r\nvery  fully  investigated and the  results  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestigations  were  submitted  to  the  Attorney-General who decided that there were no grounds  for\r\n\r\nproceeding   on   the  complaints.   The   question\r\n\r\nnaturally  poses  itself: if these allegations  are\r\n\r\nunfounded, why were they made? The answer, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nI  suggest to be found in the activities with which\r\n\r\nthese persons have been associated. They have every\r\n\r\nincentive to try and discredit the police  who  are\r\n\r\nstriving  to  counter the subversive activities  of\r\n\r\nthemselves and those working with them.  They  also\r\n\r\nhave  every incentive to avoid being questioned  on\r\n\r\nthese  activities  and  to  hinder  the  police  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  their  tasks by bringing  them  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute.  They had in fact ample  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nconcert  the  stories  they would  tell  and  those\r\n\r\nstories might have carried more weight had  it  not\r\n\r\nbeen  for  the  wise precaution  taken  to  have  a\r\n\r\nMedical Officer visiting these detainees daily  and\r\n\r\nwhose    evidence   has   largely    brought    out\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies in the statements made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, again to appeal to hon. Members\r\n\r\nto   consider  this  motion  in  an  objective  and\r\n\r\nimpartial  spirit unclouded by emotion or prejudice\r\n\r\nand  I  do not think I can conclude better than  by\r\n\r\nquoting  the  comments made by the Medical  Officer\r\n\r\nconcerned.  I  may  say that he  is  no  longer  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service; he is now in private  practice\r\n\r\nbut  I  have  his  permission  to  quote  from  his\r\n\r\nstatement. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"From my observations of the conditions here, I\r\n\r\nwould   think  that  the  allegations  are   wholly\r\n\r\nunfounded,  malicious  and with  strong  intent  to\r\n\r\ndamage   the   good  name  of  the  police   force.\r\n\r\nIndirectly,  it is an insult to me as a  doctor  in his own rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was\r\n\r\none  of  the solicitors in the major case cited  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng).  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  think I know the whole story better  than\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown can ever know  from  the\r\n\r\ncarefully prepared brief that he read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Birds of the same feather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, the position briefly is\r\n\r\nthis. On a certain day in November, the father of a\r\n\r\ndetainee  came  to  see me at one  o'clock  when  I\r\n\r\nreturned  during the luncheon hour. He informed  me\r\n\r\nthat  his  son,  whom  he saw at  11  o'clock  that\r\n\r\nmorning,  had been assaulted and had complained  to\r\n\r\nhim  of it. I got in touch with the Director of the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch and informed him that I  wished  to\r\n\r\ninterview   my   client  with  a  private   medical\r\n\r\npractitioner whom the father was arranging for.  At\r\n\r\nhalf  past  two  that afternoon, I  interviewed  my\r\n\r\nclient together with the medical practitioner.  The\r\n\r\nreport  as the Member for Queenstown read  was  the\r\n\r\nreport which the medical practitioner gave to me. I\r\n\r\ntook   a  full  statement  myself  of  the  alleged\r\n\r\nassault, and I immediately wrote to the Director of\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch informing him of this, with  a  copy\r\n\r\nto the Bar Committee, and another copy to the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. I considered it an extremely grave and  a\r\n\r\nvery serious charge and one which should be pursued\r\n\r\nto the very end. I therefore, on instructions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasked  for  an identification parade in order  that\r\n\r\nfive  of  the police officers who could  have  been\r\n\r\nidentified,  should be identified  and  proceedings\r\n\r\ntaken   against   them.  Three  days   later,   the\r\n\r\nidentification parade was arranged. I went round to\r\n\r\nthe  Central Police Station at half past four,  and\r\n\r\nthere  I  received instructions that my client  did\r\n\r\nnot wish to proceed with the identification parade.\r\n\r\nI  explained  the  position very  carefully  to  my\r\n\r\nclient,  including the implications  which  may  be\r\n\r\ndrawn by a judge, or by any Tribunal, if he refused\r\n\r\nto  go  on with the identification parade. It ended\r\n\r\nwith  written instructions to me which  I  took  to\r\n\r\nprotect  myself,  to say that he did  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nproceed. Subsequently, Sir, I was asked, not in  my\r\n\r\ncapacity  as  a  lawyer, but in my capacity  as  an\r\n\r\nAssemblyman, to move this subject in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the democratic system is open to political\r\n\r\npropaganda,  and  is open in some eases  to  abuse.\r\n\r\nBut,  after my experience in that case, I  had  not\r\n\r\nthe  slightest  intention  of  being  a  party   to\r\n\r\nsomething  which I did not believe  was  right  and\r\n\r\nproper.  I  am  not afraid to tell the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown that, although he may think that he will\r\n\r\nget  a lot of political credit out of this - be is  a\r\n\r\nvery unwise man for many reasons, not least of  all\r\n\r\nthe fact that in his heart of hearts he knows jolly\r\n\r\nwell that this is a thoroughly dishonest motion.  I\r\n\r\nsay  this  openly and publicly, that if I  had  got\r\n\r\nthose five police officers identified, I would have\r\n\r\nprosecuted them to a conviction, and got  them  out\r\n\r\nof  the  police force, and have had the  Government\r\n\r\nhold  an  inquiry  into the whole  of  the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch.  But  I  will not be a party  to  something\r\n\r\nwhich I did not believe was true. When instructions\r\n\r\ngiven  me  were subsequently countermanded  at  the\r\n\r\nlast  moment,  it  was my duty as an  advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor, and as an officer of the Court,  not  to\r\n\r\nbe a party to some smear which I did not believe to\r\n\r\nbe right and proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that is the reason why I did not wish to\r\n\r\nbring  this matter up for debate, but I  would  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to consider carefully that although\r\n\r\na Commission could be a platform for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  propaganda,  the  Government  should  also\r\n\r\nconsider that they could clarify this position, and\r\n\r\nhave  the Inquiry to go into the facts or otherwise\r\n\r\nof   the   allegations,  and  clear  the   officers\r\n\r\nconcerned. There are pros and cons, but on balance,\r\n\r\nmy  view  is that there is more to be gained  by  a\r\n\r\nproperly conducted Inquiry - to ascertain the  facts,\r\n\r\nnot  for  the  purpose of propaganda - than  by  just\r\n\r\nthrowing out the application for an Inquiry. In  my\r\n\r\nsubmission, an experienced judge would be able, not\r\n\r\nonly  to ascertain the facts, but also to see  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  character  assassination  of  police\r\n\r\nofficers  if that is what the Government is  afraid\r\n\r\nof-in  the  course  of the Inquiry,  without  proof\r\n\r\nbeing  brought.  The judicial process  is  not  one\r\n\r\nwhich   can  be  easily  perverted  and,   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wishes  to  dismiss  these  allegations\r\n\r\ncompletely, then the proper thing to do would be to\r\n\r\nhave  this  Inquiry, and have the report tabled  in\r\n\r\nthis House for subsequent debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I speak from experience in regard to only one\r\n\r\ncase. I do not know the other three cases, and I am\r\n\r\ntherefore  not in a position either to  confirm  or\r\n\r\ndeny the allegations made. The proper tribunal  for\r\n\r\nthat  should be a judicial one. If the complainants\r\n\r\nchose not to bring it before a court, then a quasi-judicial  Tribunal  might  serve  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\ncompletely dispelling any disquiet which  may  have\r\n\r\nbeen   caused   by  the  dissemination   of   these\r\n\r\nallegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

But I should like to say to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar a word about the action  he  has\r\n\r\ntaken.  I  would like to say how much I  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  attitude he took. He has quite properly  given\r\n\r\nthe  lie to, as he says, only one case; but he  has\r\n\r\ndone  that.  The  Member for  Queenstown  does  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  have  made any enquiry  himself  before\r\n\r\nputting  before this House a motion that he  admits\r\n\r\nmay  be true or may be false - he does not know;  he\r\n\r\nhas  not  enquired.  Apparently  he  has  not  even\r\n\r\nbothered  to  find out. Now, having had irrefutable\r\n\r\nevidence  that  one  of these four  allegations  is\r\n\r\nfalse  from the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  and\r\n\r\nhaving  heard  the  facts given by  the  completely\r\n\r\ndisinterested Chief Secretary who was not  even  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or responsible for the police  force  at\r\n\r\nthe time, there can, to my mind, be no question  of\r\n\r\nthe  view  this House will take when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\ndecide what should be done with this motion. But in\r\n\r\ncase   Members  are  considering  the  very  proper\r\n\r\nremarks of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  about\r\n\r\nthe  merits of the judicial process, may I just say\r\n\r\nthat the judicial process is not one that should be\r\n\r\nabused  by  being invoked in cases that  are  quite\r\n\r\ntransparently unworthy of credence. I am  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  value  of those processes and I  have  to  act\r\n\r\nquasi-judicially in arriving at decisions I make as\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor.  But I  do  say  that  in  this\r\n\r\ncase - first,  there  is  clearly  no  call  for  any\r\n\r\nenquiry; second, that at this length of time it  is\r\n\r\nextremely doubtful whether any useful purpose would\r\n\r\nbe  served,  particularly as it is  now,  I  think,\r\n\r\nobvious   that  whatever  complaints  or   whatever\r\n\r\ngrievances  these  four  people  may  now  consider\r\n\r\nthemselves  to be suffering from, it  is  extremely\r\n\r\nunlikely  that,  they having had  these  months  to\r\n\r\nprepare,  a judicial enquiry would be more  than  a\r\n\r\nplatform  of  the type that the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar so deprecates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally my third reason for suggesting that no\r\n\r\njudicial enquiry is called for is that to have  one when the facts have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  so  plainly established would be an abuse  of\r\n\r\nthe process and quite patently a waste of its time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I am surprised that this\r\n\r\nmotion  was  filed in the name of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and not in the name of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar.  When  the  Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nlaments in the name of human rights that the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  is  quiet, the Liberal-Socialists  are  also\r\n\r\nquiet,  the P.A.P. are also quiet, the trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders are also quiet, and only he champions it, I\r\n\r\nfind  that  he  has plunged into the  whole  matter\r\n\r\nwithout seeing exactly where the way leads.  If  it\r\n\r\nis publicity that he wants, probably he may have  a\r\n\r\nsmall  amount  of it - but if he is facing  realities\r\n\r\nand  acting sanely, then to bring a matter of  this\r\n\r\nnature  to  this  Assembly needs real  and  careful investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been given a copy of the complaints\r\n\r\nthat  he read out at length to this House. In fact,\r\n\r\nI  have  not  wanted to initiate any move  at  all,\r\n\r\nbecause  if there is any move that is going  to  be\r\n\r\ninitiated, it should be the leader of the Party one\r\n\r\nof  whose members is under detention. If the leader\r\n\r\nof the People's Action Party has found no fault, or\r\n\r\nhas  found it unnecessary to move a motion of  that\r\n\r\ntype,  then I think anybody else moving it and  not\r\n\r\nknowing  the facts as well as he did would be  just\r\n\r\nwasting the time of everybody in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nmotion  that has been moved by the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown confirms the view which I formed when  I\r\n\r\nspoke  on  the Governor's Speech. I said  that  the\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements  in Singapore  are  now  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  best  to seek new fronts, as the old  fronts\r\n\r\nhave  been  lost to them, by finding  stooges  from\r\n\r\namong   persons  who  are  prepared  to  prostitute\r\n\r\nthemselves for their own ends; and this, I am sorry\r\n\r\nto say, Sir, leads one to think that perhaps what I\r\n\r\nsaid  two  days ago is being proved this afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe  hon. Member came here saying that he does  not\r\n\r\nknow the facts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the case, and then he presented them in such  a\r\n\r\nway  as  if  he  is  the one and only  champion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore of subversive elements. He said that  not\r\n\r\none  organisation - neither the  P.A.P.,  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront,   the  Liberal-Socialists  nor   the   trade\r\n\r\nunions - in Singapore has raised a finger in  protest\r\n\r\nor has championed this particular cause. I am happy\r\n\r\nto  hear, Sir, that in Singapore there are a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of organisations and individuals who can  no\r\n\r\nlonger be hood-winked by subversive forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was indeed touched by the speech of the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar. I listened to  him  with\r\n\r\nrespect and with admiration - his is indeed  a  very\r\n\r\nsober and responsible speech. I would have liked to\r\n\r\nagree  to  his suggestion that perhaps it might  be\r\n\r\nbetter  in the interests of the Government that  an\r\n\r\nenquiry should be held into this, but, as has  been\r\n\r\nstated  by  the  Attorney-General, because  of  the\r\n\r\nlapse of time, the appointment of such a commission\r\n\r\nwould  not  help at all but would just  be  playing\r\n\r\ninto  the hands of these subversive elements, whose\r\n\r\none  and only desire is to make their voices heard.\r\n\r\nLet us drown their voices with louder, stronger and\r\n\r\nhealthier  voices  among the democratic  forces  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Government, Sir,  is  against  the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the emotional feeling which the Member for Queenstown brought to\r\n\r\nthis matter is one for which I have great sympathy.\r\n\r\nI  recollect  a case not so very long  ago,  before\r\n\r\nthis  Government came into power, when a man jumped\r\n\r\nfrom  a window of the interrogation Room and killed\r\n\r\nhimself. I wrote to all the newspapers and a lot of\r\n\r\nother people saying that this was rather a doubtful\r\n\r\nprocedure  and  ought  to be investigated.  When  I\r\n\r\nbecame a Minister, the matter was still close to my\r\n\r\nheart  and I spoke to the then Chief Minister,  Mr\r\n\r\nDavid Marshall, and pressed on him the need that he\r\n\r\nshould satisfy himself most fully that there was no\r\n\r\nfear that torture might be used in interrogating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetainees.  He shared my views and subsequently  he\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  he  had been into the  matter  very\r\n\r\nthoroughly, by personal visits, by inspections,  by\r\n\r\nascertaining  regulations, by finding  out  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat the procedures were, and he assured me that he\r\n\r\nwas  absolutely certain that there  was  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to suppose that the sort of method which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown has brought  before  us\r\n\r\nwas, in fact, employed or likely to be employed  or\r\n\r\ncould  be  employed safely without a  certainty  of\r\n\r\ndetection in a not very long space of time. I  just\r\n\r\nmention  this very briefly because I feel that  the\r\n\r\nformer Chief Minister's views on this sort of thing\r\n\r\nare  well known and that he at that time had  fully\r\n\r\nassented  to  the  view  that  the  allegations  of\r\n\r\ntorture  that were made then as well  as  now  were unfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think most Members sitting\r\n\r\nin  this  House are aware that I had  practised  27\r\n\r\nyears  in the courts of this colony and I have  had\r\n\r\nmy  fair share of criminal practice. In the  course\r\n\r\nof  my  practice I never hesitated to  condemn  the\r\n\r\npolice  when I felt condemnation necessary,  and  I\r\n\r\nhad  never hesitated to commend the police  when  I\r\n\r\nfelt   that  commendation  was  due.  I  extend   a\r\n\r\nfraternal hand, as a member of the Bar, to the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar for upholding  the  high\r\n\r\ntraditions  of the profession which he and  I  have\r\n\r\nchosen.  When he realises that any allegation  made\r\n\r\nis  dishonest, and the motion which is now  brought\r\n\r\nup is dishonest, he has the courage to say so. That\r\n\r\nis  the tradition in which we have been brought up.\r\n\r\nI  would  never hesitate to act, even as a Minister\r\n\r\ntoday,  if I find malpractices in the police force.\r\n\r\nI  would  fight  any  of them, the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nincluded,  if  I  felt it necessary.  I  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough the whole of the papers in this case and  I\r\n\r\nam fully satisfied that there is no truth in any of\r\n\r\nthese  allegations;  furthermore  it  would  be   a\r\n\r\npositive  waste  of time to have judicial  officers\r\n\r\nsitting in a court of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad\r\n\r\nthat the Chief Secretary has given the Government's\r\n\r\nview on this issue. Every case has two sides to it.\r\n\r\nI  gave my side and he gave his side, it is now  up\r\n\r\nto  us  to  decide whether we should or should  not\r\n\r\nhave a commission of inquiry. It is not up to us to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether the allegations are true or not.  I\r\n\r\nam  rather surprised that this issue has worked  up\r\n\r\nthe  emotions of the Minister for Health. As I have\r\n\r\nemphasised   again   and   again,   whether   these\r\n\r\nallegations are true or false, let us leave them in\r\n\r\nthe hands of the commission of inquiry, and not let\r\n\r\nus - 25   elected  representatives,  three   colonial\r\n\r\nofficials and four nominated Members - decide whether\r\n\r\nthey are true or not. The facts can only be in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Government and not Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  So we cannot decide whether  they  are\r\n\r\ntrue or not. It is only the Government who can  say\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are true or not,  but  it  is  their\r\n\r\nstory. Let the story of the opposite side come into\r\n\r\nthe hands of the commission of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answering the Chief Secretary that when I move\r\n\r\nthis  motion  it  was  on the assumption  that  the\r\n\r\nallegations  are  true, I again  emphasise  that  I\r\n\r\nnever  assumed that they are true. What I  did  say\r\n\r\nwas  that  after reading the papers sent to  me.  I\r\n\r\nfelt it my duty, in the name of humanity and social\r\n\r\njustice,  to see that something should be done.  It\r\n\r\nis   not  a  question  of  whether  I  believe   or\r\n\r\ndisbelieve those allegations are true. If they  are\r\n\r\ntrue, then it is bad; and if they are untrue,  then\r\n\r\nit  is  far worse because the Government have  just\r\n\r\ncommitted  themselves when they said they  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to set up this commission of inquiry.  If\r\n\r\nit  is  the  Government's story - and they  have  the\r\n\r\ncomplete facts - that the allegations are untrue, why\r\n\r\nthen   are  they  not  prepared  to  set  up   this\r\n\r\ncommission  and  hold  an inquiry?  There  must  be\r\n\r\nsomething that is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary said that the police are the\r\n\r\nproper authority to carry out the investigations. I\r\n\r\nappreciate  that,  because  the  police  force   is\r\n\r\nestablished  to  carry out investigations  and  not\r\n\r\njust to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsit idle; but the point is this, Sir, that in these\r\n\r\nparticular  cases  the police  themselves  are  the\r\n\r\ninterested  party. The Member for Changi  yesterday\r\n\r\nor  the  day  before yesterday rightly pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  Commissioner of  Police  relies  on  his\r\n\r\nAssistant  or  Deputy Commissioner of  Police.  The\r\n\r\nlatter  in  turn  relies on the Superintendents  of\r\n\r\nPolice   who  rely  on  the  Deputy  or   Assistant\r\n\r\nSuperintendents  of Police who rely  on  the  Chief\r\n\r\nInspectors who rely on the Staff Sergeants who rely\r\n\r\non  the  privates. Can the Commissioner of  Police,\r\n\r\nwho  directs the Special Branch, who themselves are\r\n\r\nthe persons who have detained these people, can  he\r\n\r\nor  the  Attorney-General  or  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nexpect  to have a proper, unbiased and unprejudiced\r\n\r\nreport?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

If so,  I\r\n\r\nappreciate  the procedure mentioned  by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary.  These  allegations  have  caused  world\r\n\r\ninterest.  They  have aroused  the  interest  of  a\r\n\r\nMember   of  Parliament.  They  have  aroused   the\r\n\r\ninterest of trade unions in foreign countries. Such\r\n\r\nallegations are very grave. Is the Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\nprepared  to  say that the procedure applicable  to\r\n\r\nminor offences be adopted in this case? Is that the\r\n\r\nproper way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary also admitted that at one time\r\n\r\ntwo detainees identified three police officers, but\r\n\r\nthese  three police officers denied the allegations\r\n\r\nof  torture. Are the Government prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nthe   denial  of  these  police  officers?  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are prepared to do so, why not they then\r\n\r\naccept the allegations that they are true?

If the Commissioner\r\n\r\nis  prepared to accept their word, it is their word\r\n\r\nagainst  another's.

What I\r\n\r\nactually  said was that the two medical specialists\r\n\r\nstated  in their report that they could not exclude\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of the injuries being  caused  as\r\n\r\nalleged or being self-inflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Now, as the Chief Secretary has admitted,\r\n\r\nthe   medical   report  could   not   exclude   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of one or the other - that the  injuries\r\n\r\nmight   have  been  caused  as  alleged,  or  self-inflicted,  which means that there is a  doubt.  So the  medical officer himself cannot say one way  or\r\n\r\nthe  other.  There is a possibility of one  or  the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary again said that at one time\r\n\r\nhe  was  asked why a complaint was not  lodged - that\r\n\r\nrefers  to Lim Chin Joo. I think - and Lim  Chin  Joo\r\n\r\nsaid  he had not lodged a complaint because he  was\r\n\r\nafraid  of  the presence of a police officer.  That\r\n\r\nclearly  indicates what I have said in  my  speech - that whilst a detainee is under the supervision and detention of the police, he is afraid to submit any\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  and the presence of a  police  officer outside his-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Point of clarification, Sir, The\r\n\r\nstatement to which the hon.

Again I gave a  number  of\r\n\r\nreasons  why  he  refused to have an identification\r\n\r\nparade - fear   of  further  torture   under   police\r\n\r\ndetention  or confinement - and again the police  are\r\n\r\nthemselves in fact an interested party. So that  is\r\n\r\nthe   reason  why  this  detainee  instructed   his\r\n\r\nsolicitor  that he was prepared to  go  without  an\r\n\r\nidentification parade. This is not very  important,\r\n\r\nSir,  but the important issue which the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar brought up is that this motion  is  a\r\n\r\ndishonest motion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I  filed\r\n\r\nthis  motion not for glory, not for gain,  and  not\r\n\r\nfor publicity. I do not want glory because I do not\r\n\r\nneed glory. For gain, I am not a lawyer and if I do\r\n\r\ntake  this  case  up, I will not be  paid.  As  for\r\n\r\npublicity,  I know quite a number of newspapers  do\r\n\r\nnot give me publicity. It is up to the Press not to\r\n\r\ngive me publicity, but publicity to the torture  of\r\n\r\nthe  four detainees is more important than personal\r\n\r\npublicity. The hon. Member said that he disbelieved\r\n\r\nthe  facts as contained in the allegations. Whether\r\n\r\nhe  disbelieves  them  or not,  each  has  his  own\r\n\r\nopinion.  But what I am happy to note  is  that  he\r\n\r\nbelieves in one thing - and that is that a commission\r\n\r\nof  inquiry  be set up. I am happy that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar agrees with me on this particular\r\n\r\nissue, if not on the whole motion. Sir, he believes\r\n\r\nit, but the Government say they are not prepared to\r\n\r\nset  up  a commission. Again I may say that  it  is\r\n\r\njust  a  refutation  of  the allegations,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are not prepared. The Chief Minister has\r\n\r\na  lot of respect for the Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\nWhy not give him that respect about his belief that\r\n\r\na commission should be set up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Attorney-General said that before I\r\n\r\nbrought  this motion to the Assembly I should  have\r\n\r\nmade  enquiries about the facts, and  that  when  I\r\n\r\nended my speech I confessed or admitted that I  was\r\n\r\nnot  competent to say whether the allegations  were\r\n\r\nfalse  or true. Sir, to obtain information or  make\r\n\r\nenquiries from the Government, I have to go through\r\n\r\na  lot of red tape. As an elected representative of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  feel it is my duty, once a case has been brought\r\n\r\nto  my  notice, to bring it to the notice  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, whether the allegations in the  case  are\r\n\r\ntrue or not, and let it decide. Whether I have made\r\n\r\ninvestigations to ascertain if there  is  truth  in\r\n\r\nthe allegations, I wish to say once again that this\r\n\r\nissue  has aroused the interest of foreigners,  and\r\n\r\nif  it has done that, why should it not arouse  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people of  Singapore  and  their\r\n\r\nelected  representatives? The trade union  movement\r\n\r\nin   the  United  Kingdom,  as  I  have  said,  has\r\n\r\nsubmitted a very strong protest. If the allegations\r\n\r\nare  not  true,  I  doubt whether the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement there would have sent in that protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon is surprised that the\r\n\r\nleader  of the P.A.P. has not filed in this  motion\r\n\r\nand  it has now come in the name of the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Quite so! It is! There is no\r\n\r\nsurprise, Sir. Why should there be surprise? Is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary that I should belong to a Party, or these\r\n\r\ndetainees or members of the public should belong to\r\n\r\na  Party, to bring their cases to this Assembly? I,\r\n\r\nfor one, as an elected representative, do represent\r\n\r\nthe  people,  irrespective of what  Party  or  what\r\n\r\ncolour  they  belong to. As long as I have  a  case\r\n\r\nwhich  I  feel should be taken up in  the  name  of\r\n\r\njustice, I do so. I act accordingly: I do not  play\r\n\r\nparty politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister says that there are stooges in\r\n\r\nSingapore and that the subversive elements are  now\r\n\r\ntrying  to find a new front. Sir, does he  classify\r\n\r\nany  elected representative or public spirited  man\r\n\r\nto  be  a  stooge if he is prepared to represent  a\r\n\r\ncase to this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly? If so, this is not the only time  that  a\r\n\r\nmotion  is filed. This is not the only time that  a\r\n\r\nMember of this House has represented cases to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly and, that being so, those who have brought\r\n\r\ncases  or motions to this Assembly are nothing  but\r\n\r\nstooges.  Mr  Awberry, a Member of  the  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons  and a Member of the British Labour  Party,\r\n\r\nasked  a question regarding this case in the House.\r\n\r\nIs  he  then a stooge? If we are stooges,  then  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  classified as a stooge. If  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House are stooges, then Members of the  House\r\n\r\nof Commons must also definitely be stooges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I look at it, Sir, after hearing the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  story  and the  speech  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar, who has definite  facts\r\n\r\nabout  the  case, there appears to me  to  be  some\r\n\r\ndoubt  as  to whether the allegations are  true  or\r\n\r\nnot. In a court of law, the magistrate always gives\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the doubt to the accused.  I,  Sir,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the cases, am considered  to  be  the\r\n\r\naccused, and I feel that there is some doubt  about\r\n\r\nthem;  so let us clear that doubt. The doubt  is  a\r\n\r\nvery big one. Let us set up a commission of inquiry\r\n\r\nto clear it up. It is now one word against another.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  said,  \"No,  the  allegations  are\r\n\r\ntrue.\"  On  the  Opposition  Benches,  one  or  two\r\n\r\nMembers  have supported me - the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar is supporting me to a small extent; he thinks\r\n\r\nthe  allegations may or may not be true. So let  us\r\n\r\nset  up  this  commission of inquiry.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will change their minds and set it up so\r\n\r\nas  to  clear the reputation of the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe police force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 4; Noes, 19; Abstention, 1.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     Ayes.

The  House\r\n\r\nwill remember that this Court of inquiry was set up\r\n\r\nas  a  consequence of a motion which I moved urging\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Welfare to  set  up  a\r\n\r\ncommission of inquiry to investigate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  go-slow  then in being  at  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board.  It is now seven months  since  the\r\n\r\nfindings and the recommendations of the Court  were\r\n\r\npublished,  and it is a matter for  regret  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  to move this motion to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  House to the fact that a quasi-government body\r\n\r\nhad    chosen    to   flout   the   findings    and\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Court of Inquiry  when  they\r\n\r\nwere not to its liking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to give a short historical\r\n\r\noutline  of the beginnings of the dispute before  I\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  findings. The House will  remember\r\n\r\nthat in May and June of last year there was a great\r\n\r\ndeal of unrest in the Singapore Harbour Board which\r\n\r\nwas  triggered off when a go-slow was called  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  confiscation of the  pass  of  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary of the Singapore  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association. But as was clearly brought  out\r\n\r\nat  the Court of Inquiry, the causes of the go-slow\r\n\r\nwent much deeper than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the hearings of the Court, certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations were made for an interim settlement\r\n\r\nto  hold the position while the Court enquired into\r\n\r\nthe  facts. It is a matter for regret that on  each\r\n\r\nand  every  occasion  the Singapore  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nchose  somehow  or  the other to  circumvent  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations for an interim settlement. Far from\r\n\r\nthe position becoming clearer and more resolved, it\r\n\r\nhas now reached the point today where there is open\r\n\r\nvictimisation of any worker who is associated  with\r\n\r\nthe  Union,  that  is the Singapore  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Serangoon indicated that\r\n\r\nhe  thought the Singapore Harbour Board is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  organ  of the Singapore  Government.  He\r\n\r\nthought  that it was imperative that the livelihood\r\n\r\nof Singapore should be looked after, and I am quite\r\n\r\nsure  he will agree with me that it is a matter  of\r\n\r\nparamount  importance  that  industrial  peace  and\r\n\r\nharmony  should  be maintained between  the  labour\r\n\r\nforce and the Singapore Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after a sitting of about two weeks the Court\r\n\r\nof Inquiry made these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfindings - these appear at page 7 of Sessional  Paper No. S 7 of 1957:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\"Industrial Relations</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.-(1) The evidence provided by the parties to\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  before this Court  showed  that  much\r\n\r\ncould  have  been achieved towards  minimising  the\r\n\r\nconflict  between the two groups if  a  better  and\r\n\r\nmore  continuous  use had been made  of  the  joint\r\n\r\nconsultative machinery created under the  Agreement\r\n\r\nof  1955.  If the machinery is, for some reason  or\r\n\r\nother, clumsy and not capable of lending itself  as\r\n\r\na  pliable  instrument  to smooth  over  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations, then it is our opinion that it should be\r\n\r\nrevised. It should not be difficult for the SHB and\r\n\r\nthe  unions working within the authority, to evolve\r\n\r\na   scheme  similar  to  Joint  Councils   now   so\r\n\r\nsuccessfully in operation in the Civil Service  and\r\n\r\nthe City Council of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the General Secretary's Pass is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  one of those matters that  could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  treated  much  more speedily  had  discussion\r\n\r\ntaken place in a relatively unclouded atmosphere at\r\n\r\nthe level of the instrumentality we have mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter  of  fact, the entire  dispute  could\r\n\r\npossibly  have  been  encompassed  within  narrower\r\n\r\nlimits,  had the parties been able to \"talk  things\r\n\r\nover\" as it is possible in the Whitley procedure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  then  it  goes on to the issue of recognition,\r\n\r\nand  these  are specific findings which  the  Court\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\"The Issue of Recognition</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) It is because of the disorder in\r\n\r\nadministration  that  it was difficult  for  us  to\r\n\r\narrive  at a clear-cut finding on the issue related\r\n\r\nto the second term of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was quite clear that the seven unions,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the Singapore Harbour Board Labour  Union,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Wharf and Ship  Labour  Union,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Harbour  Board  Stevedore   and   Wharf\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union, the Confederation of the Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese   Engineering  Tradesmen,   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  Engineering  Workmen's  Union,  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Seamen's Union of Singapore and the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard Employees Union of Singapore, were not-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and this is my emphasis-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"not representative of all daily-rated employees of\r\n\r\nthe SHB, nor in fact do they represent a majority\r\n\r\nor even a sizeable proportion of such group of\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the case of the SHBSA-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is the Union that was in dispute with the Harbour Board-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"the question of whether or not it is\r\n\r\nrepresentative of a majority of workers in the SHB,\r\n\r\nis more difficult and clouded by the effect of\r\n\r\ndisorderly administrative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractices  in  the keeping of books,  accounts  and\r\n\r\nother  papers,  and  with  inadequate  routine   of\r\n\r\nnotification  of  changes,  particularly   on   the\r\n\r\nalteration  of the Association's rules  to  include\r\n\r\nall employees of the S.H.B.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Court made this recommendation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We would suggest that such evidence be collected\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of a secret ballot by members  whose\r\n\r\nnames  appear on the membership cards of the  SHBWU\r\n\r\nand  the SHBSA. The question to be asked should  be\r\n\r\nwhether  or not each one of these men supports  the\r\n\r\nSHBSA.  The ballot could be easily arranged by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Labour  in  co-operation  with   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade Unions and the  Supervisor  of\r\n\r\nElections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked a question in this Assembly whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour was going to implement the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of a secret ballot, and  he  replied\r\n\r\nto  me  that  he was investigating the  matter  and\r\n\r\nwould find out the views of unions in Singapore  on\r\n\r\nthis   issue   to  determine  recognition   or   no\r\n\r\nrecognition  for the union. It is  more  than  five\r\n\r\nmonths  since the question was tabled and answered,\r\n\r\nand I would like to know whether he has made up his\r\n\r\nmind  on  this  recommendation  of  the  Court   of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  That is a big issue, and I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  fair  for  me  to  put  it  bluntly - it  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical  issue  involving seven or  eight  little\r\n\r\nunions in the Singapore Harbour Board some of which\r\n\r\nare  known to be connected with some Members of the\r\n\r\nLabour Front - like the Assistant Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Welfare - some  connected with  other  political\r\n\r\nParties,  and  the  Singapore Harbour  Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation,  of which I am the legal adviser,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore believed to be connected with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important that we should try\r\n\r\nand  keep  clear in our minds two issues: one,  the\r\n\r\nsimple  issue of trade union practice and what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wishes  to foster; two,  the  political\r\n\r\nconsequence of implementing any principle or ruling\r\n\r\nof trade union practice and procedure. I have tried\r\n\r\nvery  hard  in the last few months to  arrange,  if\r\n\r\npossible,  to get all these little unions  absorbed\r\n\r\ninto  one federation. Unfortunately it has not been\r\n\r\npossible  to  do this and I think we  must  take  a\r\n\r\nstand on this question of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot and the recognition of  whether  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour  Board  Staff  Association  does\r\n\r\nrepresent a majority of the workers in the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is more deplorable is that the Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board had chosen to flout certain specific\r\n\r\nminor  recommendations. This was  the  finding  and\r\n\r\nrecommendation  as  regards  the  case  of  the  26\r\n\r\nlascars. It said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(iv) We have given a good deal of thought to the\r\n\r\nmatter of the 26 lascars [who were dismissed]. From\r\n\r\nthe  evidence given and having regard to the danger\r\n\r\nto  life  and  property which arose  when  the  men\r\n\r\nstopped work, it is not unreasonable to expect  the\r\n\r\nSHB  to  act  as  they did with regard  to  the  26\r\n\r\nlascars.  However, we consider that  this  stoppage\r\n\r\nwas   related  to  the  general  industrial  unrest\r\n\r\nprevailing  at  that time and accordingly  we  feel\r\n\r\nthat the men should be re-employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SHB has stated before us that it considers\r\n\r\nitself a good employer. For this reason it did  not\r\n\r\ndismiss  the 3 serangs and the other 6 lascars  and\r\n\r\nre-employed  another.  We  feel  that   the   Board\r\n\r\nfollowing  further this very wise  and  broadminded\r\n\r\nattitude, should re-engage the 25 dismissed lascars\r\n\r\nstill out of work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not only were these 26 lascars not re-engaged until very much later - and some 12 of them\r\n\r\nhave   still  not  been  re-engaged - the   Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board also chose to ignore another finding\r\n\r\nand  recommendation, that is  in  regard  to  other\r\n\r\npersonnel who were suspended as a result of the go-slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(v) There may be a number of former employees of\r\n\r\nthe  Board  still awaiting reengagement.  They  may\r\n\r\nhave been dismissed by the Board during the go slow\r\n\r\nand  their  place taken by new personnel.  We  feel\r\n\r\nthat  these men should not be too severely  treated\r\n\r\nfor  following  an  industrial practice  recognised\r\n\r\nwhere  trade unionism is in operation. The go  slow\r\n\r\nwas  a  general movement and the men  followed  the\r\n\r\ninstructions  of  their Union.  They  have  already\r\n\r\nsuffered  a loss of wages and of overtime benefits.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Port is again in full operation  and\r\n\r\nfor the promotion of improved industrial relations,\r\n\r\nwe are of the opinion that it is desirable that any\r\n\r\nsuch  men  should  be speedily re-employed  as  the\r\n\r\nBoard  will find possible. We do not think that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  very difficult - at least not as difficult\r\n\r\nas it was submitted to us during the proceedings-to\r\n\r\nconvince  serangs that they should take back  their\r\n\r\nformer gang members, and to re-engage the remaining\r\n\r\nM.E. personnel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the findings were published, there were\r\n\r\nsome  several  hundred  workers  still  unemployed.\r\n\r\nThroughout   the  whole  of  the  proceedings   the\r\n\r\nargument put forward by the Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nabout  not  being able to absorb these men  rapidly\r\n\r\nwas  that it would dislocate the new gangs they had\r\n\r\njust put up, and that serangs and mandores were not\r\n\r\nvery keen on getting back into their gangs men  who\r\n\r\nhad  joined  the go slow, and also because  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  they  had engaged new men. Therefore  the\r\n\r\nCourt gave them some latitude and time to make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  adjustment.  But  far  from  making  the\r\n\r\nnecessary adjustment, the Board went out of its way\r\n\r\nin  not taking back 200 odd men, keeping out the 25\r\n\r\nlascars   and  punishing  the  men  whom   it   had\r\n\r\nreabsorbed.  I will come back to how  it  practised\r\n\r\nthis mild form - I would not say \"mild\", I would  say\r\n\r\nit is \"oblique\" form of punishment. But I think the\r\n\r\nChief Minister will remember that I had seen him on\r\n\r\nmany   occasions  both  with  and   without   Union\r\n\r\nCommittee  members, to try and  get  the  Board  to\r\n\r\naccept  these men back to work, and he had on  many\r\n\r\noccasions given his firm assurance that they  would\r\n\r\nbe  taken back and that the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Inquiry would be implemented. In fact, the\r\n\r\nHouse will remember how certain gentlemen, who  are\r\n\r\nnot  here today, tried to make political issue  out\r\n\r\nof the hunger strike called by the 200 men who were\r\n\r\nnot  taken  back to work. The Chief  Minister  then\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he did not want to succumb to political\r\n\r\nblackmail  and refused to do anything  until  after\r\n\r\nthe  elections. Well, after the elections  he  took\r\n\r\nthem  back to work; but although some 200 men  were\r\n\r\ntaken back, the Board has still kept out 12 lascars\r\n\r\nand  10 other men who have offered themselves  back\r\n\r\nfor re-employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is no reason given why this thing has\r\n\r\nnot been done. The Chief Minister has called up, as\r\n\r\nI   understand  it - although  I  have  no   personal\r\n\r\nknowledge  of it - he has called up the new  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Harbour Board on  at  least  two\r\n\r\noccasions. After\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  occasion  he  informed me  that  it  might  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  get the men back to the dockyard - the\r\n\r\n12  lascars - because  the Harbour  Board  felt  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  about the lascars walking out on  a  ship\r\n\r\ncoming  in.  Mind  you, all  this  must  have  been\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered by a court of inquiry  and  a\r\n\r\nrecommendation had been made that they should be re-engaged,  and  in fact more than half  of  the  men\r\n\r\ninvolved in that walk-out had been re-engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing has been done. At one time it was\r\n\r\nbelieved  that this was because the former Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the Harbour Board, one Mr Chrimes, was a  very\r\n\r\nobdurate  and obstinate man and not susceptible  to\r\n\r\nreason  even from his superiors in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry. He has gone gratuitously  on\r\n\r\nretirement and a new Chairman has taken his  place.\r\n\r\nThe  new  Chairman  is  a man  who  has  also  been\r\n\r\nconnected  with the Harbour Board during the  years\r\n\r\nof  Mr  Chrimes'  chairmanship.  Now,  Sir,  quite\r\n\r\nbriefly what I would like to know from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour and Welfare is this: Is he sincere when\r\n\r\nhe  says, yes, the men will be taken back  and  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  the Court of  Inquiry  will  be\r\n\r\nhonoured?  If so, has he not got the power  as  the\r\n\r\nhead  of  the  Government  to  tell  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board what should be done and what is right\r\n\r\nand proper?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very simply, as I see it, either the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  is not pressing very hard on the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,  or the Harbour Board is acting in  defiance\r\n\r\nof his wishes. If that is so, I think the remedy is\r\n\r\nopen in his hands. I stated earlier in this sitting\r\n\r\nof  the House that if and when we form a government\r\n\r\nwe  would  not just complain like the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry that heads  of  departments\r\n\r\nignore circulars which are given to them that  they\r\n\r\nshould  give preference to local goods and  so  on.\r\n\r\nThey  are prejudiced and of course he said he would\r\n\r\nlike to take action. We would take immediate action\r\n\r\nif  our  directives were flouted. Now the Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour   Board   may   be  a  public   corporation\r\n\r\nconstituted  under  the  Singapore  Harbour   Board\r\n\r\nOrdinance, but the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the  Board of  Directors  and  the\r\n\r\nChairman  is  one which is done by the Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and if he does not know how  to  exercise\r\n\r\nhis  authority,  and  the  Attorney-General  cannot\r\n\r\nadvise   him   how   to  exercise   his   authority\r\n\r\nindirectly, then I am quite prepared to advise  him\r\n\r\nhow it can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for various reasons there has not been\r\n\r\ndirect  industrial action taken as a result of  all\r\n\r\nthis. We patiently sent delegation after delegation\r\n\r\nto  see  the Chief Minister. There was some  little\r\n\r\nresult  each time. First, two hundred odd men  were\r\n\r\ntaken  back  after  the elections  when  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  took them back. Then one of the  men  was\r\n\r\nnot  taken back. Contrary to what the Harbour Board\r\n\r\nhad  promised, they sent one of the men who offered\r\n\r\nhimself for re-employment for a medical check,  and\r\n\r\nthey rejected him because they said he did not pass\r\n\r\nthe   medical   check.  But  it  had  been   agreed\r\n\r\nbeforehand  that  there would be no  medical  check\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were old men, old  workers  offering\r\n\r\nthemselves to be re-engaged; they checked this  man\r\n\r\nout  and applied pressure. They locked up his house\r\n\r\nand  all  his  belongings, S.H.B. quarters.  Again,\r\n\r\nrepresentations  were made to the  Chief  Minister;\r\n\r\nsome  pressure  was put on the Harbour  Board;  the\r\n\r\nseizure  of  the  quarters was  cancelled  and  the\r\n\r\nquarters  reopened. But the man is  still  not  re-engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, of course, those men who were not re-engaged had their housing passes confiscated. This\r\n\r\nis   the   kind  of  harassing  which  I   consider\r\n\r\ncontemptible   when   it  comes   from   a   public\r\n\r\ncorporation.  First,  they took  away  the  housing\r\n\r\npasses; then they sent the Harbour Board police  on\r\n\r\nrounds  and  they  said,  \"Ah,  you  are  on  these\r\n\r\npremises   without   a  housing   card   -you   are\r\n\r\ntrespassing within the meaning of such and  such  a\r\n\r\nsection of the. Singapore Harbour Board Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\nSo  the  matter goes to court. So we went to  court\r\n\r\nand  we had the same gentleman, Mr Rhind, who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  investigated  for  corrupt  practices,  whose\r\n\r\nactivities  were  thoroughly  investigated  by  the\r\n\r\nC.P.I.B.,  and  on  whom there was  a  considerable\r\n\r\namount of evidence, to give evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  agreed  that on his instructions certain  cards\r\n\r\nhad  been forcibly taken away from a man.  He  also\r\n\r\nagreed that two of the men who were prosecuted, and\r\n\r\non  whom  they  were hoping to get a conviction  in\r\n\r\norder  to apply the heat on all the other men,  had\r\n\r\nbeen living in those quarters for not less than  10\r\n\r\nyears.  They were prosecuted for trespass. But  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate  threw out the case, as was  only  right\r\n\r\nand proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are still 12 lascars and 10 other\r\n\r\nlabourers  not re-engaged. The Chief Minister  said\r\n\r\nhe  would try and get the 12 lascars absorbed,  not\r\n\r\ninto the dockyard, but into some other section. But\r\n\r\nmeanwhile  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board,   taking\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the patient attitude, and  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  interpreted as weakness on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nUnion,  have  put  the heat on inside  the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard. So all those men who are known to be members\r\n\r\nand supporters of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation get punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the subtle way in which they do it.\r\n\r\nThey  used to give these men a minimum of six kangs\r\n\r\na  week. As one kang is one period of eight  hours,\r\n\r\nplus  over-time as and when over-time is available,\r\n\r\nthe  average would be about 12 kangs a  week;  most\r\n\r\nprobably they give some 12, some 14. Now during the\r\n\r\ngo slow, the Labour Department, with the active co-operation of some of the union leaders referred  to\r\n\r\nin  the Report as those not representing any men at\r\n\r\nall,  were able to get a number of new workers into\r\n\r\nthe   Harbour  Board.  I  do  not  want  to  repeat\r\n\r\nallegations   of   corruption.  But,   apart   from\r\n\r\nallegations  of how they got the jobs,  the  Board,\r\n\r\nfar  from  putting these new men into spare  gangs,\r\n\r\ncasual gangs, as was directed by the Court, and re-engaging the old men, have put all the old men into\r\n\r\ncasual gangs, and kept the new men in the permanent\r\n\r\ngangs. And the new men are getting 12 to 14 kangs a\r\n\r\nweek  and the old men are getting as little as six,\r\n\r\nor even four, kangs a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not only do they try and punish them in that\r\n\r\nway,  by  giving them a less number of kangs,  they\r\n\r\ngive  them kangs which are not full kangs.  If  one\r\n\r\nworks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  normal  working  day in the morning,  one  works\r\n\r\neight  hours  and gets one full kang, eight  hours'\r\n\r\nworth  of  work. If one works over-time, one  works\r\n\r\nfour  hours,  from seven in the evening  to  11  at\r\n\r\nnight,  and is paid time-and-a-half- six hours.  So\r\n\r\nthey  gave these men, who are members of, and loyal\r\n\r\nto  the Union, night work paid at six hours instead\r\n\r\nof  eight  hours, and count that as one  kang,  cut\r\n\r\ndown  the number of kangs and thereby some  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  are getting as little as $15, $16,  $17  a\r\n\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are two ways out. One, we resolve this\r\n\r\nthing in a reasonable way - talk it over and sort it\r\n\r\nout. Or, two, we compel the Union once more to take\r\n\r\ndirect   industrial  action.  I  have   been   very\r\n\r\nreluctant to take direct industrial action for many\r\n\r\nreasons, and perhaps the Chief Minister, a  man  in\r\n\r\npossession of a great deal of the guessing faculty,\r\n\r\nwill be able to guess at some of the reasons why we\r\n\r\nhave  avoided taking direct industrial action.  But\r\n\r\nthe  point is now reached where, unless this matter\r\n\r\nis  resolved,  the Union may be compelled  to  take\r\n\r\nsome  direct industrial action. In that case it  is\r\n\r\nnot unlikely that the Board in its present frame of\r\n\r\nmind,   including  its  new  Chairman,   may   take\r\n\r\nretaliatory measures. That leads in turn to further\r\n\r\naction  on  the part of the Union and a  full-blown\r\n\r\ndispute will be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are of course ways and means of\r\n\r\ndealing  with such a dispute as the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nwell  knows.  One could just smack the whole  thing\r\n\r\ndown.  But  if  one does that, in this  case  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  a genuine Union, and indeed,  where  the\r\n\r\nissue  is not clouded by any question of subversion\r\n\r\nof  any  sort, if one does that, then the whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation in the Singapore Harbour Board,  the\r\n\r\nwhole of the dock area, will be soured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see any reason why the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  should  not be made first of all  to  follow\r\n\r\nwhat  the Court of Inquiry has recommended. In fact\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister will remember that  there  was\r\n\r\nsome  delay  in  the appointment of  the  Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  because  he said there  was  no  point  in\r\n\r\nhaving a court of inquiry unless both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparties  agreed to accept its findings;  hence  the\r\n\r\ndelay.  We  agreed  to  accept  the  findings,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour  Board was not  quite  prepared.\r\n\r\nEventually,  the  Court  of Inquiry  was  appointed\r\n\r\npresumably because they thought it over and decided\r\n\r\nthat  they also had better come into line and throw\r\n\r\nit  over to an independent commission of inquiry to\r\n\r\ndecide how best to settle the dispute. And I say it\r\n\r\nis  no  less than a breach of faith on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Harbour Board to dishonour  and  to\r\n\r\nflout the recommendations and findings of the Court\r\n\r\nof Enquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one could say, well, that does not matter.\r\n\r\nBut  it does matter, because the next time one  has\r\n\r\nan  industrial  dispute, be  it  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board or elsewhere, and if it is sent to  a\r\n\r\ncourt  of  inquiry  and both  parties  have  agreed\r\n\r\nbeforehand that they will abide by its findings and\r\n\r\nrecommendations, and if the findings turn out to be\r\n\r\nagainst the union's interests, the union may  jolly\r\n\r\nwell  say,  \"We do not want it.\" In fact  when  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council Federation of Labour Unions  did  not\r\n\r\nwant to accept the recommendations of the Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  which  the same Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare  appointed in their dispute,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwas  the first to point out that they should accept\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Court of  Inquiry.  Oh,\r\n\r\nyes,  because they sent delegations to see him,  as\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Welfare. I, in my capacity\r\n\r\nthen as the adviser of the Federation, came to know\r\n\r\nthat  he had advised them that they ought to accept\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Court of Inquiry. Well,\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  the City Council  Federation  of\r\n\r\nLabour  Unions, he was just the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand Welfare talking to an independent Union; but in\r\n\r\nthe  case of the Singapore Harbour Board, he is the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Welfare, he  is  also  the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister   heading  this  Government.   His\r\n\r\nMinister  for Commerce and Industry is the Minister\r\n\r\nin  charge of the Singapore Harbour Board,  and  he\r\n\r\ncan  very  well see that these recommendations  are\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, all I am asking the House to do today is\r\n\r\nto  join, first, in condemning the - I will use  very\r\n\r\nrestrained words, Sir, very mild and I should think\r\n\r\nmost  unobjectionable  words - all  I  said  was  the\r\n\r\nunreasonable  and  obstructive  attitude   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board.

However,  there  was  one  good\r\n\r\nthing - there  was  harmony. At  least  there  was  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  trust between employers and employees.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think  at  that time too, employers  looked\r\n\r\nafter  their employees and it was an unwritten  law\r\n\r\nthat it was their duty to look after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times have changed. Workers must be given a better\r\n\r\ndeal and indeed they should be given a better deal.\r\n\r\nAnd we have trade unions coming on the scene. If we\r\n\r\nhave  trade  unions  and  people  who  are  working\r\n\r\nmembers  looking after their own affairs, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  things  could still go on very  smoothly  and\r\n\r\nemployer-employee  relationships  could  still   be\r\n\r\ngood. But when we have people who are not connected\r\n\r\nwith   unions  coming  in,  sometimes   with   good\r\n\r\nintentions for wanting to help employees,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut more often than not coming in  with  the\r\n\r\nidea  of  creating chaos and gaining publicity  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  we  then meet with  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we find that there need not be a great\r\n\r\ndeal of dispute. It could easily be talked over and\r\n\r\nthe  matter settled amicably, but when somebody  is\r\n\r\nfanning  the fire of hatred and another is infusing\r\n\r\ninto  the  other  party distrust we  then  get  big\r\n\r\ntroubles being cooked up, and we come to the  stage\r\n\r\nwhere the employer will not trust the employee  and\r\n\r\nthe employee will regard the employer as his enemy.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  Sir,  it seems that if one  can  down  the\r\n\r\nother,  then one has scored a point; then one  will\r\n\r\nhave  gained something. On the face of it, it  does\r\n\r\nlook like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like everybody concerned to know that\r\n\r\nsuch  action can only bring disadvantages  to  both\r\n\r\nsides.  I have said in the debate on the Governor's\r\n\r\nSpeech  that the Singapore Harbour Board is a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  institution in Singapore.  We  depend  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal on it for our trade and our livelihood.\r\n\r\nBut  because of its many disputes, because  of  its\r\n\r\nmany   troubles,  trade  is  shifting   away   from\r\n\r\nSingapore. The employer may fight the employee, the\r\n\r\nemployee  may  fight back, and soon we  have  trade\r\n\r\ngoing  away  to  other lands. I ask the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially the people concerned,  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  they have any advantage when trade  should\r\n\r\ndwindle to such a small amount, that no matter  how\r\n\r\ngreat their earnings are per day, they will bring a\r\n\r\nvery  small  packet home every month.  Or  ask  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  no matter how much they can squeeze  out\r\n\r\nof  the  employee, if there is no  business  to  be\r\n\r\ndone,  then you find that there will be  no  income\r\n\r\nwhen you tally up the total for the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask, Sir, that employees and employers, for the\r\n\r\ngood  of  Singapore, for the good of  everybody  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  should try and understand one  another,\r\n\r\nshould  try  and  see  that there  should  be  less\r\n\r\ndisputes and more harmonious working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with many politicians who are interested\r\n\r\nparties  coming on the scene, such may not  be  the\r\n\r\ncase  all the time, and we may have to face a large\r\n\r\nnumber of strikes and labour unrest in future. This\r\n\r\nmust be avoided. One\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  of avoiding such a case would be to appoint  a\r\n\r\ncourt  of inquiry to find out things. And  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that  in many cases the best way to  settle  a\r\n\r\ndispute  would be not to leave it to  the  employer\r\n\r\nand  the  employee,  both thinking  that  they  are\r\n\r\nright,  but  to  leave  it to  independent  people,\r\n\r\nindependent and impartial people who have  no  axes\r\n\r\nto  grind. And I think courts of inquiry should  be\r\n\r\nestablished;   arbitration   courts    should    be\r\n\r\nestablished.  And I believe that one  day  we  must\r\n\r\nhave  compulsory arbitration with a panel of people\r\n\r\nagreed  to  by employers and employees  alike,  and\r\n\r\nthey  will sit to arbitrate. And I would  say  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  their  decision  should  be,  both  sides\r\n\r\nshould agree to their decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case where the matter has been brought\r\n\r\nup  to a court. The court has set out its findings,\r\n\r\nthe court has made its recommendations. It consists\r\n\r\nof  people trusted by all sides and I think that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  wrong for any party not  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of such a court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the Singapore Harbour Board, as a\r\n\r\nquasi-Government institution, as a  good  employer,\r\n\r\nshould  accept  the  decisions  of  the  Court.  I,\r\n\r\nhowever, Sir, made the amendment because I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  this is the first case that has come to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly that recommendations of a court of inquiry\r\n\r\nhave not been fully accepted. We would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board to accept those recommendations.\r\n\r\nIt will create a good precedent for other employers\r\n\r\nand  employees  to  follow if  we  have  courts  of\r\n\r\narbitration  or enquiry appointed at a later  date.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  move  that this House urges the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour   Board   to  accept  and   implement   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Court of Inquiry set  up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Welfare on 16th  July,\r\n\r\n1957, as contained in Sessional Paper S 7 of 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I second the amendment and reserve the right to speak at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar and representatives of the Union have\r\n\r\nseen  me  many  a time, and I have, too,  seen  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board many a time, and so far what has been\r\n\r\nachieved is the re-employment of - I do not know  the\r\n\r\nexact number - some 200 people, and only 10 from  the\r\n\r\nordinary labour force and 12 lascars have  not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  re-employed. This is a small  number  but  my\r\n\r\ninformation is that the 10 labourers were  not  re-employed  because they had not presented themselves\r\n\r\nfor  re-employment. I do not know whether  that  is\r\n\r\ncorrect or not. I do not wish to take sides  but  I\r\n\r\nwould assure this House that if this amended motion\r\n\r\nis  accepted,  it would assist me as  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare  to  present  the  case   more\r\n\r\nforcibly to the Singapore Harbour Board and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  with  the views of this House made  known  to them,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  will take due note and re-employ the  persons\r\n\r\nwho have so far not been re-employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about the 12 lascars?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I said all the persons not re-employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir. The Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  did  touch  on the question  of  the  secret\r\n\r\nballot. That is not a recommendation of the  Court.\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestion of the Court - a suggestion that I\r\n\r\nhave  been considering. I find it difficult due  to\r\n\r\nconditions  in  Singapore to agree to  introduce  a\r\n\r\nsystem of secret balloting on recognition. This  is\r\n\r\na system that has been adopted in America at a time\r\n\r\nwhen they had two big organisations - the C.I.O. and\r\n\r\nthe  A.F. of L. When workers who were not organised\r\n\r\nwished  to  be organised, the government  machinery\r\n\r\nwas set in motion to ascertain from the workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  factory  their  views as to  which  particular\r\n\r\norganisation they would wish to represent them  but\r\n\r\nunder  the present laws in Singapore any seven  men\r\n\r\ncan  form  a union and after forming one any  seven\r\n\r\nmen  can demand a secret ballot and may upset well-established and older established unions. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink this question of introducing secret balloting\r\n\r\nto  ascertain whether a union should be  recognised\r\n\r\nor  not  under the present circumstances  would  be\r\n\r\nfeasible and advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would be loath to miss\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to get complete unanimity  on  the\r\n\r\namendment,  but I would very much like to  add  the\r\n\r\nfollowing words to the amended motion so as to give\r\n\r\nsome teeth to it. I was considering that the motion\r\n\r\nshould be amended to read,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House urges the Government to compel\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Harbour  Board  to  accept  and  to\r\n\r\nimplement.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,   Sir,  I  see  nothing  wrong  in  compelling\r\n\r\nsomebody  to do what is right. In fact, it  is  the\r\n\r\nduty   of   the  Government  to  see   that   where\r\n\r\ncommonsense and reasonableness do not prevail, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompulsion begins. However, I have not been able to\r\n\r\nobtain the support of the other Parties to this and\r\n\r\nI  am therefore left in a position either to accept\r\n\r\nthe amendment, or to lose my motion by default.  On\r\n\r\nthe  balance,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I am  inclined  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  amendment  but  on  this  very   clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding, that if by the next sitting of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  these  findings have not been accepted  and\r\n\r\nimplemented, then the other Parties in  this  House\r\n\r\nwill  join me in asking the Government to take more\r\n\r\ndrastic  action  to  see  that  the  findings   and\r\n\r\nrecommendations are accepted. I understand from the\r\n\r\nleader  of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party  that  his\r\n\r\nParty would be very much in favour of that, should,\r\n\r\nafter   a   reasonable  period  has  elapsed,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board and its new  chairman  and\r\n\r\nthe  old  Chief  Minister  still  be  in  the  same\r\n\r\nposition  vis-a-vis  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff   Association  and  its  12   \"un-re-engaged\"\r\n\r\nlascars and ten workers still suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I cannot accept the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's view that it is just a suggestion of the\r\n\r\nCourt of Inquiry that there should be a ballot. The\r\n\r\nactual words are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We would suggest that such evidence be collected\r\n\r\nin the form of a secret ballot.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  in the context of the chapter under which this\r\n\r\nsentence  appears,  it  is  a  clear  finding   and\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  the  Court.   It   says   here,\r\n\r\nparagraph  9 -  Industrial  Relations - Administrative\r\n\r\nPractices - The Issue of Recognition - and under  \"The\r\n\r\nIssue  of Recognition\", it is stated that it should\r\n\r\nbe resolved by evidence \"collected in the form of a\r\n\r\nsecret ballot by members whose names appear on  the\r\n\r\nmembership cards of the SHBWU and the SHBSA.\"  This\r\n\r\nis  not a suggestion, particularly where one of the\r\n\r\nmembers  of that Tribunal represented the  shipping\r\n\r\ninterests  of Singapore, namely Mr D.  W.  Holder.\r\n\r\nThis  is a unanimous recommendation. There  was  no\r\n\r\ndissenting   voice  even  from   Mr   Holder   who\r\n\r\nrepresented  the  shipping  interests  and  who  is\r\n\r\ninterested in the Singapore Harbour Board and its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmooth operation more than any other businessman in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would urge the Hon. the Chief Minister,\r\n\r\nbefore  he commits himself to a statement  of  high\r\n\r\npolicy  on very short reflection that he is  unable\r\n\r\nto  accept this, to re-consider the matter  and  in\r\n\r\nparticular  to seek the advice of his Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  as to whether or not this is  good  trade\r\n\r\nunion  practice.
