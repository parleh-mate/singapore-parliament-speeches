It might interest Government Members\r\n\r\nalso   to   know   that  while  in  Singapore   Mr\r\n\r\nCoomaraswamy did considerable public service in the\r\n\r\ninterest of his profession. He was a member of  the\r\n\r\nLaw  Faculty at the University of Singapore. He was\r\n\r\nalso  on the editorial board of the University  Law\r\n\r\nReview  and  other  bodies. Moreover,  he  was  the\r\n\r\nChairman of one of the many advisory committees  on\r\n\r\nthe Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Coomaraswamy was also recruited as a member of the advisory committee on the P.P.S.O., and his services as a member of the public are perhaps best remembered as Secretary of the Singapore Bar Committee. In fact, I myself first met him in Select Committees of the House when he,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  Singapore  Bar  Committee,  came\r\n\r\nforward   to  give  evidence  on  behalf   of   his\r\n\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now very happy indeed that Mr\r\n\r\nCoomaraswamy,  arising out of his  legal  expertise\r\n\r\nand  experience, has been able to resign  from  his\r\n\r\nprivate  practice  in order to  take  up  full-time\r\n\r\nduties  as Speaker of this Parliament. You  can  be\r\n\r\nassured,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that our  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  will give you all the co-operation that  you\r\n\r\nrequire,  and  I  only wish that a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  were here today to say a few  words  on\r\n\r\nyour election.

I  shall  ever  be  conscious   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  must get on with the vital business  of\r\n\r\ngoverning, that Back-Benchers have their rights and\r\n\r\nthat  minorities must be heard.

Numerous questions were raised before  the\r\n\r\nre-registration  began and many other  difficulties\r\n\r\nwere faced during the process of re-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through anticipation and experience the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been good enough to find  solutions\r\n\r\nto  most of the problems. But, Sir, I am sure  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will agree with me when I say  that  there\r\n\r\nare still quite a number of difficulties which have\r\n\r\nnot  been solved in the way they should have  been.\r\n\r\nIn  spite of the Minister's assurance, in the  case\r\n\r\nof  a  person  who has an unnamed birth certificate\r\n\r\nbut who holds an identity card issued before 1949 -\r\n\r\nI  am subject to correction - in which the place of\r\n\r\nbirth  is  shown  as  Singapore,  the  officers  at\r\n\r\nvarious centres would not accept that person  as  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen by birth at the time when the re-registration started. But now I understand that the\r\n\r\nposition  has  been  clarified  and  there  is   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  on  that point. Sir, if this  had  been\r\n\r\ndone  right  from the start, much difficulty  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  saved  both  by  the  public  and   the\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem which still remains a problem is\r\n\r\nwrong spelling. Take a Chinese name. When a Chinese\r\n\r\ncharacter  is  written  in  English,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nspelling  varies according to the dialect.  And  as\r\n\r\nthis  is  going  to  be  the last  chance,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  stated  earlier, for anyone  to  do  such\r\n\r\ncorrections,  I hope the Minister will  direct  his\r\n\r\nofficials   to  be  considerate  and   allow   such\r\n\r\ncorrections.  For instance, if there is  a  request\r\n\r\nfor Teh - T e h - to be corrected to Tay - Tay - it\r\n\r\nwill  be too much to ask that person to go and take\r\n\r\na deed poll. Similar difficulties arise in the case\r\n\r\nof  Indians and Malays. Ramasamy may like to  write\r\n\r\nhis  name  Ramaswamy, that is, with an addition  of\r\n\r\n\"w\";  or  Ramasamy Sellapa would like his name  and\r\n\r\nhis  surname abbreviated to S. R. Samy. And a Malay\r\n\r\nwhose name is Abdul Rahim Ishak would like his name\r\n\r\ncalled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas A. Rahim Ishak. Sir, I am giving you these names\r\n\r\nas  examples because you will find all these  names\r\n\r\nin  this House and with such modifications. I would\r\n\r\nnot call these as changes, Sir, because nothing  in\r\n\r\nthe  name  is  changed. These  are  corrections  or\r\n\r\nslight   modifications.  Maybe  some   registration\r\n\r\ncentres  are  allowing  such  corrections.  But  it\r\n\r\nshould be a general rule, because when a team  goes\r\n\r\nto  the  community centres there will be  thousands\r\n\r\nand thousands of such cases, I am sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is the fee\r\n\r\nfor  the  new  identity card. The Schedule  to  the\r\n\r\nRegulations  under  the Act says  50  cents  for  a\r\n\r\ncitizen's I.C. and $1 for a non-citizen's I.C., and\r\n\r\n$5  for a replacement. Sir, suppose a child who was\r\n\r\nborn  outside Singapore applies for an I.C. He  will\r\n\r\nbe  given a non-citizen I.C. That is well within the\r\n\r\nlaw. A few months later this child, who earlier has\r\n\r\nobtained  a  non-citizen I.C., gets his citizenship\r\n\r\nand  when  he goes to the Registration  Office  and\r\n\r\nrequests  for a new I.C. for citizens,  he  is  told\r\n\r\nthat  the fee is $5. I cannot understand this.  The\r\n\r\nfee of $5 is for a replacement. But in this case no\r\n\r\none  will  say  that  is a replacement.  The  child\r\n\r\nsurrenders the old IC, and requests for a change as\r\n\r\nhis  status  has changed. So, Sir,  I  request  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  see that the Schedule is  interpreted\r\n\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has replied to my queries earlier.\r\n\r\nI quote  column 94 of the Hansard dated  21st  April, 1966. \r\n\r\nThis is what the Minister for Labour said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has raised the\r\n\r\nquestion of names being wrongly spelt either in the\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates  or  in  the  present  identity\r\n\r\ncards. I wish to assure the Member that in the  re-registration   \r\n\r\nexercise,  this   matter   will   be\r\n\r\nrectified  once  and for all. Any mistakes  in  the\r\n\r\nspelling  of  the  names will be given  sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration and if these are genuine errors, they\r\n\r\nwill be rectified in the new identity cards. In the\r\n\r\ncase  of  an illiterate applicant, it is  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  his  friend should assist him by writing  out\r\n\r\nthe correct spelling of his name on a slip of paper\r\n\r\nwhich   he  should  bring  at  the  time   of   re-registration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote this just to remind the Minister what\r\n\r\nhe  promised  earlier. But as it  seems  that  such\r\n\r\ncases are not being considered sympathetically, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould   like   to  request  him  to   issue   clear\r\n\r\ninstructions  to  the registration centres  setting\r\n\r\nout  what they should do. Where the officers  could\r\n\r\ndo  such minor corrections, Sir, the people  should\r\n\r\nnot be referred to Headquarters but should be dealt\r\n\r\nwith by the registration centres themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the   Ministry  of  Labour  is   seeking   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary vote of $1,450,630 and  I  feel  this\r\n\r\nHouse  is  entitled to a more detailed  explanation\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister as to how this supplementary  sum\r\n\r\nis  required, which is about 140 per cent more than\r\n\r\nthe original estimate of $1 million when the Budget\r\n\r\nwas approved in December last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to raise is that the\r\n\r\nfirst and second phases of re-registration are  now\r\n\r\nin  progress and I have come to understand that  in\r\n\r\ncertain cases during the re-registration of  school\r\n\r\nchildren,  forms had been filled in by the  parents\r\n\r\nand  submitted to the registration teams, and  when\r\n\r\nthe  pupil received the new identity card back, the\r\n\r\ninformation  contained therein was  different  from\r\n\r\nthat  provided by the parents. When this was  drawn\r\n\r\nto  the  attention  of the registration  team,  the\r\n\r\nschool  teacher  was told that they  could  not  do\r\n\r\nanything about it and that the pupil would have  to\r\n\r\ngo  to Empress Place. This may be an isolated case,\r\n\r\nbut  I  feel  that  if the people  working  in  the\r\n\r\nregistration teams are not careful in  writing  out\r\n\r\nthe  new identity cards, the public may be  put  to\r\n\r\nunnecessary inconvenience, not through their fault,\r\n\r\nof  having  to go back again to Empress  Place  for\r\n\r\ncorrecting the new identity card. Here I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister will tell the registration team to  be\r\n\r\nabsolutely careful when writing out these cards for\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to raise is that\r\n\r\nsince   our   new  identity  cards  are   important\r\n\r\ndocuments, some care should be taken in writing the\r\n\r\ninformation on them clearly. There are  some  cards\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  written  on  and  scratched  and\r\n\r\nrewritten again, and I think this is not desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point I would like to raise is that when\r\n\r\nthe third phase of re-registration commences, which\r\n\r\nis  meant  to re-register the general public,  here\r\n\r\nagain   I  feel  that  the  Citizens'  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees of the constituencies together with  the\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament of the constituency, should be\r\n\r\nconsulted  and their assistance sought in providing\r\n\r\nsuitable  places  in each area  where  the  general\r\n\r\npublic  have  least inconvenience in  having  their\r\n\r\ncards  re-registered. Likewise, the Ministry should\r\n\r\nalso  look  into  the different  language  speaking\r\n\r\ngroups   and  send  the  language  speaking   group\r\n\r\nconcerned to attend to the people. This will save a\r\n\r\nlot of trouble in the language problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nnational registration campaign started about  three\r\n\r\nmonths  ago.  So far we have registered  more  than\r\n\r\nhalf a million people - to be exact, the number  of\r\n\r\npersons  registered up to the  13th  of  August  is\r\n\r\n566,540  persons. Judging by the number of  persons\r\n\r\nwe  have  registered for the period, I  should  say\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  done quite fast work.  The  workers\r\n\r\nemployed   in   this  registration   campaign   are\r\n\r\nrecruited  from  a  list  provided  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission. They are mainly young boys  and\r\n\r\ngirls freshly graduated from secondary schools and,\r\n\r\nbecause  of their lack of experience and  training,\r\n\r\nsome allowance must be made for their work. But  so\r\n\r\nfar, we have found that the number of mistakes made\r\n\r\nin the identity cards in comparison with the number\r\n\r\nwe  have  registered is very few. Nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nwill try to ensure that mistakes will be as few  as\r\n\r\npossible. If the mistakes made in the new  identity\r\n\r\ncards are due to our own fault, then, of course, we\r\n\r\nwill  offer  free replacements, but the  applicants\r\n\r\nmust  provide  their own photographs.  I  think  we\r\n\r\ncannot  help  that,  but I  hope  the  public  will\r\n\r\nforgive us for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has raised two points.\r\n\r\nThe first is about the names on identity cards.  If\r\n\r\nyou look at the new identity cards, you will notice\r\n\r\nthat in addition to one column for the name,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is another column for the alias. A person  is\r\n\r\nallowed to have any number of aliases, but the name\r\n\r\nappearing  on his old identity card must appear  on\r\n\r\nhis  new  identity  card  in  order  to  provide  a\r\n\r\ncontinuity.  But if a person feels  that  his  name\r\n\r\nshould  be  spelt in such and such a way,  we  have\r\n\r\nmade  provision for that and I am sure the  workers\r\n\r\nin   the  registration  centres  will  oblige.  But\r\n\r\nsometimes  people  are quite difficult  to  please.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them may want to have their names written\r\n\r\nin  such a way or in a short form. Some may want to\r\n\r\nhave  their names written in a long form. Some  may\r\n\r\nwant  their  names to be spelt in Cantonese  or  in\r\n\r\nMandarin.  But we cannot help that. If  we  are  to\r\n\r\naccept  all  these demands, then the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nregistration   campaign  will   be   slowed   down.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we will try our best to  accommodate\r\n\r\nall these demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  regarding the replacement of an  identity\r\n\r\ncard  for  a person who has changed his citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus,  I would say that where the replacement  is\r\n\r\nnot  his fault, then the normal charge of 50  cents\r\n\r\nwill   apply.   But   where,  for   instance,   the\r\n\r\nreplacement is due to his own carelessness or loss,\r\n\r\nthen the fee of $5 will apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by the Member for River\r\n\r\nValley  that during the third phase when we go  out\r\n\r\nto  the  community centres to register the  general\r\n\r\npublic  as a whole, they would appreciate the  help\r\n\r\nof   Members   of  Parliament  and  the   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees in the various  areas,  we\r\n\r\nare,  in fact, now making plans to bring in Members\r\n\r\nof   Parliament   and  members  in  the   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees to help us carry  out  the\r\n\r\nregistration  in  their various  constituencies.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Members of Parliament on our  side  will\r\n\r\nvolunteer and, in fact, mobilise their workers  and\r\n\r\nhelpers in their constituencies to help us  in  the\r\n\r\nregistration  campaign so  that  the  work  can  be\r\n\r\nspeeded up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to appropriate language group teams to be sent\r\n\r\nto  the  registration centres, we are making  every\r\n\r\neffort  to  send  proper  language  groups  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point is the amount of money we\r\n\r\nhave  asked this House to vote for the registration\r\n\r\ncampaign. The original sum of $1 million  put  down\r\n\r\nis   for  the  initial  work.  This  includes   the\r\n\r\npurchasing  of machinery and stationery  and  other\r\n\r\nitems.  We  now find that this sum is insufficient.\r\n\r\nOur  estimated  total  expenditure  for  this  year\r\n\r\namounts to about $2,395,827 of which $1,619,837  is\r\n\r\nfor  Personal  Emoluments, $188,860  is  for  Other\r\n\r\nCharges  Annually Recurrent, and  $587,128  is  for\r\n\r\nOther  Charges  Special  Expenditure.  Of  the   $1\r\n\r\nmillion  which  was  provided for  in  this  year's\r\n\r\nestimate, $44,800 was transferred to meet  expenses\r\n\r\nin  connection with the operation of the Regulation\r\n\r\nof  Employment  Act, that is, with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nissue of work permits. Thus a sum of $1,450,630  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  cover  expenses  in  connection  with\r\n\r\nnational  re-registration up to  the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.  So  you will see that most of this money  is\r\n\r\nrequired for Personal Emoluments. This is  for  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of a large number of temporary  workers\r\n\r\nin these various schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

To make it compulsory for a trade union to\r\n\r\nobtain  the  consent of the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  concerned  by  secret  ballot  before\r\n\r\ncalling  a  strike  or  taking  any  form   of\r\n\r\nindustrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Trade Unions Ordinance, any\r\n\r\nperson  who  has attained the age of 21  years  may\r\n\r\nbecome  an  officer  of a trade union.  Other  than\r\n\r\nthis, the only restriction imposed by the Ordinance\r\n\r\non  the  qualification of trade union  officers  is\r\n\r\nthat at least two-thirds of the total number of the\r\n\r\nofficers of a trade union shall be persons actually\r\n\r\nengaged  or  employed in an industry or  occupation\r\n\r\nwith  which  the  trade union  is  connected.  This\r\n\r\nlaxity  has  enabled persons who are not  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  undesirable elements  with  criminal\r\n\r\nrecords  to hold important positions in and  manage\r\n\r\nthe affairs of trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As comprehensive measures have already been\r\n\r\nadopted  by  Government to protect  the  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities of Singapore citizens,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nillogical to allow non-Singapore citizens to remain\r\n\r\nentrenched  in  the  executive positions  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions. The democratic trade union movement  has  a\r\n\r\nvital role to play in our national development.  It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, only right that measures are  taken\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that individual unions  and  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement as a whole should be led by citizens\r\n\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. has already made it clear that under\r\n\r\nno circumstances will it tolerate corrupt practices\r\n\r\nin   the   labour  movement.  The  elimination   of\r\n\r\nundesirable elements with criminal records from key\r\n\r\npositions in trade unions will ensure the emergence\r\n\r\nof a clean and honest labour movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the existing Trade Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance do not adequately safeguard the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the members of trade unions in connection  with\r\n\r\nstrikes  and other forms of industrial action.  The\r\n\r\nOrdinance  merely  requires trade  unions  to  make\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  their  rules  for  the  taking   of\r\n\r\ndecisions  in respect of strikes by secret  ballot.\r\n\r\nBut nowhere in the Ordinance does it lay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  that failure to comply with the necessity  to\r\n\r\ncarry out a secret ballot prior to strike action is\r\n\r\nan   offence  under  the  Ordinance,  although  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions may, on proper complaints\r\n\r\nlaid  before him by the members affected, call upon\r\n\r\nthe  union  concerned to show cause as to  why  its\r\n\r\nregistration should not be cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from deregistration, no other action can be\r\n\r\ntaken   against  the  defaulting   union   or   the\r\n\r\nresponsible  officers,  as  a  strike,   which   is\r\n\r\ncommenced  without taking a secret  ballot  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the trade union concerned,  is  not  an\r\n\r\nillegal  strike  within the meaning  of  the  Trade\r\n\r\nDisputes Ordinance. It is intended to rectify  this\r\n\r\ndeficiency by making specific provisions in the law\r\n\r\nto  require a trade union to obtain the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of its members concerned  by  secret\r\n\r\nballot  before calling a strike or taking any  form\r\n\r\nof  industrial action. This would ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the rank and file members in respect  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  are  respected  by  the   union\r\n\r\nleadership,    and   eliminate   any   undemocratic\r\n\r\nmanipulation of imposing a strike from the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As anticipated, the anti-national elements in the\r\n\r\npro-Communist unions have come out with their usual\r\n\r\ndistorted  statements alleging that the  object  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is to deprive the right of the so-called\r\n\r\nleft-wing  trade  unionists to serve  the  workers.\r\n\r\nThey  have  been singing this old tune  for  years.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  recall that in the  past,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   introduced  legislative  measures   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard trade union funds, it was accused by them\r\n\r\nof  adopting  Fascist  and dictatorial  methods  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  the trade unions. It is easy to see  what\r\n\r\nis  at  the back of their tortuous minds. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  really  interested in the right to  serve  the\r\n\r\nworkers simply because they have no concern for the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the workers. What actually gives  them\r\n\r\ncause  for concern is that the Bill might  in  some\r\n\r\nway  curb  their evil design to subvert  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement to serve their selfish interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now explain the amendments proposed in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. The provisions in clause 2 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nseek   to   enlarge  the  existing  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"executive\"  and \"officer\" to include reference  to\r\n\r\nthe  branch committees, branch officers and members\r\n\r\nof  other  committees  of a trade  union.  This  is\r\n\r\nnecessary in view of the provision to be introduced\r\n\r\nin  clause 4 which deals with the qualifications of\r\n\r\ntrade union officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes it compulsory for a trade union to\r\n\r\nobtain  the consent of the majority of the  members\r\n\r\nconcerned by secret ballot before calling a  strike\r\n\r\nor taking any form of industrial action. Failure to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  this democratic process would  render\r\n\r\nthe  defaulting  union and its officers  liable  to\r\n\r\nprosecution  and, if convicted, a  fine  of  up  to\r\n\r\n$2,000  can be imposed. There is nothing whatsoever\r\n\r\nin  this  clause  which may in any way  hamper  the\r\n\r\nworkers' fundamental right to strike. In fact,  its\r\n\r\nsole  aim is to ensure that every member of a trade\r\n\r\nunion   has   the  opportunity  to   exercise   his\r\n\r\ndemocratic  right and express his views  freely  by\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot on the vital question of strike  and\r\n\r\nother  forms  of  industrial action which  directly\r\n\r\naffect their livelihood. It was not uncommon in the\r\n\r\npast that in some disputes the workers knew nothing\r\n\r\nabout their cases at all. The first thing they knew\r\n\r\nabout  the strike was that when they turned  up  at\r\n\r\nthe  factory  gate they found banners  hanging  all\r\n\r\nover  the place and they were not allowed to  enter\r\n\r\nthe factory. Now, we are not going to allow this to\r\n\r\nhappen  any  more. We are not going  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union leaders to have the only  say  in  the\r\n\r\nunions.  But we are not saying that they cannot  go\r\n\r\non  strike  or take any form of industrial  action.\r\n\r\nAll we say is that if they want to go on strike  or\r\n\r\ntake any form of industrial action, they must first\r\n\r\nconsult their members, and the general members must\r\n\r\nhave the final say as to whether or not they should\r\n\r\ncarry out a strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the First Reading of the Bill, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  received  representations  from  the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades Union Congress. The  N.T.U.C. has\r\n\r\npointed  out that subsection (1) of the new section\r\n\r\n24A in clause 3, as it stands,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould give the impression that before a trade union\r\n\r\ncommences a strike or any form of industrial action\r\n\r\nwhich affects only a section of its members, it has\r\n\r\nto  obtain  by  secret ballot the consent  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the entire membership. This is not  the\r\n\r\nintention of this subsection which, in such  cases,\r\n\r\nrequires   only  the'  majority  consent   of   the\r\n\r\nparticular section of members concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, Mr Speaker, Sir, at the Committee\r\n\r\nstage  to  move  an amendment which will  make  the\r\n\r\nintention  clear. The N.T.U.C. has  also  expressed\r\n\r\nvery   strong   objection  to  the  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"industrial action\" in subsection (4)  of  the  new\r\n\r\nsection 24A. For this reason, the Second Reading of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill was postponed twice to enable my Ministry\r\n\r\nto  discuss the matter fully with the N.T.U.C. Sir,\r\n\r\nat  the Committee stage I will move an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"industrial action\". Although the\r\n\r\nnew  definition  does not meet  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. in full, I would say that it is the  most\r\n\r\nrealistic   provision  we  could  make  under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed amendments in clause 4, a\r\n\r\nperson  is disqualified from holding any office  in\r\n\r\nthe  central executive committee, branch committees\r\n\r\nand  other committees, such as industrial  relation\r\n\r\ncommittees, education and cultural committees of  a\r\n\r\ntrade union, if he is not a citizen of Singapore or\r\n\r\nhas  been  convicted of criminal breach  of  trust,\r\n\r\nextortion  or criminal intimidation, or  any  other\r\n\r\noffence,  which,  in the opinion of  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nrenders  him  unfit  to be an officer  of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides in clause 5 that a person\r\n\r\nshall  not  be employed as an employee of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  if he is not a citizen of Singapore  or  has\r\n\r\nbeen  convicted  of  a criminal offence.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the amended section 26 and the new  section\r\n\r\n26A in clauses 4 and 5 endeavour to ensure that not\r\n\r\nonly  the running of this country in every  respect\r\n\r\nshall be in the hands of citizens of Singapore, but\r\n\r\nalso  that the trade union leadership shall not  be\r\n\r\nexposed  to  corrupt influence. A clean and  honest\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement will inspire the  confidence\r\n\r\nnot  only  of  the workers but also of the  general\r\n\r\npublic and the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been appreciated that there would be\r\n\r\npractical difficulties in certain cases in applying\r\n\r\nthe  new provisions of section 26 in clause  4  and\r\n\r\nsection  26A in clause 5. A proviso has  also  been\r\n\r\nincorporated  in  both these sections  which  gives\r\n\r\npower   to   the   Minister  to   rule   that   the\r\n\r\ndisqualification arising from conviction shall  not\r\n\r\napply   where  he  is  satisfied  that  the  person\r\n\r\nconvicted  has reformed. Powers are also  given  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister in the new section 26B in clause 5  to\r\n\r\nexempt   any  trade  union  or  person   from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions relating to disqualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the effective implementation of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  clause  3 and  to  improve  on  the\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions  of the  Ordinance  concerning\r\n\r\nsecret ballots, the Bill provides in clause 6  that\r\n\r\nthe  rules of a registered trade union shall ensure\r\n\r\nthat every member has an equal right to record  his\r\n\r\nvote  freely,  that the results of the  voting  are\r\n\r\naccurately ascertained and declared, and  that  the\r\n\r\nsecrecy of the ballot is properly secured. Besides,\r\n\r\npower is given to the Registrar of Trade Unions  to\r\n\r\ninspect  ballot papers and other documents used  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the ballot, and it is provided that\r\n\r\nall  such  papers and documents shall be  preserved\r\n\r\nfor  six months and the results of the ballot shall\r\n\r\nbe  sent  to  the  Registrar.  Under  the  existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance, registered trade unions are required  to\r\n\r\nnotify   the   Registrar   of   every   change   of\r\n\r\nheadquarters or offices, including members  of  the\r\n\r\ncentral  executive  committee,  within  seven  days\r\n\r\nafter   the  change.  In  view  of  the  provisions\r\n\r\nrelating   to  disqualification  of  officers   and\r\n\r\nemployees  of  trade unions in  clauses  4  and  5,\r\n\r\nconsequential changes are made in clauses 7  and  8\r\n\r\nwhereby,  in  addition  to  reporting  changes   of\r\n\r\nheadquarters  or  offices  and  central   executive\r\n\r\nmembers,  trade unions are also required to  notify\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  of all changes of  branch  offices,\r\n\r\nmembers of other committees as well as employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to add a new clause\r\n\r\nto  the Bill at the Committee stage relating  to  a\r\n\r\nminor  amendment to section l8B of  the  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose  of  the amendment is  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee to deal with immovable  property\r\n\r\nbelonging to trade unions which are dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I find that the contents\r\n\r\nof  the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill are good  and\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  should be supported if the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Labour is sincere,  as  he  has\r\n\r\nexplained  in respect of clause 3 in this amendment\r\n\r\nBill. But there are two other clauses which are not\r\n\r\nvery  happy  ones. I believe not only I myself  but\r\n\r\nevery other trade unionist will support me in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  For  example, Mr Speaker, clause  2.  At\r\n\r\npresent executive members only should be registered\r\n\r\nwith a trade union. But with this amendment when it\r\n\r\ncomes  into force - every branch committee  of  the\r\n\r\nunion   will  have  to  be  registered   with   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar.  In  this  matter, large  unions  -  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Bank Employees Union, the  Insurance\r\n\r\nEmployees Union, the A.U.P.E., the Singapore Manual\r\n\r\nand Mercantile Workers Union, etc., which have tens\r\n\r\nor   hundreds  of  branches  -have  many  sectional\r\n\r\ncommittees,   e.g.,  picnic,   social   and   other\r\n\r\ncommittees.    Although   these   committees    are\r\n\r\ntemporary, their members will also have to register\r\n\r\ntheir  names,  addresses,  ages,  etc.,  with   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions. Mr Speaker, this  would\r\n\r\ninvolve the union in administrative work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see any other constructive aim regarding\r\n\r\nclause  4  of this amendment Bill. I find  that  it\r\n\r\nprevents  a non-citizen, or a person who  has  been\r\n\r\nconvicted of a criminal offence, criminal breach of\r\n\r\ntrust, extortion or criminal intimidation which, in\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of the Minister, renders him unfit  to\r\n\r\nbe  an  officer of a trade union or a branch  of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union,  from holding office. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  issued work permits to non-citizens and  these\r\n\r\nworkers  can continue to work in Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\nfair  that  if  a  person is  allowed  to  work  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, he should be allowed to be a member of a\r\n\r\ntrade  union to safeguard the security of  his  job\r\n\r\nand his family. If he is allowed to be a member  of\r\n\r\na trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunion  according  to  our  democratic  trade  union\r\n\r\nregulations, then he will have the right to contest\r\n\r\nor  to  hold  office either in a branch or  central\r\n\r\ncommittee.  I  agree  that people  not  given  work\r\n\r\npermits be not allowed to hold office in any  trade\r\n\r\nunion. But if a person, who has been issued with  a\r\n\r\nwork permit, is a member of a trade union, then  he\r\n\r\nshould  have  the  same rights as  other  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. Otherwise these people will not have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  vote concerning an industrial action  in\r\n\r\nrespect of section 24A (1) . Employers will make use\r\n\r\nof  this provision to oppress workers who are  non-citizens  but who are allowed to work in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  these  workers will find hardship.  Then  this\r\n\r\nwill   bring  about  the  downfall  of   the   free\r\n\r\ndemocratic trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, workers with Singapore citizenship will\r\n\r\nalso  suffer  similar consequences.

I refer to section  7  (4)\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance  wherein  a\r\n\r\nperson  who is an undischarged bankrupt and  is  of\r\n\r\nunsound  mind  should not work as an officer  of  a\r\n\r\ntrade union, because such a person will not be able\r\n\r\nto manage his own financial affairs. Maybe he is  a\r\n\r\nspendthrift  and his bad habits, such as  gambling,\r\n\r\ndrinking,  etc., will cause him to get  into  debt,\r\n\r\nand if he cannot clear his debts, then he is made a\r\n\r\nbankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour to take action in respect of clauses 4 and 5\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  - that this provision  be  added  -\r\n\r\npersons  who  are non-citizens but  who  have  work\r\n\r\npermits  be  allowed to hold office  in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement. And also include in this provision,\r\n\r\nthat  persons  who  have not been  discharged  from\r\n\r\nbankruptcy  and are of unsound mind should  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to hold office in the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no\r\n\r\nquarrel  at  all with the Minister  for  Labour  in\r\n\r\nrespect of his introducing the amendment of the new\r\n\r\nsection 24A, subsections (1) , (2) and (3) . But, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, if you look at subsection  (4) ,  the\r\n\r\nwording contained therein, I will say that if  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  passed today, then I am afraid  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  trade union movement in Singapore will  have\r\n\r\nto   close  shop.  The  Minister  for  Labour   has\r\n\r\nintroduced this piece of legislation, or rather  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Trade Unions Ordinance.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nrefer to the proposed amendments to section 24A  of\r\n\r\nthe Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill. As I said, if it\r\n\r\nis  passed  today by this Legislature,  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the status of the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nwill  be  very much enhanced and, instead of  being\r\n\r\nreferred  to  as Minister for Labour,  he  will  be\r\n\r\naddressed as the Honourable Minister for Management\r\n\r\nor Employers.

We   welcome   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this  amendment  which,  as   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour has said earlier, is  to  curb\r\n\r\nirresponsible   leadership  in  the   trade   union\r\n\r\nmovement  and the anti-national elements  who  call\r\n\r\nfor  strikes without resort to a secret ballot. All\r\n\r\nthese  are  well-meant  intentions.  But  does   he\r\n\r\nrealise  that in the process of curbing  the  anti-national elements and also the irresponsible  trade\r\n\r\nunion leaders, the loyal and democratic trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  like  the National Trades Union  Congress\r\n\r\nwill also be clobbered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I read the amendments to\r\n\r\nthe  Trade  Unions Ordinance, the new section  24A,\r\n\r\nsubsection (4) wherein -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

While I am not\r\n\r\nattaching  any  blame  on the legal draftsman  for  this\r\n\r\ndefinition, I cannot appreciate its anti-labour concept.\r\n\r\nEven during the heyday of the colonial regime, when our\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and  his colleagues  were  in  the\r\n\r\nforefront  of attack against the anti-labour laws  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign  masters, there was not a single  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  then existing  Ordinance  which\r\n\r\ncould  match  this wonderful piece of  legislation,\r\n\r\nfor  which the present Government attempts to  seek\r\n\r\nthe approval of this Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why at this juncture the Government\r\n\r\nshould exert increased pressure and restrictions on\r\n\r\nthe  union  movement, especially when the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nand  its  affiliates are acting in  a  very  highly\r\n\r\nresponsible  and  democratic manner.  The  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\ntoday  represents 75 per cent of organised  labour,\r\n\r\nand  our  record during the past few years  is  one\r\n\r\nwhich  deserves praise from all quarters.  Even  in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  extreme provocation from  management\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time, we continue to explore peaceful\r\n\r\nways  and  means  with  a view  to  arriving  at  a\r\n\r\nsolution  consistent with our declared objective  -\r\n\r\n\"industrial peace with justice\". Thus, our approach\r\n\r\nhas  resulted  in  very few industrial  actions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. During 1961, there were 116 strikes  and\r\n\r\nlock-outs, while in 1962, the fact that the  figure\r\n\r\nwas   reduced   to  only  88  apparently   was   no\r\n\r\nconsolation  either  to the  employers  or  to  the\r\n\r\nunions.  But at that time, the Government  did  not\r\n\r\nsee  fit  to  introduce measures to curb industrial\r\n\r\naction.  As all the people of Singapore are  aware,\r\n\r\nat  that time, the Government and the N.T.U.C. co-operated  very  well. We fought the Communists.  We\r\n\r\nfought  the crooks. We fought the communalists.  We\r\n\r\ncame  out with flying colours. But it is surprising\r\n\r\nthat  today  the  P.A.P.  Government,  which  often\r\n\r\nclaims   to   be   labour-biased,   is   apparently\r\n\r\ndetermined  to throttle us for no rhyme or  reason.\r\n\r\nCompared  with the figures of industrial  stoppages\r\n\r\nin  1961  and 1962, there were only 31 strikes  and\r\n\r\nlock-outs  in 1965, and further, during  the  first\r\n\r\nsix  months  of  this year, from January  to  June,\r\n\r\nthere  were  hardly  half a dozen  strikes  on  our\r\n\r\nindustrial scene. Mr Speaker, Sir, does  this  not\r\n\r\nindicate  the high sense of responsibility  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  trade union movement  and  also  our\r\n\r\nsuccess in finding a common ground for the economic\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  the Republic? And yet the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  got  the  cheek to introduce such  restrictive\r\n\r\nmeasures to curb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  loyal  democratic trade union movement like  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.!  That being the case, can the  Government\r\n\r\nfurnish   one  good  acceptable  reason   for   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this particular subsection  in  the\r\n\r\namendment which de facto binds and chains the limbs\r\n\r\nof the workers? The colonial masters did not do it.\r\n\r\nThe turbulent years of 1961 and 1962 did not demand\r\n\r\nit,   and   yet  today  in  a  comparatively   calm\r\n\r\natmosphere and situation, the Government  is  going\r\n\r\nto  introduce this amendment - as the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  has  said  earlier - to curb  irresponsible\r\n\r\nleadership and anti-national elements. I completely\r\n\r\nagree  with him. But does he realise that in  doing\r\n\r\nso, we will also get involved? The democratic trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  also  will  be  clobbered  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, a series of statements issued by our\r\n\r\nPrime Minister on labour matters and the number  of\r\n\r\namendments to the labour legislation introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe Labour Minister have subsequently made many  of\r\n\r\nus wonder what exactly the Government are up to. Do\r\n\r\nthey  believe in industrial peace at any costs?  Do\r\n\r\nthey  believe in knocking down the N.T.U.C.,  which\r\n\r\nis  a loyal and democratic trade union movement, so\r\n\r\nthat the Communists and opportunists can take over?\r\n\r\nI  would like to warn this House, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   if  the  Government  prefer  to  allow   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  opportunists  to  take  over   the\r\n\r\ngovernment, they can go ahead with their amendment.\r\n\r\nBut  if  they  choose the N.T.U.C.  -  the  present\r\n\r\nleadership in the trade union movement - then  they\r\n\r\nare listening to the voice of reason. It says, \"Vox\r\n\r\npopuli, vox dei.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While analysing the figures for organised labour\r\n\r\nin  this country for the years 1956 and 1966, I was\r\n\r\nsurprised to note that for the year 1956, organised\r\n\r\nlabour  was 157,216 and for June, 1966, the  figure\r\n\r\nfor  organised  labour  was reduced;  it  was  only\r\n\r\n152,023.  Why is it so? If the Government claim  to\r\n\r\nbe  labour-biased and labour-orientated,  organised\r\n\r\nlabour  should  have  increased,  but  instead  the\r\n\r\nfigure   was  reduced.  Something  must  be   wrong\r\n\r\nsomewhere.  As I understand, in 1956, we  had  only\r\n\r\nsemi-colonial status, but today we are told\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  citizens  of a democratic  socialist\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Further, the labour force has  increased\r\n\r\nsubstantially during the last decade, and today one-third of the total population can be considered  as\r\n\r\neconomically  active. Still, the  total  number  of\r\n\r\nunionised  workers has dwindled. Why?  It  is  very\r\n\r\napparent,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the Government\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  introduce  anti-labour  legislation,\r\n\r\nnobody  will  wonder that the number  of  organised\r\n\r\nworkers has dwindled. So in future, I will  not  be\r\n\r\nsurprised  if  the  number  of  our  organised   or\r\n\r\nunionised workers will be further reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, it will be\r\n\r\npertinent  to refer to section 79 of the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Ordinance which is intended  to  protect\r\n\r\nthe interest of labour from victimisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink   section  79  of  the  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance  has nothing to do with the present  Bill\r\n\r\nwe are discussing now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I will wait to see what\r\n\r\nconnection the Member for Bras Basah seeks to bring\r\n\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> The reason why I mention section\r\n\r\n79  now, which was section 77 (10) then, is to make\r\n\r\na  comparison,  that  for a  piece  of  anti-labour\r\n\r\nlegislation, the Government is ever ready to  bring\r\n\r\nit  to this House for approval. But for a piece  of\r\n\r\nprogressive labour legislation which is intended to\r\n\r\nrestrict  employers - that is  section  79  -  from\r\n\r\nvictimising workers, the Government is reluctant to\r\n\r\ndo  it, in spite of our repeated requests. So  when\r\n\r\nwe  made  repeated requests to put more teeth  into\r\n\r\nthis clause, there was reluctance on the Government\r\n\r\nside.  They just do not care. But today,  they  are\r\n\r\never  ready to bring this new amendment  into  this\r\n\r\nHouse to seek its approval. On the other hand,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour has no hesitation to introduce\r\n\r\nthis  particular  amendment which incorporates  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"industrial action\" which he  himself\r\n\r\nshould  know amounts to selling the labour movement\r\n\r\nlock, stock and barrel to the employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government maintain or at least\r\n\r\nattempt   to  maintain a semblance  of  a  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment! But the working class cannot be  duped.\r\n\r\nThey  can  see  through the \"camouflage\".  We  have\r\n\r\nbattled   right  from  1945  against  colonialists,\r\n\r\nagainst  colonial stooges like Lim  Yew  Hock,  and\r\n\r\nalso  against Communists during 1961 and 1962. But,\r\n\r\ntoday, if we have to face another \"emergency\" which\r\n\r\nwarrants solidarity and determination of the workers to\r\n\r\nstruggle  for the survival of a free and democratic\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement in pursuit of its  legitimate\r\n\r\nmaintenance of dignity of labour, we will  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation  or reservation in doing battle as what we  did  in\r\n\r\nthe  past against the Lim Yew Hock regime  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Now,  I have made it  very  clear before the\r\n\r\nHouse  that it is left to the Government to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether   they   are  to  delete  the   amendments,\r\n\r\nparticularly  subsection (4) , or whether  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to face the wrath of the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I subscribe to the point of view that\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  is designed to curb irresponsible  trade\r\n\r\nleaders  and anti-national elements who call for strikes\r\n\r\nwithout  legitimate grounds and without the  consent  of\r\n\r\nthe majority of their members. As I said earlier, I\r\n\r\ncompletely  agree with that. But in the process  of\r\n\r\ncurbing   the  anti-national  elements   in   their\r\n\r\nirresponsible acts,  the  loyal  democratic  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement like the N.T.U.C. and its affiliates  will\r\n\r\nalso  get  clobbered.  Hence,  I  submit  that  the\r\n\r\namendment  is  totally unnecessary and unwarranted.\r\n\r\nThe  existing laws are sufficient and  adequate  to\r\n\r\ndeal with any situation. For instance, section 28 (b) of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Relations Ordinance  gives  enough\r\n\r\npower  to  the  Minister to refer  any  dispute  to\r\n\r\narbitration  at  any  time. The  President  of  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  is  also  fully  armed  to issue any\r\n\r\ninjunction  to  meet  the  requirements. So why  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  afraid  that  strikes  will  be  called\r\n\r\nwithout secret ballot, and so on? If the President  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  feels that a strike is illegal, he can issue\r\n\r\nan  injunction  to  call it off. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour has full ministerial power to direct  it  to\r\n\r\nCourt. So where is the necessity to have this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment?   Even   the   constitution   of   every\r\n\r\nindividual trade union has also relevant clauses to\r\n\r\nprevent it from taking industrial action without  a\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot. Further, there is the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nTrade Unions - the watchdog of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I submit that this subsection\r\n\r\nshould  not  be incorporated. It should be  totally\r\n\r\ndeleted  from the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the Government will succumb  to  common\r\n\r\nsense  and  democratic ideals  and,  last  but  not\r\n\r\nleast,  give  way to the legitimate rights  of  the\r\n\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We are supposed to be men and women given\r\n\r\nto  liberal,  democratic, socialistic thinking.  If\r\n\r\nall   our   thinking  can  only  produce   pathetic\r\n\r\nlegislation  of  the sort that is  being  attempted\r\n\r\nhere,  then  I  for one am at a loss to  understand\r\n\r\nwhat is meant by either socialism or democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless and until the Hon. Minister supplies us\r\n\r\nwith  very  cogent reasons for the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis amendment, I am of the view that it ought  not\r\n\r\nto  be  approved. As a trade unionist, I  will  not\r\n\r\nstand  for anti-labour legislation in any shape  or\r\n\r\nform. As my colleague the Member for Bras Basah has\r\n\r\nquite  rightly  pointed  out,  the  need  for  such\r\n\r\nrestrictive   provisions  in   the   Trade   Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  completely unjustified, particularly\r\n\r\nin  view of the fact that the figures quoted by him\r\n\r\ndo  not warrant undue restrictions to be imposed at\r\n\r\nthis juncture of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C. and its affiliates cannot, by any\r\n\r\nstretch of the imagination, be termed anti-national\r\n\r\nor  obstructive in their attitude. All that we, the\r\n\r\nworkers of the N.T.U.C., ask for is not to seal our\r\n\r\narmoury  in such a way that our existence  will  be\r\n\r\nrendered    hopelessly   impotent   or   completely\r\n\r\nineffective. There is not one iota of doubt in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the  workers  of  Singapore  that   this\r\n\r\nproposed amendment is rightfully anti-labour. If it\r\n\r\nis  the  Government's intention slowly to  do  away\r\n\r\nwith   every   single  right  of  the  workers   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then we have no doubt that  legislation\r\n\r\nto  this  end is indeed possible. But, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, is this the avowed intention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our Government? Was this our manifesto? I  hope\r\n\r\nnot  and I pray not. The workers of Singapore  have\r\n\r\nbeen  aware  and have been more patient  in  recent\r\n\r\ntimes,  but let this not be mistaken for  cowardice\r\n\r\non their part. For, as the saying goes, even a worm\r\n\r\nwill turn if it is unduly provoked.

What are the reasons?  What  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid  just now is not enough. He said that  judging\r\n\r\nfrom  the last few years, although there have  been\r\n\r\nstrikes, there has been a decrease in the number. But this\r\n\r\ncould  be  ascribed to the fact  that  the  workers\r\n\r\nunder their leaders have realised their own position  and\r\n\r\nhave  co-operated with the Government to  meet  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation. This I say is a good  sign.  To\r\n\r\nsay  that the decrease in the number of strikes has\r\n\r\nbeen  due  to the fact that we have not  introduced\r\n\r\nsuch  an  amendment as this, and that  if  once  we\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  amendment then  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  number of strikes and so on, I should  say\r\n\r\nthis  argument  of his could not hold water.  From  the\r\n\r\npoint  of view of legislation, it is not for us  to\r\n\r\ndiscard our duties in legislation just because  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of strikes has decreased. This can also  be\r\n\r\ndue  to industrial peace. It is a healthy sign.  It\r\n\r\ndoes not go to show that once the number of strikes\r\n\r\nhas  decreased, that shows a healthy  situation  in\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement, legislation must end.  In\r\n\r\na  primitive  age  there was no  strike  whatsoever\r\n\r\nbecause  in  that  society the existence  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions  or strikes was not possible. That  goes  to\r\n\r\nshow   that  it  is  not  necessary  to  have   any\r\n\r\nlegislation on that aspect. It is an extreme  case.\r\n\r\nBut  what I want to point out to him. If we can say\r\n\r\nthat  the reduction in the number of strikes  is  a\r\n\r\nconcrete, collective sign of industrial peace, then\r\n\r\nit  is another matter. If it is just because of the\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  the number of strikes that  we  amend\r\n\r\nthis law, then the anti-national elements will like\r\n\r\nvery  much to amend our law because of that reason. And  if\r\n\r\nthe  anti-national  elements are  wise,  they  will\r\n\r\nadopt  an attitude of opposition in silence. If  in\r\n\r\njust a short period of one year, when they are able\r\n\r\nto control the trade unions or when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey have great influence in the trade unions, they\r\n\r\nwill  suddenly  ask the workers on  their  side  to\r\n\r\nstrike en bloc for one year or half a year. And  by\r\n\r\nthat  time,  can  we  still  say  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for us to make any advance  preparations\r\n\r\nin our legislation to prevent such a situation, and\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to  argue  again  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nreduction in the number of strikes by 90  per  cent\r\n\r\nin  one  year?  What  we can  see  of  the  present\r\n\r\npeaceful  situation in the trade union movement  is\r\n\r\nthat the law should be such that it can endure  all\r\n\r\nsituations  and not just be able to meet  only  the\r\n\r\npresent calm situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We should not think of passing\r\n\r\nlegislation to deal with a situation only  when  it\r\n\r\narises.  The  law should be flexible enough  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to deal with all situations. In other  words,\r\n\r\nit should have a preventive and curative effect.  I\r\n\r\nwill  sum up my conclusions which will give you  my\r\n\r\nopinion  on this matter. I feel that in the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  independence of Singapore, what should  not  be\r\n\r\nlacking  is democracy which should also be  applied\r\n\r\nto  trade unionism. Our trade unionism should  also\r\n\r\nhave  the  manifestation  of  the  spirit  of   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic   Republic  of  Singapore.   Legislation\r\n\r\nshould not prevent the development of the spirit of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.

I  think  our\r\n\r\nnational   trade  union  leaders  have  failed   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  present approach and  thinking.  I\r\n\r\nthink they have failed to understand that they  are\r\n\r\nno longer dealing with a colonial Government, but a\r\n\r\nfree  and  independent Government who has  got  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people at heart. Why do they oppose\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  amendment? I  personally  feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  is nothing wrong in this legislation.  If  a\r\n\r\nunion  wishes to take industrial action and  if  it\r\n\r\nhas legitimate reason to do so, by all means go  on\r\n\r\nstrike. By all means have a strike ballot. If their\r\n\r\nreasons  are valid and if they have the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers, why should they fear this  amendment?\r\n\r\nIt  is  this  very amendment that is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nregulate    irresponsible   employers   and    also\r\n\r\nirresponsible   trade  union   leaders   who   take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the slightest reason to go on  strike,\r\n\r\nwith  the result that the public suffers.  We  have\r\n\r\nseen many cases of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that this Bill gives\r\n\r\nadequate  power  to  the  Registrar  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nirresponsible trade union leaders who do not  abide\r\n\r\nby the rules of their union.

I am sure that if this Bill  had  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  then,  such  action  would  have   been\r\n\r\nunnecessary and the workers would have been  spared\r\n\r\nthe expense of having to take High Court action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Generally, for\r\n\r\nthose union leaders who can act in a lawful manner,\r\n\r\nthere  is no difficulty. In this country, for those\r\n\r\nwho treat the workers well and who want to work for\r\n\r\ntheir  welfare,  there is scope. We  cannot  expect\r\n\r\nprogress and prosperity by suppressing the  workers\r\n\r\nand  reducing their affluence. Production  will  go\r\n\r\ndown.  The country's affluence will also  go  down.\r\n\r\nFor  example, today the labour unions, through  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement, often resort to strikes. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  which  law  they follow.  It  is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessary to restrict these activities. The  unions\r\n\r\nare  meant  to lift up the workers. When  they  see\r\n\r\nsuch  a severe law, they will think that they  have\r\n\r\nto  work  for  the trade unions and  work  for  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement. And they will then  come  to  the\r\n\r\nstage to take further action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a law is made, the situation should be\r\n\r\ncarefully  examined. We should know which  are  the\r\n\r\ncountries where there is confusion, and when  there\r\n\r\nis  such  confusion, the country or the people  may\r\n\r\nsuffer; and when there is such a situation,  a  law\r\n\r\nsimilar to this is necessary. My friend the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah has stated that it is not  easy  to\r\n\r\nstage  a strike. When there is a strike, we have  a\r\n\r\nlaw  and  we can deal with that. We have to  follow\r\n\r\nthe proper way and exercise control, and if workers\r\n\r\ndo  not  come under control, then we will  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  further  action.

Anti-national elements  are  not\r\n\r\nconfined  to  the  Communists alone.  They  include\r\n\r\nopportunistic  employers.  They  come   under   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"anti-national elements\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 24A (4) has been emphasised by\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member for Bras Basah:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"industrial action\" means any action aimed at\r\n\r\nretarding,  obstructing, limiting or  reducing  the\r\n\r\nnormal progress of work in any occupation,...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand so on.

Naturally those bus\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are doing shift duties will  have  to\r\n\r\nattend  the  meeting,  which  means  that  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices  will  be affected. In  such  a  case  the\r\n\r\nemployers  will take the opportunity  to  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  particular  section can  be  taken  as  going\r\n\r\nagainst   that   particular   section.   Then   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   cannot  do  anything.  That   is   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty with which we will be faced. That is the\r\n\r\nfundamental  issue  which is  brought  out  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  I hope such matters  can  be  looked\r\n\r\nafter carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, as has been said by the hon.

That  also  must   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  so  that  this Bill  will  be  enforced\r\n\r\nsmoothly  for the benefit of both sides,  including\r\n\r\nworkers and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

What is\r\n\r\nthere  in  this Bill to be afraid of if  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions themselves are aware of where they stand and\r\n\r\nwhat  they  do?  Sir,  there is  a  saying  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  field  that state power  put  in  proper\r\n\r\nhands will lead men to a good society.

Sir,\r\n\r\nI  know of unionists who try to use union authority\r\n\r\nto  go  into the normal day-to-day problems of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. For instance, if there happen to  be  some\r\n\r\nmembers  who  do  not toe the line,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nthreatened  by the trade unionists that  they  will\r\n\r\nsee   to  it  that  they  are  sacked  from   their\r\n\r\nemployment. There are certain trade union officials\r\n\r\nin  Government departments who even threaten  their\r\n\r\nown colleagues by using their own position as trade\r\n\r\nunion  officials.

He\r\n\r\nthought this new section is beneficial to employers\r\n\r\nand  not  to employees. I feel that it is  not  so,\r\n\r\nbecause   the   important   thing   lies   in   the\r\n\r\norganisation  and leadership of a trade  union.  If\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of a trade union can guide it  well\r\n\r\nand  can look after the interest of its members  so\r\n\r\nthat  a  secret  ballot can  be  taken  before  any\r\n\r\nindustrial  action, then the Member for Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nwill have no cause to worry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the executive members of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union headquarters or branch having  to\r\n\r\nregister with the Registrar. I think this will help\r\n\r\nto consolidate the organisation and discipline of a\r\n\r\ntrade union, and is good. It will also prevent anti-national  elements  designs on  trade  unions.  The\r\n\r\nstrength of trade unions cannot be ignored, and our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  all along been looking  after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  and interest of the workers by legislative\r\n\r\naction.  Let  me  refer  to an  example  concerning\r\n\r\nworkmen's  compensation. In the past one year,  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  amounted  to $400,000.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Government has always been  encouraging\r\n\r\nhealthy   trade   unionism.   For   instance,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has a big sum of money to  build  Union\r\n\r\nHouse   to  show  its  keen  for  democratic  trade\r\n\r\nunionism,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand it is still continuing to give such support  in\r\n\r\norder that trade unionism can develop and grow from\r\n\r\nstrength to strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ridiculous to say that this Government has\r\n\r\nall  of  a  sudden become an anti-labour Government\r\n\r\nbecause of the introduction of this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  will  only give the impression to the  public\r\n\r\nthat  there  are even Members on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse who think that the Government is anti-labour.\r\n\r\nI  hope this is not the intention of the Member for\r\n\r\nBras Basah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all the amendments proposed here will\r\n\r\nbe implemented correctly and properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been\r\n\r\nencouraging   today  to  hear   our   trade   union\r\n\r\ncolleagues speak with so much gusto on this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah, who reminds us that he\r\n\r\nis  also the Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C., has\r\n\r\naccused the Government of clobbering, knocking down\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C. by way of opposing this Bill.

Some\r\n\r\nMembers  have  described this Bill as  a  wonderful\r\n\r\npiece  of  legislation which did not even exist  in\r\n\r\nthe  colonial days.

Opposition has been concentrated on clause 3,\r\n\r\nin  particular, new section 24A (1)  and  (4) .  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I do not want to be reminded that  we\r\n\r\nare  not in Committee but all that new section  24A\r\n\r\n(1) says is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A registered trade union shall not commence,\r\n\r\npromote, organise or finance any strike or lock-out\r\n\r\nor  any  form  of  industrial  action  without  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the  majority of the members  thereof,\r\n\r\nwhich  consent shall be obtained by taking a secret\r\n\r\nballot  of  the  members of such  registered  trade\r\n\r\nunion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the N.T.U.C. claims to be - again to use the\r\n\r\nwords  of the Member for Bras Basah - \"a democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  trade union\". Why then is it  afraid  to\r\n\r\nseek  the  views  of its members?  This  particular\r\n\r\npiece of legislation does not ban all strikes, lock-outs  or any form of industrial action. All it does\r\n\r\nis  to  say, \"Before you start a strike,  seek  the\r\n\r\nviews  of your members.\" And I would say that  this\r\n\r\nBill   protects  members  of  trade   unions   from\r\n\r\nirresponsible leaders. Before you go on a strike or\r\n\r\na  go-slow or, as the Member for Kampong Kapor  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Lain2 perkara\", what is wrong  with  asking\r\n\r\nyour  members?  They do not want  to  rise  up  one\r\n\r\nmorning  and  find  flags flying, members  shouting\r\n\r\nslogans, pickets all round the place - a strike  is\r\n\r\non.  This has happened before and this is  what  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  prevent. If the N.T.U.C. claims to  be  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  democratic socialist  trade  union,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  any good reason why it  should  oppose\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather\r\n\r\nsurprised that the Member for Bras Basah has made a\r\n\r\nsudden outburst over this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to restore democratic rights to\r\n\r\nthe  workers.

I do  not  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  do all the work for the trade unions.  They\r\n\r\nmust  also  do some work themselves. The Government\r\n\r\ncan only prevent criminals and undesirable elements\r\n\r\nin  a  wide sense from taking office. If there  are\r\n\r\nother categories of undesirable elements, then  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  must remove them by  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess of election. That is all they can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also worried that non-citizens\r\n\r\ncarrying work permits will not be allowed  to  work\r\n\r\nin  trade  unions, and he wants  us  to  put  in  a\r\n\r\nprovision to exempt them if they are of any good. I\r\n\r\nshould  say  that  he  should not  worry  about  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the provision is already there, in  clause\r\n\r\n5, i.e. new section 26B (b) :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister may by order -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) grant, either absolutely or subject to such\r\n\r\nconditions as he may consider reasonably necessary,\r\n\r\nexemption\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  all or any of the provisions of section  26\r\n\r\nor 26A in respect of officers or employees...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The power of exemption is already there, so he need\r\n\r\nnot be worried about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I should say that responsible\r\n\r\ntrade  union leaders should not be afraid  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.

I  have  already  said  that  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  is administering this Bill and I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  our officials are so foolish as to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  holding of this genuine general meeting of the\r\n\r\nworkers is an industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 4 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nearlier  on I have said that in the enforcement  of\r\n\r\nclause  3 (section 24A (1) ), there is no difference\r\n\r\nbetween citizens and non-citizens of Singapore. But\r\n\r\nunder  this clause 4, a person who is not a citizen\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  - it does not say whether  he  is  a\r\n\r\nholder  or a non-holder of a work permit  -  cannot\r\n\r\nbecome  an official of a trade union. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour has also said just now that every member\r\n\r\nof  a union has democratic rights as a worker under\r\n\r\nclause 3, new section 24A of this Bill. But in this\r\n\r\nclause 4, however, members who are holders of  work\r\n\r\npermits   are   denied   the   democratic   rights.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I suggest that the following  words  be\r\n\r\nadded  to  section 26 (1) (a) , \"those who  are  not\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  or  who  are  not  yet  in\r\n\r\npossession of work permits.\" Just now the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  also  said that trade union leaders  need  not\r\n\r\nworry because he has his prerogative under clause 5\r\n\r\nof  this  amendment  Bill, because  he  can  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  non-citizens of Singapore who are  holders\r\n\r\nof  work permits can or cannot become officials  of\r\n\r\nunions. Why cannot this be vice versa? That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay, if the Minister finds that the person is not a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of Singapore but is the holder of  a  work\r\n\r\npermit,  then he can use his prerogative to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  union and ask the particular member  to  cease\r\n\r\nbeing  an  official of the union.  So  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can consider my amendment regarding  those\r\n\r\nwho  are not citizens of Singapore or those who are\r\n\r\nnot yet in possession of work permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is now possible to amend this  Bill  any\r\n\r\nfurther.  I  hope the Member for Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nshould not confuse citizens of Singapore with  non-citizens   who   are  holding  work  permits.   The\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  this  Bill is to  exclude  any  non-citizen from taking part in the running of a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.  If  we  allow  non-citizens  holding   work\r\n\r\npermits  to  be included, then the object  of  this\r\n\r\nBill will be defeated. But only in very exceptional\r\n\r\ncases  can  the Minister by his power  exempt  such\r\n\r\npersons  from this provision.

I beg to move, \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Third time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this is a very important\r\n\r\nBill which will affect all Muslims in the Republic,\r\n\r\nand  so  that what I have to say in this  House  is\r\n\r\nfully   understood   and   appreciated   by   them,\r\n\r\nespecially the Malays, I will speak in the national\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) The Administration of Muslim Law Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich has been under consideration for a number  of\r\n\r\nyears,  was  referred  to  a  Select  Committee  in\r\n\r\nJanuary   1966   after   its   introduction    into\r\n\r\nParliament.  The closing period for the  submission\r\n\r\nof  written representations on the Bill, originally\r\n\r\nfixed   on   24th  January,  1966,  was  eventually\r\n\r\nextended  to  the  31st March, 1966.  In  all,  18\r\n\r\nwritten  representations  were  received  and  oral\r\n\r\nevidence was heard from 14 of the representors. The\r\n\r\nBill  was subjected to close scrutiny not  only  by\r\n\r\nMuslim  organisations and persons but also  by  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  which had  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nadvice not only of the Attorney-General but also of\r\n\r\nTuan Haji Mohamed Sanusi Bin Mahmood, the President\r\n\r\nof the Shariah Court. The Bill was also referred to\r\n\r\na  number  of  Muslim scholars in England  and  the\r\n\r\nUnited Arab Republic and it is hoped that the Bill,\r\n\r\nwhile  it  may  not  satisfy  every  one,  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  as  a  significant step  forward  in  the\r\n\r\nregulation of Muslim religious affairs and  in  the\r\n\r\nproper administration of Muslim law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, it must be emphasised, does not seek to\r\n\r\ndeal  with the Muslim law itself but only with  its\r\n\r\nadministration. No attempt has been made  to  alter\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental concepts or rules of  Muslim  law\r\n\r\nand where the Bill suggests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprovements  in the administration of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nlaw,  every  effort  has been made  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nprecedents which have been adopted in other  Muslim\r\n\r\ncountries.  The  Bill,  in the  main,  follows  the\r\n\r\nstructure  of the various Administration of  Muslim\r\n\r\nLaw  enactments  in the States in Western  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  it  has  also  followed  the  changes  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of Muslim law in the Arab  countries\r\n\r\nand in Pakistan and, in this respect, represents  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable    advance    towards    the    better\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  law  and  the  removal  of\r\n\r\ndiscriminations and abuses in such administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to constitute a Council of Muslim\r\n\r\nReligion   which  will  be  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\nregulation   of   Muslim   religious   affairs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Most  of  the representations  received\r\n\r\ndealt with the composition of the Council and  many\r\n\r\nwould  like it to be a fully elected body  entirely\r\n\r\nfree  from  any  control or supervision.  This,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  would be an ideal to which all of us should\r\n\r\nstrive. But those who are aware of the position  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and of how easily religious issues can be\r\n\r\nused  or abused to create division, dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nand civil strife must agree that, to begin with, at\r\n\r\nany   rate,   there  must  be  some   control   and\r\n\r\nsupervision, not necessarily by the Government  but\r\n\r\nby  the more stable elements in Muslim society. The\r\n\r\nBill  therefore  provides for an  equal  number  of\r\n\r\nelected and appointed members - and this is  indeed\r\n\r\nin  line  with the composition of the  Councils  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  religion in the States of Malaysia. In  the\r\n\r\npresent stage of Muslim society in Singapore, also,\r\n\r\nit  would  appear  that election  from  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nregistered  societies  in Singapore  will  not,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  provide a representative body  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  power of the President to appoint members\r\n\r\nwill  enable  the  Majlis to be a body  more  fully\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the Muslims of  Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  first  time  that  the  Muslims   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  have  a  body  to  regulate  their\r\n\r\nreligious  affairs. The Council of Muslim  Religion\r\n\r\nwill  have considerable executive powers  and  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  merely  an advisory body like  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Board. It appears to be wise  caution  to\r\n\r\nensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the powers of the Council are not abused, that\r\n\r\nit  will be an executive body whose sole purpose is\r\n\r\nto  serve the interests of the Muslims of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  that  it  will not be used for  any  personal,\r\n\r\nsectional or political purposes. On behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I  should like to give  the  assurance\r\n\r\nthat no political influence will be made to bear on\r\n\r\nthe  Council. All that the Government is interested\r\n\r\nin  is  to  see that the affairs of the Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are entrusted to a wise, forward-looking\r\n\r\nand stable organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Council, as I have said,\r\n\r\nwill   have  considerable  executive  powers.  Some\r\n\r\nrepresentors  would like to deny the Council  these\r\n\r\npowers and, in effect, to leave the organisation of\r\n\r\nMuslim  society very much as it is at present.  The\r\n\r\npower  of  the  Majlis to arrange for  the  orderly\r\n\r\ncollection  and  distribution of  zakat  and  zakat\r\n\r\nfitrah  has,  for  example,  been  criticized.   At\r\n\r\npresent,  zakat  fitrah is collected  not  only  by\r\n\r\nMuslim      societies,     including      political\r\n\r\norganisations,  but also by individuals.  There  is\r\n\r\nduplication  and  wastage of  resources.  If  zakat\r\n\r\nfitrah  were properly collected, a sum of  $100,000\r\n\r\ncan be collected each year and this will provide an\r\n\r\neffective  fund  for  the  relief  of  poverty  and\r\n\r\ndistress  among  the  Muslims  in  Singapore.  Some\r\n\r\nrepresentors again would deny the Majlis the powers\r\n\r\nin relation to charitable foundations which are now\r\n\r\npossessed by the Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill,  it  is true, provides that  the  Majlis\r\n\r\nshall have power to take over the administration of\r\n\r\nany  Muslim  charitable endowment, if it  is  shown\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  to the advantage of the  endowment.\r\n\r\nThis power is already possessed, as I said, by  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  and  Hindu  Endowments  Board.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ncontemplated that the Council will be able to  take\r\n\r\nover the administration of all Muslim endowments in\r\n\r\nSingapore;  most of them will still  be  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  private trustees but  subject  to  the\r\n\r\nsupervision  of the Council and with power  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  remove the trustees  and  appoint  new\r\n\r\ntrustees,   where  such  a  step  appears   to   be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I  should like to  emphasise  that  the\r\n\r\nCouncil will be a Muslim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation,  whose  members  should  and  can  be\r\n\r\ntrusted to ensure that the interests of the Muslims\r\n\r\nwill be safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks also to strengthen the powers of\r\n\r\nthe  Shariah Court in Singapore and to provide  for\r\n\r\nthe   better  administration  of  Muslim   law   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. A Mufti will be appointed and he will be\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of a Committee of the Council  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  empowered to give rulings on Muslim  law.\r\n\r\nThe  administration of the law relating to marriage\r\n\r\nand divorce has been further strengthened following\r\n\r\nthe  precedents in the Arab countries and Pakistan,\r\n\r\nand  the Bill will provide that the Muslim law will\r\n\r\napply  not  only  to  the  distribution  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nestates on intestacy but also to testate succession\r\n\r\namong  Muslims. In all these matters, the views  of\r\n\r\nthe representors have been given full consideration\r\n\r\nand the Bill has, in fact, been amended to meet the\r\n\r\nrepresentations made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many respects, the Bill represents a\r\n\r\ncompromise.  On  the minimum age of  marriage,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  some representations would like  the  age\r\n\r\nincreased to eighteen; others would prefer  not  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  minimum age of marriage. The Bill provides\r\n\r\nthat the minimum age shall be 16 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it has not been possible to please\r\n\r\neverybody  and  to  accept all the  representations\r\n\r\nmade, it is hoped that the Bill will be welcomed as\r\n\r\none   more  step  -  a  significant  step - in   the\r\n\r\nregulation  of  Muslim affairs and  in  the  proper\r\n\r\nadministration of Muslim law in Singapore. The Bill\r\n\r\nalso  represents  a significant advance  in  social\r\n\r\nlegislation for the protection of women, and it  is\r\n\r\nhoped   that  Muslim  women  will,  in  particular,\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  Bill. The Bill has not, it  is  true,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  Muslim women all the  benefits  of  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter, 1961, but in itself and within its\r\n\r\nlimitations  it  represents  a  charter  which  has\r\n\r\nrestored to Muslim women their rights of which  for\r\n\r\nlong they have been deprived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nevery  law  that  is  enacted  cannot  satisfy  all\r\n\r\nsections  of  the  people.  The  Administration  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Law Bill, which is now being read  a  Third\r\n\r\ntime  today, does not amend the Muslim law  itself,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  a Bill to administer Muslim law.  Here\r\n\r\narises   misunderstanding  among  members  of   the\r\n\r\npublic, because the States in Malaysia, who are our\r\n\r\nimmediate neighbours, have established Councils  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Religion to administer the  Muslim  law  in\r\n\r\ntheir States. It is appropriate that Singapore,  as\r\n\r\ntheir  immediate neighbour, should have  a  similar\r\n\r\nlaw. Furthermore, in addition to being a neighbour,\r\n\r\nwe have maintained close contacts with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parts of the Muslim law have been taken from\r\n\r\nMuslim  laws  implemented in Western  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  believe, before their enforcement,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given careful consideration by the Ulamas  in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective States and which have  eventually\r\n\r\nbeen  approved by the State Assemblies.  To  be  in\r\n\r\nline  with our neighbours, it can be said that more\r\n\r\nthan  80 per cent, or more than 100 clauses in this\r\n\r\nBill  have  been  taken from  States  like  Penang,\r\n\r\nSelangor  and  Pahang, and the remainder  from  the\r\n\r\nMuslims Ordinance, 1957, which is in force  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the speech of the Minister for Social\r\n\r\nAffairs   which  says  that  this  Bill   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  in stages. The most important  is  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  a  Council of Muslim  Religion,  a\r\n\r\nMufti, and a Council of Rulings, or Fetua. It is up\r\n\r\nto  the  Legal Committee and the Council of  Muslim\r\n\r\nReligion  to put up recommendations to the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned if they find it necessary to amend  parts\r\n\r\nof  the Bill. I am sure that the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nwill give due consideration if such amendments  are\r\n\r\nfound necessary in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On principle, and for the reasons stated above, I\r\n\r\nfully support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion\r\n\r\n\"That  the  Bill  be now read a  Third  time.\"  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  given full opportunity  to  Muslim\r\n\r\nbodies and Muslims individually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  study  the  Bill, which has been  deferred  for\r\n\r\nabout   four  years.

They do so deliberately with  a\r\n\r\nview to misleading the Muslim population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the passing of this Bill in the\r\n\r\nRepublic   will   be  one  step  further   in   the\r\n\r\nadvancement of Muslim affairs. It is true that this\r\n\r\nBill  cannot  satisfy all sections  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\npopulation, but I am sure that when the Council  of\r\n\r\nMuslim Religion is set up, its implementation  will\r\n\r\nbe  examined from time to time to fit in  with  the\r\n\r\nchanging times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Muslim population in the Republic\r\n\r\nwill  give their full support in the implementation\r\n\r\nof  this Bill.

This is proper procedure because the provisions in the Bill can be examined from time to time. I wish to reiterate that only a minority of the Muslim population are opposed to this Bill, and\r\n\r\nI know that their opposition is not in the interest\r\n\r\nof Muslims but in their own self-interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully support the Third Reading of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

However,  Mr  Speaker, we  must  protect  and\r\n\r\nsafeguard the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the assurance of the Minister for\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs that the implementation of the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  be  carried  out  stage  by  stage.  This  is\r\n\r\npractical  and wise, because this is a  Bill  which\r\n\r\naffects  Muslims  as  a  whole.  Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for us to examine it from time  to  time\r\n\r\nwith a view to improving it. I am sure that it will\r\n\r\nsatisfy all Muslims in Singapore in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Speaker, whilst welcoming\r\n\r\nthe   Minister's   assurance  that   it   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  stage  by stage, I hope  an  assurance\r\n\r\nwill also be given by him to appoint members to the\r\n\r\nCouncil  when the time comes. I hope he  will  once\r\n\r\nagain use his discretion so that political elements\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  appointed to the Council,  including\r\n\r\nthose  from  the  ruling Party.  In  this  way  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  will  comprise  persons  who  are   really\r\n\r\nconversant with Muslim law, so that it will not  be\r\n\r\nused as a political platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, that if the Minister in\r\n\r\ncharge  can  judiciously implement this  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  Muslims will have confidence  in  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  will  be  Muslims  who   will   be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied because they will be at a disadvantage\r\n\r\nor  because  they  may  not  be  appointed  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil. No person in this world can satisfy  every\r\n\r\nmember of his community, but what we can do  is  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the great majority of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Administration of Muslim Law  Bill  was  first\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1960. At that time, the Bill  was  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  and there was a Malay rendition,  We  must\r\n\r\nalso remember, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that  in 1960 the P.A.P. was  in  power.\r\n\r\nPrior  to  that,  there was an Alliance  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  included  political  Parties  like  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nSince the P.A.P. Government introduced the Bill  in\r\n\r\n1960, representations have been put forward by  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community. Today we will be taking the  Bill\r\n\r\nthrough  its  Third Reading. Over a period  of  six\r\n\r\nyears  -  six  years is a long period - opportunity\r\n\r\nwas  given  to  the Muslim population to  consider,\r\n\r\nexamine, and decide upon the Bill which affects the\r\n\r\nMuslim community. Certainly, Mr Speaker, this Bill\r\n\r\nseeks to put right the administration of Muslim law\r\n\r\nwhich   is   being  administered  by  the   Muslims\r\n\r\nthemselves.  By  Muslims, I  mean  those  qualified\r\n\r\nMuslims  who  are holders of diplomas and  who  are\r\n\r\nvery  conversant with Muslim law. They are  experts\r\n\r\nin  the Muslim law, and will remove persons who use\r\n\r\nthe Muslim religion for their own self-interest  or\r\n\r\nfor   their  own  monetary  interest  -  like   the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  zakat fitrah  -  and  not  for  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the Muslim community. It follows  that,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  point  of view of the Muslim  community,\r\n\r\nthere  exist persons who misuse religion,  as,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  collection of zakat fitrah  not  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  Muslim  law.  According   to\r\n\r\ntoday's  newspapers  - the Straits  Times  and  the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu - U.M.N.O, has expressed  its  views\r\n\r\nwhich,  inter alia, support the Bill in  principle.\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. has emphasised on the membership  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Muslim Religion. That is the  worry  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. There is no other worry as far as they are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  In  the  Utusan  Melayu  today,  it  is\r\n\r\nmentioned  that the Select Committee  has  rejected\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. proposals. It has been mentioned  earlier\r\n\r\non  by  the Minister for Social Affairs that, among\r\n\r\nthe   representations,  the  Select  Committee  has\r\n\r\naccepted  some.  What  the  Select  Committee   has\r\n\r\nrejected  is  that we do not want  members  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim religion in Singapore who are unqualified in\r\n\r\nmatters relating to Muslim law. These members  must\r\n\r\nbe  holders of recognised diplomas from an  Islamic\r\n\r\nuniversity. The Government want such people  to  be\r\n\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there are U.M.N.O. leaders\r\n\r\nwho  are  qualified  and who  have  graduated  from\r\n\r\nIslamic  universities, and if they are  anxious  to\r\n\r\nsit  on  the Council, they are at liberty to submit\r\n\r\ntheir applications to the authorities concerned. If\r\n\r\nthere  is any member of U.M.N.O. who has been  left\r\n\r\nout  and who is aspiring to be the President of the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Muslim Religion, if he is qualified  and\r\n\r\nin    possession   of   the   requisite    academic\r\n\r\nqualifications, the Government will not hesitate to\r\n\r\nappoint such a person. The object of the Government\r\n\r\nis  to  appoint  suitably qualified persons.  There\r\n\r\nshould  be no worry from U.M.N.O. because our  real\r\n\r\naim  is to protect and promote the Muslim community\r\n\r\nso  that  they  will not be duped  by  persons  who\r\n\r\nmisuse   this  religion  for  their  own  political\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Mr Speaker, Sir, political Parties in\r\n\r\nthe  opposition want to hinder the passage  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  because it has been brought out  by  a  Party\r\n\r\nwhich   does  not  play  on  religion,   like   our\r\n\r\nopposition  political Parties. Yet we are  prepared\r\n\r\nto  protect the interest of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  race, colour  or  creed.  We  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the Republic of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole. That is all, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INHERITANCE (FAMILY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>PROVISION) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
