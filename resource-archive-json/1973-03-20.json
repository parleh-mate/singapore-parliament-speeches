I  have outlined in  some  detail  the\r\n\r\nmonetary measures which have been taken to  absorb\r\n\r\nthe  excess  liquidity  in the  economy  to  check\r\n\r\ninflationary  pressures. The  most  recent  policy\r\n\r\naction  was  the  increase of the minimum  reserve\r\n\r\nrequirement which banks and finance companies have\r\n\r\nto   maintain  with  the  Monetary  Authority   of\r\n\r\nSingapore against their deposit liabilities from 5\r\n\r\nper  cent  to  9 per cent. Similarly, the  special\r\n\r\ndeposit  which banks have to keep with MAS against\r\n\r\ntheir  net  foreign liabilities has been increased\r\n\r\nfrom 5 per cent to 9 per cent. These measures came\r\n\r\ninto  effect on 16th March, 1973. The  effects  of\r\n\r\nthese  measures on credit creation and  the  money\r\n\r\nsupply will be felt in the coming months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic monetary situation will be closely\r\n\r\nwatched   particularly  in  the   light   of   new\r\n\r\ndevelopments   in   the   international   currency\r\n\r\nmarkets.

What we cannot  do  is  to  prevent\r\n\r\nfailure  of  crops in large areas  of  the  world,\r\n\r\ncausing  a  world shortage of rice, wheat,  sugar,\r\n\r\nand  other  essential commodities, which  cause  a\r\n\r\nrise  in the prices of these commodities.  Let  us\r\n\r\nhope  there  is a fair harvest this year  so  that\r\n\r\ngrain  prices will go back to normal. However,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  avoid  a rise in the cost  of  imports  of\r\n\r\nmanufactured  goods, resulting from the  increased\r\n\r\nwages  and inflation of some industrial countries.\r\n\r\nOf  course, some of these countries may have, from\r\n\r\ntime  to time, to devalue their currencies but  it\r\n\r\nnever brings prices back to what they used to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REVISION OF SALARIES FOR THE PRESIDENT AND CABINET MINISTERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it is 18 years, since 1955, when the  salary\r\n\r\nfor  the  post of Chief Minister, and subsequently\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, was fixed at $3,500. The position\r\n\r\nfor Ministers became intolerable by 1970, when  an\r\n\r\nadjustment had to be made. It is time to do a more\r\n\r\ncomplete revision of these salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with my colleagues\r\n\r\nin Cabinet and decided as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) All Cabinet Ministers will be paid the salary\r\n\r\nof $7,000, i.e. $500 more than Superscale Grade  A ($6,500).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Dr Goh Keng Swee, who acts for me from time\r\n\r\nto  time,  will  fill  the post  of  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. It will carry a salary of $8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Dr Toh Chin Chye will have a Charge Allowance\r\n\r\nof  $700  for  discharging  the  duties  of  Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore, as well as being Minister for Science and Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Senior Minister of State will be equivalent\r\n\r\nto  Superscale Grade C ($4,500), Minister of State\r\n\r\nequivalent to Superscale Grade D ($3,500),  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary equivalent to  Superscale\r\n\r\nGrade    F   ($2,750),   Parliamentary   Secretary\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  Super-scale Grade G ($2,500),  and\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary, $1,750.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) My own salary as Prime Minister will be $9,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The President's emoluments will be raised\r\n\r\nfrom  $4,000, which is tax-free, to $12,000,  with $4,000   tax-free.  However,  the  President   has requested me to inform the House that he does  not\r\n\r\nwish to make use of this increase in his salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of civil servants, these salaries\r\n\r\nwill be effective from 1st March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   year,   and  they  will  be   revised   and\r\n\r\nconsolidated every four to five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these adjustments in salaries, two\r\n\r\nconsiderations have been uppermost in  our  minds.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  need for some rough correlation  with\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Service pay scales. Second, they should\r\n\r\nbe  sufficiently realistic, so that in  the  years\r\n\r\nahead,  it  will not be so much of a sacrifice  to\r\n\r\ngive  up  a job in the private sector in order  to\r\n\r\ntake on the responsibilities of public office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is seldom possible to pay a man in his\r\n\r\nMinisterial position as much as what he would get,\r\n\r\neither in running a business or practising his own\r\n\r\nprofession. Some sacrifice is inevitable.

It  was\r\n\r\nfor  this reason that the Minister for Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology appointed an Ad Hoc Committee  in  May,\r\n\r\n1969, to advise on matters relating to the use  of\r\n\r\nradioisotopes and irradiating apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through specific licensing on imports introduced\r\n\r\nby  the  Ad  Hoc Committee in 1970 and  through  a\r\n\r\nsurvey   conducted   by  the  Ministry,   it   was\r\n\r\nascertained that currently there are at least  170\r\n\r\nirradiating apparatus and at least 4,500 curies of\r\n\r\nradioisotopes  in use in Singapore.  Further,  the\r\n\r\nrate   of   importation   of   radioisotopes   and\r\n\r\nirradiating apparatus is estimated at  an  average\r\n\r\nof  18  imports  per month for the  year  1971  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  15 imports per month  for  the  year\r\n\r\n1970.  Most of the irradiating apparatus are X-ray\r\n\r\nmachines while in the case of radioactive material\r\n\r\nthey  are  mainly in the form of  Cobalt  60  (for\r\n\r\nhealing  purposes),  Iridium 192  (for  industrial\r\n\r\nradiography) and a scatter of Tritium and  Caesium\r\n\r\nand others (for use in non-destructive testing  or\r\n\r\nas  radioactive  tracers). The number  of  persons\r\n\r\ntrained   to   handle  radioactive  material   and\r\n\r\nirradiating apparatus is also on the increase  and\r\n\r\nat the last count, they numbered about 150.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irradiating apparatus and radioisotopes are\r\n\r\nmainly   used  by  three  major  sectors,  namely,\r\n\r\nindustries, Government and institutions of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning.  In the industrial sector, the  uses  of\r\n\r\nirradiating apparatus and radioisotopes are mainly\r\n\r\nconfined    to    non-destructive   testing    and\r\n\r\nradioactive tracer technology\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith    the    shipbuilding   and   ship-repairing\r\n\r\nindustries as a dominant user (testing  of  weld).\r\n\r\nIn the Government sector, these are mainly used in\r\n\r\nhospitals  for  diagnostic  and  healing  purposes\r\n\r\nwhile in the institutions of higher learning, they\r\n\r\nare used for research purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With growing sophistication and expansion in our\r\n\r\nindustries and medical services, it is anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  the  variety  and  quantity  of  imports  of\r\n\r\nradioisotopes  and  irradiating  apparatus   would\r\n\r\nregister  very significant increases in the  years\r\n\r\nto  come  to  be  accompanied by  a  corresponding\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number of  persons  trained  to\r\n\r\nhandle such material and apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main, the Bill seeks to make provision for\r\n\r\nthe   regulation   and  control  of   importation,\r\n\r\nmanufacture,   sale,   disposal,   transportation,\r\n\r\npossession  and use of radioactive  materials  and\r\n\r\nirradiating  apparatus such that these  activities\r\n\r\nmay  not be permitted except with a licence to  be\r\n\r\nissued by the Director of Radiation Protection who\r\n\r\nshall be appointed by the Minister for Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology for the administration of the  proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, the Bill provides for the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  pharmacists, medical  practitioners\r\n\r\nand veterinary surgeons to authorise these persons\r\n\r\nto  sell and to use radioactive materials for  the\r\n\r\ntreatment  of human beings and animals.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nfurther   requires  workers  handling  radioactive\r\n\r\nmaterial and irradiating apparatus to be protected\r\n\r\nfrom the hazards of over-exposure through constant\r\n\r\nmonitoring  of their exposure levels  and  regular\r\n\r\nmedical examination. There are also provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe   Bill  whereby  persons  aggrieved   by   the\r\n\r\nenforcement of the proposed legislation  may  have\r\n\r\nan avenue of appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill empowers the Minister to make\r\n\r\nsubsidiary   legislation  for  a  more   effective\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  the proposed legislation  and  to\r\n\r\nestablish a Radiation Advisory Committee to advise\r\n\r\non  matters  pertaining to the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr E.

But  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain defects in the Bill. I do not know whether\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"owner\" of property would  also\r\n\r\ninclude  the  Government. The  Government  owns  a\r\n\r\ngreat number of buildings and properties, and I do\r\n\r\nnot  really know whether the intention of the Bill\r\n\r\nis  to include the Government in the definition of\r\n\r\n\"owner\".  If  the  Bill is  meant  for  owners  of\r\n\r\nproperties in the private sector, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif any such owner infringes the provisions of this\r\n\r\nBill,  he may be sued by Government in court.

I am  therefore  a\r\n\r\nbit  puzzled  as  to  whether  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"owner\"  in this Bill includes the Government.  If\r\n\r\nit  does not include the Government, then I  think\r\n\r\nit is necessary to look further into the matter to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  there  is any need  to  include  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the definition. Otherwise the people\r\n\r\nwill  say  that the Government is allowed  to  get\r\n\r\naway  with  all  sorts  of infringements  but  the\r\n\r\ncommon people are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, this Bill is all-embracing.

Perhaps to keep the Member for  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nhappy, I will enlighten him. He has asked to  whom\r\n\r\nshould  any notice be served? Well, in  this  case\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner will have the duty, pleasant  or\r\n\r\nunpleasant,  of  serving  notice  either  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment or on the head of any statutory  board,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is the Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  Public Utilities Board, the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority, or even the Singapore Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard, if it owns and lets out property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nMinister.

Touting in black-market  cinema  tickets has  increased  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears   despite  regular  raids  mounted  by   law\r\n\r\nenforcement officers. In July last year, a special\r\n\r\nanti-tout   squad  was  formed  by   the   Customs\r\n\r\nDepartment, and since the inception of this squad,\r\n\r\nsustained  raids have been made resulting  in  the\r\n\r\narrest  of  106  touts and 68 cinema  patrons  for\r\n\r\nreselling   tickets  and  purchasing  black-market\r\n\r\ntickets respectively. Despite the sustained raids,\r\n\r\nthe  black-market and touting unfortunately  still\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major problem for the authorities is the\r\n\r\nlarge  number of enforcement officers required  to\r\n\r\nprevent  touting in black-market tickets, whenever\r\n\r\npopular films are shown. The purpose of this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  therefore to make better use of such  officers\r\n\r\nas  we have to fight such cinema touts. Clauses  2\r\n\r\nand  3  of  the Bill seek to empower  any  customs\r\n\r\nofficers  or  police constable to  arrest  without\r\n\r\nwarrant any person whom he reasonably suspects  of\r\n\r\ncommitting or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattempting  to  commit  any  offence   under   the\r\n\r\nEntertainments Duty Act, including black-marketing\r\n\r\nin  cinema tickets. The customs officer or  police\r\n\r\nconstable  is  also empowered to seize  from  such\r\n\r\npersons any document or any other thing in respect\r\n\r\nof which an offence is reasonably believed to have\r\n\r\nbeen committed. Presently, these powers are vested\r\n\r\nonly  in  senior officers of the rank of Assistant\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Customs and above in the case of\r\n\r\nthe  Customs Department, and officers of the  rank\r\n\r\nof  Inspector and above in the case of the  Police\r\n\r\nForce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to dispense with the provision in\r\n\r\nthe   Act   which  requires  sanction   from   the\r\n\r\nComptroller of Entertainments Duty before a  Court\r\n\r\ncan take cognizance of any offence committed under\r\n\r\nthe  Act.  This  should speed up  the  process  of\r\n\r\nbringing the black-market touts before the  Court,\r\n\r\nand   demonstrate  clearly  that  punishment  will\r\n\r\nswiftly follow the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment contained in clause 5 seeks to\r\n\r\ncorrect  an  existing  anomaly.  The  penalty  for\r\n\r\noffences  committed under the Entertainments  Duty\r\n\r\nAct is prescribed in the Act, but the offences are\r\n\r\nset  out  in  the Entertainments Duty  Rules  made\r\n\r\nunder the principal Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four amendments proposed in this Bill will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  enforcement of the  law,  particularly\r\n\r\nagainst organised gangsters and racketeers touting\r\n\r\ncinema tickets. I should emphasise, however,  that\r\n\r\nlegislation   alone  cannot  wholly  control   and\r\n\r\neradicate    black-marketing.    Greater     civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness by the public is also required.  The\r\n\r\nblack-market  in  tickets cannot possibly  survive\r\n\r\nwithout  patronage  by  the  cinema-going  public.\r\n\r\nWhile  our  enforcement officers in taking  action\r\n\r\nagainst  black-marketeers will try to ensure  that\r\n\r\nlaw-abiding    cinema-goers   are    not    unduly\r\n\r\ninconvenienced, they will expect the public to co-operate  with  them  in  stamping  out  the   very pernicious practice of black-marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of experience gained from the\r\n\r\noperation  of the Insurance Act, which  came  into\r\n\r\nforce on 1st January, 1967, certain amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe Act seem necessary and desirable for: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) additional provisions to ensure that\r\n\r\ninsurance   companies   conduct   their   business\r\n\r\nstrictly   in  accordance  with  sound   insurance\r\n\r\nprinciples;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) powers to the Insurance Commissioner to deal\r\n\r\nexpeditiously with insurance companies that become\r\n\r\ninsolvent or are likely to become insolvent; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) more effective control and supervision of\r\n\r\ninsurers and Lloyd's agents and brokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objectives of the Bill are those\r\n\r\ncontained in clauses 6 and 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Commissioner to cancel the\r\n\r\nregistration   of   an   insurer   under   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances  which include the  failure  of  the\r\n\r\ninsurer   to   effect   satisfactory   reinsurance\r\n\r\narrangements,     non-compliance     with      the\r\n\r\nCommissioner's  order to make good any  deficiency\r\n\r\nin  its insurance fund, and failure to maintain  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  of assets over liabilities of $1  million\r\n\r\nin  respect of life business or general  business,\r\n\r\nor  $1 1/2 million in respect of both classes.
