J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir, I am ready to answer  the  request\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon\r\n\r\nTeck) in his motion yesterday. He intimated to  me\r\n\r\nafter  the adjournment that he would like a little\r\n\r\nmore  information  about the  tuberculosis  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  we intend to carry out in our Ministry.  It\r\n\r\nis  intended  that all known cases of tuberculosis\r\n\r\nbe  followed up so that we can be sure  that  they\r\n\r\nare  obtaining  adequate treatment either  as  in-patients  or as out-patients. As soon as  such  an\r\n\r\norganisation which I explained yesterday has  been\r\n\r\nestablished,  then it is worth while  intensifying\r\n\r\nin   Singapore   our   case  findings.   Effective\r\n\r\ntuberculosis control is likely to be an  expensive\r\n\r\nundertaking,  and  for  this  reason  it  is  most\r\n\r\nimportant  that  we should have a clearly  defined\r\n\r\nestimate of the extent of the problem which  faces\r\n\r\nus,  and this is where Australian assistance comes\r\n\r\nin.  We  have  asked for a team  of  experts  with\r\n\r\nequipment   for  mass  miniature  radiography   to\r\n\r\nundertake  a  short-term  survey  to  cover  about\r\n\r\n50,000  persons.  Subject to further  consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  Australian experts, it is  proposed  to\r\n\r\nselect three sample areas in Singapore - two in  the\r\n\r\ncity area and one in the rural area. Such a survey\r\n\r\nof  complete  groups to a total of 50,000  persons\r\n\r\nwill take at least six months and the results will\r\n\r\ngive  us a very much clearer knowledge of the real\r\n\r\nincidence  of tuberculosis in a densely  populated\r\n\r\nand   less  densely  populated  area.  When   this\r\n\r\nintensive  survey is over, the Australian  experts\r\n\r\nwill  withdraw,  leaving their equipment  for  our\r\n\r\nfuture use. Thereafter we shall continue with  the\r\n\r\ncase-finding  programme,  inevitably  at  a   much\r\n\r\nslower pace but as quickly as available staff  and\r\n\r\nfunds  will  permit.  There  is  no  intention  to\r\n\r\nnationalise  tuberculosis. We  shall  welcome  and\r\n\r\nneed all the help we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan   get   from   S.A.T.A. and   from   private\r\n\r\npractitioners,  and  there  is  no  intention   to\r\n\r\ndictate or interfere with treatment being given by\r\n\r\nnon-government  practitioners.  We  wish  only  to\r\n\r\nensure  that if a person has tuberculosis,  he  is\r\n\r\ngiven  treatment  and to ensure  also,  if  he  is\r\n\r\ninfective,   that   the  public   are   adequately\r\n\r\nsafeguarded from his spreading the infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that a study group on\r\n\r\ntuberculosis control sponsored by the World Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation met at the end of November 1955.  The\r\n\r\ntechnical  report of their findings has just  been\r\n\r\npublished.  In  that study group were  represented\r\n\r\nexperts  from  ten countries, and in their  report\r\n\r\nthey  stated,  inter alia, that \"The establishment\r\n\r\nin each country of a Central Tuberculosis Register\r\n\r\ncovering notified and re-notified cases will be of\r\n\r\ngreat  value for the study of the epidemiology  of\r\n\r\nthe   disease.\"   and  that  \"Complete   pulmonary\r\n\r\nexaminations  of  sample groups are  necessary  to\r\n\r\nobtain  a   reliable index for the  prevalence  of\r\n\r\ntuberculosis.\" It is also interesting to note that\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations  represent,  in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nprogramme   which  we  have  now   formulated   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think, Mr Chairman, I have  covered\r\n\r\nall  the  points which the Member for  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nwishes to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, I look at page 227, sub-head 1  (4) \r\n\r\nand I see there the post of Assistant Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical  Services.

The  job\r\n\r\nis still the same, that is, that the Chief Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer  of the General Hospital looks  after  all\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals  in Singapore.

The Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare is also concurrently the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, and as the salary of the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nis far higher than that of the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand Welfare, I am sure that he prefers to draw the\r\n\r\nsalary  of the Chief Minister rather than that  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer you, Sir, to page 161, the\r\n\r\n\"Remarks\" column against subhead 1 (1)  which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No provision entered for 1956 as the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  then was also Minister for Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  Member for Cairnhill  then  was  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  concurrently Minister for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this case, as the Budget shows a deficit,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think it is fair to put the figure  of\r\n\r\n$30,000,  shown against sub-head 1 (1) ,  Minister,\r\n\r\non  page  269,  in the Estimates because  it  will\r\n\r\nmisguide  us. However, rather than take away  that\r\n\r\nvote altogether, I would much prefer\r\n\r\nto  put  in  a  token vote of $10  in  its  place,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Assistant Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare may be promoted to the post of Minister if\r\n\r\nthere is a vacancy in due course. If that happens,\r\n\r\nwe  can,  without  any difficulty,  re-insert  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  $30,000 against the post of  Minister.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy(Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister has been good enough  to  take\r\n\r\nover the portfolio of the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare.  This  has  saved the  Colony  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney - a      Minister's     salary,     allowance,\r\n\r\nentertainment  expenses,  etc.  The  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, the Member for Cairnhill, also did  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing  in  the beginning when  he  held  the\r\n\r\nportfolio  of  Commerce and Industry.  His  was  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  task  when he began  to  work  the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution. I remember his words  at,  I  think,\r\n\r\nthe first Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsitting - that  there was not even an ink-pot  or  a\r\n\r\nsheet  of  note-paper, or even an office  for  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister. I also remember that he had to try\r\n\r\nand  wrest  power  from the  ex-officios.  I  also\r\n\r\nremember  that he had to put up a fight  with  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office. The first Chief Minister's  task\r\n\r\nwas difficult, with the result that he had to give\r\n\r\nup  later  on  the portfolio of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry. But now things  are  well\r\n\r\nunder  way,  and  we are grateful to  the  present\r\n\r\nChief  Minister for taking up both this  portfolio\r\n\r\nand  that  of the Minister for Labour and Welfare,\r\n\r\nthereby saving the revenue of the Colony. He might\r\n\r\nbe  able  to give us information why this post  of\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare is kept open.  The\r\n\r\nfact is that he has to go to London, and his is  a\r\n\r\nminority   Government.  I  wonder  whether   other\r\n\r\nparties  will co-operate with him when he goes  to\r\n\r\nLondon, or whether the Colonial Office will accept\r\n\r\nwhat  a  minority Government says. Sir, I  believe\r\n\r\nthere  is  something in the minds of  the  present\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government  or in  that  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  and I would like to hear why this  post\r\n\r\nof  Minister of Labour and Welfare is kept  open.\r\n\r\nIf  the  vote is reduced to a token $10,  he  will\r\n\r\nstill  have  the same chance, but  it  is  no  use\r\n\r\ncarrying  such  a big item in the Budget.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to have an explanation from the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir,  the  Member  for  Queenstown  has\r\n\r\nrightly  said that I am not drawing salaries  from\r\n\r\ntwo  Ministries.

In his case, Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to point out to the Assembly that, under  the\r\n\r\nthen  Rendel Constitution, the Chief Minister  had\r\n\r\nto hold a portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo   he  became  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  who is also the chief of all the  other\r\n\r\nMinisters. But as a result of his talks  with  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State last December, his  Government\r\n\r\nwas able to get a concession, that, in view of the\r\n\r\nheavy  responsibilities of the Chief Minister,  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  be loaded with another Ministry.  His\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Commerce and Industry was  therefore\r\n\r\nseparated  from  him  and  so  the  portfolio   of\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Commerce and Industry was  created.\r\n\r\nNow when I accepted the Chief Ministership, I said\r\n\r\nthat my spiritual home was in the Labour Ministry,\r\n\r\nand  it still is. I will not give that up. But one\r\n\r\nmust not forget that although I may not want to do\r\n\r\nit, I might be forced to do it, may be in February\r\n\r\nwhen I come back from London. Or I might be forced\r\n\r\nto  do it earlier, may be on account of reasons of\r\n\r\nhealth.  But I can say that, as long as  there  is\r\n\r\nlife  in  me, and as long as I am allowed to  hold\r\n\r\nit, I will hold it. But the amendment proposed  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown, Sir, means nothing. The\r\n\r\nvote is still there. What the hon. Member wants is\r\n\r\nto  see a reduction of a comparatively few dollars\r\n\r\nin the Estimates. It is just $29,990 - it is nothing\r\n\r\nin  an  Estimate  of  millions  upon  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars.  Sir, we cannot accept the  amendment  on\r\n\r\nthis  side  because  of  the  uncertainty  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse  should  be  satisfied with the  explanation\r\n\r\ngiven. The position, of course, appears to be very\r\n\r\nuncertain, as the Chief Minister has pointed  out,\r\n\r\nand  I  think we should remain contented  for  the\r\n\r\ntime being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do fully\r\n\r\nappreciate  what the Chief Minister  has  in  mind\r\n\r\nwhere  his appointment is concerned, that  someone\r\n\r\nshould  be  there,  whether  he  himself  or   the\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister if and when he is promoted. But\r\n\r\nthe  fact is that in my amendment I am not  trying\r\n\r\nto  take  away the vote altogether. Where a  token\r\n\r\nvote  is  concerned,  if it is  passed,  it  gives\r\n\r\nauthority  for  the money to be spent.  But  if  a\r\n\r\ntoken   vote   is  taken  away  altogether,   then\r\n\r\nauthority has to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   sought  for.  And  when  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nappoints a new Minister for Labour and Welfare  or\r\n\r\nappoints a new Minister, he may have got to go  to\r\n\r\nthe Governor in Council or Council of Ministers to\r\n\r\nseek  approval for that appointment. I feel,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  where  an  estimate is  concerned,  I  would\r\n\r\nprefer  a  token  vote rather than an  imaginative\r\n\r\nfigure.  When  such  time as the  appointment  has\r\n\r\nactually been filled, we could then easily release\r\n\r\nthat  token  vote  where  the  actual  amount   is\r\n\r\nconcerned. But since the Member for Telok Ayer has\r\n\r\nsaid  that he is prepared to overlook it,  and  in\r\n\r\norder to save time, may I have your permission and\r\n\r\nthat of hon.

As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, it is more of a puzzle,  because\r\n\r\nthe  man in the street is not fully aware  of  the\r\n\r\nactual functions of this Department or what is the\r\n\r\nsystem of application for entry into this country.\r\n\r\nSir, I have known of cases where applications  for\r\n\r\nentry  for  wives or aged parents met  with  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty  as  compared to the  ease  with  which\r\n\r\nstrip-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteasers and singers can enter this colony. It  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  a  fact that these  stripteasers  and\r\n\r\nsingers  come  here for a very short period,  say,\r\n\r\nsix months or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another surprise is that the application for\r\n\r\nextension of the visas of these entertainers meets\r\n\r\nwith  no  difficulty. I have known of cases  where\r\n\r\nsingers  in  night-clubs have been here  for  more\r\n\r\nthan   three  years.  I  wonder  how  they  manage\r\n\r\nthis - may be they are females! I think that is  why\r\n\r\nthe  immigration authorities take such  a  lenient\r\n\r\nview!  But I have known of cases where technicians\r\n\r\nhave  found much difficulty in applying for  entry\r\n\r\nvisas for even a short stay here. I have known  of\r\n\r\na   permanent   wave   expert - a   man,   in   this\r\n\r\ninstance! - who was quite prepared to come  down  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  give the benefit of his  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  experience to our local people. He has tried,\r\n\r\nbut  without success, to get an entry visa. If the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare desires it, I  can\r\n\r\none day bring this case to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Chinese custom is that we prefer to have\r\n\r\nour  wives  and aged parents stay  with  us  as  a\r\n\r\nfamily unit rather than that they live apart  from\r\n\r\nus.  Where  immigration is concerned, there  is  a\r\n\r\nproviso   that  a  marriage  photograph  must   be\r\n\r\nproduced.  Sir,  in  olden  times,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nquestion of a marriage photograph because the  man\r\n\r\nand  his wife were too shy of each other and  more\r\n\r\nso  of  exposing themselves to the public. I think\r\n\r\nthis  proviso  should be relaxed  in  such  cases.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also cases of aged parents wishing  to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore to join their sons or daughters,\r\n\r\nbut  the reply from the Immigration Department  is\r\n\r\nalways  the same - they are not within the  category\r\n\r\nto be considered. I wonder what are the categories\r\n\r\nto   be  considered,  Sir,  because  it  is   very\r\n\r\ndifficult to say the actual categories. Now a  son\r\n\r\nmay  have a well-established business here and  is\r\n\r\nable  to  maintain his parents, but they  are  not\r\n\r\nstaying with him, and it will naturally be a cause\r\n\r\nof much sorrow to them all if they are kept apart,\r\n\r\ninstead of living together as a happy family. This\r\n\r\nson,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  who  is a business man, is also prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  guarantee  to  the  Government  that  his\r\n\r\nparents, if they are allowed to enter the  colony,\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  a burden to the State.  There  are\r\n\r\ncases, Sir, where the applicants have estates  and\r\n\r\ncertainly in their position they are in a position\r\n\r\nto   maintain  their  parents.  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be prepared to let the public know\r\n\r\nwhat   are  the  categories  which  they  consider\r\n\r\nimmigrants  should  come  into  before  they   are\r\n\r\nallowed  to enter here, because as far as I  know,\r\n\r\nit  is only the wives who are considered and  they\r\n\r\nare only subject to the production of documents of\r\n\r\nfamily photographs. But what about aged parents? I\r\n\r\nmay  get a reply from the Minister that above  the\r\n\r\nage of 60 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S.

Even\r\n\r\nthousands  are coming in! It really surprises  me,\r\n\r\nSir, that in some cases they are considered and in\r\n\r\nother  cases they are not. What is the  difference\r\n\r\nthen?  I can tell you, Sir, that although the  age\r\n\r\nof  entry  for  children is 12, I  have  known  of\r\n\r\nchildren  15  or  16 years old  coming  into  this\r\n\r\ncolony.  How did they manage it? I wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare, who is in  charge\r\n\r\nof  the Immigration Department, can explain  this.\r\n\r\nAt one time I went into a shop and I was surprised\r\n\r\nto  see a boy of this height [Indicating.] who told\r\n\r\nme  that  he  came  from China  only  a  few  days\r\n\r\npreviously and I asked him how old he was and  how\r\n\r\nhe came into the colony. To my surprise he replied\r\n\r\nthat  his  age, by Chinese reckoning, was  16.  To\r\n\r\naccount for the difference between 16 and 12 years\r\n\r\nof age is beyond me. Is it not surprising then how\r\n\r\na boy of 16 was allowed to come in? As I have said\r\n\r\nearlier,  it is a puzzle - in some cases,  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed  in  and in other cases they  are  not.  I\r\n\r\nthink  there should be a change of system  in  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department.  I  wonder  whether   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare could institute an\r\n\r\ninvestigation into the functions of that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment   so  that  there  will  be   no   more\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also point out in the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nthat  it is not hundreds or even thousands of aged\r\n\r\nparents  who  have come in. Millions of  wives,  I\r\n\r\nshould  say,  have  come in through  some  way  or\r\n\r\nother! So I do hope that the Minister could set up\r\n\r\na  committee  to investigate into the workings  of\r\n\r\nthat Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Chairman, Sir, as the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Welfare but not drawing the salary  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Welfare,  may  I  now\r\n\r\nattempt to justify or give an answer to the attack\r\n\r\non  the  Immigration Department?  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   seems  to  be  concerned   with   the\r\n\r\nimmigration policy. He asks for information, which\r\n\r\nhe   could   easily   get  from  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  of  the categories of people  who  are\r\n\r\npermitted  entry into the colony.  Sir,  before  I\r\n\r\nbecame Minister for Labour and Welfare, I had been\r\n\r\ntoiling and toiling for the people of Singapore in\r\n\r\nso   far   as  their  immigration  problems   were\r\n\r\nconcerned. This was ever since 1948, and so  if  I\r\n\r\nclaim to know a lot about that Department, I  hope\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will understand that it is  a  claim\r\n\r\nbased on personal knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member says that marriage photographs\r\n\r\nare  insisted before entry is permitted.  I  think\r\n\r\nhis   information   is   incorrect.   A   marriage\r\n\r\nphotograph  is not insisted upon. It was  insisted\r\n\r\nupon  in  1948,  1949, 1950, 1951 I  think,  1952\r\n\r\nmaybe, so much so that if a marriage photograph is\r\n\r\nasked for and if the sponsor of the immigrant  has\r\n\r\nit,  it  will help to substantiate his application\r\n\r\nfor entry; but if there is no marriage photograph,\r\n\r\nit  does  not  mean  that his case  is  that  much\r\n\r\nweaker.  I  would say that it was because  of  the\r\n\r\ninsistence    of    marriage   photographs    that\r\n\r\nphotographers in Singapore made a lot of money  by\r\n\r\nimposing one photograph upon another, so  much  so\r\n\r\nthat when the sponsor (meaning the husband or  the\r\n\r\nwife;  the  applicant is the  person  who  desires\r\n\r\nentry)   was  asked,  \"Why  did  you  forge   this\r\n\r\nphotograph?\", he replied, \"I do not know. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas told that I must produce a marriage photograph\r\n\r\nand  so  I produce a marriage photograph!\" It  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of that that the production of a marriage\r\n\r\nphotograph  is  no longer insisted  upon.  If  the\r\n\r\nsponsor  can produce one, it will help  his  case;\r\n\r\nbut if he cannot, well, that is that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Without\r\n\r\nlabour,  industry would not be able  to  progress.\r\n\r\nGovernment, I believe, is trying to see that there\r\n\r\nis  less  unemployment. It is trying its  best  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there  is  no unemployment  in  this\r\n\r\ncolony, and that is why a labour exchange has been\r\n\r\ncreated.  But, Sir, in my opinion, the  system  of\r\n\r\noperation  in  that  labour  exchange  is   rather\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  I  have known  cases  where  long\r\n\r\nqueues  have  stood  alongside the  Havelock  Road\r\n\r\nbuilding waiting either to be registered  or  sent\r\n\r\nto  employers or firms which require  labour.  The\r\n\r\ncoordination between the employers and the  labour\r\n\r\nexchange  is not very satisfactory. There  may  be\r\n\r\ncases  of a firm which requires a large number  of\r\n\r\ncarpenters  but the labour exchange is  unable  to\r\n\r\nsupply them; whereas, in fact, there are thousands\r\n\r\nof  unemployed carpenters who are not prepared  to\r\n\r\nregister or have not registered themselves at  the\r\n\r\nlabour exchange. So this is the reason why  I  say\r\n\r\nthe  system is not satisfactory. It is either  the\r\n\r\nemployers  or  the unemployed who are  not  making\r\n\r\nmuch use of the labour exchange. I presume they do\r\n\r\nnot  know the benefits to be derived from the  use\r\n\r\nof  that  exchange. Or it may be  that  the  staff\r\n\r\nthere is inadequate so that they are unable to set\r\n\r\nup   a  new  system  whereby  the  employers,  the\r\n\r\nunemployed    and   the   exchange   could    have\r\n\r\nco-ordination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer to this problem, if I may say so again,\r\n\r\nis to appoint a committee to go into the functions\r\n\r\nof  the  labour  exchange with a  view  to  making\r\n\r\nrecommendations for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is again the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  who speaks and the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  who labours for no reward! Sir, he brought\r\n\r\nup   the  question  of  the  work  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nexchange.  I  agree that the work  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nexchange  is not as satisfactory as I should  have\r\n\r\nliked  to  see, but I am sure he himself  realises\r\n\r\nthe  limitations  under which the labour  exchange\r\n\r\nhas to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, there is no compulsion on\r\n\r\nemployers  to seek to fill vacancies  through  the\r\n\r\nlabour exchange. In the second place, there are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of private employment agencies, about  whom\r\n\r\nI  have  already  asked for more information,  who\r\n\r\nappear  to be able to do better business  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular line. It has been reported to me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  more and more people would like to make  use\r\n\r\nof  these  agencies  because,  through  their  own\r\n\r\norganisations within the offices, they are able to\r\n\r\nknow  in advance of any vacancy that may arise  in\r\n\r\nany  particular office. In some cases, it has been\r\n\r\nreported to the Labour Department that there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a good number of illegal practices going  on\r\n\r\nin these so-called private employment agencies and\r\n\r\nI  have  therefore, as I have said earlier,  asked\r\n\r\nfor further information about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown asked for a committee\r\n\r\nto  be  set up to look into and improve  upon  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the  labour exchange. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ninform  him,  Sir, that there is already  a  small\r\n\r\ncommittee on the job and I hope they will be  able\r\n\r\nto  make  recommendations to me which will improve\r\n\r\nthe working of the labour exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the long queues of people waiting at\r\n\r\nthe  labour exchange for registration, perhaps the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown has confused them with  the\r\n\r\nlong  queues  waiting  for relief  at  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department. The labour exchange  and  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department are on the same  floor,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  the  queues could  have  been  enlarged\r\n\r\nbecause there is only one entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister is calling for a report on  the\r\n\r\nworking  of  these private employment agencies.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Government  should  take  very  strong\r\n\r\naction  against  them.  To  my  knowledge,   these\r\n\r\nagencies  are,  in  fact, exploiting  the  workers\r\n\r\nrather than assisting them. A registration fee  is\r\n\r\nlevied  whether you get employment or not; and  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as employment is found for persons who  have\r\n\r\nregistered with them, a certain percentage of  the\r\n\r\nfirst month's salary has to be paid to them.  This\r\n\r\nis   nothing   but  corruption  and  exploitation.\r\n\r\nUnemployed persons are trying to find work and  in\r\n\r\nthe process a certain fee has first to be paid.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  that  is fair.  These  unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople want work to keep themselves alive and  yet\r\n\r\na  certain amount of money is extracted from them.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Minister will ask Government  to  be\r\n\r\nquick  about the action to be taken against  these\r\n\r\nagencies  and  see that they are  not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,024,280 for Head 52 order to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 53-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in\r\n\r\nrespect of sub-head 1 (46) , Community Centre\r\n\r\nOrganisers, on page 281 of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I must draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House to the fact that Community\r\n\r\nCentre  Organisers  are new  innovations  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget. They have been here for only a few  years.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest to the House, Sir, that this type of\r\n\r\nemployment is not necessary? It gives me  a  queer\r\n\r\nfeeling  to  have  that  title  \"Community  Centre\r\n\r\nOrganisers\" put into the Budget. It gives  me  the\r\n\r\nidea  that  people in Singapore must be organised.\r\n\r\nIt   gives  me  the  feeling  that  people  cannot\r\n\r\norganise  themselves before; but, Sir, nothing  is\r\n\r\nfurther  from  the  truth. In  fact,  people  have\r\n\r\nalways  organised  themselves  and  will  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves  when they want to. But they  will  not\r\n\r\nwant to organise themselves if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  forced into it. Sir, we  find  that  in\r\n\r\nevery  locality  in Singapore little  associations\r\n\r\nhave  come  up. We have little guilds  coming  up.\r\n\r\nPeople   have   formed  themselves   into   sports\r\n\r\nassociations,   benevolent   associations,    clan\r\n\r\nassociations and associations to promote a certain\r\n\r\ntype  of welfare activity or social activity;  and\r\n\r\nin   all  such  cases  they  have  never  had  any\r\n\r\nprompting  from  anybody.  In  fact,  it  is   the\r\n\r\ninterest in these people which causes them to band\r\n\r\nthemselves into whatever organisations they  want.\r\n\r\nNow  it  may  be said by the Department  concerned\r\n\r\nthat this can only apply to many decades ago, say,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  second world war, when everybody  was\r\n\r\nstaying in a fixed place for a very long time; but\r\n\r\nafter  the war, we have the growth of new  estates\r\n\r\nand  the  coming of this event has brought  people\r\n\r\nfrom  all  parts  of Singapore to  stay  together.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there will be problems which  are\r\n\r\ncommon  to them and which they want to solve,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the shortness of time, they  are  not\r\n\r\nable to come together; so we must have somebody to\r\n\r\nlook  after such things for them. But, Sir, I  say\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  true. In this case of new  estates,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  people  have  common  problems,   they\r\n\r\nusually organise themselves into community centres\r\n\r\nto  fight  their own battle. They need  no  urging\r\n\r\nfrom the Department concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now look at the work of these\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre organisers during the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears.  I  happen to be pretty familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nwork  which  they are doing and in  most  cases  I\r\n\r\nthink   they   have  nothing  much  to   recommend\r\n\r\nthemselves  for the maintenance of their  jobs.  A\r\n\r\ncommunity centre is built in a place which is  not\r\n\r\nconspicuous  enough to attract  attention  and  in\r\n\r\nsuch   a  way  that  people  will  find  it  quite\r\n\r\ninconvenient  to make use of it. In  such  centres\r\n\r\nthere will be a few types of activities - boys' club\r\n\r\nactivities, girls' club activities - and there  will\r\n\r\nbe a little library in the corner and occasionally\r\n\r\nthe  members  will meet there for a lecture  or  a\r\n\r\nshort talk. But invariably, Sir, these centres are\r\n\r\nempty - empty  for the most part of the  month,  for\r\n\r\nthe  most part of the week, and for the most  part\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday. You can say, \"Yes, we have a centre and it is\r\n\r\ncatering  for the needs of the young children.  We\r\n\r\nrun  classes.\" Yes, these centres run classes, but\r\n\r\nclasses  for  about 20 or 30 or 40 people  and  no\r\n\r\nmore;  and if you can call them community centres,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are being made use of by only  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall number of people, then I wonder if there  is\r\n\r\nnot  something wrong with the title. However, even\r\n\r\nif  we  confine  ourselves to the subject  of  the\r\n\r\ncentre  being  made use of by these young  people,\r\n\r\nlet  us  see how the work is being done. Sometimes\r\n\r\nan association will come in and ask for the use of\r\n\r\nthe  place,  and in one case that I know  of,  the\r\n\r\norganiser  said,  \"You  will  have  to  write   in\r\n\r\nofficially.\"  I  quite agree, Sir, that  community\r\n\r\ncentres  deal with all sorts of people,  and  such\r\n\r\npeople will also include those who are illiterate,\r\n\r\nand   to   ask  illiterate  people  to  write   in\r\n\r\nofficially  is, I think, the height of  folly.  Or\r\n\r\nyou  may have an organisation asking, \"You are not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  use this place for a few days.  Let  us\r\n\r\nhave  it for the purposes of weight-lifting.\" This\r\n\r\norganisation  is  prepared to guarantee  that  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  will not be spoiled, the floor will  not\r\n\r\nbe  chipped,  and  should  there  be  damage,  the\r\n\r\nassociation  is  prepared to compensate  for  such\r\n\r\ndamage.  But  even  then the  association  is  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  make use of that centre. A  community\r\n\r\ncentre,  according  to  that  type  of  organiser,\r\n\r\nshould  be  kept as a white elephant, white-washed\r\n\r\nand cleanly swept, nobody making use of it because\r\n\r\nit will then not be dirty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out another fact. Invariably we find\r\n\r\nthat  organisers  are sent into a community  about\r\n\r\nwhich  they  know nothing. I put it to  you,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  if  you  are sent in to organise  a  certain\r\n\r\ncommunity - in   fact,  they  do   not   need   your\r\n\r\nassistance  at  all - then the very least  that  you\r\n\r\nmust  know is that you should know the people  and\r\n\r\nthe  conditions there. If you do not, then you can\r\n\r\ndo no work at all. In fact, the work that has been\r\n\r\ndone has nothing to recommend itself. I have known\r\n\r\nof  one  centre  where, instead of the  organisers\r\n\r\nmaking  everybody happy to go into  it  and  drink\r\n\r\ncoffee,  talk  together, read the papers,  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  day's  work, these people have  divided  them\r\n\r\ninto factions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  organisers  in this case did  not  bring  the\r\n\r\npeople  together, but had split them into  various\r\n\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I must say one very interesting thing.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in community centres there must be\r\n\r\nno politics, absolutely no politics. We agree with\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes. In fact, there was a\r\n\r\ncase  where  a group of people were interested  in\r\n\r\nforming  a  community centre, but  the  Department\r\n\r\nconcerned  said, \"No, you cannot form a  community\r\n\r\ncentre.  We  do not agree with you because  it  is\r\n\r\npolitical.\" Then the organisers had to  produce  a\r\n\r\nlist  in which they said, \"We have so many  people\r\n\r\ncoming  into this project; there are so many  from\r\n\r\none  Party,  and so many from another.\"  In  fact,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the Parties were represented,  including\r\n\r\nquite  a  number of people who had no  Parties  at\r\n\r\nall.  That  was actually the case. They came  from\r\n\r\nall sorts of Parties. I should even say, they have\r\n\r\npeople  coming from the Labour Front! Let  us  say\r\n\r\nnow that we agree that there should be no politics\r\n\r\nin  community centres. We agree with that,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould ask the Government to read an article  by  a\r\n\r\njournalist  writing under the name of  Aster  Gunasekera  who  gave  prominence to  an  event  which\r\n\r\nhappened  in one of the community centres.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  my  opinion,  but it is  the  opinion  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent  observer. He says, \"If  that  is  not\r\n\r\npolitics, what is it?\". Here, Sir, is a case where\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government  can do,  the  other  people\r\n\r\ncannot do. I think that is absolutely wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also other instances where people\r\n\r\nwant to form community centres but instead of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment sending along organisers to  help  them\r\n\r\nin a positive way, they have done so in a negative\r\n\r\nway.  Take  the case of the Tiong Bahru  community\r\n\r\ncentre.  Some  people wanted to form  a  community\r\n\r\ncentre  there. They had interests there  and  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to come out and do work for the community,\r\n\r\nbut  I  doubt whether there was any positive  help\r\n\r\ngiven to them. Take another case, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSerangoon Garden Estate.

That\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  organisation received  no  help\r\n\r\nwhatsoever from the Department concerned. I should\r\n\r\nlike the House to know exactly how this Department\r\n\r\nis carrying out its work. Instead of helping those\r\n\r\npeople who are interested in community work, which\r\n\r\nshould,  in  fact,  be the most  logical  way,  an\r\n\r\norganiser  is  posted to a place.  This  organiser\r\n\r\nthen  uses  his  discretion  and  goes  round  and\r\n\r\ninvites  people  whom he thinks  fit  to  form  an\r\n\r\nadvisory  committee. This advisory committee  will\r\n\r\nthen advise the Department as to what is good  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is  bad.  There is, however,  one  point  to\r\n\r\nremember about this, Sir. In a place where  people\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  advisory committees, then  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittees must be done away with. In a place\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  the  people wish to call a meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole district to elect democratically those  whom\r\n\r\nthey  wish to run their community centre, I  think\r\n\r\nthe Government should give way to the popular wish\r\n\r\nof the people. I am certain, Sir, that in a matter\r\n\r\nlike  this, where there is still a denial  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to accept the principle that the people\r\n\r\nmust  be trained at the lowest level so that  they\r\n\r\nmay  know  what is the meaning of an election  and\r\n\r\nhow  to select the best men to represent them,  it\r\n\r\nis  something  that  I  think  should  never  have\r\n\r\noccurred. I say to this Assembly, Sir, that should\r\n\r\nany hon.

It  is\r\n\r\nthe  policy,  I  understand, of community  centres\r\n\r\nthat  no  public meeting of a political  character\r\n\r\ncan  be  held in them, and that, I understand,  is\r\n\r\nalso true of schools. Sir, the concept of polities\r\n\r\nhas  been  something unclean.  It  is  a  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice concept in respect of colonial territories.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not a healthy concept in a territory which\r\n\r\nseeks  democratic development, and  I  would  urge\r\n\r\nupon  Government  to reconsider  the  question  of\r\n\r\npermitting political meetings in community centres\r\n\r\nand  in  schools with a fair apportionment to  the\r\n\r\nvarious political Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair): Sir, I hold no brief\r\n\r\nfor  the Department of Social Welfare, but I  must\r\n\r\ncorrect  some  of the misapprehensions  which  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Serangoon  has  expressed   to   the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  As  a  Member of the Assembly  who  has\r\n\r\ntaken  pains  to  organise one of these  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  I  must refute every word  of  what  the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, community development went the wrong way as\r\n\r\nearly as 1950.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese   centres  were  then  used  for   political\r\n\r\npurposes and there were difficulties arising as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this. But a year or two back, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment realised the position and, as a result,\r\n\r\nthey  have tried to obtain trained and experienced\r\n\r\nstaff  as  community centre organisers.  They  are\r\n\r\ndoing a very good job, Sir, as far as my place  is\r\n\r\nconcerned. I have every praise for their  work.  I\r\n\r\nthink  community development has been considerably\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  by the Member for  Serangoon,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand  I  hope that the Department of Social Welfare\r\n\r\nwill publish some material for the information  of\r\n\r\nall  concerned which will be of immense  help  not\r\n\r\nonly  to Members of the Assembly but also  to  the\r\n\r\npopulation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, with due\r\n\r\nrespect  to  the Member for Serangoon - I understand\r\n\r\nhe  is  a youth leader - I am afraid I cannot  agree\r\n\r\nwith him that community centre organisers are  not\r\n\r\nnecessary. I believe that he was referring to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-sponsored community  centres -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - rather than the community\r\n\r\ncentres that have been set up in S.I.T. estates by\r\n\r\nthe residents themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Confined to Government only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> These centres are set up, as a\r\n\r\nmatter  of fact, for the co-ordination of residents\r\n\r\nwithin  the estate and to assist them in  case  of\r\n\r\nneed;  but the officials of such community centres\r\n\r\nare  treating  these centres more as  associations\r\n\r\nthan  as community centres. That is why I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  when  the  Member for Serangoon  says  that\r\n\r\ncommunity centre organisers are not required.  The\r\n\r\ncommunity centres should have wardens to guide the\r\n\r\nofficials,  and,  as  such,  it  should   be   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government to  provide  such\r\n\r\nwardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that Government has established\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Social  Welfare Department  a  little\r\n\r\nsection  called the Community Development  Section\r\n\r\nunder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Assistant Director for Community Centres, but\r\n\r\nwhat I would like to say is this: that the liaison\r\n\r\nbetween this section and the community centres  is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  This section  within  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department waits for the community centres\r\n\r\nto  come  to  it for advice rather  than  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  go  to  the centres and give them  advice.\r\n\r\nThese  centres  are, in fact,  in  great  need  of\r\n\r\nfinancial help. The only concession that  they  do\r\n\r\nget is not from the Government but from the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nwho gives a special rate of $20 rental for a shop-house at the premises of the centre. The rental of\r\n\r\nthat shop-house may be $160 to $200. I think it is\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of the Government to go round to  these\r\n\r\ncentres - the privately established ones and not the\r\n\r\nGovernment-sponsored  ones - to  find  out  what  is\r\n\r\nrequired.  Most  of  them,  I  may  say,  live  on\r\n\r\ncinemas. In each of the different estates you will\r\n\r\nfind  an  open-air  cinema  set  up  charging   an\r\n\r\nentrance  fee of ten cents. Without such  cinemas,\r\n\r\nthe  community  centres would have to  close  down\r\n\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\n(Mr  M.  P.  D. Nair) has said that in  1950  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of community development was  raised.  I\r\n\r\nremember  that sometime in that year or  the  year\r\n\r\nafter   that  a  committee  called  the  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Committee was set up and  on  it  were\r\n\r\nrepresented members of public bodies like the City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  Legislative Council and  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard. That committee must have wound up because I\r\n\r\nhave  never heard of it again. I would urge,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  Government  revive this committee,  but  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation on this committee should not be  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  Government or local organisations.\r\n\r\nPrivately established community centres should  be\r\n\r\nasked  to come on to this committee so that  there\r\n\r\ncould   be  an  exchange  of  views  on  community\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   They   could   easily    ask    two\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from each community centre to  sit\r\n\r\non  this committee. There has been no trouble with\r\n\r\nGovernment-sponsored  community  centres,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon has alleged. In Yio Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nthere  is a beautiful and well-established  centre\r\n\r\nwhich will be opened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntomorrow  by  the Labour Minister. It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-sponsored centres that we  should  look\r\n\r\nafter;  it  is  the privately-established  centres\r\n\r\nthat  we  should look after. I hope the Government\r\n\r\nwill  bear  my  suggestion in mind to  revive  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Committee so that  a  chance\r\n\r\ncould be given to private community centres to air\r\n\r\ntheir views and their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I see that the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown is very committee-minded! For the three\r\n\r\ndepartments in my Ministry - Immigration, Labour and\r\n\r\nWelfare - he has been suggesting one committee after\r\n\r\nanother!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon started his speech by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  he  objected to the  appointment  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre organisers. He said  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  sinister meaning given to organisers  when\r\n\r\nthey are officers of the Government; but later  on\r\n\r\nin  his speech he told us that his dissatisfaction\r\n\r\narose  out  of  the  alleged inefficiency  of  the\r\n\r\norganisers  themselves  rather  than  because  the\r\n\r\ncentre organisers were there. Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  that  community  centre organisers  are  very\r\n\r\nnecessary to help and advise in the management  of\r\n\r\ncentres.  They  are trained people and  experience\r\n\r\nhas  shown  that without a competent  professional\r\n\r\nstaff  the premises tend to be put to insufficient\r\n\r\nuse and government money is therefore wasted. Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  Government's policy to  provide  community\r\n\r\ncentres and children's social centres within them,\r\n\r\nand  to  appoint advisory committees to run  them,\r\n\r\nand  to  appoint members of the general public  to\r\n\r\nserve  on  these committees, with  the  object  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  at  the earliest possible  moment  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  association formed by persons  who  use\r\n\r\nthese centres. In this way, Sir, the management of\r\n\r\nall  appropriate functions of the  centre  can  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  a  committee  and  this  could  be\r\n\r\nseparated from the Social Welfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon and the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  have  touched on the use  of  community\r\n\r\ncentres for political meetings. Political meetings\r\n\r\nin  community centres and in schools  are  allowed\r\n\r\nduring  election  time, and in  community  centres\r\n\r\nthey will be allowed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  more than one Party is represented. It could\r\n\r\nnot  be  given to any political Party at  any  one\r\n\r\ntime,  but  if there is a joint political  meeting\r\n\r\norganised  by more than one Party on a  matter  of\r\n\r\ngeneral interest to the community, permission will\r\n\r\nbe granted to hold such a meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $11,020,270 for Head 53 stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  on a matter of very considerable importance\r\n\r\nto  a  considerable number of people, and that  is\r\n\r\nthe  Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance; but before  I\r\n\r\ndo  so, Sir, I would ask whether the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare has any information  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  add  to  our  knowledge  of   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, I am sure the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill will be pleased to know  that\r\n\r\nit  is  proposed that Part I of the Legal Aid  and\r\n\r\nAdvice  Ordinance will come into operation without\r\n\r\nany  further delay. The Director of Legal Aid  can\r\n\r\nthen  be  appointed and an office set up.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\npropose  to hold further discussions with the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee  as  soon as possible.  The  discussions\r\n\r\nwhich I have already had with them indicated to me\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  can  be  assured  of  their\r\n\r\nco-operation,  and in the operation  of  this  law,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  most  necessary  that  we  have  the\r\n\r\nco-operation of the Bar Committee in order to  give\r\n\r\nthe utmost benefit to those desiring legal aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, indeed I think all sides of the House welcome\r\n\r\nthe  announcement of the Minister of the immediate\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  Part I of the  Legal  Aid  and\r\n\r\nAdvice Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points which I would like to make,\r\n\r\nSir.  First,  I  see no provision  to  cover  this\r\n\r\nimplementation in the Budget, Sir. Do  I  take  it\r\n\r\nthat  the  House  will be asked for  supplementary\r\n\r\nprovision at a very early date? Secondly, Sir,  on\r\n\r\nthe question of the necessity of co-operation from\r\n\r\nthe Bar. I think the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  is fully aware that this was  completely\r\n\r\nthrashed out among themselves at the time prior to\r\n\r\nthe introduction of the Bill and that though it is\r\n\r\nrecognised that the co-operation of the  Bar  would\r\n\r\nbe  most helpful, the Bill is so framed that it is\r\n\r\nnot essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, an\r\n\r\napplication  for supplementary provision  will  be\r\n\r\ntabled early next month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think I\r\n\r\nshould   now  give  credit  and  thanks   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  having  a section  called  \"Public\r\n\r\nAssistance\". Without this section, I am afraid the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  beggars on the streets will  increase;\r\n\r\nbut  what  I would like to say is this, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  money given by  this  section  is\r\n\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> More tax!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> More tax. On the other hand, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  this  section should be  decentralised\r\n\r\nrather than that it should all be concentrated  in\r\n\r\nthe  Havelock  Road  building.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare said earlier that I might  have\r\n\r\nmistaken  the  people who go to that building  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance for people who want to register\r\n\r\nthemselves for employment. Sir, that is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  I  am now referring to the men and women  who\r\n\r\nsit  on the doorsteps of that building waiting for\r\n\r\ntheir  turn  to receive public assistance.  People\r\n\r\ncoming  from  Queenstown,  Alexandra,  Changi  and\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang to town have to cover about five  to\r\n\r\neight  miles, and to do that and receive only  $15\r\n\r\nto  $25  as assistance from the Department  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink, a waste of time and transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If he wished for a  debate  on\r\n\r\nthat particular section, he ought to have moved  a\r\n\r\nconventional reduction of the vote.  All  that  he\r\n\r\ncan do now is just to ventilate what he wishes  to\r\n\r\nventilate, but he should not enter into a debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\ntrying  to  originate a debate, and neither  am  I\r\n\r\ndebating   any   particular   item   under    that\r\n\r\nDepartment. I am only referring to the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe Government in regard to public assistance.

Because  there  are\r\n\r\n\"Distinguished Visitors\" and there are  V.  I.  P.'s,  there  will be discrimination against  V.  I.\r\n\r\nP.'s if this vote is passed.

I would  invite  the\r\n\r\nauthorities to go and see this house and  have  an\r\n\r\nestimate made later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Very briefly, Mr Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nthese  are  standard Division I quarters providing\r\n\r\nfor   two  bedrooms,  a  lounge,  a  dining  room,\r\n\r\nservants  quarters, W.C, sanitation and a  garage,\r\n\r\nand are of very simple construction using 4\ufffd inch\r\n\r\nwalls  of hollow concrete blocks, and if you built\r\n\r\nthe  house by itself, it would cost about $28,000.\r\n\r\nBut the cost, in fact, includes $10,000 to $12,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextra   for  water  and  electricity  supply   and\r\n\r\nsewerage  disposal.

You will realise,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nJurong is a remote area where one has not got  all\r\n\r\nthe  services and you have to put on the ancillary\r\n\r\ncosts  which are a very large element in the total\r\n\r\ncost  of the house. A similar house completed only\r\n\r\nsix  months  ago  worked out to a  little  over  a\r\n\r\ndollar  a  foot cube and a similar house at  Mount\r\n\r\nPleasant was built at a cost of $38,000, that  is,\r\n\r\na  saving of $7,000.

We have already spent many millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars to create that force. It will indeed be  a\r\n\r\ntragic  waste of public money to disband  it  now.\r\n\r\nWhen  we achieve independence and self-government,\r\n\r\nsurely a country like ours, surrounded by the sea,\r\n\r\nmust  have a navy of our own, no matter how small?\r\n\r\nRather than have two infantry battalions and scrap\r\n\r\nthe  Royal Malayan Navy, I would have one infantry\r\n\r\nbattalion and the Royal Malayan Navy, because  the\r\n\r\nNavy,  besides patrolling the seas around us,  can\r\n\r\nalways come to the assistance of the Government in\r\n\r\ncase  of  any threat to internal security.  I  do,\r\n\r\nhowever,  agree  with the view of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill   regarding   what   he   contemptuously\r\n\r\ndescribed  as a \"toy Navy\" for which we are  asked\r\n\r\nto  provide  $15  million, but for very  different\r\n\r\nreasons. Sir, I think $15 million is a very,  very\r\n\r\nlarge  sum  to spend at this time on a  method  of\r\n\r\nwarfare  which,  to my mind, will  never  be  used\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the development of atomic energy,\r\n\r\nwarfare  is  moving into another stage altogether.\r\n\r\nWith  guided missiles, atomic war-heads and, in  a\r\n\r\nfew years' time, aeroplanes and warships propelled\r\n\r\nby  nuclear  energy,  we must think  of  different\r\n\r\ntypes of warfare. To my mind, minesweeping will be\r\n\r\nout  of the picture, for in any big conflict,  the\r\n\r\nnation that controls the air will control the  sea\r\n\r\nand hardly any ship will be able to move. Besides,\r\n\r\nI  can  think  of  other ways  of  removing  mines\r\n\r\ninstead\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  using these cumbersome minesweepers which were\r\n\r\ndeveloped  before the last war. Sir, we  now  have\r\n\r\nhelicopters which are being used by the  Army  for\r\n\r\ndetecting land mines. There is no reason  why  two\r\n\r\nhelicopters  cannot, between  them,  pull  a  mine\r\n\r\ndetector  over  the sea for the purposes  of  mine\r\n\r\ndetection.  Then again these helicopters  can  use\r\n\r\nthose  devices which at present are being used  by\r\n\r\nships  for  spotting  shoals  of  fish,  and   the\r\n\r\ndiscovery  of any mine by the helicopters  can  be\r\n\r\nleft  to  \"frogmen\" to dispose  of.  What  I  have\r\n\r\nsuggested may seem to be a bit silly, but many  of\r\n\r\nthese suggestions have been adopted in warfare and\r\n\r\nhave proved to be completely effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if my surmises are incorrect, the\r\n\r\nsweeping  of  mines  will be principally  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the Commonwealth nations, and I see  no\r\n\r\nreason why they should not assist us by lending us\r\n\r\nminesweepers, now lying idle, for training our men\r\n\r\nand supplying us with minesweepers in time of war.\r\n\r\nI   think  we  should  use  obsolete  vessels  for\r\n\r\nobsolescent  warfare instead of  having  to  build\r\n\r\nwarships which may be useless by the time they are\r\n\r\ncompleted. This $15 million can then be  allocated\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the social services or even  to\r\n\r\nprevent  an  increase of income tax on  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups  in the years to come,  instead  of\r\n\r\nspending  it on the Royal Malayan Navy.  The  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Secretary has informed us that  it  is\r\n\r\npossible that the Federation, on her attainment of\r\n\r\nindependence,  will take over this  responsibility\r\n\r\nnow assumed by us. Until that question is settled,\r\n\r\nwe must record our objection to this expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir, when one defends the undefendable,\r\n\r\nthe   proper  technique  which  has  always   been\r\n\r\nrecognised is to indulge in platitudes with  one's\r\n\r\nhand  on one's heart. We have heard from the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary,  in  tones of ringing emotion,  of  the\r\n\r\nwonderful  work being done to build the spirit  of\r\n\r\nthese  men  in  accordance with the  tradition  of\r\n\r\nthose who did so magnificently during the war. The\r\n\r\nChief Secretary did not,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  course,  point out that the  men  who  did  so\r\n\r\nmagnificently  during the war were not  the  Royal\r\n\r\nMalayan Navy but the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer\r\n\r\nReserve;  nor  did he point out  that  I  did  not\r\n\r\ncriticise  the  allocation for the  Malayan  Royal\r\n\r\nNaval  Volunteer Reserve of $744,710 but, in fact,\r\n\r\nvoted with the rest in accepting it without demur.\r\n\r\nThose  are  the  men who did good service  and  it\r\n\r\nmight well be a valuable service for local needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Malayan Navy, Sir, is another kettle of\r\n\r\nfish.  The Chief Secretary did not also  tell  you\r\n\r\nthat  85 per cent of the personnel, who are  small\r\n\r\nin number, come from the Federation, and it is for\r\n\r\nthese  that  we have to spend $4 million  annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent and $15 million for these minesweepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary also told you of the\r\n\r\nwonderful  work which was done during the  war  in\r\n\r\nminesweeping. I am not aware, Sir, and perhaps  he\r\n\r\nwill  term  me ignorant, of any enemy power  which\r\n\r\ndropped any mines in any territory connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation or Singapore. It is true that  the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Navy  planted mines in  the  approaches  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  I suppose it will be  anticipated\r\n\r\nthat mines will be planted in future wars; but let\r\n\r\nus  recognise  the fact, Sir, that  this  enormous\r\n\r\nexpenditure is a horrible waste of money  with  no\r\n\r\nrelation  to the needs of this territory;  because\r\n\r\nit  is said we are surrounded by water, we need  a\r\n\r\nNavy for internal security. I do not know if it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  go  up  Kallang River to  subdue  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah.  Is  the Navy small enough  to  go  up  the\r\n\r\ncanal?  I  do not know the type of work which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar has in mind in  suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  these little boats can be used for  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity,  but let the voice of experience  speak,\r\n\r\nSir.  They have been of no value to this territory\r\n\r\nin  that  matter. In respect of customs,  we  have\r\n\r\nvery   expensive  programme  of  ships  to  assist\r\n\r\nagainst  smuggling and they can, in time of  need,\r\n\r\nbe  turned very rapidly for offensive purposes.  I\r\n\r\ncannot understand how any Member in this House can\r\n\r\ncomplacently view this great expenditure  annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent and this provision which calls  upon  us\r\n\r\nto   accept   it   as  a  matter  of  principle - an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  $15 million for four  very  small\r\n\r\nships to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsweep mines. Sir, I would much rather see this $15\r\n\r\nmillion  used to sweep poverty, which has existed,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  imaginary mines which never  did  and\r\n\r\ncannot exist. What kind of war do you think,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwill  ever  occur in which the provision  of  four\r\n\r\nminesweepers  by this territory could  be  of  any\r\n\r\nvalue to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally let us not forget the basic principle.\r\n\r\nThe   United   Kingdom  has  insisted,   and   its\r\n\r\ninsistence has been acceded to, on the control  of\r\n\r\nexternal  defence  of  this  territory.  It  wants\r\n\r\ncomplete, absolute and unquestioned control and it\r\n\r\nhas  got it, and it will get it again if there  is\r\n\r\nany  merdeka at all. So long as that is true, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  it  fair  to  call  upon the  people  of  this\r\n\r\nterritory to give a substantial part of the public\r\n\r\nrevenue  to  purposes  over  which  they  have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, there seems to be some conflict\r\n\r\nof  opinion between the two hon. Members who  have\r\n\r\nspoken.   One   clearly  supports  the   continued\r\n\r\nexistence  of  the Royal Malayan  Navy,  which  is\r\n\r\nconsistent,  of  course, with the  line  that  was\r\n\r\ntaken  by the previous Government. The other,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, obviously does not like  the\r\n\r\nRoyal Malayan Navy or to have anything to do  with\r\n\r\nit.  I have not the time to answer in detail, Sir,\r\n\r\nbut I would like to make one or two quick points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is whether or not it is quite a\r\n\r\nwaste  of money to have any vessels to sweep mines\r\n\r\nhere. It may be that people will not drop mines in\r\n\r\na  future  war.  It may be that  it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  lay  a defensive  minefield  around\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  if  it  is  necessary  to  lay  a\r\n\r\nminefield,  or if enemies do drop mines  from  the\r\n\r\nair, then you will have to have minesweepers, just\r\n\r\nas minesweepers had been used right up to the last\r\n\r\nday  of  the  recent hostilities.

I  have\r\n\r\ntherefore  asked  to  speak on  the  general  Head\r\n\r\ninstead  of  on the different items, but  I  shall\r\n\r\ncome down to the items themselves later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of expenditure for building, I\r\n\r\nspoke  quite a lot about it last year, but then  I\r\n\r\nwas  still a greenhorn and my experience regarding\r\n\r\nmethods of building was rather limited, but during\r\n\r\nthe  present year I have taken pains  to  go  into\r\n\r\ncosts and I think I can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow speak with more authority. It is gratifying to\r\n\r\nme  to  know  that  in certain  aspects  costs  of\r\n\r\nbuilding   by   the   Public   Works   Department,\r\n\r\nparticularly where primary schools are  concerned,\r\n\r\nhave come down a great deal, more particularly  so\r\n\r\nwhen I found that the expenditure for converting a\r\n\r\nboys'  hostel  into flats for nurses was  $100,000\r\n\r\ninstead  of  $200,000,  after  repeated  arguments\r\n\r\nbetween the Minister for Communications and  Works\r\n\r\nand myself in this Chamber last year. While I will\r\n\r\nadmit that costs have come down, I still say  that\r\n\r\nthere  is room for further reduction. The  debates\r\n\r\nthat  we have during this week have shown  us  how\r\n\r\ntight  money  is  going to be and how  pressed  we\r\n\r\nshall be for finances to be able to carry out  the\r\n\r\nprogramme for our schools and hospitals and  other\r\n\r\nsocial work. I must therefore keep on hammering at\r\n\r\nthis  House  and  insist on  the  most  economical\r\n\r\nmethod of building for the public services, taking\r\n\r\naway  all the trimmings if necessary. We have come\r\n\r\nto  a  stage  where  we must, I think,  build  for\r\n\r\nutility and not as a monument for posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come now to the items on which I wish to\r\n\r\nspeak. The first one is the $100,000 that is being\r\n\r\nasked  for garages for radio vehicles. This  seems\r\n\r\nto  me  to  be  a very large sum for garages.  The\r\n\r\nsecond item is $700,000 being asked for to provide\r\n\r\nnew  Divisional  Headquarters for Queenstown.  For\r\n\r\nthis sum I visualise a rather sumptuous office and\r\n\r\nI  should like to know some of the costs for  this\r\n\r\nbuilding.  Then  we come to the super  building - $2\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the new Headquarters of the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch.  If  we were to spend millions of  dollars\r\n\r\nfor  all these items, I am afraid the finances  of\r\n\r\nthe  colony will not be able to stand  it,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to have some explanation of the  money\r\n\r\nasked for under this Head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I will try and answer the queries of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar as quickly as I can, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Chairman, Sir. I had better  try  and  put\r\n\r\nthis  in  perspective first by  referring  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department's Report of a  comparable\r\n\r\nterritory where I find they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  done  the equivalent of about (Malayan)  $62\r\n\r\nmillion worth of work, and personal emoluments and\r\n\r\nsimilar  overheads  amounted to  $18\ufffd  million - in\r\n\r\nother   words,   14.9  per  cent  of   the   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.

Sir, I think this\r\n\r\nreflects  well  on the progress of  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nachieved so far in this territory and also on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral efficiency of the department. I must  pass\r\n\r\non as quickly as I can, Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out that I have given details in\r\n\r\nthe  past  of  the machinery by which  we  try  to\r\n\r\neffect our policy of economy and austerity - we have\r\n\r\nvarious committees at different levels - and I have\r\n\r\nalso  given details of the achievements  which  we\r\n\r\nhave   made   in   economy,  and   very   handsome\r\n\r\nachievements  they  are. I  will  not  waste  time\r\n\r\nrepeating them. I just wish to point out  that  we\r\n\r\ndo  control the designs of our buildings,  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  control the prices, which  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ntenders  offered. There is a suggestion  that  the\r\n\r\nquarters  may be too lavish. I have  with  me  the\r\n\r\nagreed   scale  of  quarters  for  medical  staff:\r\n\r\nhousemen get 310 square feet per person at a  cost\r\n\r\nof  $13,000; matrons in charge get 825 square feet\r\n\r\nper  person  at a cost of $24,500; student  nurses\r\n\r\nget 80 square feet per person at a cost of $4,500.\r\n\r\nBut  whatever  we  agree as  to  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nbuilding, the price will still depend on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat the building trade is able to produce in  the\r\n\r\nway  of tenders which are competitive; and in that\r\n\r\nconnection must remark that the building trade  is\r\n\r\nnot  at the moment producing as man tenders as  it\r\n\r\nused to in the past. In fact, for one large job no\r\n\r\ntenders were received and we had to put it out for\r\n\r\ntender again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs are also rising, partly as a result of the\r\n\r\ncurrent  Suez crisis, and whilst I will give  some\r\n\r\nfigures in a minute, I cannot guarantee that  they\r\n\r\nwill be figures which will exist when the next lot\r\n\r\nof  tenders come in, because the situation is  too\r\n\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pass on to some more figures for\r\n\r\nbuildings. Let us take hospitals again. You divide\r\n\r\nthem  into three categories - A, B and C. That  part\r\n\r\nof  the  hospital  which has  to  be  scrupulously\r\n\r\naseptic,   with  a  high  standard  of   finishes,\r\n\r\noperating  theatres, and so  on,  category  A,  we\r\n\r\nbuild at a cost of $1.41 a cubic foot. In category\r\n\r\nB, mostly wards in major hospitals, where you have\r\n\r\nto  make sure that they are clean and where you do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  spend  money  on  cleaning  and  on\r\n\r\nmaintenance  which you have saved on building,  we\r\n\r\nbuild  at  $1.05 a cubic foot; and for the  places\r\n\r\nwhere   you   can  omit  the  expensive  finishes,\r\n\r\ncategory  C, we get the cost down to  84  cents  a\r\n\r\ncubic   foot.   We  can  vary  our  standards   in\r\n\r\naccordance with what we can get the department  to\r\n\r\naccept. That is one variable factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another variable factor is, of course, that we\r\n\r\ncannot  necessarily choose our sites and say,  \"We\r\n\r\nwill   choose   a   site  where   we   can   build\r\n\r\neconomically.\" We may have to put a  school  or  a\r\n\r\nhospital where it will serve the public needs, and\r\n\r\nthe only site we can get may be a difficult one.

The\r\n\r\ncost  of schools finished in 1956 ranges from  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Katong  Secondary  Technical  School   at\r\n\r\n$1,047,229 to a group of three primary schools  at\r\n\r\nBukit  Merah  which average $236,000 each.  It  is\r\n\r\nnotable  that  $185,000 was  spent  on  the  piled\r\n\r\nfoundation for the Tanjong Katong and $26,000  for\r\n\r\nthe  three  Bukit Merah schools. The  former  site\r\n\r\nseems to have been somewhat ill chosen. Taking the\r\n\r\naverage  for  the 21 primary schools completed  in\r\n\r\n1956,  $30,000 per school was spent on piling  and\r\n\r\n$190,000  per  school on the  building,  that  is,\r\n\r\nomitting the cost of the sites and the expenditure\r\n\r\non  grounds, fencing, drainage roads  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nPiling  has become expensive because of the three-storey construction which is now fashionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the bringing down of costs, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works said that he\r\n\r\nwould welcome suggestions, and I have a suggestion\r\n\r\nto  make regarding schools in the rural areas.  In\r\n\r\nUlu  Pandan  the  new barracks for  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBattalion   are   being   erected   as   temporary\r\n\r\nbuildings.  These  are  cheaply  built  one-storey\r\n\r\nbuildings   with  walls  made  of  some  specially\r\n\r\ntreated   hardboard,  but  they  look  solid   and\r\n\r\nserviceable.  I have no doubt that in  ten  years'\r\n\r\ntime  they will still be standing, they will still\r\n\r\nbe  serviceable,  and they will  still  be  called\r\n\r\ntemporary. The advantage is that they can be built\r\n\r\nwith  the minimum of site clearance and they  need\r\n\r\nnot  be built on a large piece of flat ground, and\r\n\r\nno  piling  is required. I know that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications  and Works  will  look  at  me\r\n\r\nrather  sadly and repeat that I have not  done  my\r\n\r\nhome-work,  and like the painstaking school-master\r\n\r\nthat  he  is, he is going to tell me about  higher\r\n\r\nmaintenance costs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  over  again. But, Sir, I think there  is  too\r\n\r\nmuch  of this fetish of erecting buildings to last\r\n\r\nfor  a century. In this rapidly changing world and\r\n\r\nthis   rapidly   changing  Singapore,   there   is\r\n\r\nsomething  to  be  said for planning  for  ten  to\r\n\r\nfifteen  years  instead of the next generation  or\r\n\r\ntwo  in  certain  types  of building  for  certain\r\n\r\npurposes.  Building  techniques  change.  Teaching\r\n\r\nrequirements in a certain area can change,  and  I\r\n\r\ncan see no harm in allowing for them and in trying\r\n\r\nto  use cheaper materials on an experimental basis\r\n\r\nfor  some of our schools. What is good enough  for\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Battalion should be good enough  to\r\n\r\ntry in our schools, bearing in mind that it is the\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  the ability of the  teacher  which\r\n\r\nmatter in education and not the material that  the\r\n\r\nwalls  are made of. This is not to say that  I  am\r\n\r\nnot   appreciative  of  the  economy   of   school\r\n\r\nbuilding. The Minister gave us facts about it  the\r\n\r\nother day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also mindful of the enormous changes which\r\n\r\nhave  come  over Singapore in ten years since  the\r\n\r\nwar.  The  changes  in  the next  decade  will  be\r\n\r\nequally enormous, probably even more so. Sometimes\r\n\r\nI think that we are caught too much in the grip of\r\n\r\nexpert  planners who wish to plan our future  much\r\n\r\nfurther  ahead than we ourselves can see. I  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  that for expressing these awful heresies,  I\r\n\r\nshould  probably  go down to  the  bottom  of  the\r\n\r\nclass,  but nevertheless I hope that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education  and his educational  experts  will\r\n\r\nremember  that many students on this island  today\r\n\r\nare being taught quite successfully in schools not\r\n\r\nmade or bricks and mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to refer to one small matter on\r\n\r\npage 379 of the Estimates - the point on which I  am\r\n\r\nmoving  this amendment. It seems to me a  question\r\n\r\nof   primary  school  mathematics.  Under   \"Group\r\n\r\nD - fifteen  schools\",  there  is  an  estimate   of\r\n\r\n$4,680,000;   whereas  under   \"Group   C - eighteen\r\n\r\nschools\", there is provision for a similar amount.\r\n\r\nIt  would  seem  to  me,  therefore,  that  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to spend more per school under  Group  D\r\n\r\nthan Group C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, as\r\n\r\nregards  the same provision for Group C and  Group\r\n\r\nD, perhaps I can explain to the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nthat  the  15  primary  schools  in  Group  D  are\r\n\r\ndesigned to accommodate as many pupils as  the  18\r\n\r\nschools in Group C. By reducing the dimensions and\r\n\r\nsimplifying  the  structure, it  was  the  aim  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the total cost of the schools in Group  D.\r\n\r\nEach  of  the new type schools in Group D  has  18\r\n\r\nclassrooms and the cost is expected to be  reduced\r\n\r\nby  a  considerable amount at least, but the costs\r\n\r\nof material and labour have remained unchanged. In\r\n\r\nfact, in certain respects, costs have increased by\r\n\r\n16   per   cent.  The  Suez  crisis   has   caused\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  be  somewhat  nervous  about  the\r\n\r\nprices   of  steel  and  cement  and  also   other\r\n\r\nimportant building materials. Moreover,  the  best\r\n\r\nsites  have been used up and I think future  sites\r\n\r\nwill  cost  even  more, especially  in  regard  to\r\n\r\npiling, levelling and filling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that cheaper buildings be built\r\n\r\nhas been gone into by my Ministry and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Communications and Works.  We  have  not  lost\r\n\r\nsight   of  it.  We  have,  in  fact,  a  building\r\n\r\ncommittee meeting very frequently to deliberate on\r\n\r\nthe  question.  Some people have advocated  to  me\r\n\r\nthat,  in the interests of economy, wood and attap\r\n\r\nbuildings  be  put  up. When  we  went  into  this\r\n\r\nquestion, it was found to be more uneconomical, as\r\n\r\nboth  wood and attap have to be imported from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, our nearest neighbour,  and\r\n\r\nthey would therefore cost us more than they do the\r\n\r\nFederation. Vacant land is also scarce and we have\r\n\r\nto build three - or four-storey schools and plan for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also to take into consideration the\r\n\r\nMaster   Plan.  New  satellite  towns  are   being\r\n\r\nplanned.  Areas  have  been ear-marked  for  green\r\n\r\nbelts  and  open space, and we have  to  plan  our\r\n\r\nschools  accordingly. Instead of putting up  cheap\r\n\r\nwooden  huts  or  attap  buildings,  we  have  now\r\n\r\nplanned  to  put up cheap smaller schools  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas,  so that they can last  for  ten  to\r\n\r\ntwenty  years,  by which time, of course,  we  may\r\n\r\nplan  for bigger buildings if the demand justifies\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should also like to mention that bricks\r\n\r\nand tiles are manufactured in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore, and if we build schools with bricks and\r\n\r\ntiles,  we  are  actually  giving  employment   to\r\n\r\nthousands of people.

Since then, we have been told\r\n\r\nthat  most of the cost is due to the expansion  or\r\n\r\nto the more ambitious planning and not so much due\r\n\r\nto  the cost of the building itself. All the same,\r\n\r\nI  think  that we have to go into detail  and  see\r\n\r\nthat  this vast expenditure of nearly $10  miIlion\r\n\r\nshould be carefully used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest item of the Polytechnic is the six-storey teaching block which will cost round about\r\n\r\n$3  million,  working out at about  $20  a  square\r\n\r\nfoot.  The  Minister for Communications and  Works\r\n\r\nhas  given us an indication of the cost  of  round\r\n\r\nabout  $13  a  square  foot for  the  three-storey\r\n\r\nprimary schools. I think personally that the  cost\r\n\r\nof  this  Polytechnic for the six-storey  building\r\n\r\ncan  be brought more or less in line with the cost\r\n\r\nof  these primary schools. We know very well  that\r\n\r\nthe main cost of the building is the finishing. It\r\n\r\ncan cost as much as the structure itself. I do not\r\n\r\npropose that any alteration should be made to this\r\n\r\nstructure  because I understand that  the  job  is\r\n\r\nready  for tender and part of it is already  being\r\n\r\nbuilt  but  I do submit that we and the  Estimates\r\n\r\nCommittee  of which I am a Member should  go  into\r\n\r\ngreat detail and see what cost we can cut down  in\r\n\r\nthe ornaments of this building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item which attracted our attention was\r\n\r\nthe  very,  very big provision for the architect's\r\n\r\nfee.  If  the job were competed as visualised  now\r\n\r\ncosting  $8  million for the buildings  alone,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have to pay the architect $800,000. This  I\r\n\r\nsubmit, Sir, is a stupendous amount. In the Budget\r\n\r\ntoday, the programme is cut down and we are  asked\r\n\r\nto  budget for $5\ufffd million for which we will have\r\n\r\nto  pay  the  architect just over half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars.  When  we went into the question  of  why\r\n\r\nsuch a big fee has to be paid, we found that under\r\n\r\nthe   Architects  Ordinance,  there  is  provision\r\n\r\nwhereby  the flat fee of 7\ufffd per cent  was  to  be\r\n\r\ncharged and the architects' stand is that they are\r\n\r\nbound  by that scale of fees and they cannot  give\r\n\r\nus  any reduction. This scale of fees was approved\r\n\r\nby  this  Assembly only last June when I was  away\r\n\r\nbut Members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly have told me that had they realised\r\n\r\nthat  this  amounted to 7\ufffd per cent  plus  2\ufffd per\r\n\r\ncent  for quantity survey, making it ten per  cent\r\n\r\nin all and had they been informed of this enormous\r\n\r\nsum of half a million dollars, they would not have\r\n\r\nagreed to this scale of fees. In fact, so many  of\r\n\r\nthem are so agitated that there is a definite move\r\n\r\nto  repeal  section 4 of the Architects  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhereby   the   power  that  was  given   to   the\r\n\r\nArchitects'  Board to fix the fee  will  be  taken\r\n\r\naway  from  them. I think this is rather  a  hasty\r\n\r\nmove.  I have consulted many architects and  I  am\r\n\r\ntold  that  the  position of architects  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent from that of other people. They are more\r\n\r\nor  less like the lawyers in that, if there is any\r\n\r\ndefect in the building or should the building fall\r\n\r\ndown,  they have to make good. They have to  carry\r\n\r\nthat   responsibility  simply  because  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the  Government do not  have  enough\r\n\r\nsupervisors  to watch the progress of a  building.\r\n\r\nTherefore the responsibility is passed over to the\r\n\r\narchitects  for which it is quite reasonable  that\r\n\r\nhe  should be sufficiently remunerated but at this\r\n\r\nscale,  when  $10  million  of  public  money   is\r\n\r\ninvolved and, in about two years, an architect can\r\n\r\nearn  between half a million dollars to  $800,000,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think  that all Members will  agree  with\r\n\r\nme - in  fact, many of them are insisting - that  this\r\n\r\nscale  should  be  sent  back  to  the  Board   of\r\n\r\nArchitects  with  a  request  that  it  should  be\r\n\r\nrevised  so  that there is a reducing  scale  say:\r\n\r\nafter  the  first  half  a million  dollars  or  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars, if you like, there should  be  a\r\n\r\nreducing  scale and make this whole fee reasonable\r\n\r\nand acceptable to us.

As   an\r\n\r\narchitect,  Sir,  I am unable  even  to  allow  my\r\n\r\nimagination  to stretch to whatever extent  I  may\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should ask for $5\ufffd  million\r\n\r\nfor the Polytechnic whereas the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwhich has three Faculties, a library, hostels  for\r\n\r\nabout  600 students, a sewerage purification plant\r\n\r\nand about a couple of miles of road could be built\r\n\r\nfor less than $3\ufffd million. Since the announcement\r\n\r\nof  the  revised cost, strong criticism  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  by  Members of this House  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  the Press of the high cost.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, Sir, I am grateful to the Government  for\r\n\r\nsending  me a memorandum giving an explanation  of\r\n\r\nhow  this cost is arrived at. I have gone  through\r\n\r\nthe  memorandum thoroughly and I for  one  am  not\r\n\r\nconvinced  with  the  explanation  at   all.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  $30 per square foot has been  given  as\r\n\r\nthe  estimate of the cost of a square foot of  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic whereas the hotel now being built by a\r\n\r\nClass A P.W.D. contractor in Orchard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad  includes shops downstairs, a restaurant  and\r\n\r\n140  bed-rooms  upstairs, each  with  a  bath-room\r\n\r\nattached  complete  with all  fittings,  including\r\n\r\npiling  which  goes down to 70 feet  and  it  only\r\n\r\ncosts $12.50 a square foot. If piling is excluded,\r\n\r\nit  will  come down to $11 a square foot.  Another\r\n\r\ninstance  is  the Nanyang Girls' School  which  is\r\n\r\nalso   being  built  by  another  Class  A  P.W.D.\r\n\r\ncontractor and which works out at less than $8 per\r\n\r\nsquare foot complete. Numerous instances could  be\r\n\r\nquoted  in  comparison, if desired. Even  allowing\r\n\r\nfor  foundation  for  heavy  machinery  and  extra\r\n\r\nheights of rooms, I think that the $30 per  square\r\n\r\nfoot quoted is still fantastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with the Member for Paya Lebar that\r\n\r\nthe   question  of  architects'  fees  should   be\r\n\r\nreconsidered. As an architect, Sir, I  do  welcome\r\n\r\nsuch protection but as a Member of this House  who\r\n\r\nhas   to  protect  the  public,  I  must  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to have this vote amended at  an  early\r\n\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Well said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Another point put up by the\r\n\r\nGovernment   in  the  memorandum   is   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment could not do it cheaper than a  private\r\n\r\narchitect  because  they  would  have  to   engage\r\n\r\nquantity surveyors of whom they have none  or,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  none available yet. Are quantities  really\r\n\r\nrequired  for  a  building like  the  Polytechnic?\r\n\r\nHundreds of millions of dollars worth of buildings\r\n\r\nhave been constructed by the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust and private architects in the past few years\r\n\r\nand  none of them had quantities. No such practice\r\n\r\nis  adopted  in America. In fact, some years  ago,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Improvement Trust put up two tenders\r\n\r\nfor  some  flats  on  exactly the  same  plan  and\r\n\r\nspecification: one with quantities and  the  other\r\n\r\nwithout.  The  tender for the one with  quantities\r\n\r\ncame  out  eight  per  cent higher  than  the  one\r\n\r\nwithout quantities. In cutting out quantities, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not only save on the fees  of  the\r\n\r\nquantity  surveyor but it will also  save  on  the\r\n\r\nprice of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntender  because  I  know of many  instances  where\r\n\r\ncontractors  have had to wait for  months  to  get\r\n\r\npaid  as  the  quantity surveyor  engaged  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was overwhelmed with work. If  one  has\r\n\r\nto  wait  so  long  for his money,  one  naturally\r\n\r\nincreases his price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government seems to have a tendency of\r\n\r\nspending lavishly on buildings, if left unchecked.\r\n\r\nThey do not seem to realise the value of money  at\r\n\r\nall. For instance, I know of a case where they put\r\n\r\na  $3  per square foot floor finish for some flats\r\n\r\nat  Leonie  Hill which are only meant  for  junior\r\n\r\nofficers.  I  myself  have  designed  houses   for\r\n\r\nmillionaires and luxurious flats and  at  no  time\r\n\r\nhas  the floor finish cost exceeded $2 per  square\r\n\r\nfoot.  Another instance is the recently  completed\r\n\r\nNurses  Hostel.  I  remember distinctly  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works said at  its\r\n\r\nopening  that the Government had brought down  the\r\n\r\ncost  from $6,000 per unit to $4,000 per  unit.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  Minister  concerned  should   be\r\n\r\ncongratulated for his good work. If the Government\r\n\r\ncould make a saving in this case, why did not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment make it in previous cases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, hon. Members can see that if\r\n\r\nGovernment  takes  the trouble to  scrutinise  the\r\n\r\ncost carefully, savings could be made. I therefore\r\n\r\nplead with Government to appoint a committee to go\r\n\r\ninto the matter thoroughly thereby hoping that the\r\n\r\ncost might be reduced by one-third or more as  the\r\n\r\nNurses Hostel which opened lately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nrecently  there  has  been a very  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nuninformed  criticism  about  the  cost   of   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  and  I  would  like  to   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity of stating the facts clearly once  and\r\n\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report issued by the Dobby Committee, the\r\n\r\nfirst  Committee  to go into the question  of  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic,  stated  that the  estimated  capital\r\n\r\ncost  of the Polytechnic would be $8 million.  The\r\n\r\nReport did not, however, go into details as to how\r\n\r\nthis figure was made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup.   When  Mr  Gibson  came  out  to   make   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into the question  of  establishing\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic, he did, in fact, make  a  rough\r\n\r\nestimate  of  cost  and that  is  broken  down  as\r\n\r\nfollows:  Buildings  $3.7 million;  Furniture  and\r\n\r\nFittings  for  the Buildings $47  million;  Heavy\r\n\r\nEquipment  $1.01  million,  making  a   total   of\r\n\r\n$5,196,000. This figure was accepted by Government\r\n\r\nuntil  such  time  as  plans could  be  drawn  and\r\n\r\naccurate  estimates  of cost  made.  Planning  did\r\n\r\nproceed   thereafter  and  a   firm   of   private\r\n\r\narchitects  was employed on the recommendation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Executive  Council with the  consent  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Committee of the then Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nWhen  their plans were completed, they  were  sent\r\n\r\nhome to the Secretary of State's Board of Advisers\r\n\r\non  Technical  Colleges.  This  Board  immediately\r\n\r\ncondemned the plans in so far as only seven  acres\r\n\r\nof  land were used and the area, having regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  buildings which would be placed in it and the\r\n\r\nfunctions which they would have to serve, would be\r\n\r\ntoo   congested.   Subsequently,  therefore,   the\r\n\r\narchitects were asked to re-draw their  plans  and\r\n\r\nthey did so. The estimate of cost of the new plans\r\n\r\nis   as   follows:  Site  preparation  will   take\r\n\r\n$150,000. The workshop and navigation block, which\r\n\r\nMr  Gibson  left out of his estimate, will  total\r\n\r\n$986,000. The six-storey teaching block, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  main  part  of  the  Polytechnic,  will  cost\r\n\r\n$956,000.  The administrative block,  library  and\r\n\r\nlecture  rooms  above the administration  building\r\n\r\nwill cost $766,000. The architects' fees will come\r\n\r\nto  $504,000;  making a total  of  $5,362,884.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  it had been suggested that a  gymnasium\r\n\r\nand  students'  union  costing  $253,000  and   an\r\n\r\nauditorium and canteen costing $1,689,000,  making\r\n\r\na  total  of  $1,942,000 should be undertaken.  In\r\n\r\naddition also, heavy equipment for the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nincluding furniture and fittings is estimated  now\r\n\r\nto cost $2,500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these estimates came to me in my capacity as\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary,  I  immediately  asked   the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Public Works to examine them  with  a\r\n\r\ntine tooth-comb to see that they were accurate  in\r\n\r\nall respects. Then the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector  of Works in answer to my request  turned\r\n\r\nthem over to the Chief Architect of the Government\r\n\r\nwho  examined them and found that they were in all\r\n\r\nrespects reasonable minimum estimates of the  cost\r\n\r\nof  the  amount of work which had to be  done.  At\r\n\r\nthat  stage,  I  held a meeting  with  all  people\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the  Polytechnic,  and   it   was\r\n\r\ndecided, and subsequently confirmed by the Council\r\n\r\nof  Ministers, that we would go ahead for the time\r\n\r\nbeing with work amounting to $5.5 million and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, with the purchase of equipment to the tune\r\n\r\nof  $2,500,000, leaving the other work -  gymnasium\r\n\r\nand students' union, auditorium and canteen - to  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  at  some  future date  if  money  were\r\n\r\navailable.  It was made clear that no  undertaking\r\n\r\ncould  be  given to the Board of Trustees  of  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  that  this  additional   work   would\r\n\r\nsubsequently be undertaken. In the opinion of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  which sat on the matter in  my  office,\r\n\r\nthis  work  was not regarded as essential  to  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful operation of the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at the moment, Government's total\r\n\r\ncommitment in respect of the Polytechnic  is  $5.5\r\n\r\nmillion  in  respect  of capital  works  and  $2.5\r\n\r\nmillion in respect of equipment, making a total of\r\n\r\n$8  million  altogether. The  other  work  on  the\r\n\r\ngymnasium, students' union, auditorium and canteen\r\n\r\nwill  be left until very much later and will  then\r\n\r\ndepend upon whether funds are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other items which I should mention: a request from the Board of Trustees of the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  for  the provision of  playing-fields\r\n\r\nwhich  was  estimated  to cost  $500,000  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision of $1 million for houses. Both of  these\r\n\r\nrequests  have been turned down. It is hoped  that\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  expatriate officers  who  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be employed by the Polytechnic  will  be\r\n\r\nfound amongst existing Government quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the cost of the building in\r\n\r\nterms  of square feet which has been mentioned,  I\r\n\r\nregret  to  say  that I am not in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nconfirm  or  refute that statement. I  do  however\r\n\r\nknow that in the case of the six-storey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteaching  block which is the largest item  in  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic,  the total cost of that  building  is\r\n\r\n$2.9   million  and  the  cubic  footage  of  that\r\n\r\nparticular building is 1.4 million cubic feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The new estimate of $6.5\r\n\r\nmillion  includes  $2  million  for  quarters  for\r\n\r\nresidential    staff,   Medical    Superintendent,\r\n\r\nsisters,  nurses and servants. It also allows  for\r\n\r\nthe   provision  of  450  beds.  Fifty  additional\r\n\r\nmaternity beds have been added, making a total  of\r\n\r\n100  because  of  the  very  evident  pressure  on\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau  Hospital where accommodation  has\r\n\r\nreached saturation point and where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\novercrowding constitutes now a real danger to  the\r\n\r\nnew-born. It was also made with knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nsite.  I think that, at the last sitting here,  in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  the  same hon. gentleman,  I  gave  an\r\n\r\naccount to the House of the cause of the delay  on\r\n\r\nthe  final  choice  of the site. A  multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nbuilding is envisaged on the land which is  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired  on East Coast Road, at the end of  Tanah\r\n\r\nMerah  Ketchil  Road. A pavilion hospital  of  450\r\n\r\nbeds  is  not  an  economic proposition,  because,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  it would require 40 acres of  flat  land\r\n\r\ninstead of 18 acres at present envisaged. It would\r\n\r\nnot  be  cheaper  to  build  because  foundations,\r\n\r\nroofs,  sewage pipes, water distribution, electric\r\n\r\ndistribution, piping of steam and oxygen,  and  so\r\n\r\nforth,  would  be  far more extensive  than  in  a\r\n\r\ncompact   multi-storeyed  building.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nrecurrent costs would be higher because  a  larger\r\n\r\nsupervisory  and subordinate staff is required  to\r\n\r\nmake  up  for  the  time wasted  in  walking  long\r\n\r\ndistances between wards and departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Telephone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I regard what the hon.

In that respect,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the site is eminently eligible because  it\r\n\r\nis  free. Secondly, it is eligible because  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  well  situated from a demographic  point  of\r\n\r\nview  because the population around is both  heavy\r\n\r\nand poor and it is therefore a very suitable place\r\n\r\nfor a hospital to be where the poor people can get\r\n\r\ninto it easily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir, one year later, the choice of a new site\r\n\r\nis made in the Bedok area which is a less populous\r\n\r\narea  and  the cost is to be doubled.

Finally, we inspected two\r\n\r\nsites in the Bedok area and chose the one which is\r\n\r\nimmediately behind the Fisheries Research  Station\r\n\r\nwhich   we   now  find  to  be  an   ideal   site.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,  I  might mention that  the  outdoor\r\n\r\npatients  clinic at the old site  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  canteen  is  now  under  construction  or\r\n\r\nundergoing additions and alterations. When our new\r\n\r\nhospital     is    ready,    anybody     requiring\r\n\r\nhospitalisation will be sent there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

You will notice here  that\r\n\r\nfor  all  the quarters, the estimate for  each  of\r\n\r\nwhich I shall deal with, there is already provided\r\n\r\na  sum  of $1,400,000 for Ancillary Services which\r\n\r\nmeans  that when we come to calculate the cost  of\r\n\r\neach  quarter, we shall have to take  out  of  our\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  roads, the water  supply,  the\r\n\r\nelectric supply and the sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point that I am dealing with is sub-head 13 (4) at page 383 of the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  and  there  is  $1,250,000  asked   for\r\n\r\naccommodation for 78 sisters which  works  out  at\r\n\r\nabout\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$16,000 per flat. That, I submit, Sir, is still  a\r\n\r\nhigh figure and I think that $12,000 per flat  for\r\n\r\na sister would be suitable accommodation because I\r\n\r\nknow  for a fact that many private architects  are\r\n\r\nbuilding  very  comfortable flats  with  two  bed-rooms,  a sitting-room, and a dining-room complete\r\n\r\naround $12,000 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sub-head that I would like to speak on\r\n\r\nis   14   (2)   at  page  383  of  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  There we have $450,000  asked  for  to\r\n\r\nprovide  accommodation for  12  medical  officers.\r\n\r\nThis  is an increase over last year's estimate  of\r\n\r\n50  per cent and it works out at $37,000 per flat.\r\n\r\nNow  I  know that we have paid sums like this  for\r\n\r\naccommodating previous officers and professors  in\r\n\r\nthe  University but I think we have come to a time\r\n\r\nwhen  we  must be more realistic and cut down  the\r\n\r\ncost of accommodation for our officers. Every  one\r\n\r\nof  us,  big  or  small, is  asked  to  contribute\r\n\r\ntowards  income tax and our taxes  are  rising  by\r\n\r\nleaps  and bounds. I am quite sure that when these\r\n\r\nofficers,  who  will  in the future  occupy  these\r\n\r\nflats, are asked to give their opinion, they  will\r\n\r\nagree with us in that they are prepared to live in\r\n\r\na less luxurious manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sub-head that I wish to touch on is 14\r\n\r\n(4) ,  Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital. There  we\r\n\r\nhave   \"Additions  and  Alterations  to   existing\r\n\r\nHospital Buildings\" and the sum is $2 million.  It\r\n\r\nseems to be a lot of money for alterations alone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sub-head that I wish to comment on is 15\r\n\r\n(4)   on  page  384  of the Development  Estimates,\r\n\r\nStudents Nurses Hostel and Training School. There,\r\n\r\nthe  estimated cost of $1,200,000 asked  for  last\r\n\r\nyear  is  now  revised  at  $2  million.  Why  the\r\n\r\nincrease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to draw the attention of this\r\n\r\nHouse  to sub-head 15 (5) . Here, the amount  asked\r\n\r\nfor  is $750,000 for Quarters for 40 Sisters which\r\n\r\nworks out at nearly $20,000 a flat. That, again, I\r\n\r\nsubmit,  Sir,  is  a standard of living  which  we\r\n\r\ncannot afford today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on the question of\r\n\r\nquarters for housemen, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas   a  statutory  provision  that  all  medical,\r\n\r\ngraduates   must  have  a  first-year  residential\r\n\r\nhousemanship before registration and  the  working\r\n\r\nparty  of the medical building has agreed  on  the\r\n\r\nstandard  scale of accommodation for  the  medical\r\n\r\nstaff  who  may  be required to live  in  quarters\r\n\r\nwithin  the  hospital  compound.  The  provisional\r\n\r\nestimate of the cost per unit of accommodation has\r\n\r\nbeen  worked out as follows: Houseman, 310 square\r\n\r\nfeet  which works out at $13,000 cost per  quarter\r\n\r\nfor a normal site, including furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform hon. Members of the House\r\n\r\nthat  all  buildings  on the Kandang  Kerbau  site\r\n\r\nrequire piling. On the flats for medical officers,\r\n\r\nthe  original estimate of $300,000 was  for  eight\r\n\r\nmedical  officers. Now this has been increased  to\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  twelve medical  officers.  The\r\n\r\namount  of $36,000 from that sum will be  required\r\n\r\nfor  piling  and that reduces it to about  $34,000\r\n\r\nper flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of additions and alterations to\r\n\r\nthe  buildings, sub-head 14 (4) , page 383  of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, it is already evident  that\r\n\r\nthe estimate of $2 million for the work needed  at\r\n\r\nthe  Kandang  Kerbau Hospital will  be  sufficient\r\n\r\nonly to cover the cost of the gynaecological unit.\r\n\r\nEssential  alterations to this  teaching  hospital\r\n\r\nwill  be  needed in future years and new provision\r\n\r\nwill  have to be made when the time comes. I would\r\n\r\nlike  you  to  appreciate that the Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital is a teaching hospital and as such has to\r\n\r\nkeep up with certain standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sub-head 15 (4), Student Nurses Hostel and\r\n\r\nTraining School, this will be the main centre  for\r\n\r\nthe  training of assistant nurses and it  must  be\r\n\r\nnoted  that  the $2 million is only a  provisional\r\n\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sub-head 15 (5), Quarters for forty Sisters,\r\n\r\nit  is  doubtful  whether  this  project  will  be\r\n\r\nproceeded  with.  It is expected  that  sufficient\r\n\r\naccommodation   for  unmarried  sisters   may   be\r\n\r\navailable at the new general hospital building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered the question of costs on\r\n\r\nsub-head 14 (3), Ancillary Ser-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvices. The explanation is given on page 436 of the\r\n\r\nEstimates which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provision has been made for roads, water,\r\n\r\nelectricity   supplies  and   sewerage   for   new\r\n\r\nbuildings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Provision  for  ancillary services  is  only  made\r\n\r\nunder  a  separate item in the  case  of  a  large\r\n\r\nproject  where  services are  shared  between  the\r\n\r\nvarious buildings included in the project.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  exactly to apportion  the  cost  of\r\n\r\njoint services between the various buildings being\r\n\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have not covered all of the points raised, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  my  attention  drawn  at  this  stage\r\n\r\nbecause I propose going on to something else  with\r\n\r\nyour  permission, Mr Chairman, as I feel that  it\r\n\r\nis  my  duty to inform hon.

It is going to  be  much\r\n\r\nhigher  than  it was originally. May I  have  your\r\n\r\npermission, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would like to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  to  sub-head 9, page  383,  of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates. The revised estimated  cost\r\n\r\nis   shown   at  $2.9  million  and  the  previous\r\n\r\nestimated cost was $1.5 million. I have to explain\r\n\r\nthat the estimate of $1.5 million was made without\r\n\r\nknowledge of the exact size and on a \"diagrammatic\r\n\r\nline  drawing\" of the cheapest possible  envisaged\r\n\r\npavilion-type  hospital of 200 beds.  Since  then,\r\n\r\navailable Crown land at Thomson Road was  surveyed\r\n\r\nand we decided that a pavilion-type hospital meant\r\n\r\nan  extravagant  use  of land.  It  was  therefore\r\n\r\ndecided  to use plans already drawn and  available\r\n\r\nfor a multi-storeyed building. The use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting  plans would save 12 to 18 months'  delay\r\n\r\nand  enable work to start early in 1957  and  when\r\n\r\nestimating  the  $2.9  million,  it  was  only  to\r\n\r\nprovide a hospital of 180 beds. Now in the process\r\n\r\nof  detailed planning, it was found that it  would\r\n\r\nbe  cheaper  in  the long run to build  a  396-bed\r\n\r\nhospital on a single site rather than to build one\r\n\r\n180-bed hospital now at a cost of $2.9 million and\r\n\r\nanother  at  a  later date at the same  cost.  The\r\n\r\nestimate  therefore for a 396-bed  hospital  using\r\n\r\nexisting  plans is $4.65 million. In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe  can provide 396 beds in one hospital for  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion   less  than  we  can  build  two  180-bed\r\n\r\nhospitals.   Again  studying  the  necessity   for\r\n\r\nrelieving the General Hospital of beds blocked  by\r\n\r\nchronic  or  incurable  patients,  we  find   that\r\n\r\napproximately  300  beds  are  constantly  blocked\r\n\r\nthere  so  that  the figure of 396  beds  for  the\r\n\r\nchronic sick is not excessive. The Government  now\r\n\r\ntherefore proposes to go forward with the  396-bed\r\n\r\nproject as an economic figure in the long  run  so\r\n\r\nthat the figure should now read $4,650,000 instead\r\n\r\nof $2,900,000. Doubling the size of the project is\r\n\r\nnow much less than double the cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, with your\r\n\r\npermission,  I would like to ask the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  whether he is aware of the  great  service\r\n\r\nrendered  to  the poor, especially  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  by the travelling dispensary unit? I  have\r\n\r\nlooked through the Development Estimates and it is\r\n\r\nsurprising  that this unit has not had any  chance\r\n\r\nto  expand  its activities. I have approached  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health and have asked them to increase\r\n\r\nthe  visits  of the travelling dispensary  to  the\r\n\r\npoor  living in the congested kampongs and in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  and to send, if possible,  a  doctor\r\n\r\nalong  with this travelling dispensary. I am  sure\r\n\r\nwe  are  aware that the really poor sick  patients\r\n\r\nhave  not got the bus fare or the means to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  go  to the hospitals and the  only  help\r\n\r\nwhich   they   can  get  is  from  the  travelling\r\n\r\ndispensary.  Therefore I would like  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health to inform us whether or not it is still\r\n\r\nhis intention to develop such facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, for the information\r\n\r\nof the Member for Changi, there are six travelling\r\n\r\ndispensaries and three mobile dental clinics  with\r\n\r\ntrailers  and  generators and  these  visit  rural\r\n\r\nareas   regularly  with  a  medical   officer   in\r\n\r\nattendance. If the hon. Member can point  out  any\r\n\r\nparticular  rural area which he complains  is  not\r\n\r\nbeing properly attended to, I will be glad to take\r\n\r\nthe matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would like to say a word, Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, about the suggestion that we might  call\r\n\r\non  our officers to accept smaller quarters. There\r\n\r\nis this factor to bear in mind. We have heard many\r\n\r\nstatements in here about the very heavy burden  of\r\n\r\ndependants  which  Asians have to  carry  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  and  which expatriates  do  not  have  to\r\n\r\ncarry.  This  was, of course, thought  of  by  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department quite a  long  time  ago\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  in  fact  true  that  the  normal\r\n\r\nexpatriate does send his children back to England.\r\n\r\nHe  has young children around and he does not have\r\n\r\nboys  of  15, 16, 17, and 20 years old  having  to\r\n\r\nlive  in the same house with him but they  are  at\r\n\r\nhome   in   England  attending  a  school   or   a\r\n\r\nuniversity. Here if a doctor has children and they\r\n\r\nare  going  to live with him, they will remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  house with him until they themselves  set  up\r\n\r\nfamilies  and, no doubt, he will go and live  with\r\n\r\nthem  when  he  retires. But there  is  a  genuine\r\n\r\naspect, to my mind, that if you leave the quarters\r\n\r\nas  they are, you will, in fact, be providing less\r\n\r\naccommodation  because there will be  more  people\r\n\r\nhaving  to  live in them, if the Asian  custom  is\r\n\r\nfollowed.  That  is one point. To give  a  further\r\n\r\ndeduction would be a double deduction. You see the\r\n\r\npoint  and  I  do  not  wish to  elaborate  on  it\r\n\r\nfurther. It is a simple arithmetical point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out that the figures for\r\n\r\nquarters do include furniture and that must not be\r\n\r\noverlooked  when you are taking into  account  the\r\n\r\noverall costs. I would just like to refer to  some\r\n\r\nnotes  I got from Nigeria which is not necessarily\r\n\r\na  wholly comparable territory where one's general\r\n\r\nstandard is rather low but there, in the new block\r\n\r\nfor  sisters, each sister gets a flatlet, that  is\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay, living space, bed-room, kitchenette and bath-room.  In  other  words, she has  a  little  self-contained  flat  of  her  own.  That  is  not  yet\r\n\r\nnecessary in Singapore but if we are going to  get\r\n\r\npeople  into  the nursing service  and  the  other\r\n\r\nservices in the Government, then they have got  to\r\n\r\nbe given positions which are attractive to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just run through as far as I can see the\r\n\r\nwhole of the departments in my Ministry. There was\r\n\r\na  motion  to  cut out the grant  for  the  senior\r\n\r\nquantity  surveyor, a most ill-judged  motion.  We\r\n\r\nhad  to  put  it  in  because  it  was  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary to put that senior quantity surveyor  in\r\n\r\nand  it  should  be a career which  would  attract\r\n\r\npeople into the service. You had a vacancy  for  a\r\n\r\nyear;  it was advertised locally and there was  no\r\n\r\napplicant.  It  was also advertised  overseas  and\r\n\r\nthere  was no applicant. Luckily, we got two young\r\n\r\nmen  in  the  pipe  line coming out  for  training\r\n\r\nshortly: one will be in the next year, I hope, and\r\n\r\nwe shall not increase our vacancies. But if we are\r\n\r\ngoing to get young men or young women to come into\r\n\r\nthe  service and to stay in, you have to give them\r\n\r\nattractive  conditions  which,  in  Singapore,  is\r\n\r\nlikely to mean giving them quarters because it  is\r\n\r\nvery hard to get proper housing in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just make these points because I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should be accused  of  undue\r\n\r\nlavishness in the treatment of its officers.  They\r\n\r\ndo a very good job of work and if you are going to\r\n\r\nretain  them,  you must recognise their  qualities\r\n\r\nand   their   services  by  giving   them   proper\r\n\r\nconditions to live under.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to  ask the Minister whether the 60 housemen\r\n\r\nto  be  provided for are people who are quite  old\r\n\r\nand   have  many  children?  I  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nhousemen   are  probably  people  who  have   just\r\n\r\ngraduated and they might be single or married but,\r\n\r\nI  do not think that they can produce children  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate as alleged by the Minister. Again on the\r\n\r\nmatter  of sisters and matrons, I think  they  are\r\n\r\nusually  confined to single ones and if  they  are\r\n\r\nmarried,  probably  the  husbands  will  have   to\r\n\r\nprovide the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarters.

The point is that if  you  are\r\n\r\nproviding  for married couples with children,  you\r\n\r\nmust  provide them with adequate quarters.  For  a\r\n\r\nhouseman,  I  think the figure of 310 square  feet\r\n\r\nquoted   earlier  today - I  cannot  recollect   for\r\n\r\ncertain - is  not  an  excessive  allowance  for  a\r\n\r\nqualified professional man living as a bachelor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\nglad  that  the  Minister for  Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks  confirmed  that a houseman  only  gets  310\r\n\r\nsquare feet. That will mean one sitting-room,  one\r\n\r\nbed-room  and a lavatory. Now at 310  square  feet\r\n\r\nfor  a flat of $13,000, the cost for that flat  is\r\n\r\n$40  a  square  foot which is really  a  fantastic\r\n\r\ncosting. No doubt, it includes furniture but I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  the  cost  of  furniture  for  a\r\n\r\nhouseman's  flat would come to more  than  $3,000.\r\n\r\nThe cost for a flat in a residential area is $12 a\r\n\r\nsquare  foot. I think it comes to about that  much\r\n\r\nfor  a  fairly  luxurious  flat  at  Orchard  Road\r\n\r\nopposite  the  Prince's being built  on  a  burial\r\n\r\nground  and  I frankly can not see why  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncome down to that standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> He has not done his homework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

My idea of a community centre is that it\r\n\r\nshould  be readily available to the people and  it\r\n\r\nshould serve a great multiplicity of functions  to\r\n\r\nthe  community living around it. The  present  day\r\n\r\ntype  of  community centre, Sir, serves a somewhat\r\n\r\nunorganised  population, and probably only  girls'\r\n\r\nor  boys'  clubs with perhaps one or two  meetings\r\n\r\nrarely of other organisations far in between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look at the way in which the community\r\n\r\nof Singapore carry on with their work. I will just\r\n\r\npoint out one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstance.  In one locality, invariably,  you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that  there are people who are  not  of  the\r\n\r\nChristian  faith  but  who  like  to  run   public\r\n\r\nwayangs.  I find that one section of the community\r\n\r\nwill  go around and build a stage, run the  wayang\r\n\r\nfor  about  two days for the public and then  pull\r\n\r\ndown  the stage and after two days, another  party\r\n\r\nwill stage another wayang there. In one particular\r\n\r\nlocality, you might have seven repeat performances\r\n\r\nin  a month and for each performance, it incurs an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  nearly $1,000.  So  if  community\r\n\r\ncentres  are  going  to serve  the  public,  these\r\n\r\npoints must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, community centres obviously must help the\r\n\r\npublic  in all sorts of functions. Probably  these\r\n\r\ncentres have not been publicised or no attempt has\r\n\r\nbeen  made in that direction. Very few people know\r\n\r\nwhere  community centres are and probably they  do\r\n\r\nnot  know how to apply for the use of them so that\r\n\r\neven  in  the  locality where there are  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  we  find  that many  people  still  hold\r\n\r\nfunctions in their houses which are too small  for\r\n\r\nthe  occasion.  So all in all,  I  find  that  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres which have been built  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  serving the public as they should. They have\r\n\r\nonly  been white elephants, and if they are  going\r\n\r\nto  remain as white elephants, we should expend no\r\n\r\nmore  money on them. One reason for that is  this.\r\n\r\nWhen a community centre is to be built, the people\r\n\r\naround  the area are not consulted or if they  are\r\n\r\nconsulted,  the opinion given must have  been  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of a few who do not know much  about  the\r\n\r\narea. A community centre built right behind a  row\r\n\r\nof  shophouses half a mile from a village  is  no\r\n\r\nattraction to the people but it should be  central\r\n\r\nto  that locality, just like the Victoria Memorial\r\n\r\nHall.  From my experience of community centres,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  are  a waste of public  funds  unless\r\n\r\nsteps  are  taken to rectify all that I have  said\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Serangoon keeps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non attacking community centres to make one feel as\r\n\r\nif  he has a great hatred for community centres or\r\n\r\nthat  some  community centres must have  hurt  him\r\n\r\nquite deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not at all.

We are  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition where people are compelled to come to us.\r\n\r\nThere  are alternative airports to which they  can\r\n\r\nfly  if  the other ones are more attractive,  more\r\n\r\nefficient and more convenient. We have a very good\r\n\r\nposition  for  an airport and, other things  being\r\n\r\nequal, we shall probably get the trade but we have\r\n\r\ncompetitors in the business and it is up to us  to\r\n\r\nbe competitive in every way and one aspect is that\r\n\r\nif you are going to attract the type of people who\r\n\r\ntravel by air, you have got to give them the  sort\r\n\r\nof  surroundings that they are used to.

We already  have  in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  different Government  offices  over  a\r\n\r\ndozen canteens which are running; some of them are\r\n\r\nrunning very much in spite of being sited  in  the\r\n\r\nmost unsuitable corners. For example, one is in  a\r\n\r\nbasement  in Fullerton Building and the conditions\r\n\r\nthere  are  such  that the health authorities  are\r\n\r\nlikely to condemn it.

It is a large vote and there is a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  quarters to be modernised,  one  after\r\n\r\nanother. If the hon. Member really wants to have a\r\n\r\nfull  list  of all the various quarters which  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be tackled and how much is going  to  be\r\n\r\nspent on each, I dare say that it could be got out\r\n\r\nbut it would take quite a considerable time and  I\r\n\r\nreally  doubt whether it would profit him or  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to have it. If he wishes it, he can  put  a\r\n\r\nQuestion down and I will, of course, do my best to\r\n\r\nget the figures for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the last item in which he raised a\r\n\r\nquestion  on the New Government Offices,  he  will\r\n\r\nsee, from the Explanatory Notes at the back of the\r\n\r\nEstimates, that the present intention  is  to  use\r\n\r\nCrown  land which is available on Shenton Way  and\r\n\r\nto  put up a building in conformity with the  type\r\n\r\nof building which is required on Shenton Way. This\r\n\r\nsum  voted is by no means based on firm plans but,\r\n\r\nat  the moment, we do know that we require a great\r\n\r\ndeal of new office accommodation and attention has\r\n\r\nalready  been drawn in this House to the state  of\r\n\r\nthe office accommodation of, I think, the Registry\r\n\r\nof  Marriages.  There has been  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\npressure  in  this House that the Assembly  should\r\n\r\nhave more elbow-room in this present building  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  number  of offices  which  must  be\r\n\r\nnotorious to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House for being quite inadequate\r\n\r\nto  modern conditions.

This\r\n\r\nestimate is only a round figure at this stage  but\r\n\r\nthe intention is to put up a fine office block  on\r\n\r\nShenton  Way  and  that is  how  the  estimate  is\r\n\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, am I to understand from\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Secretary that if this building\r\n\r\nwere not put up on Shenton Way to conform with the\r\n\r\nstandard required in that area, the building could\r\n\r\nthen be brought in more cheaply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No, Sir.

It is obviously necessary that a  big\r\n\r\noffice building should be centred in the heart  of\r\n\r\nthe  City where it can do its business and  while,\r\n\r\nof  course,  piling costs may be high  in  Shenton\r\n\r\nWay,  if  we  try  to purchase  an  area  of  land\r\n\r\nanywhere in the City to use an alternative site, I\r\n\r\nshould  think that it would come to  at  least  as\r\n\r\nmuch.
