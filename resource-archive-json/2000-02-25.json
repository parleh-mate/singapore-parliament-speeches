TP's  statistics  show\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  an average of six accidents per year  involving\r\n\r\nschool  buses,  which  resulted in  fatal  and  serious  injuries\r\n\r\naffecting  other motorists and pedestrians.  Of the total  number\r\n\r\nof  accidents in the three years, only about 0.1% involved school\r\n\r\nbuses that resulted in fatal and serious injuries.  None of these\r\n\r\naccidents  which  resulted  in  such  injuries  involved   school\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing guidelines under the Road Traffic (Public Service\r\n\r\nVehicles)  Rules require school bus owners to provide  attendants\r\n\r\nof  at  least  16  years  of age when school  buses  carry  small\r\n\r\nchildren  enrolled  in child care centres or  kindergartens.  The\r\n\r\nsame  requirement applies when school buses carry  more  than  30\r\n\r\nolder school children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the requirement for school buses to have a bus\r\n\r\nattendant, the authorities also impose a speed limit of  50  km/h\r\n\r\nfor such buses.  The drivers will hence have to comply with these\r\n\r\nrequirements  as well as other traffic rules to ensure  the  road\r\n\r\nsafety  of  the  children.  Compelling all  school  buses  to  be\r\n\r\ninstalled  with seat belts will have cost implications  for  both\r\n\r\nthe  bus owners and the parents.

Could he elaborate what  we\r\n\r\ncan  do  more to balance this issue of cost implications and  the\r\n\r\nissue of protection of children as young as 31/2 years old?  What\r\n\r\ncould we do more?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most important\r\n\r\nis the safety record.

But I do agree  with\r\n\r\nthe Member that we can try to do more if we can, and therefore we\r\n\r\ncan  step  up, for instance, the training of the attendants.   We\r\n\r\ncan  consider,  subject  to the discussion  with  bus  operators,\r\n\r\nwhether   they   can   perhaps  implement   more   cost-effective\r\n\r\nprotection, maybe padding and so on.

Credit  card  companies,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  are  not caught by the Official Secrets Act.   What  is\r\n\r\nthere to stop credit card companies, for example, processing data\r\n\r\nof  users  of  credit cards and selling them to  other  companies\r\n\r\ndoing business?  And the second question is: Is it the Ministry's\r\n\r\nview  that the code of practices would be sufficient to  regulate\r\n\r\nthe whole industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, basically, in my reply, I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that there are codes of conduct in the  industry.   In\r\n\r\nthe  survey conducted at the end of last year, we asked  Internet\r\n\r\nusers, who were not transacting on the Net, what were the reasons\r\n\r\nfor  not  going on e-commerce.  In fact, only 6.7% of them  cited\r\n\r\nprivacy as a concern, meaning that for the majority of the  users\r\n\r\nwho  are  not transacting on the Net, the main reason  is  either\r\n\r\nthey  do not find the things they need on the Net, or they prefer\r\n\r\nnot to shop on the Net for whatever reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, over time, we believe that for Internet\r\n\r\nusers,  two  concerns will become more important in  the  future.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the protection of safety of children using the Net  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  privacy.   So the question is:  What  do  we  do  with\r\n\r\nprivacy?   I  understand the Member's point that in the  case  of\r\n\r\ncredit card companies, for example, right now there is nothing to\r\n\r\nstop  them  under the law from doing that.  But the  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether enacting a legislation is the way to go.  At this moment,\r\n\r\ncountries adopt three approaches.  Some countries decide  not  to\r\n\r\ndo  anything.  Other countries enact new legislation.  The  third\r\n\r\ntype goes for industry self-regulation.  In view of the fast pace\r\n\r\nof  change of the Internet world, we believe that at this moment,\r\n\r\nindustry self-regulation is still the best way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause,  on  the one hand, we make sure that the  industry  will\r\n\r\nrespect  the  privacy of the users and yet at the same  time,  we\r\n\r\nallow  the  industry enough room for them to  innovate.

Therefore, on 1st June 1999,  the  Land\r\n\r\nTransport Authority introduced a new procedure to deal  with  ERP\r\n\r\nviolations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative surcharge is levied to recover the\r\n\r\nadministrative costs of processing an ERP violation.  Instead  of\r\n\r\na  composition  fine of $30 (which was introduced in  May  1998),\r\n\r\nmotorists  who  commit  ERP offences  are  requested  to  pay  an\r\n\r\nadministrative surcharge of $10 plus the ERP charges  within  two\r\n\r\nweeks  of  the  violations.  If they fail to do  so,  they  would\r\n\r\nreceive  a Notice of Traffic Offence to compound the offence  for\r\n\r\n$70  payable  within 28 days.  Upon expiry of  this  Notice,  the\r\n\r\nmatter will be referred to the Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two months preceding the introduction of the\r\n\r\nadministrative surcharge (i.e. April and May 1999),  the  average\r\n\r\nnumber of violations per month for no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCashCards  and  CashCards  with insufficient  balance  was  about\r\n\r\n16,000.  The same average after the introduction of the surcharge\r\n\r\nshowed an increase to about 17,300 per month.  The average amount\r\n\r\nof  fines  collected during the corresponding periods  was  about\r\n\r\n$533,000 per month before the introduction of the surcharge,  and\r\n\r\n$288,000 per month after that.

Traffic\r\n\r\nspeeds  on  various  stretches of busy  roads  are  monitored  at\r\n\r\nregular  intervals throughout the day, and adjustments  are  then\r\n\r\nmade to the ERP rates to maintain travel speeds within the ranges\r\n\r\nof  45  to  65 kph for expressways and 20 to 30 kph for  arterial\r\n\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before making any changes to ERP rates, LTA takes into\r\n\r\nconsideration the impact of any changes on a network-wide  basis.\r\n\r\nERP rate changes, if any, are implemented in January, April, July\r\n\r\nand October each year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP was introduced in April 1998. After nearly two years of\r\n\r\noperation,  it is indeed timely for LTA to review and refine  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  rates review.

As these flats were  no\r\n\r\nlonger  needed  for  the various schemes, they  were  offered  to\r\n\r\neligible public applicants.  Executive flats in non-mature\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestates which were not taken up by applicants on the waiting list\r\n\r\nwere also offered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to the offer has been very good. At the close of\r\n\r\napplication  on 4th November 1999, HDB received more than  13,000\r\n\r\napplications,  about  five  times the number  of  flats  offered.\r\n\r\nApplications for flats in the mature estates were about 10  times\r\n\r\nhigher  than  the number of flats offered.  As for the  Executive\r\n\r\nflats in the non-mature estates, applications received were about\r\n\r\n1.5 times the number of flats offered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducted a computer ballot and informed all the\r\n\r\napplicants of their queue positions.  To help first-timers set up\r\n\r\ntheir  homes early, they were accorded priority in the balloting.\r\n\r\nAbout  70% of the applicants shortlisted were first-timers.   The\r\n\r\nselection  exercise for the first batch of shortlisted applicants\r\n\r\ncommenced  on  7th  January this year and was  completed  on  3rd\r\n\r\nFebruary.

In the last few years, it has embarked on the\r\n\r\nSERS  programme  to redevelop the older public  housing  estates.\r\n\r\nThrough this programme, HDB has been able to make better  use  of\r\n\r\nscarce land and build more flats in the mature estates.

Second, what other proposals has\r\n\r\nhis Ministry got to revitalise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nolder estates, like mine and other Parliamentary colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this is exactly what the Ministry is\r\n\r\nembarking upon, to try and revitalise and bring back some of  the\r\n\r\nvibrancy in some of the older estates.  This has got benefits not\r\n\r\njust  to  the new applicants who are interested to come to  these\r\n\r\nestates, particularly those in the city areas, but also those who\r\n\r\nare  currently  living  there, the shopkeepers  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  So we are now looking at the exercise on a systematic\r\n\r\nbasis  to  try  and identify more areas for the  SERS  programme.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have to bear in mind that there is a certain limit to\r\n\r\nthe  number  that  we can do every year, not  least  because  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  the ability to absorb such new flats will  also  be\r\n\r\nlimited.  We have to look for replacement sites for a start.   We\r\n\r\nhave  got  to make sure that replacement sites are sufficient  to\r\n\r\ntake care of the residents who will be relocated and, thereafter,\r\n\r\nwe  can start the programme.  While we want to move as fast as we\r\n\r\ncan,  there  is  a certain limit to how fast we can  move.

But  of\r\n\r\ncourse  that  is  not  the  only way to achieve  that  objective.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  there are already SERS flats in the area  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  earmarked for relocation of  lessees from other  locations.\r\n\r\nAs and when there are surplus flats available in these particular\r\n\r\nlocations,  we  will  look  into  opening  up  these  flats   for\r\n\r\nallocation  to  new applications.  And generally, as  the  Member\r\n\r\nhimself  has  said,  these  flats  are  very  popular  with   new\r\n\r\napplicants,  especially  the younger applicants.   So  with  this\r\n\r\nparticular  programme, we will be able to go  quite  a  long  way\r\n\r\ntowards the revitalisation programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I also would like to mention to the\r\n\r\nMember  that  there  are also other schemes  that  are  currently\r\n\r\navailable  to  these people to encourage them to  move  into  the\r\n\r\nmature  estates,  including  those  involving  the  Member.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the CPF grant scheme actually encourages and facilitates\r\n\r\nthe  movement of younger applicants into this particular  estate.\r\n\r\nWith the CPF grant, if you consider the fact that applicants  who\r\n\r\nwish  to  move  nearer to their parents can apply and  receive  a\r\n\r\ngrant  of  $40,000, I think that is a considerable sum  of  money\r\n\r\nwhich  will help facilitate the movement of these people  to  the\r\n\r\nolder estates.  So one of the ways that the Member can help is to\r\n\r\npublicise such schemes to his constituents or the children of his\r\n\r\nconstituents  and  encourage them  to  come  back  to  the  older\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Can I ask the Minister whether the $40,000 grant\r\n\r\nthat has been given could be reviewed to make it more attractive?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> At the moment, the sense is that the grant\r\n\r\nis sufficiently attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS INVOLVING THE USE OF HANDPHONES AND MUSIC HEADSETS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if\r\n\r\nhe  will give an update on the incidence of traffic accidents  in\r\n\r\n1999 involving the use of handphones and portable music headsets,\r\n\r\nand whether further measures, such as stiffer penalties or public\r\n\r\neducation, will be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

May  I  ask  the  Minister of State,  if  there  are  no\r\n\r\naccidents, why do we have to have these new laws?  Does this seem\r\n\r\nstrange as compared to the safety factor of young children, which\r\n\r\nwe  have just discussed?  In that case, we are also assured  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no safety problem because there is no accident, but  we\r\n\r\ndo not want to legislate on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

But no accident relating\r\n\r\nto  handphone  driving  does not mean handphone  driving  is  not\r\n\r\ndangerous.  When  you  use a handphone, it results  in  dangerous\r\n\r\nbehaviour on the road.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, the Biosafety Protocol, or Cartegena Protocol\r\n\r\non  biosafety,  addresses  the  environmental  concern  over  the\r\n\r\npotential  negative  impact  of  genetically  modified  organisms\r\n\r\n(GMOs)  on biological diversity; and the Protocol prescribes  the\r\n\r\nprocedures  for  the  safe transfer, handling  and  use  of  such\r\n\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol was only concluded on 28th January last month\r\n\r\nin  Montreal  after  many  years of  negotiations.   We  will  be\r\n\r\nstudying  the  Protocol  in detail in  relation  to  its  aim  of\r\n\r\nprotecting  the  environment and its implications  on  trade  and\r\n\r\nrelated  activities  before  we  decide  whether  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nProtocol.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the Cartegena Treaty is very recent. I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the  Senior  Parliamentary Secretary  to  conduct  a\r\n\r\nreview.   Will  the  Ministry  consider  involving  both   public\r\n\r\nofficials  as well as private sector experts, given the  possible\r\n\r\nimpacts on human safety?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The  Protocol deals with very technical  issues  like\r\n\r\nLMOs,  GMOs, things like that, which are over most of our  heads,\r\n\r\nand if the public needs to be involved, we will certainly involve\r\n\r\nthe public.

The system  provides  a  national\r\n\r\nframework  for  the definition, acquisition and certification  of\r\n\r\njob  skills competencies for our workforce.  It will be industry-driven,  accessible to workers through an open entry and  modular\r\n\r\napproach,  and provide for training and acquisition of skills  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  to  establish  skills  progression   for   the\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing clear skills standards will potentially benefit\r\n\r\nmany  workers who are holding skilled or semi-skilled jobs,  such\r\n\r\nas  clerical,  sales and service personnel, production  operators\r\n\r\nand  even  cleaners.  Currently, most of these jobs do  not  have\r\n\r\nclear  competency  standards.   Implementing  a  national  skills\r\n\r\nrecognition system for the workforce is an enormous task.   Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  large numbers involved, we need to cater to  different\r\n\r\nindustries  and  within  industries, different  occupations.   To\r\n\r\nsucceed, a concerted effort involving all key Government agencies\r\n\r\nand industry bodies is needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the system is being piloted in 3 industries - hotel, marine and cleaning. The pilot phase aims to test the\r\n\r\nrobustness  of  the system and fine-tune it for the comprehensive\r\n\r\nlaunch to all industries.  To date, 19 skills standards have been\r\n\r\ndeveloped for the pilot industries.  For the hotel industry,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  standards include servicing guestrooms,  providing\r\n\r\nwestern-style   food  and  beverage  services,   handling   guest\r\n\r\narrivals, processing room reservations and so on.  The assessment\r\n\r\ncentres and training programmes for the pilot industries  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  being established.   Our aim is  to  train  and\r\n\r\ncertify 3,000 workers in these three pilot industries.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  to  extend the National Skills Recognition System to  other\r\n\r\nindustries by the second quarter of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, what are the other\r\n\r\nindustries which the Ministry has in mind  that their skills  can\r\n\r\nbe certified in the next 1-2 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, our intention, eventually, is to\r\n\r\ncover all the industries, but we want to do it in stages.   As  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  in  my  main answer, the National Skills  Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem  will only work if it is a collaborative and joint effort.\r\n\r\nIt  cannot  work  just  purely as a Government  initiative.   The\r\n\r\nindustries themselves have to come together and agree  that  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  have  formal standards for skill competencies  for  all\r\n\r\ntheir  workers in the various occupations.

With  a  highly\r\n\r\nuncertain  outlook,  we braced ourselves  for  a  difficult  year\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, 1999 was a year of remarkable economic\r\n\r\nturnaround.  After a modest 0.8% growth in the first quarter, the\r\n\r\neconomy  rebounded strongly for 3 consecutive quarters, recording\r\n\r\na  high of 7.1% growth in the last quarter.  For the whole  year,\r\n\r\nwe  enjoyed a respectable 5.4% growth.  The Asian economic crisis\r\n\r\nis largely behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's V-shaped recovery benefited first from the\r\n\r\nstrong  upturn  in  global electronics.   In  particular,  global\r\n\r\nsemiconductor  sales rebounded by a robust  17%  in  1999,  after\r\n\r\nhaving  contracted  8.4%  a year ago.   This  surge  in  external\r\n\r\nelectronics demand provided a fillip to our manufacturing sector,\r\n\r\nand contributed to its stellar 14% growth last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second boost to our recovery came from the concurrent\r\n\r\nturnaround in the regional economies.  Buoyed too by the  rebound\r\n\r\nin  global electronics demand and stabilised regional currencies,\r\n\r\nmost  Asian  economies returned to positive growth by the  second\r\n\r\nquarter  of  1999.   This boosted intra-Asian trade  and  further\r\n\r\nfuelled Singapore's growth, as intra-regional trade accounted for\r\n\r\nabout  half  of our total trade.  Region-dependent services  like\r\n\r\ntourism also benefited from the 14% surge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin visitor arrivals last year from our key Asian markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One critical factor which enabled Singapore to seize the\r\n\r\nopportunities  presented by the rising external  demand  was  our\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  cost  competitiveness.  In  particular,  the  10\r\n\r\npercentage point cut in employers' CPF contribution rate and  the\r\n\r\nwage  restraint  last year made a significant  difference.   They\r\n\r\nhelped  to lower the unit labour cost of the economy by  10%  and\r\n\r\nthe  unit  business cost of our manufacturing sector by 12%  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the strong external demand, domestic demand\r\n\r\ngradually recovered, helped by 2 main factors.  First, job losses\r\n\r\nmoderated. Last year, the total number of retrenched workers fell\r\n\r\nto 14,600, about half that in 1998.  In fact, many companies have\r\n\r\nbegun  to  rehire  by  third quarter 1999  as  employment  levels\r\n\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, asset prices recovered strongly. The stock market,\r\n\r\nin  particular, saw strong rallies.  The Straits Times Index  set\r\n\r\n11  record  highs  last year and ended 1999 78% higher  than  the\r\n\r\nstart  of the year.  The property market also firmed, with prices\r\n\r\nclimbing by 28%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, increased job security and the wealth effect\r\n\r\nin  the  asset  markets renewed consumer confidence  and  boosted\r\n\r\nprivate  consumption  spending by  6.2%  last  year.   Against  a\r\n\r\nhealthier backdrop of aggregate demand, the Consumer Price  Index\r\n\r\nrose marginally by 0.4%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the economy has largely turned around, not every\r\n\r\nsector  has  recovered.   The  construction  sector  remained  in\r\n\r\nrecession;  it contracted a severe 12% last year, compared  to  a\r\n\r\ngrowth of 4.4% in 1998.  Due to the oversupply in residential and\r\n\r\noffice  properties, contracts awarded had continued  to  decline.\r\n\r\nDragged down by weak commercial lending and poor regional  demand\r\n\r\nfor  funds, growth in the financial services sector was flat last\r\n\r\nyear.  Growth in the business services sector was also feeble, at\r\n\r\nonly 0.1% due to poor real estate earnings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>OUTLOOK FOR 2000</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But overall, the prospects for this year are bright. We can\r\n\r\nexpect  the  pockets of weaknesses in the economy to  improve  as\r\n\r\ngrowth  momentum  picks  up.  We can  be  confident  because  the\r\n\r\nexternal environment looks favourable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the strength of the global electronics demand remains\r\n\r\nfirm.  According to industry forecasts, world-wide semiconductors\r\n\r\nand  PC  sales  are expected to grow by 20% and 15%  respectively\r\n\r\nover the next 2 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the recovery of the Asian economies is likely to be\r\n\r\nsustainable.  Regional monetary and fiscal policies are  expected\r\n\r\nto  remain accommodative, which will fuel growth ahead.  So  far,\r\n\r\nrecovery has been concentrated mainly on exports and consumption,\r\n\r\nwhich will continue to strengthen on the back of healthy external\r\n\r\ndemand  and better job prospects. In addition, investment  demand\r\n\r\nhas  also  shown  glimpses of improvement after  having  remained\r\n\r\nnegative   for  most  regional  economies  last  year.   Already,\r\n\r\ncapacity   utilisation,  capital  imports  and   foreign   direct\r\n\r\ninvestment applications have picked up across Asia, although  the\r\n\r\npace differs across economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a benign external environment, our Composite Leading\r\n\r\nIndex  (CLI), which leads economic growth by about 9 months,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  rising  over  the last 6 quarters.  Trade prospects  remain\r\n\r\nvery  positive  as non-oil retained imports, a leading  indicator\r\n\r\nfor  future exports, continues its double-digit growth.  Consumer\r\n\r\nsentiments  have also turned visibly upbeat. Retail sales  growth\r\n\r\nis  up,  as consumers increase their spending in anticipation  of\r\n\r\nbetter pay increases and a partial restoration in employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this favourable outlook for 2000 is conditional on\r\n\r\na  soft landing in the United States and a sustained recovery  in\r\n\r\nJapan  and Europe.  In particular, the risk of a sharp correction\r\n\r\nin Wall Street triggering a reverse wealth effect and causing a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarked   slowdown  of  the  US  economy,  cannot  be  discounted.\r\n\r\nMacroeconomic imbalances in the US economy, such as the  widening\r\n\r\ncurrent  account deficit, the falling personal savings rate,  and\r\n\r\nthe  rising  corporate leverage, are not sustainable  at  current\r\n\r\nrates and will need to be corrected at some point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, while recovery is slowly taking shape, its economy\r\n\r\nis   not  yet  out  of  the  woods.   Recovery  continues  to  be\r\n\r\nunderpinned  by  fiscal  stimulus  as  consumption  and   private\r\n\r\ninvestments  are  likely to remain fragile  due  to  the  ongoing\r\n\r\ncorporate restructuring process.  The pace of recovery is further\r\n\r\ncomplicated by the prospect of a rising Yen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the region, the main concern is whether the crisis-hit countries can sustain investor confidence by making progress\r\n\r\nin  financial  and  corporate restructuring.   In  addition,  the\r\n\r\npolitical  stability  of  Indonesia remains  a  key  uncertainty.\r\n\r\nFlash  points  have again erupted in various parts of  Indonesia:\r\n\r\ncommunal  clashes in Maluku, Lombok, Ambon, and even Bintan,  and\r\n\r\nsecessionist movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are more reasons to be optimistic, than\r\n\r\nto  be  pessimistic  about our growth prospects  for  2000.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Trade and Industry (MTI) is maintaining its forecast\r\n\r\nof  4.5  to  6.5%  for this year.  The lower  end  of  the  range\r\n\r\nreflects  the  potential risks in the external environment.   But\r\n\r\nthe upside for the economy appears bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Competing In The New Millennium</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Asian economic crisis was brief, it has left a\r\n\r\ntrail  of destruction in its wake, and brought great hardship  to\r\n\r\nmany  regional  economies.  The cost  has  been  exacting.   Some\r\n\r\ngovernments  were  toppled.   Great  fortunes  were  lost.   Many\r\n\r\ncompanies  went  under; millions of livelihoods  were  destroyed.\r\n\r\nSeveral regional countries have had to take on large public debts\r\n\r\nto restart their economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Singapore has weathered the regional crisis\r\n\r\nwell  and  emerged largely unscathed.  There were  no  widespread\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  bankruptcy, social dislocations  or  political\r\n\r\nupheavals.  Strong economic fundamentals underpinned by years  of\r\n\r\nconsistent and rational policies have ensured this.  For example,\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  prudent  supervision of  our  banks  and  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  our financial system was never in  distress.   Our\r\n\r\nbanking  sector's non-performing loans constituted less than  10%\r\n\r\nof  total loans at its peak, compared to 80% in Indonesia, 48% in\r\n\r\nThailand  and  15%  in Malaysia.  Because  we  did  not  have  to\r\n\r\nrecapitalise  our  banks, our fiscal health has remained  intact.\r\n\r\nWe  have  avoided  the sharp rise in public  debts  seen  in  the\r\n\r\nregional economies  -  to as much as 100% of GDP in the  case  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia   -   and  the ensuing heavy debt servicing  burden  in\r\n\r\nfuture years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have successfully ridden out the Asia economic storm with\r\n\r\nthe  economy  remaining in shipshape.  Our  strong  recovery  has\r\n\r\nenabled us to start the new millennium on a firm footing, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  every  reason to look ahead with optimism  and  confidence.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not mean we can afford to slacken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitiveness will remain the prime economic challenge for\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  new  millennium.  In fact,  competition  will\r\n\r\nbecome  increasingly  intense  as  more  countries  join  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic race.  More importantly, globalisation and the onslaught\r\n\r\nof  technological advancement will quicken the competition  tempo\r\n\r\nfurther. It used to take several months for a new product in  one\r\n\r\nmarket to reach another part of the globe.  Today, virtually  any\r\n\r\ngood  and  service can be bought and sold anywhere in  the  world\r\n\r\nwith the click of a mouse.  The Internet has dramatically reduced\r\n\r\nthe geographical barriers to economic competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twin forces of IT and globalisation have prompted a wave\r\n\r\nof  alliances,  mergers  and acquisitions  around  the  world  as\r\n\r\ncompanies consolidate to gain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket   share  and  critical  mass  in  preparation  of  tougher\r\n\r\ncompetition  ahead.  Last year, the value of  mergers  in  Europe\r\n\r\nsurged  50% to US$1.2 trillion, while that in the US has remained\r\n\r\nhigh at US$1.6 trillion for the last 2 years.  These mergers  cut\r\n\r\nacross  a spectrum of industries, from traditional ones like  oil\r\n\r\nand  automobile, to New Economy ones like info-communications and\r\n\r\nbanking.   In  recent months, we have witnessed  mega-mergers  of\r\n\r\ngiant  corporations  such  as  Mobil  and  Exxon,  Vodafone   and\r\n\r\nMannesman,  and  AOL and Time Warner.  The new  AOL  Time  Warner\r\n\r\nconglomerate, for instance, has a market capitalisation of  about\r\n\r\nUS$360 billion, almost 4 times Singapore's GDP.  Not only are the\r\n\r\ndeals  getting  bigger, the tie-ups are also increasingly  cross-border,  as globalisation of the market place gathers pace.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  spurred  partly by the Euro, 60% of  Europe's  mergers\r\n\r\nlast  year crossed national boundaries.  [Estimate by JP  Morgan.\r\n\r\nBusiness Week 24 Jan 2000].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale and quality of competition have thus risen to a\r\n\r\nwhole new dimension.  In this new competitive landscape, it is no\r\n\r\nlonger viable for economies and businesses to think and act  only\r\n\r\non a national basis.  We need to adopt a global mindset, innovate\r\n\r\nand advance with global trends, or risk being rendered redundant.\r\n\r\nUnless  we  are among the world's best, we will be  relegated  to\r\n\r\nplaying a peripheral role in the global economy.  To thrive,  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses  need to adopt a global outlook, and boldly  seek  out\r\n\r\nnew  markets and alliances for expansion.  Already we are  seeing\r\n\r\nsigns  of this happening. SIA has recently acquired 49% of Virgin\r\n\r\nAirways,  DBS  is  expanding its regional  presence  through  its\r\n\r\nstakes  in  Thai  Danu Bank and Hong Kong's Kwong  On  Bank,  and\r\n\r\nSingTel  is  engaging in merger talks with Cable & Wireless  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  Telecom.  To  be  successful  in  global  competition,  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  will also need to draw in top talent - not  only  from\r\n\r\nSingapore, but from the world.  Only then can we over time  build\r\n\r\nup a stable of our own world class transnational companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In post-crisis Asia, one economy that will bring profound\r\n\r\nchanges to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetitive  equation  is  China.  Even without  WTO  membership,\r\n\r\nChina  has been attracting more foreign direct investments  (FDI)\r\n\r\nthan the rest of Asia combined.  With its impending WTO accession\r\n\r\nand the ongoing reforms of its state-owned enterprises, China can\r\n\r\nbe  expected to become even more competitive both as an  exporter\r\n\r\nas  well as FDI destinations.  [Goldman Sachs estimated that  FDI\r\n\r\ninto China would rise to US$100 billion a year over the next five\r\n\r\nyears  as  a  result of its WTO entry.  Wu, Fred WTO  Membership:\r\n\r\nWhat This Means for  China, Goldman Sachs, Apr 99.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, China's exports are no longer confined to low\r\n\r\nvalue-added  or  labour-intensive products.   Increasingly,  they\r\n\r\nwill  move  towards  more  sophisticated and  higher  value-added\r\n\r\nproducts in direct competition with the NIEs.  China has  already\r\n\r\nmade  impressive inroads in the electronics industry.   In  1996,\r\n\r\nChina's share of the US and Japan electronics market was only  6%\r\n\r\nand  7%  respectively.  These shares have now increased to around\r\n\r\n10%,  comparable  to that of Taiwan and South Korea,  and  higher\r\n\r\nthan most of the ASEAN countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But China's rise is not all negative for the other Asian\r\n\r\neconomies.  Global trade is never a zero-sum game.  China's  rise\r\n\r\noffers  tremendous opportunities for all.  For example, with  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  China's tariff regime,  ASEAN  economies  can\r\n\r\nfunction more effectively as production bases and export gateways\r\n\r\nto   China's  markets.   The  key  challenge  for  the   regional\r\n\r\ncountries,  including Singapore, is to devise ways to  complement\r\n\r\ninvestments and growth in China, to ride on the rise of China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, China will not be the only source of\r\n\r\ncompetitive  threat  to  Asian economies.   Outside  Asia,  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica  and Eastern Europe have similarly geared up for the  new\r\n\r\ncompetitive challenges.  Argentina, for example, has seen a four-fold  increase  in  its GDP in the last decade  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\neconomic  reforms.  The transitional economies in Eastern  Europe\r\n\r\nare  estimated  to  triple in size in the next  decade,  if  they\r\n\r\ncontinue with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivatisation,  enterprise restructuring and other  institutional\r\n\r\nreforms.  [Estimates by the European Bank for Reconstruction  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment.   'Eastern Europe - Transitional  Economies'  Output\r\n\r\nMay Triple, July 1999, Reuters.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the developed economies are not resting on\r\n\r\ntheir  laurels.   They  too are strengthening  their  competitive\r\n\r\nlead.  Japan is embarking on fundamental reforms to its  economic\r\n\r\nstructure and banking sector.  The US is in the throes of its New\r\n\r\nEconomy powered by innovations and technological start-ups.   The\r\n\r\nEU countries are reforming their tax systems and trying to inject\r\n\r\nmore dynamism and flexibility into their economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be a grave mistake to think that it is\r\n\r\nbusiness as usual in the post-Asian-crisis world economy.   Rapid\r\n\r\ntechnological   change   and   globalisation   are   intensifying\r\n\r\ncompetition and posing new challenges for our economy.  To thrive\r\n\r\nin  the  new millennium, we need to sharpen our competitive  edge\r\n\r\nfurther, stay nimble, and constantly reinvent ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implementing Long-term Economic Strategies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet these competitive challenges, the Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Competitiveness (CSC) has mapped out a comprehensive\r\n\r\nset of long term economic strategies.  These strategies have been\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the  Government  as  the  blueprint  for  developing\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  an advanced and globally competitive  knowledge-based  economy  within this decade.  The Government  is  actively\r\n\r\npursuing  these strategies, which address both the  hardware  and\r\n\r\nsoftware aspects of our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hardware, Singapore already has a competitive edge. We\r\n\r\nhave   invested  heavily  in  many  key  economic  and   business\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and international surveys have consistently ranked\r\n\r\nus  highly on infrastructure, citing our world-class sea and  air\r\n\r\nports, modern telecommunications facilities, and advanced IT\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   Private  sector  investments  have  also   been\r\n\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some observers and analysts have commented that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  over-invested and become inefficient in our use of  capital.\r\n\r\nMTI has studied this in detail and has found that this is untrue.\r\n\r\nExcept  for the period in mid-80s, our investment rates  are  not\r\n\r\ndisproportionately high compared to the regional  countries.   In\r\n\r\naddition, trends in our Incremental Capital Output Ratio  (ICOR),\r\n\r\na  measure of the additional unit of capital required to  produce\r\n\r\neach  additional unit of output, also show that we have not  been\r\n\r\nusing  capital inefficiently.  MTI will be releasing  details  of\r\n\r\nits findings in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical infrastructure, however, can be easily replicated.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, latecomers can often leapfrog ahead using state-of-the-art  technology.  The challenge is for Singapore to differentiate\r\n\r\nourselves  by  finding  creative  ways  to  add  value   to   our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Island project is one such example. Amalgamated\r\n\r\nfrom  7  offshore islands, Jurong Island aims to become a  world-class  integrated  chemical hub, the first of  its  kind  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  Through clustering and the sharing of common facilities,\r\n\r\nit  will generate significant synergistic linkages across a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum of petrochemical industries.  For example, the provision\r\n\r\nof  centralised logistics and common corridors for material flows\r\n\r\nwill  significantly reduce feedstock transportation and  handling\r\n\r\ncost.   With  the recent launch of the JurongIsland.com  internet\r\n\r\nportal, companies on the island can now be easily linked up  with\r\n\r\none  another on the island, and with Government agencies  on  the\r\n\r\nmainland.  When the masterplan to dot-com Jurong Island is  fully\r\n\r\ncompleted,  companies on Jurong Island will be  able  to  conduct\r\n\r\nbusiness electronically and reduce product cycle time and  costs.\r\n\r\nJurong Island will truly be an intelligent island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the software aspect of our competitiveness, the quality\r\n\r\nof our people will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkey.  The New Economy is about exploiting knowledge as the source\r\n\r\nof  competitive advantage.  As a small country, every Singaporean\r\n\r\nmatters.   The  key is for everyone to consciously improve  their\r\n\r\nskills and look for new ways to do the job better.  The more well\r\n\r\ntrained and educated our workforce, the better our chances are in\r\n\r\nachieving this goal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 65% of our yearly cohort of students enter\r\n\r\nuniversities and polytechnics - a First World standard.  However,\r\n\r\nif we look at the total stock of our workforce, less than half of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  above  the  age of 40  have  secondary  and  higher\r\n\r\neducation.  We need to level up this group of workers,  numbering\r\n\r\nsome  834,000  or  42  % of our workforce, through  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining  to  help  them cope with  the  new  economy.   A  key\r\n\r\npriority  of the Government will therefore be manpower  training.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Manpower will press  ahead  with  its  various\r\n\r\ninitiatives under the Manpower 21 programme to upgrade the  skill\r\n\r\nlevel of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, training our indigenous workforce alone will not be\r\n\r\nenough.   Even  with  a  highly  educated  workforce,  our  small\r\n\r\npopulation  size  would limit the talent pool in  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  augment  both the quantity  and  quality  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce  by  actively  attracting  foreign  talent.    In   the\r\n\r\nknowledge  age, top talents make a big difference and  contribute\r\n\r\ndisproportionately to the economy.  With a larger pool of talent,\r\n\r\nwe  can  enlarge  our economic pie, create more  jobs  and  bring\r\n\r\nhigher wages for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important software aspect of competitiveness is the\r\n\r\nability  of  the  economy to leverage on science, technology  and\r\n\r\ninnovation  to keep pace with the global economy.  The Government\r\n\r\nwill   continue   to  build  up  our  research  and   development\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   At  the  same time, we will  create  a  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  grow and develop a strong pool of  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nwho   can  combine  technology  and  business  acumen  under  the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21 programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing and Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key development strategy is to make manufacturing and\r\n\r\nservices  the  twin pillars of our economy.  We  already  have  a\r\n\r\nstrong manufacturing sector, which has been the key locomotive of\r\n\r\ngrowth.  EDB's Industry 21 Blueprint aims to further enhance  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  capabilities, and diversify among and  within  our\r\n\r\nexisting key manufacturing clusters of electronics, chemicals and\r\n\r\nengineering.    This  will  maximise  growth   opportunities   by\r\n\r\nleveraging  on all possible linkages and complementarities  among\r\n\r\nthe clusters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the EDB is continuously looking into the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  new,  high  growth  emerging  industries.   Life\r\n\r\nsciences  is one such example.  Analysts have predicted that  the\r\n\r\n21st  century will belong to biotechnology.  With our established\r\n\r\ncluster  of  leading companies in pharmaceuticals,  biotechnology\r\n\r\nand  agri-biotechnology, coupled with our world-class  healthcare\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  institutions, Singapore is  well  positioned  to\r\n\r\nbecome a major player in the life sciences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our manufacturing sector is globally competitive, the\r\n\r\nsame  cannot be said of our services sector.  One reason is  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  been slow in opening up our services sector to  foreign\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity of our services sector has been\r\n\r\nsignificantly  weaker than manufacturing.  The gap  has  actually\r\n\r\nwidened  over  the years. Between 1985-1992, the  average  annual\r\n\r\nproductivity  growth in the services sector  was  0.4  percentage\r\n\r\npoint  below manufacturing.  In 1992-1999, this gap has increased\r\n\r\nto 4.7 percentage points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new economy, services will play an increasingly\r\n\r\nimportant  role.  Goods will increasingly have a  higher  service\r\n\r\ncontent,  as  more  goods are bundled with services  to  form  an\r\n\r\nintegrated product package.  In any case, the line between  goods\r\n\r\nand  services is blurring.  The logistics industry, for instance,\r\n\r\nhas evolved from just providing transportation and warehousing to\r\n\r\ndelivering value-added services in supply chain management.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, technology will render more services\r\n\r\ntradable.  The Internet is accelerating this trend.  Even  highly\r\n\r\npersonalised services like education and healthcare  can  now  be\r\n\r\noffered  over the Internet to people located thousands  of  miles\r\n\r\naway.  Natural monopolies in certain service industries will also\r\n\r\nbecome  increasingly  threatened.   For  example,  mobile   phone\r\n\r\nservice  providers  can  now  effectively  challenge  fixed  line\r\n\r\noperators  in  the telecommunications field.  The implication  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  services sector in every country will increasingly  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  global  rather  than domestic,  or  even  regional\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA, PSA and Changi Airport are fine examples of our service\r\n\r\ncompanies which are globally competitive.  They competed globally\r\n\r\nfrom  day  one  and  showed that we can  be  world-class.   Their\r\n\r\nsuccess  gives  us  confidence that the way  forward  is  not  to\r\n\r\nconfine our services sectors to mere domestic market or to shield\r\n\r\nthem  from  foreign competition.  The way forward is  to  subject\r\n\r\nthem to global competition, as we have done for manufacturing for\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deregulation of the Services Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has led the way in opening up the financial services\r\n\r\nsector.   Financial markets are now more globalised due to  lower\r\n\r\ntransaction    barriers   across   economies    and    world-wide\r\n\r\nderegulation.   Rapid advancements in financial and informational\r\n\r\ntechnology are creating new and sophisticated financial products.\r\n\r\nThe demarcations between financial products are blurring, and the\r\n\r\nInternet  has  opened up new service delivery possibilities.   To\r\n\r\nretain  our  role  as a key financial centre in  Asia,  Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds  to  attract and develop new growth activities and  players\r\n\r\ninto  the  market.   MAS  has therefore  embarked  on  regulatory\r\n\r\nreforms  in banking, fund management, debt and equity markets  so\r\n\r\nas to promote a more flexible and conducive environment for these\r\n\r\nfinancial activities to thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the IDA brought forward the introduction of\r\n\r\nfull market competition in the telecommunications sector by 2\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  starting from 1 April 2000.  Direct and indirect  foreign\r\n\r\nequity limits for all public telecommunications services licences\r\n\r\nwere  also lifted.  The decision to accelerate the liberalisation\r\n\r\nschedule was not an easy one, in view of our earlier commitments.\r\n\r\nBut  it  was a necessary and right decision.  With the rapid  and\r\n\r\ndramatic  changes in the telecommunications industry  world-wide,\r\n\r\nthe  original  liberalisation schedule  would  have  stunted  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  our telecommunications sector and severely undermined\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness.  It would have also  set  us  back  in  our\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  develop  a strong and vibrant  info-communications\r\n\r\nindustry, which depends on globally competitive telecommunication\r\n\r\nrates  and services.  By opening up the telecommunications sector\r\n\r\nsooner,  we stand a better chance of attracting the major players\r\n\r\nand realising our aim to be an info-communications hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deregulation of the Power Industry</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is another critical sector where we need to be\r\n\r\nglobally  competitive. It is a key component of  business  costs.\r\n\r\nWe  started to deregulate the sector in 1995 when we corporatised\r\n\r\nthe  electricity and gas operations of the Public Utilities Board\r\n\r\n(PUB)  to  form  Singapore Power Ltd. Since then, we  have  taken\r\n\r\nsystematic steps to prepare for further deregulation.  Within the\r\n\r\nnext  2  years, we plan to open up the contestable parts  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  sector fully and also introduce competition  in  the\r\n\r\nnatural gas industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our deregulation efforts, we hope to ensure long-term efficiency in our power industry and achieve more\r\n\r\ncompetitive   electricity  tariffs   for   our   businesses   and\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  Liberalisation also brings many other  benefits  for\r\n\r\nall  consumers, including better service quality, greater product\r\n\r\ninnovation and more choice of suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can achieve a systematic deregulation process in our\r\n\r\nservices sector, it can bring substantial spin-offs for the  rest\r\n\r\nof the economy. It will further enhance the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nglobal  competitiveness of our manufacturing  sector.   Harnessed\r\n\r\nproperly,  the forces of deregulation can strengthen  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the new economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore enters the new millennium on a cheerful note. The\r\n\r\nglobal  economic  environment  is favourable.   Our  capacity  to\r\n\r\ncompete  globally  is  strong.  We should  return  to  pre-crisis\r\n\r\ngrowth soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, sustained growth in the long term cannot be taken\r\n\r\nfor granted and will not come effortlessly.  The economic contest\r\n\r\nhas  become  more  intense with globalisation  and  as  countries\r\n\r\nworldwide  enhance their competitiveness.  The Singapore  economy\r\n\r\nwill  need to be responsive to these global developments and stay\r\n\r\nrelevant and competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from improving our physical infrastructure, and\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to  upgrade our people, there is a  need  to  further\r\n\r\nderegulate  our  services  sector.   Many  of  our  services  are\r\n\r\nperforming  below  their potential. The problem  is  insufficient\r\n\r\nindustry competition.  Singapore as an economy cannot hope to  be\r\n\r\nglobally  competitive, if our services sector  is  a  laggard  at\r\n\r\nhome.   The  Government will step up its deregulation efforts  to\r\n\r\nbring our services sector and the economy to new heights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>II  THE FY2000 BUDGET</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to the Budget for Fiscal\r\n\r\nYear 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FY99 BUDGET OUTTURN</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I highlight the salient features of this year's\r\n\r\nexpenditure  budget,  I would first like to  recap  on  the  FY99\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FY99 Budget was worked out based on the circumstances as\r\n\r\nat end 1998 and beginning 1999.  Then, we were in the midst of  a\r\n\r\nrecession  and were expecting negative growth for the year  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  With operating revenue estimated at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$24.1  billion  and a planned expenditure of $29.2  billion,  the\r\n\r\noutcome  would  be  a budget deficit of $5.1 billion.   Operating\r\n\r\nrevenue had been estimated on the basis of falling revenue  while\r\n\r\nexpenditure was planned on greatly increased Government spending,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  development spending,  to  help  stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, events turned out quite differently as the\r\n\r\neconomy  rebounded strongly after the first quarter of  1999  and\r\n\r\ngrowth  in 1999 turned out to be a respectable 5.4%.  The  strong\r\n\r\nrebound  is  expected to raise operating revenue  by  about  $4.8\r\n\r\nbillion.   The  increase has come mainly from  stronger  COE  and\r\n\r\nincome tax collections.  On the other hand, total expenditure  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to be some $3.4 billion less, mainly because  of  lower\r\n\r\ndevelopment  spending.  This was because strong  competition  for\r\n\r\nprojects  forced bid prices down, and because some lower priority\r\n\r\nprojects were rescheduled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined impact of higher revenue collection and lower\r\n\r\nexpenditure is that instead of a large budget deficit of some  $5\r\n\r\nbillion, a surplus of $3.2 billion is expected in FY99.   With  a\r\n\r\nbudget surplus now expected, the Government will within FY99 make\r\n\r\na  $100  million contribution to Medifund, to bring  Government's\r\n\r\ntotal contribution in the Fund to $700 million.  In addition, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  also make a $200 million  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nElderCare Fund approved by Parliament on 22nd February 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While transfers to Medifund and the ElderCare Fund are ways\r\n\r\nto  share the surplus, they benefit Singaporeans indirectly.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment appreciates that workers had accepted the CPF and wage\r\n\r\ncuts as part of the package to deal with the recession.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF cut can only be restored gradually so as not to increase\r\n\r\nbusiness costs abruptly, thereby stalling economic recovery.   As\r\n\r\nan additional gesture, the Government will make a special CPF top-up  of  $250  to  the Ordinary Account of every  Singaporean  CPF\r\n\r\nmember aged 21 years and above on 31 December 1999, who had  made\r\n\r\nat least one CPF contribution within the period 1 January 1998 to\r\n\r\n<br><br>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than 1.5 million Singaporeans are expected to benefit.   The\r\n\r\ntop-up  will be credited in March 2000.  Details will be released\r\n\r\nseparately  by  the CPF Board.  This top-up will amount  to  $385\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROJECTED FY2000 FISCAL POSITION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue for FY2000 is estimated at $31.4 billion,\r\n\r\nan  increase  of  8.6% over FY99.  As a percentage  of  GDP,  the\r\n\r\nincrease is from 18.8% in FY99 to 19.0% in FY2000.  The  rise  in\r\n\r\nrevenue  collection  is mainly due to the  good  economic  growth\r\n\r\nforecast  for  2000.  With total FY2000 expenditure  budgeted  at\r\n\r\n$29.0  billion, a budget surplus of $2.5 billion or 1.5% of  GDP,\r\n\r\nis  projected.  However, the surplus will not be achieved at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  cutting back on essential spending.  In fact,  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure in FY2000 is expected to rise by more than 12%,  with\r\n\r\na substantial increase of 21% in development spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are thus back in the happy position of being able to add\r\n\r\nto  our reserves, whilst continuing to invest in and upgrade  our\r\n\r\neconomic  infrastructure  and human resource  capabilities.   The\r\n\r\neconomic crisis has however amply demonstrated the importance  of\r\n\r\nliving  within  our  means  and the  need  to  accumulate  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses in good years so as to have the resources to deal  with\r\n\r\neconomic downturns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the salient features of the FY2000\r\n\r\nexpenditure budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FY2000 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Government expenditure for FY2000 is estimated at\r\n\r\n$29.0  billion or 17.5% of GDP, a rise of 12.5% over  expenditure\r\n\r\nin  FY99.  Development expenditure is projected to grow 21.1%  to\r\n\r\nreach  $12.9 billion.  Operating expenditure, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nis  estimated  to increase by 6.4% to $16.1 billion,  a  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease  that  is lower than the nominal GDP growth  rate.   The\r\n\r\nlower  rate of increase of operating expenditure, as compared  to\r\n\r\nthat   for   development  expenditure,  underlines   Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  keep recurrent cost increases within  sustainable\r\n\r\nlimits.  Operating and development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpenditure account for 9.7% and 7.8% of GDP respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Operating Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure in FY2000 is estimated at $16.1\r\n\r\nbillion or 9.7% of GDP, an increase of $969 million or 6.4%  over\r\n\r\nFY99.    92% of operating expenditure is for ministries'  running\r\n\r\ncosts  while the remaining 8% is for transfer payments to members\r\n\r\nof the public and outside organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total running costs are projected to increase by 6.9% to\r\n\r\n$14.8  billion  because of higher manpower  costs,  increases  in\r\n\r\nother  operating expenditure, and larger grants to the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.   Expenditure on Transfers is estimated at $1.3  billion,\r\n\r\nthe  main  items being subventions to the restructured  hospitals\r\n\r\nand town councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower expenses are estimated at $3.3 billion, an increase\r\n\r\nof  $323 million or 10.8%.  The increase is due to restoration of\r\n\r\nthe  salary cut imposed service-wide in 1999, partial restoration\r\n\r\nin  employers'  rate  of  CPF  contributions  and  normal  salary\r\n\r\nincrements.

The bulk of the subsidy is for the  HDB\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programmes, development of infrastructure  within  HDB\r\n\r\nNew Towns and financing of HDB's bottom-line deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social & Community Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, as in the past years, the largest share of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  expenditure budget goes to the Social  &  Community\r\n\r\nServices sector.  It accounts for 39.6% of total expenditure.  In\r\n\r\nabsolute  terms, the sector's allocation of $11.5 billion  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease   of  $856  million  over  FY99.   Education,  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  &  Sports,  and  Health  will  all  get  substantial\r\n\r\nincreases in their budget allocations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on educating our young continues to take up the\r\n\r\nlion's share within the Social & Community Services sector,  with\r\n\r\n$6.0 billion or 52% going to MOE.  This represents an increase of\r\n\r\n$881  million or 17% compared to FY99.  Within MOE,  the  General\r\n\r\nEducation  Programme  undertaken by the  Government,  Government-aided,  special  education and independent schools  accounts  for\r\n\r\n$3.1  billion or 53% of its total budget.

Our\r\n\r\nintention is to keep the central administration lean, and let the\r\n\r\noperational ministries have the bulk of the resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINANCIAL REFORM  -  RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the economic crisis has passed and our economy is\r\n\r\nnow  back on track, the budgetary positions in the years to  come\r\n\r\nare  expected  to remain tight.  There are two main  reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis.   First, as the Singapore economy matures, economic  growth\r\n\r\nwill  slow  down and revenue growth will also moderate.   Second,\r\n\r\nwith  increasing  globalisation and the  lowering  of  investment\r\n\r\nbarriers,  competition for high value-added  economic  activities\r\n\r\nwill become keener.  This means that as we lower our tax rates to\r\n\r\nkeep  our tax system competitive, there will be downward pressure\r\n\r\non revenue.  The combined impact of these developments is that we\r\n\r\ncan expect operating revenue growth to slow down over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with rising affluence, the public will\r\n\r\ndemand  more  and  better services.  However,  as  the  budgetary\r\n\r\noutlook  is expected to be tight, ministries can only meet  these\r\n\r\nincreasingly  sophisticated expectations through  more  effective\r\n\r\nuse  of existing resources rather than through the employment  of\r\n\r\nmore resources.  In other words, officers in the ministries would\r\n\r\nhave to be managers rather than just staff officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the budgeting angle, the system in the past has been\r\n\r\none  based  on giving more resources on the promise of  increased\r\n\r\noutput.   However, this has the tendency to get MOF  involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  micro-management of the ministries.  The budgeting  paradigm\r\n\r\nhas  since  been shifted to one of encouraging the ministries  to\r\n\r\nget  the  most  out  of  their allotted resources.   Within  that\r\n\r\nbudgeting  framework,  ministries  are  assured  of  a   built-in\r\n\r\nincrease  for  their base budget which is dependent  on  the  GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate.   Any increase in budgetary provision  beyond  that\r\n\r\nwould  have to be justified on the basis of the priority of their\r\n\r\nprogrammes against others.  In tandem with this, ministries  have\r\n\r\nalso  been  moved to looking at the desired outcomes  that  their\r\n\r\nprogrammes are intended to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieve rather than just looking at the outputs generated by  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This in essence is the next phase of financial reform which\r\n\r\nMOF  has undertaken to ensure that the Government makes the  best\r\n\r\nuse  of its resources.  It will require ministries to look at the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost of providing services rather than just the cash  cost\r\n\r\nalone.   To  achieve  this, the concept  of  resource  accounting\r\n\r\nwithin  ministries will be introduced.  Over the next  couple  of\r\n\r\nyears, other resource management concepts and practices will also\r\n\r\nbe introduced in stages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we continue to innovate and improve on\r\n\r\nthe  way we manage our resources.  We have no choice.  To  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive, we must keep Government expenditure as a  percentage\r\n\r\nof  the GDP low.  Yet, there are more and more that we have to do\r\n\r\nin  order  to  cater for the economic and social  aspirations  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    We   can  meet  these  seemingly   contradictory\r\n\r\nrequirements only if we continuously innovate and improve on  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of our resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The   timely\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the cost cutting package played  an  important\r\n\r\npart  in  helping the economy rebound quickly.  We expect  growth\r\n\r\nfor  the economy as a whole to remain strong this year.  However,\r\n\r\nnot  all  sectors  are  fully out of  the  woods.   For  example,\r\n\r\nconstruction\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  business services are still under-performing.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing and electronics sectors which led the recovery\r\n\r\nface  strong competitive pressures.  To ensure that the  momentum\r\n\r\nof  economic  recovery  is sustained, I will  be  announcing  the\r\n\r\nextension  of  some tax measures introduced in  the  cost-cutting\r\n\r\npackage, partially or in full, to help contain cost pressures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer term, we face structural problems posed by an ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.  The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation made comprehensive recommendations and these are being\r\n\r\nstudied.  Although many of the problems raised have  longer  term\r\n\r\nimplications, we should start to address some of the less complex\r\n\r\nissues.   I  will therefore be announcing several tax changes  to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to plan prudently for their  needs  after\r\n\r\nretirement  and  also  to encourage greater family  cohesiveness.\r\n\r\nThere  will  also be incentives to enhance our competitive  edge,\r\n\r\nencourage  the growth of knowledge intensive and high value-added\r\n\r\nactivities and measures to foster entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first touch on tax changes for individuals and the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THE FAMILY</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Supplementary Retirement Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the areas studied by the IMC on the Ageing Population\r\n\r\nis  financial  security.  The IMC has recommended that  financial\r\n\r\nsecurity  should comprise a \"basic needs Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nmodel\",  and a \"complementary private sector system\" to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  supplement their CPF  savings  by  contributing\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  to private funds.  The Government agrees  with  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will introduce a Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS),\r\n\r\nwhich  allows  Singaporeans to contribute  voluntarily  over  and\r\n\r\nabove  their CPF savings.  Contributions to SRS will be  accorded\r\n\r\ntax  deductions  at  the  time of contribution,  with  tax  being\r\n\r\npayable only when the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsavings  are  withdrawn.   Participants  will  have  considerable\r\n\r\nflexibility in investing their savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary SRS contributions can only be made by\r\n\r\nemployees,  subject to a percentage cap based  on  their  salary.\r\n\r\nEmployers  shall not contribute.  SRS will not be  an  additional\r\n\r\ncost to business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention is to allow foreigners who are\r\n\r\nworking  in  Singapore to also participate if the scheme  can  be\r\n\r\nuseful for their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the SRS is a complex scheme, details of the scheme will\r\n\r\ntake  time  to work out.  Views from the private sector  will  be\r\n\r\nsought on the implementation aspects.  We expect to implement the\r\n\r\nscheme by next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Income Tax Relief for Dependants</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the IMC has raised public awareness on care of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly.  We believe that the elderly are best cared for  by\r\n\r\ntheir children in the familial surroundings of their own homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is a tax relief of $4,500 for the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of each aged parent if the taxpayer is staying  with\r\n\r\nthe  aged  parent or a lesser amount of relief at $3,500  if  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  is  not  staying with his parent.  To  provide  greater\r\n\r\nrecognition to those who stay with their parents, the relief  for\r\n\r\nthem  will  be raised by $500 to $5,000.  For those who  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  aged  parents but do not stay with them, the  relief  will\r\n\r\nremain at $3,500.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change will take effect from the Year of Assessment\r\n\r\n2000.  Revenue loss to Government will be about $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Treatment for CPF Savings Beyond the Minimum Sum</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the Minimum Sum Scheme, the Minimum Sum may\r\n\r\nbe  left with CPF Board, deposited with an approved bank or  used\r\n\r\nto purchase an annuity.  CPF savings in excess of the Minimum Sum\r\n\r\ncan be withdrawn at age 55.  To encourage more prudent financial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning  with  CPF  savings,  the  current  tax  exemption   for\r\n\r\nannuities  bought  with  the Minimum  Sum  will  be  extended  to\r\n\r\nannuities  bought with CPF savings beyond the Minimum  Sum.   The\r\n\r\ntax  treatment  will  similarly be accorded  to  interest  income\r\n\r\narising  from the deposits of CPF savings beyond the Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\ndeposited with approved banks.  Several conditions, such as those\r\n\r\nof  the  Minimum Sum Scheme will apply.  Details will be released\r\n\r\nby CPF Board in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of Tax Relief for CPF Top-Up to Grandparents</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from providing for their own financial security,\r\n\r\nindividuals currently enjoy a tax relief for cash top-ups to  the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum Account of their parents.  At present, a taxpayer who\r\n\r\ntops  up  in cash to his own or his parents' retirement  accounts\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed  a tax relief on the amount topped  up,  up  to\r\n\r\n$6,000  a  year.   To  promote inter-generational  ties  and  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  extended  families, I have decided  to  extend  this\r\n\r\nrelief to cover top-ups in cash for grandparents with effect from\r\n\r\nYear  of Assessment 2001.  Details will be released by CPF  Board\r\n\r\nin due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Personal Tax Rebate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government gave a one-off 10% tax rebate to\r\n\r\nhelp  mitigate the impact of the recession.  As economic recovery\r\n\r\nis  well underway this year, the 10% rebate will not be extended.\r\n\r\nInstead,  a  one-off, across-the-board rebate of 5% on individual\r\n\r\nincome   tax  for  Year  of  Assessment  2000  will  be  granted.\r\n\r\nEstimated revenue loss to Government is $200 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the GST-related changes made to personal income\r\n\r\ntax, currently about 65% of individuals no longer pay income  tax\r\n\r\nand  will not benefit from income tax rebates.  To assist  people\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  group,  Government will grant rebates on  HDB  Service  and\r\n\r\nConservancy (S&C) charges and rents to citizens staying in owner-occupied  HDB  flats and rented flats.  The rebates  will  be  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One-Room Flats</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months' net rent and two months' net S&C charges.\r\n\r\nThe  rental  and  S&C rebates will be made on 1st  June  and  1st\r\n\r\nDecember this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Two-Room Flats</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's net rent and two months' net S&C charges.\r\n\r\nThe  rental  rebate  will be made on 1st December,  and  the  S&C\r\n\r\nrebates on 1st June and 1st December this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Three-Room Flats</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half months' net S&C charges. The S&C rebate\r\n\r\nwill be made on 1st June and 1st December this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Four-Room Flats</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three quarter month's net S&C charges. The S&C rebate\r\n\r\nwill be made on 1st December this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Five-Room Flats</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a month's net S&C charges, to be made on 1st\r\n\r\nDecember this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rebates is $25 million. The\r\n\r\nrebates will be given after deducting GST offset rebates and  S&C\r\n\r\ngrants associated with utilities rebates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>GST-Related Offsets and Rebates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I announced that in view of the difficult\r\n\r\neconomic conditions, the GST offset package, consisting of rental\r\n\r\nand  S&C rebates for 1 to 3-room HDB households would be extended\r\n\r\nfor  two years until March 2001.  I am happy to confirm that  the\r\n\r\nGST  offset  package will continue to be given  this  year.   The\r\n\r\nrental and S&C rebates are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rental Rebates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: a rental rebate of $12 per month\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: a rental rebate of $8 per month\r\n\r\n<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rebates for S&C Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: $8 per month\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: $7 per month\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 3-room flats: $4 per month\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rebates is $19 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Offset Package for Utilities Rate Revision</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1997, the Government announced the revision of water\r\n\r\ntariffs and water conservation tax to a uniform flat rate for all\r\n\r\nusers.   The increases were to be phased over 4 years,  with  the\r\n\r\nlast  increase  scheduled for 1st July 2000.  The water  tariffs,\r\n\r\nincluding  conservation tax, will increase by between 14.3  cents\r\n\r\nand 23.3 cents per cubic metre for domestic consumers.   The non-domestic  water  rate will remain unchanged at  $1.52  per  cubic\r\n\r\nmetre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offset higher sewerage costs, the waterborne fee will be\r\n\r\nraised  as  scheduled  by 5 cents per cubic  metre  for  domestic\r\n\r\nconsumers and 9 cents per cubic metre for non-domestic consumers,\r\n\r\nalso with effect from 1st July 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to help lower-income households\r\n\r\ncope  with  the water tariff increases and I am happy to  confirm\r\n\r\nthat  the offset package announced in last year's Budget will  be\r\n\r\ncontinued this year.  The utilities rebates are $200 for 1 to  3-room  HDB flats and $100 for 4-room HDB flats.  The rebates  will\r\n\r\nbe  credited  against the utilities bills of eligible  households\r\n\r\nfor  the month of September.  Households which are unable to  use\r\n\r\nup  the rebate within the month can carry over the balance of the\r\n\r\nrebate  until it is fully used up.  This will cost the Government\r\n\r\nabout $81 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants for S&C charges to HDB lessees and tenants, ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  $36  to  $66 a year will also continue to  be  given.   The\r\n\r\ngrants  will start from July this year and will be $3  per  month\r\n\r\nfor  1-room flats, $4 per month for 2-room flats, $5.50 per month\r\n\r\nfor 3-room flats and $4 per month\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  4-room flats.  They will be credited directly into  the  S&C\r\n\r\naccounts of eligible lessees or tenants with their Town Councils.\r\n\r\nThis will cost the Government $29 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to tax changes for companies and\r\n\r\nbusinesses in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Corporate Income Tax</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, a 10% corporate tax rebate was given to assist\r\n\r\ncompanies  affected by the economic downturn.  This  rebate  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  extended  for  a  second year because  the  economy  has\r\n\r\nrebounded  strongly. Our corporate tax rate was last  reduced  to\r\n\r\n26%  in  1997  and remains generally competitive at  this  level.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  recent  years, many developed countries  have  been\r\n\r\nlowering  corporate taxes to stimulate investments  and  if  this\r\n\r\ntrend  continues,  our tax competitiveness will  be  eroded  over\r\n\r\ntime.   I have therefore decided to take a cautious next step  by\r\n\r\nreducing the corporate tax rate by 0.5% to 25.5% with effect from\r\n\r\nYear of Assessment 2001.  Maintaining a competitive tax regime is\r\n\r\na  cornerstone of our fiscal strategy and the tax cuts  over  the\r\n\r\nyears  have  contributed  greatly towards  our  economic  growth.\r\n\r\nRevenue loss arising from the reduction in corporate tax rate  is\r\n\r\nestimated at $140 million annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension  of  Property Tax Rebate on Commercial  and  Industrial Properties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, against a background of economic recession, a 55%\r\n\r\nproperty tax rebate for commercial and industrial properties  was\r\n\r\ngranted for two years, starting 1st July 1998.  Although the real\r\n\r\nestate sector has shown recovery in the past year, rental markets\r\n\r\nremain  weak.  I have therefore decided to extend the rebate  for\r\n\r\nanother year, up to June 2001, but at a lower rate of 25%.   This\r\n\r\nwill  also  help  to ease cost pressures on companies  generally.\r\n\r\nRevenue forgone is estimated at $250 million.  HDB, JTC and other\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  owning properties will  pass  most  of  the\r\n\r\nrebate to their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntenants.  I would also urge private landlords to do likewise, and\r\n\r\npass on at least half of the rebate to their tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Further Stamp Duty Relief for Corporate Restructuring and Merger</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 15 of the Stamp Duties Act provides stamp\r\n\r\nduty  relief for corporate restructuring and merger.  As  section\r\n\r\n15  is  a relieving section, qualifying conditions have been  set\r\n\r\nfor the concession.  In recent years, we have seen an increase in\r\n\r\nthe number of companies involved in restructuring or merger to re-align  their businesses, so as to improve on cost-efficiency  and\r\n\r\nbetter  deliver  products or services to customers.   With  these\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  mind, I have therefore decided  to  expand  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  stamp duty exemption to a wider spectrum of  corporate\r\n\r\nrestructurings  and  mergers.   In  addition  to   the   existing\r\n\r\nexemptions,  relief  will be granted to the  transfer  of  assets\r\n\r\nbetween  associated companies, the restructuring  and  merger  of\r\n\r\nlisted  companies, and companies which intend to list or  further\r\n\r\nlist their shares after the exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, if the transfer involves less than 90% of the\r\n\r\ncompany's  shares, or if the consideration is made in  cash,  the\r\n\r\nexercise  would  not qualify for the relief.  I have  decided  to\r\n\r\nlift  these  two  conditions for the transfer of  assets  between\r\n\r\nassociated  companies,  defined as one  owning  75%  or  more  of\r\n\r\nanother  company, or a third company owning at least 75% of  both\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, publicly-listed companies and companies which\r\n\r\nintend to list their shares after the restructuring or merger are\r\n\r\nnot  able to meet the condition of a 2-year moratorium on changes\r\n\r\nin  beneficial ownership of the shares.  I have decided  to  lift\r\n\r\nthe  2-year moratorium on the consideration shares held by public\r\n\r\nshareholders,  and  also allow companies to float  a  portion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  issued  share capital up to the minimum listing  threshold\r\n\r\nrequired by the SGX for its mainboard listing.  This threshold is\r\n\r\ncurrently 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will take effect shortly when details are\r\n\r\nannounced by IRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION, CREATIVITY AND ENTERPRISE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Income Tax Concession for Royalty Payments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, authors, composers and inventors can avail\r\n\r\nthemselves of a tax incentive which exempts from tax 90% of gross\r\n\r\nroyalties received.  To further encourage the development of  the\r\n\r\narts  and  innovation in Singapore, I have decided to  liberalise\r\n\r\nthe current scheme.  The changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Concession for Authors and Composers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the concession is only applicable to income\r\n\r\nreceived  by  authors and composers from publishers in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  the  assignment of or for the right to use the copyright  in\r\n\r\nany  literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.   With  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  Year  of  Assessment 2001, royalty payments received  by  a\r\n\r\ncomposer or an author from recording, film or drama companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will also qualify for this incentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Concession for Inventors and Innovators</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentive for inventors and innovators is presently\r\n\r\napplicable  only  to  income derived by a  Singapore  citizen  or\r\n\r\npermanent resident for the assignment of or for the rights in any\r\n\r\napproved   inventions  or  innovations  that  are  manufacturing-related.   This incentive will be extended to cover any  approved\r\n\r\ninventions  or  innovations  from the non-manufacturing  sectors.\r\n\r\nThe scheme will also be extended to foreigners, provided that the\r\n\r\ncreations  of  the  inventions or innovations  are  substantially\r\n\r\ncarried out in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the incentive, the inventions or innovations\r\n\r\nmust be protectable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Economic Development Board will administer the incentive.

However, for residential properties to qualify\r\n\r\nfor  the $9 million exemption, they must not be used for any form\r\n\r\nof business activity.  To encourage entrepreneurs who may want to\r\n\r\nwork  from  home,  this  rule will be  relaxed.   With  immediate\r\n\r\neffect,  a  Singapore  residential  property  used  for  business\r\n\r\nactivity  will  also  qualify for the estate duty  exemption  for\r\n\r\nresidential property, as long as the residential character of the\r\n\r\nproperty  is  not  materially  affected.   This  relaxation  will\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Technopreneur Home Office Scheme,  and  also  allow\r\n\r\nother   small   businesses  to  be  carried  out  in  residential\r\n\r\nproperties   without  disqualifying  these   from   estate   duty\r\n\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced Tax Treatment for Stock Options</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity ownership is key to the development of the vibrant\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurial  environment in Silicon Valley  and  other  high\r\n\r\ntech  nodes.  Talented people, including research scientists  and\r\n\r\nengineers, high tech professionals, MBA holders, and even  office\r\n\r\nstaff,  are nowadays prepared to accept low or even zero salaries\r\n\r\nin  return for equity stakes in the companies they work in.  They\r\n\r\nhope  that their companies will succeed spectacularly, and  their\r\n\r\nequity  stakes  will  increase by tens or hundreds  of  times  in\r\n\r\nvalue.   Their  direct stakes in their firms'  success  motivates\r\n\r\nthem  to  put their hearts and souls into building up the  firms,\r\n\r\nand to slog long hours to outdo their competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these equity stakes are offered to the employees\r\n\r\nthrough  stock option schemes, commonly known as ESOPs  (Employee\r\n\r\nStock Options).  The use of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESOPs  is  most pervasive among technopreneurial start-ups.   But\r\n\r\neven for mature companies, ESOP schemes have been shown to have a\r\n\r\nsignificant  impact on corporate performance.  The evidence  that\r\n\r\nstock  options play a pivotal role in good corporate  performance\r\n\r\nis well established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usefulness of stock options lies in their ability to\r\n\r\nrecruit,  motivate and retain employees.  This is  vital  in  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses of today.  But it will be even more important  in  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  of  tomorrow, which will place a growing  premium  on\r\n\r\ndeveloping  and applying knowledge, and committing  the  energies\r\n\r\nand  creative juices of the people working for the company.  They\r\n\r\nmay still be called employees, but they are actually partners  in\r\n\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many developed countries have recognised the importance of\r\n\r\nemployee stock options in helping high-growth companies to retain\r\n\r\nand  motivate top talent.  They have made significant changes  to\r\n\r\ntheir  tax  systems to encourage employee stock  options,  or  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  incentive schemes for stock options.  These  countries\r\n\r\ninclude the UK, Scandinavian countries and even Japan.  Under the\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes,  tax treatment for ESOPs is  more  favourable\r\n\r\nthan cash payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must move in the same direction. We need to act quickly,\r\n\r\nto offer potential entrepreneurs that extra incentive to take the\r\n\r\nplunge,  and  to  send  a  clear  signal  that  we  are  strongly\r\n\r\nencouraging  enterprise  and  wealth  creation.   Attractive  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  to  encourage  the use of ESOPs  will  also  help  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  compete for global talent, which is highly  mobile\r\n\r\nnot  only  across companies, but also across national boundaries.\r\n\r\nTalent will be attracted to places where opportunities and  post-tax rewards are the greatest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We improved the tax treatment of ESOPs last year, by\r\n\r\nallowing  the tax payable to be deferred by up to 5  years,  with\r\n\r\ninterest  chargeable  for the deferment.  But  this  was  only  a\r\n\r\nmodest first step.  We need to improve the tax treatment of ESOPs\r\n\r\nfurther, particularly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  high  tech  start-ups.  As this  may  have  significant\r\n\r\nimplications  for our tax system, we need a little more  time  to\r\n\r\ncomplete the study.  We will announce an enhanced scheme for high\r\n\r\ntech start-ups by the end of May this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Abolishment of Stamp Duty on Contract Notes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to fine-tune its tax regime to\r\n\r\npromote the development of the financial services sector  and  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  Singapore continues to be a  conducive  centre  for\r\n\r\ntrading and transacting financial products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The securities markets today are facing a period of intense\r\n\r\ntechnological  change and competition.  Exchanges worldwide  have\r\n\r\nbeen  restructuring themselves in the face of globalising  equity\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Advancement  in technology has not  only  created  new\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  alternative  trading  systems,  it  has   also\r\n\r\nfacilitated the rapid flow of capital to markets which offer  the\r\n\r\ngreatest efficiency and lowest trading costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has responded to\r\n\r\nthese challenges with a series of initiatives.  Liberalisation of\r\n\r\nthe  fixed  brokerage  commissions system  will  be  accelerated.\r\n\r\nCommissions  on  all trades regardless of value  will  be  freely\r\n\r\nnegotiable  from 1st January 2001, instead of 1st  January  2003.\r\n\r\nStamp  duty on contract notes on share transactions is  now  only\r\n\r\n0.05%, and had been suspended until 29th June 2000 as part of our\r\n\r\nearlier response to the economic crisis.  To further enhance  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of our stock exchanges, stamp duty  on  contract\r\n\r\nnotes  on  share transactions will be abolished with effect  from\r\n\r\n30th  June  2000.   The  annual revenue  loss  to  Government  is\r\n\r\nestimated  at  $70  million, based on the  average  stock  market\r\n\r\ntransactions for the past 3 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Abolition  of  Withholding Taxes on Financial Guaranty  Insurance Contracts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent financial crisis has highlighted the need for\r\n\r\nAsia  to  develop  a  deeper  and  more  liquid  bond  market  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate raising of longer-term funds.  Increasingly, there  is\r\n\r\na   need   for  issuers  of  debt  securities  to  employ  credit\r\n\r\nenhancement tools, as investors become more concerned over credit\r\n\r\nquality.   This will open up business opportunities in  Asia  for\r\n\r\ncredit  enhancers,  such  as financial guaranty  insurers,  which\r\n\r\ninsure the payment of the principal and interest to investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has amended its regulations to allow multi-line\r\n\r\ninsurers, reinsurers and branches of foreign insurers,  to  write\r\n\r\nfinancial  guaranty business.  To further promote this  activity,\r\n\r\nclaim  payments made under financial guaranty insurance  policies\r\n\r\nby  approved financial guaranty insurers to non-residents will be\r\n\r\nexempt from withholding tax.  This will take effect immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of Tax Concession for Bond Trading to Swap Trading</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Budget, I announced a concessionary 10% tax rate\r\n\r\non  income  derived  by financial institutions  from  trading  in\r\n\r\nbonds.   For  the  bond market to flourish, it  is  important  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a swap market to provide market players with avenues  for\r\n\r\nrisk-hedging  and arbitraging.  To encourage the  development  of\r\n\r\nthe  swap  market here, the concessionary 10% tax  rate  will  be\r\n\r\nextended to income derived by financial institutions from trading\r\n\r\nin  interest rate and currency swaps.  This concession will  take\r\n\r\neffect  from  Year of Assessment 2001 and will apply  until  27th\r\n\r\nFebruary  2003, which is also the expiry date of the 5-year  bond\r\n\r\nincentives which took effect on 28th February 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Withholding Tax Exemption on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1989 Budget, I announced the exemption of\r\n\r\nwithholding tax on interest rate and currency swap payments  made\r\n\r\nby  Asian  Currency  Units (ACUs) to non-residents.   To  further\r\n\r\ndevelop our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nswap  market, withholding tax exemption will be extended  to  all\r\n\r\nbona  fide  interest  rate and currency  swap  payments  made  by\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions besides ACUs.  The  exemption  will  take\r\n\r\nimmediate effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of the Asian Currency Unit (ACU) Scheme to All Offshore Financial Derivatives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, ACUs are taxed at a concessionary rate of 10% on\r\n\r\nincome   from  transactions  in  certain  specified  derivatives,\r\n\r\nincluding  interest  rate  and currency  swaps  in  non-Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars, with offshore counterparties and other ACUs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trading of financial products other than plain vanilla\r\n\r\nswaps has expanded considerably.  To further develop this area of\r\n\r\nbusiness, the 10% tax rate will be extended to income derived  by\r\n\r\nACUs  from  all  other offshore derivative transactions  in  non-Singapore dollars.  This extension will take effect from Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 2001 and will apply for 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Goods  and Services Tax on Trustee Services Provided to  a  Trust with Non-Resident Settlors and Beneficiaries</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cardinal principle underlying the GST is that it is a tax\r\n\r\non domestic consumption of goods and services.  Under present tax\r\n\r\nrules,  the  provision of trustee services by a  trustee  to  the\r\n\r\ntrust is standard-rated if the trustee representing the trust  is\r\n\r\nsituated  in  Singapore.  This treatment applies even  where  the\r\n\r\nsettlors and beneficiaries of a trust are all or mostly foreign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to put Singapore trustees on a more competitive\r\n\r\nfooting  with  offshore  trustees, I have  decided  to  zero-rate\r\n\r\ntrustee services in cases where at least 80% of the settlors  and\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries are non-resident, and at least 80% of the assets of\r\n\r\nthe  trust were originally contributed by settlors who  are  non-resident.   This measure will also facilitate the development  of\r\n\r\nour private banking industry, where trusts are likely to play  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly substantial role.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR THE PROPERTY SECTOR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Tax Exemption for Land under Development</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax exemption for land under development was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in the FY98 Budget to address difficulties  faced  by\r\n\r\ndevelopers  during the economic crisis.  The property development\r\n\r\nmarket  has  shown signs of recovery since.  Property transaction\r\n\r\nvolume  and  the  property  price  index  have  seen  a  pick-up.\r\n\r\nGovernment has also decided to resume residential land sales this\r\n\r\nyear.   Tax  exemption on property tax for land under development\r\n\r\nwill  therefore be withdrawn with effect from today.  The  change\r\n\r\nwill  only affect new projects.  Projects which have been granted\r\n\r\ntax exemption will continue to enjoy the concession for a maximum\r\n\r\nperiod of 5 years or upon completion, whichever is earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES ON PERSONAL CONSUMPTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Duties on Cigarettes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes were last revised in February 1998. In\r\n\r\nsupport  of the continuing national effort to discourage smoking,\r\n\r\nespecially among the young, the excise duty on cigarettes will be\r\n\r\nraised  from  $130 to $150 per kilogram.  Details of the  changes\r\n\r\nare  in  Annex A.  (Cols. 1123-4).  The changes will take  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  today.   There will be a revenue gain of about $64  million\r\n\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CONCLUSION</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, barring any major external shocks, the\r\n\r\nrecovery momentum is expected to continue in 2000 and beyond.  We\r\n\r\nhave  come through the economic crisis well because of our strong\r\n\r\nfundamentals  and sound principles of governance.   We  are  well\r\n\r\nplaced  for  future growth, provided we do not become complacent.\r\n\r\nThe  economic crisis has also taught us valuable lessons  on  the\r\n\r\npost crisis economic environment and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrategies needed for future growth.  We have to face up  to  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  a globalised economic system and keep  pace  with\r\n\r\nchanges in technology to remain relevant and useful.  We need  to\r\n\r\naccelerate  the pace of economic restructuring.  Our  costs  must\r\n\r\nremain competitive.
