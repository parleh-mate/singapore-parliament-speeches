Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members are no doubt\r\n\r\naware  that there is a growing rice shortage  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  This  is  becoming clearer when  we  read  of\r\n\r\nreports   that   rice-growing   countries   in   Asia\r\n\r\nthemselves  have  to import rice to meet  consumption\r\n\r\nrequirements.  The  growing  general   shortage   was\r\n\r\nhighlighted  when Thailand, one of the largest  rice-growing  countries  in  the  world,  had  to   impose\r\n\r\nrestrictions on exports of rice from Thailand.  These\r\n\r\nrestrictions had an immediate effect on the trend  of\r\n\r\nrice  prices. Therefore, at the end of December 1966,\r\n\r\nthe  retail price of Siam polished rice 100 per  cent\r\n\r\nwas  40 cents per katty compared with 34 cents at the\r\n\r\nend of 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, the retail price has increased\r\n\r\ngradually to about 45 cents or 46 cents per katty  at\r\n\r\nthe end of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the lifting of the export\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  rice by Thailand  in  January,  the\r\n\r\nwholesale  price of rice has shown a slight decrease.\r\n\r\nAt  the  end  of April, the wholesale price  of  Siam\r\n\r\npolished rice 100 per cent was $40 per pikul compared\r\n\r\nwith $40.25 per pikul at the end of March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a position of surplus with low prices paid for\r\n\r\nraw  sugar,  in  recent months  the  trend  has  been\r\n\r\nreversed.  The  price of raw sugar has  been  rising.\r\n\r\nConsequent  on  this, it is therefore not  surprising\r\n\r\nthat the price of refined sugar should also increase.\r\n\r\nHence  in  January, the wholesale  price  of  refined\r\n\r\nsugar  per pikul was $24.25, which rose to $27.60  by\r\n\r\nthe   end  of  April.  The  retail  price  of   sugar\r\n\r\naccordingly rose from 28 cents per katty  in  January\r\n\r\nto 30 cents per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkatty  the  following month, and it has  remained  at\r\n\r\nthis level since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Singapore does not grow its own rice and\r\n\r\nwill only refine granulated sugar from raw sugar, the\r\n\r\nincreases in the price of rice as well as sugar  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  as  severe as in other countries  of  this\r\n\r\nregion.

Between July 1966 and  March\r\n\r\n1967, there were two programmes on basketball with an\r\n\r\ninterview in Chinese about local basketball, and  for\r\n\r\na  similar  number  of occasions,  table  tennis  was\r\n\r\nshown.

In fact, all religions are  equal,\r\n\r\nand the Government's policy has always been, and will\r\n\r\nalways  be, to leave each religious community to  run\r\n\r\nits  own affairs without interference from the State.\r\n\r\nThis is religious freedom. I shall,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore, be most happy to answer the hon.  Member's\r\n\r\nquestion, in so far as the seeking of information  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, but I shall be in no position to deal with\r\n\r\nany  matters  impinging upon any power  or  right  of\r\n\r\nadministration, which is strictly a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nreligious authority concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now to come to the hon. Member's question. I\r\n\r\nhave  obtained  the information from the  Muslim  and\r\n\r\nHindu Endowments Board, which is responsible for  the\r\n\r\nadministration of four Hindu Temples, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Mariamman Temple at South Bridge Road,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Sivan Temple at Orchard Road,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Kaliamman Temple at Somerset Road, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Perumal Temple at Serangoon Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mariamman Temple has one Head Priest who is\r\n\r\npaid  a salary of $100 per month, and three Pandarams\r\n\r\nwho are paid $65 per month, $63 per month and $60 per\r\n\r\nmonth  respectively.  The Sivan  Temple  employs  one\r\n\r\nPriest  at $80 per month and one Pandaram at $60  per\r\n\r\nmonth. The Kaliamman Temple has only one Pandaram  at\r\n\r\n$90  per month. The Perumal Temple employs one Priest\r\n\r\nat  $150  per month and one Assistant Priest at  $130\r\n\r\nper month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that each Temple employs priests\r\n\r\nand   pays   salaries  according  to  its  means.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that there are no fixed salary scales with\r\n\r\nregular  increments. I am told, however,  that  these\r\n\r\nemployees  receive other emoluments  over  and  above\r\n\r\ntheir salaries, e.g., commissions on fees paid to the\r\n\r\nTemples  by devotees for prayer ceremonies  conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  priests;  they are also provided  with  free\r\n\r\nhousing, water and electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

When  it was  first  established,\r\n\r\nGovernment  was given to understand that  the  Kongsi\r\n\r\nhad  ample  funds  to finance the  project  and  that\r\n\r\nGovernment   financial  assistance   would   not   be\r\n\r\nnecessary   then   and  in  the   future.   On   that\r\n\r\nunderstanding, Government had given its  blessing  to\r\n\r\nthe   establishment  of  the  college  as  a  private\r\n\r\ninstitution and subsequently approved the  plans  for\r\n\r\npermanent  buildings to be erected in Clementi  Road.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  insofar as Government is  concerned,  the\r\n\r\nfinancial aid given to the College has been confined,\r\n\r\nsince  its inception, to the award of bursaries which\r\n\r\namounted to $82,000 in 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the College was sited at the Tank\r\n\r\nRoad   premises   which   belong   to   the   Teochew\r\n\r\nAssociation.  Later 40 acres of the  Kongsi  land  at\r\n\r\nClementi  Road were used for building the  Technology\r\n\r\nDepartment of the College and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Kongsi has promised that the rent collected from\r\n\r\nthe  College  will be returned to the  College  as  a\r\n\r\ngrant. Ngee Ann Kongsi, however, had difficulties  in\r\n\r\nproviding  funds  for  the construction  of  the  new\r\n\r\nbuildings at Clementi Road. Furthermore, there was no\r\n\r\nassurance   of  a  regular  income  to  meet   annual\r\n\r\nrecurrent  expenditure. In fact,  this  situation  is\r\n\r\nstill  prevailing. There were also doubts as  to  how\r\n\r\nthe  College  could  best  serve  the  needs  of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Therefore, in mid 1964  Professor  Lucian\r\n\r\nPye,  a  political  economist  at  the  Massachusetts\r\n\r\nInstitute of Technology, and Mr Arthur Singer of the\r\n\r\nCarnegie  Corporation  in  the  United  States   were\r\n\r\ninvited by the Kongsi to survey the College and  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations  as  to  its future  development  and\r\n\r\nexpansion.  The  Pye/ Singer Report recommended  that\r\n\r\nthe  position  of  the  College  in  the  educational\r\n\r\nstructure of the Republic needed to be redefined  and\r\n\r\nthat Ngee Ann College should develop into a community\r\n\r\ncollege  to  train  technicians  needed  for  our  industrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1966, the Kongsi decided to set up a\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Review, headed by Professor  Thong  Saw\r\n\r\nPak, with the following terms of reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To review the organisation of the Ngee Ann College\r\n\r\nwith  special reference to the courses  of  study  at\r\n\r\npresent available at the College and, in the light of\r\n\r\nthe  findings  and  the  needs  of  our  country,  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  to  the Ngee Ann Kongsi in what  way  this\r\n\r\ninstitution  of higher learning should be  developed,\r\n\r\nand  how the organisation and courses of study should\r\n\r\nbe   improved   in   order  to   bring   about   such\r\n\r\ndevelopment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Thong Saw Pak Committee submitted its report  to\r\n\r\nthe Kongsi in July 1966. This report was released  by\r\n\r\nthe  Kongsi  in  September  of  the  same  year.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  recommends  that  the  College  should  be\r\n\r\nreorganised into a community college administered  by\r\n\r\na   17-man  council  with  representatives  from  the\r\n\r\nKongsi,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and prominent citizens from a broad\r\n\r\narea  of  community life in Singapore. The  Committee\r\n\r\nconsider  that the College may eventually attain  its\r\n\r\nobjective of university status. This cannot, however,\r\n\r\nbe accomplished overnight. There must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  interim period during which difficulties  can  be\r\n\r\nironed out. The Committee recommends that during this\r\n\r\ninterim  period  -  the length  of  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nspecified, because there are too many variables - the\r\n\r\nCollege be reorganised into a community college  with\r\n\r\ncourses   leading  only  to  diplomas.  The  existing\r\n\r\ncourses   can   continue  until  all  students   have\r\n\r\ncompleted their courses, i.e., till 1970, but no  new\r\n\r\nstudents  are  to  be  admitted to  them.  Since  the\r\n\r\nCollege   has  so  committed  itself,  the  Committee\r\n\r\nrecommends that degrees be awarded to all the present\r\n\r\nstudents,  including  those  admitted  in  1966,  for\r\n\r\npassing  the  final examinations for  which  external\r\n\r\nexaminers  are to be appointed, who will  advise  the\r\n\r\nCollege  in  adopting a realistic standard.  At  some\r\n\r\nlater  date,  as soon as the College has become  well\r\n\r\nestablished  as  a  community  college,  a   separate\r\n\r\nassessment  of the situation should be undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  College authorities and, depending on the future\r\n\r\nneeds  of the Republic, the College can then  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  the final part of its development programme  of\r\n\r\nproviding degree courses in Engineering, Commerce and\r\n\r\nTechnology. Meanwhile, for the community college  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  lists  an  extensive coverage  of  courses\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be  offered  of immediate  importance  to\r\n\r\nbuilding   trades,  electricity,   radio   and   T.V.\r\n\r\ntechnology,    metal   work,   woodwork,    ceramics,\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial arts, industrial laboratory\r\n\r\ntechniques and shipyard trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students became concerned about their future. A\r\n\r\nboycott of classes was mounted in June 1965 over  the\r\n\r\ndelay  of  the Kongsi in completing the buildings  at\r\n\r\nthe  Clementi Road site. Another boycott  of  classes\r\n\r\ndirected against the Thong Saw Pak Report took  place\r\n\r\nin  October 1966. This boycott was exploited  by  the\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements and the Barisan Sosialis.  The\r\n\r\nscope of the agitation was expanded and middle school\r\n\r\nstudents, Nanyang University, University of Singapore\r\n\r\nand Polytechnic undergraduates became involved in it,\r\n\r\nculminating  in security action being  taken  against\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall how the Ngee Ann students\r\n\r\nrioted  in  front of the City Hall on  4th  November,\r\n\r\n1966, and when the police finally moved into the Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  College  premises  at Tank  Road  in  the  early\r\n\r\nmorning  of 19th November, 1966, they were  met  with\r\n\r\nstiff  resistance  and finally 66 Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nexpelled  students  and  65 Ngee  Ann  students  were\r\n\r\nflushed out of the building where they had barricaded\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, events have taken a turn for the\r\n\r\nbetter.  At an extraordinary general meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nKongsi held on 18th February, 1967, the Thong Saw Pak\r\n\r\nReport  was accepted by the Kongsi in tow,  with  the\r\n\r\nexception that the present premises of the College at\r\n\r\nTank  Road  could not be turned over to  the  College\r\n\r\nbecause  the  ownership  is  vested  in  the  Teochew\r\n\r\nAssociation and not the Kongsi. This means that  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  College  will be reorganised in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  Thong  Saw  Pak Report and the Kongsi  will,  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  turn over to the College half of its  annual\r\n\r\nincome.  The  Kongsi has also decided  that,  pending\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the College, no new  students  will\r\n\r\nbe enrolled this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is introduced consequent upon the\r\n\r\nacceptance of the Thong Saw Pak Report by the  Kongsi\r\n\r\nas  a  first step towards the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nReport  so  as  to enable the College  to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nstatus   of   a  corporation  with  its  constitution\r\n\r\nembodied  in  the Ordinance. The Bill  has  the  full\r\n\r\nagreement  of the Kongsi. The enactment of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwould  confirm the establishment of Ngee Ann  College\r\n\r\nas  a  permanent  institution.  It  would  assist  in\r\n\r\nenlisting   financial   support   from   foundations,\r\n\r\ninstitutions and philanthropists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides for a Council and a\r\n\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides that the Council shall be the\r\n\r\nsupreme  governing and executive body of the College,\r\n\r\nwhilst  clause  13 delegates responsibility  for  the\r\n\r\npromotion of instruction and research, the conducting\r\n\r\nof  examinations for its students and  the  award  of\r\n\r\ncertificates,    diplomas    and    other    academic\r\n\r\nqualifications to the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the 17-man Council is set out in\r\n\r\nclause  7.

Adequate representation\r\n\r\nfrom  commercial  and industrial interests  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen provided. Clause 7 (d) allows for representation\r\n\r\nfrom the Senate and full-time staff of the College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these provisions have been made to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe   College   contributes  to   the   intellectual,\r\n\r\ncultural,   commercial  and  industrial  welfare   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Emphasis has, however, been made  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  studies in the sciences,  technology\r\n\r\nand  commerce,  as other educational  fields  are  at\r\n\r\npresent well provided for by our two Universities and\r\n\r\nthe  future  of our economy will depend  to  a  large\r\n\r\nextent on our industrial and commercial activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this is a hybrid Bill, it will\r\n\r\nat  the  end of the Second Reading be referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee in accordance with the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Standing Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  as  a  former  student  of  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege,  I  would like to say a few words  today  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  Ngee  Ann  College.  The  House  is   now\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the Ngee Ann College Bill. This  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintended   to  turn  Ngee  Ann  College,  a   private\r\n\r\ninstitution which has been in existence for only four\r\n\r\nyears,  into  a corporation with a permanent  status.\r\n\r\nSir, when we review the situation we know that, since\r\n\r\nthe  inception of Ngee Ann College, certain directors\r\n\r\nof  Ngee  Ann Kongsi have said that Ngee Ann  College\r\n\r\nwould  develop  from  a  small  college  into  a  big\r\n\r\nuniversity. I would like to ask those directors  what\r\n\r\nis the situation now and whether Ngee Ann College\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis now already a university, or whether they will act\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  former plans and  turn  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege   from  a  small  college  into  a  community\r\n\r\ncollege?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thong Saw Pak Review Committee was appointed on\r\n\r\nthe  16th of April, 1966. Let us look at the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau  report on this occasion. Professor  Thong\r\n\r\nSaw  Pak was reported to have said that the Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege  students would be issued certificates.  From\r\n\r\nthe following year the College would be turned from a\r\n\r\nprivate  institution into a public community college.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  Ngee Ann College would continue to  develop\r\n\r\nto  enable it to become a body which would  have  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  a university to meet the requirements  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At  the same time, Professor  Thong  also\r\n\r\npointed  out  that the interests of the  students  of\r\n\r\nNgee Ann College would be taken care of and that they\r\n\r\nshould  not  agitate  or do anything  detrimental  to\r\n\r\ntheir own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that students should not\r\n\r\ntake  part  in  any undesirable activities.  However,\r\n\r\nthey  should not be made use of by a handful of anti-national elements. There are several ways whereby the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the Ngee Ann College students  can  be\r\n\r\ntaken  care  of.  Firstly,  the  College  authorities\r\n\r\nshould have close contact with the students. Students\r\n\r\nof  any  college  or school, if their performance  or\r\n\r\nbehaviour  is good, should be respected  or  be  duly\r\n\r\nrewarded by the Government and members of the public.\r\n\r\nIf  their behaviour is not good, of course, they will\r\n\r\nearn  the  disrespect of the public. Then  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen  to  the other students who are  in  the  same\r\n\r\ncollege  or school? That is the present situation  of\r\n\r\nNgee Ann College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, concerning the development of Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nCollege,  the Review Committee said that in 1964  Mr\r\n\r\nSinger  from  the Carnegie Corporation and  Professor\r\n\r\nLucian   Pye   of  the  Massachusetts  Institute   of\r\n\r\nTechnology  had been invited by Ngee Ann  College  to\r\n\r\nstudy  and  review the position concerning  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege.  In  their recommendations,  they  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  Ngee  Ann  College should  become  a  community\r\n\r\ncollege, namely, a junior college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere it clearly tells us that a community college  is\r\n\r\na  junior college. On the 6th of April last  year,  a\r\n\r\nstatement   was  published  saying  that   from   the\r\n\r\nfollowing  year Ngee Ann College would be reorganised\r\n\r\ninto  a  public college and not a junior college.  Is\r\n\r\nthere no contradiction between these two statements?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Ngee Ann College at its inception was\r\n\r\nintended  to  be on par with any ordinary university.\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that in an ordinary university\r\n\r\nthere are several faculties. But Ngee Ann College has\r\n\r\navailable only a few courses. If it can increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of its courses, would it not he able to  turn\r\n\r\nitself into a university? And when the time comes,  a\r\n\r\nscholars'   committee  can  be  appointed   to   make\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on how to turn Ngee Ann College  into  a\r\n\r\nuniversity   or  an  organisation  on  par   with   a\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Sir, if you are a student  of  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege,  would you be satisfied with  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nsuggestion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Thong Saw Pak Report has, after long\r\n\r\nconsideration, quoted what has been expressed by  the\r\n\r\nPye/  Singer  Report  concerning  Singapore's  higher\r\n\r\neducation.  Some  degrees are conferred  by  American\r\n\r\nuniversities or colleges which are not famous.  Would\r\n\r\nyou  agree  to  this? Is it true  that  some  of  our\r\n\r\neducationists  here  have  only  degrees  issued   by\r\n\r\ncertain   not   very  famous  American  colleges   or\r\n\r\nuniversities? This argument is not quite  correct  or\r\n\r\nproper in the context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the 1965 Ngee Ann College\r\n\r\nSouvenir.  Let us look at it. We can see  that  wrong\r\n\r\nthings  have  been  said  about  the  professors  and\r\n\r\nteachers  of Ngee Ann College. I would like  more  or\r\n\r\nless  to enumerate the qualifications and experiences\r\n\r\nof  the teachers of Ngee Ann College. Dr Wen got his\r\n\r\ndoctorate from Germany and was the Dean of  a  Taiwan\r\n\r\nUniversity,   Science  Faculty.  Dr  Lee   got   his\r\n\r\ndoctorate from Paris and was a Professor in a  Taiwan\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the 218th issue of Free World. Here\r\n\r\nit   mentions   that  the  Committee  reviewing   the\r\n\r\nqualifications of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  teachers had, as one of its members, one Dr Hu-hse.  He is one of the most famous scholars of China.\r\n\r\nDr  Yang  Sang  Chew  - he has been  brought  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and is also a citizen of Singapore. He  had\r\n\r\na    doctorate   in   Mathematics   from   Brantridge\r\n\r\nUniversity.  And  Dr  Shueng Su-loon  came  from  an\r\n\r\nAmerican university - Cornell University. From  these\r\n\r\nenumerated  facts regarding their qualifications  and\r\n\r\nexperiences, we know that the teachers  of  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege  are not teachers without qualifications,  as\r\n\r\nalleged  in  the Pye/ Singer Report. There  are  also\r\n\r\nother   people   with   quite  high   qualifications.\r\n\r\nProfessor  Kuan was in the Massachusetts  College  of\r\n\r\nTechnology, and many such teachers have been teaching\r\n\r\nin   other  universities.  The  present  teacher   of\r\n\r\nGeography  in  Ngee  Ann College  was  a  teacher  of\r\n\r\nGeography  in Nanyang University and a Faculty  Head.\r\n\r\nProfessor  Chen  also taught in a Taiwan  University.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Ngee Ann College has other teachers  who\r\n\r\nhave  a  string  of  degrees and titles  after  their\r\n\r\nnames. Can you say that when these teachers with high\r\n\r\nqualifications  come to teach in  Ngee  Ann  College,\r\n\r\ntheir  values depreciate all of a sudden? We  can  be\r\n\r\nproud of the fact that, although Ngee Ann College  is\r\n\r\na  new  College, it has obtained the services  of  so\r\n\r\nmany scholars of repute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Chinese Press of 8th May,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a news item about a campaign  to  conduct\r\n\r\nteaching in the mother tongue. It also went on to say\r\n\r\nthat  Ngee  Ann College has a very short history  and\r\n\r\nthat  some  of the graduates of a recent  batch  have\r\n\r\ngone  to  New Zealand and other countries for further\r\n\r\neducation. Can these concrete facts be denied?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill and I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it will be very helpful  to  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege in its future administration and development.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to express the hope that the Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege  students  will face facts  and  not  involve\r\n\r\nthemselves  in political intrigues and  go  out  with\r\n\r\nothers  shouting empty political slogans.  They  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  the present practical realities  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry and go along the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright  path.  Furthermore, if  there  is  mutual  co-operation  \r\n\r\namong  Ngee Ann Kongsi - the  sponsors  of\r\n\r\nNgee Ann College - the Government and members of  the\r\n\r\npublic, Ngee Ann College can be turned into a  centre\r\n\r\nof  learning from where talented and useful  citizens\r\n\r\nof this country can emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we all know that education in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been  making great progress in keeping with  the\r\n\r\npolitical   situation.   This   progress   has   been\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  in  nature  and  we  must  trace   its\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Such a development should be in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  our  situation and time. Ever  since  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecame  a  sovereign  independent  State,  tremendous\r\n\r\nadvance has been made in various fields and this  has\r\n\r\ninstilled  a  spirit of optimism in  the  people  and\r\n\r\naugurs  well for our future. Education plays  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant role in national development. The trend and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of education is a matter of great concern\r\n\r\nto  the people of Singapore. Everyone must sit up and\r\n\r\ntake notice of this fact. On 22nd November, 1965,  at\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  Educational Conference  in  Bangkok,  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Education  spoke  on  the   Five-Year\r\n\r\nEducation  Plan  of  Singapore  and  emphasised   the\r\n\r\nfollowing points:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to improve the quality of education;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to expand secondary education and tertiary\r\n\r\neducation; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to set up various kinds of special institutes\r\n\r\nand  colleges in order to cope with  the  needs\r\n\r\nof an industrialised society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  also  said  that  we should expand  our  existing\r\n\r\nfacilities to improve the standard of education  and,\r\n\r\nin  general,  foster  the growth  of  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety  through  education. From  all  this,  it  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that  before  this  Bill  was  tabled,   the\r\n\r\neducational content of Ngee Ann College had not  kept\r\n\r\npace with the post-independent era of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the various courses in Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nCollege.   There  are  seven  courses:  (1)   Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage; (2) Malay language; (3) Domestic Science;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Business Administration; (5) Accountancy; (6)\r\n\r\nApplied  Chemistry; and (7) Telecommunications.  This\r\n\r\nis  mentioned in the first chapter of the  Thong  Saw\r\n\r\nPak Report. We must admit that the setting up of such\r\n\r\ncourses is not in keeping with our need for a  proper\r\n\r\ndivision  of labour and is a waste of our  human  and\r\n\r\nmaterial resources. These courses have not only  been\r\n\r\nduplicated  in  Nanyang University but  also  in  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic. In other words, all these courses,  with\r\n\r\nthe exception of Domestic Science, have also been set\r\n\r\nup  in  Nanyang University and the Polytechnic.  Such\r\n\r\nduplication  of  courses is not in keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of making use of what we have learnt and  has\r\n\r\nnot  taken account of our needs. What special talents\r\n\r\ndo  we  need in our society? Ngee Ann College  should\r\n\r\nset  up  courses  such  as  Arts  and  those  courses\r\n\r\nconnected  with Arts. Everyone is aware of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  any  university or college is an institute  for\r\n\r\nthe training of talents. We must set up courses which\r\n\r\nare needed by society. Our next generation must learn\r\n\r\nto   make  full  use  of  their  talents.  If  higher\r\n\r\neducation   is  not  concerned  with  the  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities of students, and if students  are  mass\r\n\r\nproduced,  the graduates of institutes  will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to find employment. They and their parents will\r\n\r\ninevitably be disappointed. Therefore, I suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  courses  which are taught in other  universities\r\n\r\nand  colleges should not be duplicated  in  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Ngee Ann College can train people on\r\n\r\nthe  physical  side  of education.  This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  need  of our society. Our  past  education\r\n\r\npolicy  has  not paid much attention to the  need  of\r\n\r\nphysical   education.   As  Singapore   is   now   an\r\n\r\nindependent nation, we must have a rugged  and  brave\r\n\r\ngeneration. Therefore, we must train our teachers  to\r\n\r\nteach  our  next generation to be rugged  and  brave.\r\n\r\nTeachers  from abroad are not suitable to  train  our\r\n\r\nyounger generation, as they can only train people  to\r\n\r\nbe  courageous but lacking in patriotism. Let us look\r\n\r\nat  the  countries around us in South-east Asia.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  Cambodia,  Thailand  and  Formosa  have  an\r\n\r\ninstitute  for  physical education. But  in  our  own\r\n\r\ncountry,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Government  is  stressing  the  need  for\r\n\r\nphysical  education, we do not  have  a  college  for\r\n\r\nphysical  education.  This is a  matter  for  regret.\r\n\r\nEverybody cannot deny that as an independent  nation,\r\n\r\nwe  must  stress the importance of national survival.\r\n\r\nEmphasis  should  not be put on  the  survival  of  a\r\n\r\nparticular college, and this should be our assessment\r\n\r\nof values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should train our younger generation to be brave,\r\n\r\nstrong,  and  determined  citizens,  and  to   become\r\n\r\nmembers   of  a  closely-knit  society.   We   should\r\n\r\nstrengthen our younger generation so that  they  will\r\n\r\nbe  energetic,  of upright character, and  strong  in\r\n\r\nbody  and mind, to enable them to play their role  in\r\n\r\nnation-building. Therefore, university undergrads  or\r\n\r\ncollege  students should be people who are strong  in\r\n\r\nbody  and mind, who are determined, and who are  full\r\n\r\nof  vitality, energy and stamina. Apart from this, it\r\n\r\nis  also  important that they should also be equipped\r\n\r\nwith   knowledge  and  discipline.  They  should   be\r\n\r\npatriotic and loyal to their country, dedicated,  and\r\n\r\nbe willing or prepared to sacrifice themselves in the\r\n\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must also pay attention to\r\n\r\nthe  academic  side of a college or  university.  The\r\n\r\nPrincipal  of Ngee Ann College is to be appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe Council according to this Bill, and there will be\r\n\r\na  Senate  formed  by  the academic  staff  who  will\r\n\r\nsupervise  its academic affairs. I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  the Senate should  also  include  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  or  two  scholars of  high  international\r\n\r\nstanding to carry out joint research into measures to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the discipline and to raise the  academic\r\n\r\nstandard of the college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, university education is the acme of our\r\n\r\nnational  education. It not only produces specialists\r\n\r\nbut it is also a matter of prestige for a country  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  university. Whether a university is properly\r\n\r\nrun or not will affect other levels of education, for\r\n\r\nexample,  secondary  and primary education.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso affect the international image of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to point out is that every year\r\n\r\nevery  student is entitled to a bursary of $120  from\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann  College,  compared  with  $2,000  for  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  students. We know that Ngee Ann  College\r\n\r\ncannot  truly be a college. What it should do  is  to\r\n\r\nbuild itself up gradually by setting up courses which\r\n\r\nare needed by our society, and eventually grow into a\r\n\r\nfull-fledged  college.  As a matter  of  fact,  every\r\n\r\ncollege,  apart  from  its  general  courses,  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate on one or two important courses in  order\r\n\r\nto  cope  with  the  needs of our  society,  such  as\r\n\r\ntraining university talent to promote the development\r\n\r\nof  our  country  and to make a greater  contribution\r\n\r\ntowards the advancement of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  Ngee Ann  College  Bill  is  now\r\n\r\nintroduced into this House. According to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education, this is done at the request  of  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  College.  On this, I feel that the Committee  of\r\n\r\nManagement   of  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi  are  very,   very\r\n\r\nrealistic in their approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also shows that the authorities of Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nCollege  are confident about their College. Thus  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  the  Ngee Ann College  students  will  be\r\n\r\nensured. We know that the College was set up in 1963.\r\n\r\nThe  term  is a four-year course. The first batch  of\r\n\r\nstudents will graduate this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy for higher institutions like\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann  College to be successful. I know that  the\r\n\r\nNgee Ann College Development Committee has produced a\r\n\r\nreport. According to this report on Ngee Ann College,\r\n\r\nthere  should be certain prerequisites if  it  is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop.   For  instance,  there  should   be   ample\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources and facilities and a large  team\r\n\r\nof  teachers with good qualifications. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the report says that it is also necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  College to recruit students of an equal standard\r\n\r\nof education. At the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nmoment,  the  students  of  Ngee  Ann  College   have\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  or  standards  of  education.  The\r\n\r\nreport also holds the view that the present situation\r\n\r\nin  Ngee  Ann College is causing concern  because  of\r\n\r\nlack  of  financial resources, poor  facilities,  and\r\n\r\nshortage  of  teaching staff. Therefore,  the  report\r\n\r\nholds the view that in order to turn the College into\r\n\r\na  university  where  it can confer  degrees,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for it to consider its problems further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ngee Ann College Bill, as we all know, is\r\n\r\nbased  on  the Thong Saw Pak Report. The  report  has\r\n\r\ngone  into a detailed discussion of the role of  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  College and the courses to be provided,  it  has\r\n\r\nalso  gone into the details of higher education  that\r\n\r\nwe need, and it suggests that Ngee Ann College should\r\n\r\nnot  set  up courses in those fields already provided\r\n\r\nby  other  higher  institutions of learning.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the report says that Ngee  Ann  College\r\n\r\nshould specialise in technology and commerce in order\r\n\r\nto keep up with the needs of industrialisation in our\r\n\r\ncountry. Therefore, it suggests three points  in  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  new  students. Firstly,  specialised\r\n\r\ntraining  should  include  engineering  and  commerce\r\n\r\nreaching  a  degree  standard. Secondly,  large-scale\r\n\r\ncomprehensive training to enable the students  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared   to  meet  the  changes  in  commerce   and\r\n\r\nindustry. Thirdly, to recruit apprentices for  newly-established industries and firms. On this it suggests\r\n\r\nthat  there  should  be prior consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that these suggestions are\r\n\r\nvery  practical and useful because we are  developing\r\n\r\nthe  College  and the talent produced by  our  higher\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of learning should be in  keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe  needs of our society. If the higher institutions\r\n\r\nof our country do not plan well for their development\r\n\r\nbut   engage  themselves  in  producing  a  body   of\r\n\r\ngraduates  who  are not useful in the development  of\r\n\r\nour  country, then a social problem will  be  created\r\n\r\nfor our country to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also provides for the setting up of\r\n\r\na  Council  whose members will include the  Principal\r\n\r\nand Deans of Faculties, three representatives of Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  Kongsi, three members appointed by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education,  one representative of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, and some others. But the Bill does\r\n\r\nnot   provide  for  student  representation  on  this\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Is it because the Ngee Ann College students\r\n\r\nhad  staged  a  boycott of classes in the  past,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore cannot have the right to be represented  on\r\n\r\nthe  Council?  This  is quite  contrary  to  what  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in the Nanyang University Council  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  student  representation.  So  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will be able to clarify the matter  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Ngee Ann College has only a short\r\n\r\nhistory of four years, there have been many incidents\r\n\r\nconnected  with  it. For instance,  in  October  last\r\n\r\nyear,  there was a boycott by its students.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  this  boycott  was agitated  by  elements  with\r\n\r\nulterior motives. It did not have the support of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral mass of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that when this Bill is passed and\r\n\r\nenforced, it will be able to help Ngee Ann College to\r\n\r\ndevelop  properly on correct lines and  to  help  our\r\n\r\ncountry to produce talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision\r\n\r\nto set up Ngee Ann College as a community college was\r\n\r\ntaken  by  Ngee Ann Kongsi itself, and this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintroduced  at the request of the Kongsi. Actually  I\r\n\r\nam  a  bit  puzzled because the Member  for  Thomson,\r\n\r\nwhilst  supporting  the introduction  of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nspoke against the concept of a community college. The\r\n\r\nBill  provides specifically for the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  college. I do not see  how  he  can  speak\r\n\r\nagainst the setting up of a community college and yet\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not going into the merits\r\n\r\nand  demerits of the academic staff appointed by Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn College\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nand  whether  the existing Ngee Ann College  has  the\r\n\r\nfacilities,  the staff and the financial  support  to\r\n\r\nenable it to be run as a university. I think all this\r\n\r\nhas  been thoroughly gone into by the Thong  Saw  Pak\r\n\r\nCommittee. Most of the comments raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  should, I think, have been directed  to\r\n\r\nNgee Ann Kongsi anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar raised the question of the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a Department of Physical Education  for\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann College.

We are, in fact,  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  planning  the  setting  up  of  such   a\r\n\r\ndepartment  at the Teachers' Training College.

There  have  been  instances   where\r\n\r\nmanufacturers have asked for the imposition of  quota\r\n\r\nrestrictions,  and  with  the  knowledge  that   such\r\n\r\nrestrictions would be implemented soon, they or their\r\n\r\nfriends are suspected to have taken advantage of  the\r\n\r\nproviso  to  section  5 of the Ordinance  by  placing\r\n\r\norders with overseas buyers in quantities much larger\r\n\r\nthan  they  normally  import and  establish  covering\r\n\r\nletters  of credit just before the quota restrictions\r\n\r\nare imposed. There are also instances where merchants\r\n\r\nand   banks   are  suspected  to  have  connived   in\r\n\r\nbackdating letters of credit so as to take  advantage\r\n\r\nof  opportunities  arising  from  the  imposition  of\r\n\r\nquotas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to prevent these disruptive\r\n\r\npractices,  it is considered that the recognition  of\r\n\r\nan   irrevocable   letter   of   credit   should   be\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  and  not mandatory.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nwhere  letters  of credit have been  opened  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith,  then  such imports will be  allowed.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, if there are strong grounds of suspicion\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  improper advantage  being  taken  of\r\n\r\nforeknowledge of a quota or ban or that the banks, in\r\n\r\nconnivance  with  the traders, have  backdated  their\r\n\r\nletters  of  credit,  then the imports  will  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  even if irrevocable letters of  credit  have\r\n\r\nbeen established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was originally proposed that\r\n\r\nthe  proviso to section 5 of the Control  of  Imports\r\n\r\nand Exports Ordinance (Chapter 214) be deleted so  as\r\n\r\nto  enable  Government to cancel, suspend,  amend  or\r\n\r\ndisallow  any  import  licence or  permit  for  goods\r\n\r\ncovered  by an irrevocable letter of credit. However,\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers of Commerce and banks have advised that\r\n\r\nthe   deletion  of  this  proviso  would   give   the\r\n\r\nController  and  Registrar  of  Imports  and  Exports\r\n\r\nunfettered powers to cancel even import licences  for\r\n\r\ngoods   covered   by   genuine  letters   of   credit\r\n\r\nestablished   in   good  faith.   This   may   create\r\n\r\nuncertainty  among the trade and could react  to  the\r\n\r\ndiscredit  of  Singapore  as  a  trading  centre.  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, propose to suggest an amendment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  clause 2 of the Bill during the Committee  stage.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment  will give the Government  powers  to\r\n\r\nreject, cancel or suspend import licences covered  by\r\n\r\nirrevocable  letters  of  credit  suspected   to   be\r\n\r\nestablished not in good faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\namendment to the Bill amending the Control of Imports\r\n\r\nand Exports Ordinance attempts to restrict the powers\r\n\r\nsought  in  the  Bill  which,  as  it  stands,  gives\r\n\r\nabsolute  discretion to the Controller to  cancel  or\r\n\r\nvary  import  licences whether or not an  irrevocable\r\n\r\nletter  of  credit exists. This amendment  is  to  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  as  Singapore is a trading  city.  Whatever\r\n\r\nmight   be   the  success  of  its  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme, its geographical position determines  that\r\n\r\nits  trading activity will go on expanding. And in  a\r\n\r\ntrading city traders must feel secured that bona fide\r\n\r\narrangements  and  commitments  in  trade   will   be\r\n\r\nhonoured.  The essence in trade is that delivery  and\r\n\r\nacceptance  are made as scheduled. I quite appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  there have been and there will be circumstances\r\n\r\nin  which it is justifiable for the State to step  in\r\n\r\nand  interfere  with trade. But I  submit  that  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances must be rare and far between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wording of the amendment, I should like to\r\n\r\nhear  the views of the Members of this House who  are\r\n\r\nin  the  legal profession. As a layman, I  see  great\r\n\r\ndifficulties in implementing the law if the amendment\r\n\r\nas  it  stands is passed. My experience  in  business\r\n\r\ntells  me  that all letters of credit are established\r\n\r\nin  good  faith  by the banker and  his  client,  the\r\n\r\nimporter. Without such good faith or confidence,  the\r\n\r\nbanker  will  not issue a letter of credit.  I  think\r\n\r\nwhat  is  in  doubt  is not so much  the  good  faith\r\n\r\nbetween  the banker and his client as the  morals  of\r\n\r\nthe  importer.  Circumstances  may  arise  where   an\r\n\r\nimporter,  as  the  Minister  for  Finance  has  just\r\n\r\nmentioned, armed with foreknowledge acquired  legally\r\n\r\nor  more  likely  illegally,  attempts  to  frustrate\r\n\r\nGovernment's intentions and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenriches  himself by extraordinary imports.  For  one\r\n\r\nman  to enrich himself in this way at the expense  of\r\n\r\nthe  nation  and the people is obviously immoral  and\r\n\r\nreprehensible. Tire State, indeed, has a duty to step\r\n\r\nin.  What  I  am  worried  is  whether  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment as it stands enables the State to do  this.\r\n\r\nI  should feel happier if Members in this House  will\r\n\r\nassist  with  words which will enable  the  State  to\r\n\r\nintervene  and only intervene in the circumstances  I\r\n\r\nhave narrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, far from\r\n\r\ninterfering in any trading that is being  carried  on\r\n\r\nin   Singapore,  it  is  the  avowed  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  allow freedom of  trade  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible.  But, as I have said in moving  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  the Bill, we have come across  instances\r\n\r\nwhere letters of credit were opened and there was  an\r\n\r\nabsence  of good faith. In fact, there was connivance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  banks.  Hence the  necessity  for  this\r\n\r\namendment. I can assure the Member for Havelock  that\r\n\r\nthe wording of the amendment as it stands will enable\r\n\r\nus  to  prevent  or discourage such malpractices  and\r\n\r\npunishment   meted  out  if  they  ever  arise.   The\r\n\r\namendment has been vetted by the S.A.G.'s Office and,\r\n\r\nas  far as I can ascertain, the legal phraseology  is\r\n\r\nas  it  should be. If the hon.

Under the existing Trade Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  workers employed by statutory  boards  or\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies  such  as  the  Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority,  unlike Government servants  are  free  to\r\n\r\njoin  any trade union they like. For instance,  there\r\n\r\nis  nothing  to  prevent gas workers  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board from enrolling as members in  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing  general unions  which  cater  for  all\r\n\r\ncategories of workers in the private sector  if  they\r\n\r\nchoose  to do so. This laxity in the trade union  law\r\n\r\nhas  created a ludicrous situation in which  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  workers  engaged in essential services  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector are tied up with a predominant  number\r\n\r\nof   other   categories  of  workers  in   the   same\r\n\r\norganisation,  and that the former is  bound  by  the\r\n\r\nconstitution of the organisation to act according  to\r\n\r\nwhatever is the majority decision, including that  on\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  taken  by  the  latter.   As   an\r\n\r\nillustration,  I cite the case of the  Public  Daily-Rated  Transport  Workers' Union. This  union  has  a\r\n\r\nmembership  of 839 daily-rated workers, 402  of  whom\r\n\r\nare  from  the Public Works Department, 212 from  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Health  Department, and 225 from  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities   Board.  Its  25-man  executive  committee\r\n\r\nconsist  of 17 Government daily-rated workers  and  8\r\n\r\nworkers  from the Public Utilities Board. The control\r\n\r\nof  the union and the management of its affairs  are,\r\n\r\ntherefore, in the hands of the Government daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers because of their overwhelming majority. Under\r\n\r\nthis peculiar set-up, the 225 members from the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board can never act independently.  Within\r\n\r\nthe union they have to abide by the majority decision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Government daily-rated workers  even  though\r\n\r\nsuch decision may conflict with their own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until its deregistration recently, the Public Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation was also in the\r\n\r\nsame  unhealthy  position. There were  13  unions  of\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers affiliated  to  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThree  of  them catered for workers employed  by  the\r\n\r\nPublic   Utilities  Board  in  the  Water,  Gas   and\r\n\r\nElectricity  services.  One catered  for  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board and the Government transport workers.\r\n\r\nAnother catered for the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  remaining eight  catered  for  workers\r\n\r\nemployed   by   Government.  The  Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  the  Federation  was  composed  of  21\r\n\r\nmembers. But the 4,500 workers employed by the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board, who constituted more than one-third\r\n\r\nof  the aggregate membership of the affiliates of the\r\n\r\nFederation,  had  only 5 representatives  sitting  in\r\n\r\nthat  Central Executive Committee. Under this set-up,\r\n\r\nthis group of 4,500 workers in the essential services\r\n\r\nalso  had  to  follow whatever decision was  made  by\r\n\r\nthose  workers not engaged in the essential  services\r\n\r\nwho  constituted the majority. Surely this is not the\r\n\r\nway  trade union democracy should be practised in our\r\n\r\ndemocratic   society.   This   pattern    of    union\r\n\r\norganisation  is not only undesirable,  but  it  also\r\n\r\nprovides  a  danger  point for  the  enemies  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  to disrupt civil order. The recent  illegal\r\n\r\ncleansing strike and the threatened general strike of\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers  in  the  public  sector  was  a\r\n\r\nclassic example of how easily this situation could be\r\n\r\nexploited to deprive the people of Singapore of their\r\n\r\ndaily   essential   supplies  of   water,   gas   and\r\n\r\nelectricity.  The overall economic situation  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry and Singapore's economic future demands  that\r\n\r\npositive  measures should be taken to regularise  the\r\n\r\nposition.   The  services  provided  by  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board are part of the vital services of the\r\n\r\ncountry.  I  am  sure that all of  us  who  have  our\r\n\r\neconomic future at heart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  agree that it is absolutely necessary that  the\r\n\r\nworkers in this area should he given full freedom  to\r\n\r\nact  independently  in their own  organisation.  They\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  given adequate  protection  against\r\n\r\noutside  control and exploitation to ensure that  our\r\n\r\nvital  public  utilities will not be  jeopardised  by\r\n\r\nirresponsible  elements using deplorable  tactics  to\r\n\r\ncoerce  conformity under the pretext of  trade  union\r\n\r\ndemocracy.   Briefly,  Sir,  these   are   the   main\r\n\r\nconsiderations which have compelled the Government to\r\n\r\nintroduce the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill confers on the Minister discretionary\r\n\r\npowers  to specify any statutory board or body  whose\r\n\r\nemployees  shall  have to form their  own  union.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  more  than  one  union  organised  in  the\r\n\r\nspecific  statutory hoard or body,  they  may  freely\r\n\r\nenter  into  amalgamation or form a federation  among\r\n\r\nthemselves,  but  the  consent  of  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the  purpose  of  affiliation   to   a\r\n\r\nfederation  of  trade unions if one or  more  of  its\r\n\r\naffiliates cater for workers other than employees  of\r\n\r\nthat particular statutory board or body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions in the Bill will affect the\r\n\r\nemployees  of only a few statutory boards  which  are\r\n\r\nproviding  the vital services of the country.  It  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  the  intention of the  Government  to\r\n\r\nalter  the present position with regard to the  trade\r\n\r\nunion activities of employees of statutory boards  or\r\n\r\nbodies  which  are not connected with  the  essential\r\n\r\nservices, or are less important as far as the running\r\n\r\nof  the economy of the country is concerned, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Adult  Education  Board, the  Seamen's  Registry\r\n\r\nBoard,  the Central Provident Fund Board and  so  on.\r\n\r\nIronically, it is just because these provisions  will\r\n\r\naffect  only  a  few  existing  unions  that  vicious\r\n\r\naccusations  are  being made,  both  locally  and  at\r\n\r\ninternational level, that the Trade Unions  Ordinance\r\n\r\nis  being amended to crush an institutional group and\r\n\r\nto  suppress  freedom of association.  This  is  very\r\n\r\nuntrue.   Only   persons  with  an  irrational   mind\r\n\r\nstimulated by sinister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotives can make such an irresponsible and irrational\r\n\r\nallegation.  I  regret  to say that  the  Amalgamated\r\n\r\nUnions of Public Employees confused the issue further\r\n\r\nby  rushing to print in its journal, the Mimbar,  its\r\n\r\nletter to the Prime Minister which contained a number\r\n\r\nof  misleading  points. I hope that the  inaccuracies\r\n\r\nare  just honest mistakes made by the writers who had\r\n\r\nmisread  the  Bill,  and not a wilful  distortion  of\r\n\r\nfacts  intended  to confuse the issue.  The  A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\nstates, among other things, that the Bill will affect\r\n\r\nthe  Teachers' Union because the Minister may declare\r\n\r\nthe  aided-school teachers as a body, in which  event\r\n\r\nthe  aided-school teachers will have to form separate\r\n\r\nunions.  The  A.U.P.E. also claims that the  Minister\r\n\r\nmay  declare  a  group of Government employees  as  a\r\n\r\nbody, thereby forcing such group of employees to form\r\n\r\na  separate  union. It also jumps to  the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat   the  registration  of  the  Singapore   School\r\n\r\nClerical Staff Union a month after the First  Reading\r\n\r\nof the Bill, is an attempt to splinter the A.U.P.E. I\r\n\r\nwould   never   have  imagined  that  such   shocking\r\n\r\nmisrepresentations could come from the A.U.P.E. whose\r\n\r\nefficient organisation and capable leadership I  have\r\n\r\nlong admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the wording of subsection (1) of the new\r\n\r\nsection  29A  of  the Bill is plain and  simple.  The\r\n\r\noperative  phrase  is, \"No workman employed  by  such\r\n\r\nstatutory  board or body.. .\". Aided-school  teachers\r\n\r\nare  not employed by any statutory board or body.  It\r\n\r\nis absolute nonsense to suggest that the Minister has\r\n\r\nthe power or intends to specify aided-school teachers\r\n\r\nor  a group of Government employees as a body. I will\r\n\r\nrepeat  here that the Bill will not in any way affect\r\n\r\nthe teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Singapore School Clerical Staff\r\n\r\nUnion, the fact that its registration came after  the\r\n\r\nFirst Reading of the Bill is just a coincidence. This\r\n\r\nunion  was formed by a group of Chinese school clerks\r\n\r\nin  November  1966  after  they  had  failed  to  get\r\n\r\nthemselves admitted to the Chinese School Teachers'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion,  because its constitution does not  cater  for\r\n\r\nmembership   of   clerks.  The  union   applied   for\r\n\r\nregistration   on  10th  November,  1966,   and   was\r\n\r\nregistered on 8th April, 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have just said, this union was formed by\r\n\r\nChinese  school clerks and its object is to  organise\r\n\r\nthe  clerks in Chinese schools. Although the  union's\r\n\r\nrules  do  not debar the clerical staff in Government\r\n\r\nschools  from joining its membership, the union  will\r\n\r\nnot be able to recruit the Government school clerical\r\n\r\nstaff, the reason being that this is a non-Government\r\n\r\nservant  union  and the clerical staff in  Government\r\n\r\nschools  are  debarred  by  law  from  joining   non-Government  servant unions. On the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. is  not  permitted  by  law  and  its   own\r\n\r\nconstitution  to recruit as members clerks  in  aided\r\n\r\nschools.  I therefore see no reason why the  A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\nshould  take objection to the Chinese school  clerks,\r\n\r\nwho  have  hitherto  no union  to  look  after  their\r\n\r\ninterests,  coming  together and  forming  their  own\r\n\r\nunion. Perhaps it was confused thinking that prompted\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  of  the A.U.P.E. to  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of the Singapore School Clerical  Staff\r\n\r\nUnion  has anything to do with the Bill and that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  are intended  to  splinter  the A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it remains now for me to repeat that the Bill\r\n\r\nis not designed to crush any individual or union. Its\r\n\r\nsole  purpose  is  to rationalise the  organisational\r\n\r\npattern   of  trade  unions  in  the  public   sector\r\n\r\nconnected  with essential services. But  some  people\r\n\r\nfoolishly  believe  that they are  so  important  and\r\n\r\nindestructible that the Government has  to  take  the\r\n\r\ntrouble to pass this law just to cause their downfall\r\n\r\nand nothing else. This is childish thinking. If it is\r\n\r\nonly  a  few individuals that are worrying us,  there\r\n\r\nare  many other methods and laws which we can use  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  them. We need not have to go through  all\r\n\r\nthese  First, Second and Third Readings to get a  new\r\n\r\nBill  passed. These few individuals can be dealt with\r\n\r\neffectively  and conclusively. But what we  are  more\r\n\r\nconcerned with is the future of our economy on  which\r\n\r\nthe   livelihood  of  all  of  us  depends.  We   are\r\n\r\ndetermined that no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none - not even the strongest personality in the trade\r\n\r\nunion  field - can do anything to cause the  loss  of\r\n\r\nconfidence in our economy. However, there may be some\r\n\r\npeople - forces from outside, for instance - who like\r\n\r\nto  see our economy go down. One way they can do this\r\n\r\nis  by  manipulating  some of our  trade  unions  and\r\n\r\nleaders and causing labour unrest. The way things are\r\n\r\nwith  many  categories of workers  in  the  essential\r\n\r\nservices grouped together in one giant union,  it  is\r\n\r\ncomparatively  easy  for anyone  to  create  a  minor\r\n\r\nindustrial dispute in any section, then spreading  it\r\n\r\nto affect the workers in the whole union, and in next\r\n\r\nto no time we will find strikes all over the place  -\r\n\r\ntelephone,  post  office,  water,  electricity,  gas,\r\n\r\ntelegraph services all stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

This will definitely shake the economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, causing a flight of capital. This Bill  is\r\n\r\nonly one of the measures to safeguard against such  a\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of talk about this Bill being in\r\n\r\ncontravention   of  the  principle  of   freedom   of\r\n\r\nassociation of the I.L.O. But we are not denying  any\r\n\r\nworker  his right to join any trade union. We do  not\r\n\r\neven  want  to  deregister the A.U.P.E or  any  other\r\n\r\nomnibus union or hamper its work. In fact, this  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  read the First time on the 27th of February this\r\n\r\nyear  and  it  should  have gone through  its  Second\r\n\r\nReading in the last Parliament sitting in March.  But\r\n\r\nwe  deliberately postponed it to give fair notice  to\r\n\r\nall  concerned, including the A.U.P.E. We have  given\r\n\r\nthem  ample time to readjust their internal  affairs.\r\n\r\nWith  the  time given, they can, I am sure, form  new\r\n\r\nunions  for workers in the different statutory boards\r\n\r\nif they want to and we will have no objection to such\r\n\r\na  move.  But I regret to say that the A.U.P.E. have\r\n\r\nnot   made  use  of  the  time  available   to   make\r\n\r\nreadjustments  within the union.  Instead  they  have\r\n\r\ntaken this postponement to mean weakness on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the Government. They even cherish the faint  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  yield to pressure applied from within  and\r\n\r\nwithout the country and withdraw the Bill. I must say\r\n\r\nthat they have taken the wrong advice. We know we are\r\n\r\ndoing  the right thing for Singapore and we will  not\r\n\r\nyield  to  any lobbying or pressure. We  can  justify\r\n\r\npublicly in Singapore the course we are taking and we\r\n\r\nare prepared to justify it on an international level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not affect the affiliation of local\r\n\r\ntrade    unions   to   international   trade    union\r\n\r\norganisations. In recent years, more and  more  local\r\n\r\ntrade unions have extended their activities into  the\r\n\r\ninternational field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsorry that the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill has been\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Minister for Labour.  Its  object  is\r\n\r\nnothing  else but to break up and control the  unions\r\n\r\nby a policy of divide and rule. Perhaps he is worried\r\n\r\nabout  workers  who are uniting in a  militant  trade\r\n\r\nunion  to  struggle for their own rights.  Amendments\r\n\r\none  after another to the Trade Unions Ordinance have\r\n\r\nbeen   moved   in  this  Parliament  to  stifle   the\r\n\r\nachievements  of unions who have made  progress.  Not\r\n\r\nlong  ago,  an  amendment Bill was approved  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament  to prohibit P.U.B. employees from  taking\r\n\r\nindustrial  action. There were also other amendments,\r\n\r\nand  bank employees were also affected. All this goes\r\n\r\nto  show  that  the  trade unions will  face  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult situation. The Minister for Labour believes\r\n\r\nthat the militant trade unions can be controlled only\r\n\r\nin  this way. But he is unaware that the workers  are\r\n\r\nfully conscious of the tactics of employers to weaken\r\n\r\nthem  and that they are ever willing to struggle  for\r\n\r\ntheir legitimate rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on one occasion, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour, when refuting a statement made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah, said that the Member for Bras  Basah\r\n\r\ntook   part  in  trade  union  activities  only  very\r\n\r\nrecently.  He  also said that he had more  experience\r\n\r\nand  that although he had been to prison at one time,\r\n\r\nit would not dampen his spirit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  struggle for the cause of labour. Today he is the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Labour.  Likewise  the  workers   are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  sacrifice  their  time  and  energy  to\r\n\r\nstruggle for their legitimate rights and interests. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the spirit of the workers of  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  strong  today, unlike in the past, and that  they\r\n\r\nare  prepared to face any consequences. So with  this\r\n\r\namendment  Bill,  I  think the workers  will  not  he\r\n\r\nweakened in their struggle for their rights.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  they will consolidate their  position  and\r\n\r\nthey  will be even more determined to fight for their\r\n\r\ninterests in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy of the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  unite  trade unions  and  to  abolish\r\n\r\nsplinter  or  yellow  unions  has  been  welcomed  by\r\n\r\nworkers  throughout Singapore. It  was  through  this\r\n\r\npolicy  that  the ruling party, which is  pro-labour,\r\n\r\ncame  to  power.  Many unions have  adhered  to  this\r\n\r\npolicy  with  the  result that  unions  catering  for\r\n\r\ninsurance   company  workers,  bank  employees,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Manual and Mercantile Workers'  Union  and\r\n\r\nmany other unions have been established. But what  is\r\n\r\nstrange  is that this amendment Bill mainly  concerns\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the P.U.B., whilst workers in commercial\r\n\r\nfirms  are not affected by it. Although the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  has  stated  that  the  object  of  this\r\n\r\namendment  is not to suppress the unions in  general,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, there is no doubt that it  is  directed\r\n\r\nagainst   a  particular  union  or  unions.   It   is\r\n\r\nunjustified,  Mr Speaker, because this amendment  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  restrict a particular union  while  not\r\n\r\naffecting other trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Even so, it is the object\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  that the  trade  union  movement\r\n\r\nshould be strengthened. In these circumstances, trade\r\n\r\nunions which are now united in big organisations  are\r\n\r\nto  be  broken up into splinter unions. This, I feel,\r\n\r\nis  the  real motive of this amendment. If we try  to\r\n\r\nbreak  the match sticks in a box all at once,  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible.  But  to break them one  by  one  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  an  easy  task. If the Government  helps  to\r\n\r\nunite the unions, it will be of great benefit to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   The  statutory  boards  are  now   to   be\r\n\r\nseparated,  and it is also intended that  the  unions\r\n\r\nshould  be  splintered and their backbones broken.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that this is the motive of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each sitting of Parliament the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  brings forward an amendment, and  perhaps  at\r\n\r\nthe  next  sitting too he will bring forward  certain\r\n\r\namendments.  My  feeling is that he really  wants  to\r\n\r\nbreak up the labour movement. He says that he has  in\r\n\r\nmind  the interests of the workers. He ought to  know\r\n\r\nexactly  how to bring about a better labour movement.\r\n\r\nBut  it is totally wrong of him to think of ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  break up the unity of labour.  Members  of\r\n\r\nunions  have  certain rights and if they are  divided\r\n\r\nand broken up,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nthen   this  amendment  does  not  serve  any  useful\r\n\r\npurpose.  Take  the  case of a  union  of  about  100\r\n\r\nmembers.  What  can  they really  do?  How  can  they\r\n\r\nimprove  their  living standard? Can they  fight  for\r\n\r\ntheir  rights?  They cannot. But if they  are  united\r\n\r\nwith  other unions, they can certainly find ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to fight for their rights. Let us take another\r\n\r\nexample,  the public daily-rated workers.  One  union\r\n\r\nmay  ask  for $6 a day wage, and another may ask  for\r\n\r\n$7,  while yet another may ask for $4. If each  union\r\n\r\nasks  for  a  different rate, how  are  we  going  to\r\n\r\nrationalise these demands? But if they all belong  to\r\n\r\none union and speak with one voice, it will be easier\r\n\r\nfor   statutory  boards,  Government,   and   private\r\n\r\ncompanies to deal with this one union. But now,  step\r\n\r\nby step, the unions are being broken up. What will be\r\n\r\nthe  final result for the labour movement?  There  is\r\n\r\nthe  basic  doubt  whether the labour  movement  will\r\n\r\nsurvive in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister spoke about the A.U.P.E. He praised it, and quite rightly so. A.U.P.E. has approximately 40,000 members and it is growing from strength to strength. One day it may be able to pose a threat to the Government. But up to now it has not behaved in such a manner as to threaten the Government. So far\r\n\r\nit  has  followed the labour laws. It has taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the interests of the workers. It has  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  leadership. I do not  think  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen any harmful moves by the A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Government goes on legislating in this\r\n\r\nmanner, it will finally affect the workers to a  very\r\n\r\ngreat  extent.  This is my opinion.  Then  what  will\r\n\r\nbecome of them in the end? This is something we ought\r\n\r\nto consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the labour movement in other\r\n\r\ncountries,  we  find  that some  unions  have  80,000\r\n\r\nmembers;   others   have  100,000  members,   200,000\r\n\r\nmembers, and so on. In such countries we do not  come\r\n\r\nacross  any dangerous elements. Our country is small,\r\n\r\nand  our unions are also small. So if our unions  are\r\n\r\nunited,  they will be able to fight for their rights.\r\n\r\nBut if they are broken up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlittle  by  little, it will not do the Government  or\r\n\r\nour people any good. That is my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in considering this amendment Bill, we\r\n\r\nmust   remember   the  several  other   Trade   Union\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bills that have been passed in this House\r\n\r\nbefore.  I think that this particular amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nshould be sent to Select Committee to seek the  views\r\n\r\nof  the  unions and of the people. Therefore, I  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to send this amendment Bill  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill before the House is significant,  not  for\r\n\r\nany  vigorous  controversy it has  aroused  in  trade\r\n\r\nunion circles in Singapore, but for the misconception\r\n\r\nentertained  in certain international labour  circles\r\n\r\nregarding the intentions of the Bill. It has come  to\r\n\r\nmy  knowledge,  as  Secretary  of  the  International\r\n\r\nRelations  Department of the N.T.U.C.,  that  certain\r\n\r\ninternational trade secretariats have been  seriously\r\n\r\nand grossly misled about the purpose and intention of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These quarters have been led to believe that the\r\n\r\nBill  has  the most despicable motivations, and  that\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister of Singapore is behaving just like\r\n\r\nan  African  despot, and that he is out  to  cut  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. down to size, and particularly Mr Kandasamy\r\n\r\ndown to size. I do not for a moment believe that this\r\n\r\nis  the  intention of the Government. Besides I  also\r\n\r\nunderstand that the A.U.P.E. at the moment  does  not\r\n\r\npose  any  threat  or danger at all.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore would laugh at such stories because we know\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  simply not true. The  A.U.P.E. also\r\n\r\nknows that this is not true. Indeed, the A.U.P.E. has\r\n\r\nissued  a  statement  to the effect  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  \"took great pains\" to explain to  them  the\r\n\r\nreasons for the introduction of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, certain international trade union\r\n\r\nbodies, hitherto friendly to Singapore, have been led\r\n\r\nto  believe, by certain persons in this region,  that\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill is motivated by the basest of considerations. My\r\n\r\ninformation  is that some damage has  been  done,  at\r\n\r\nleast  in  some  international  labour  circles,   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's image. As a loyal Singaporean  and  as  a\r\n\r\npatriotic  trade unionist, I call upon the Government\r\n\r\nto  give  the  lie to the mischievous interpretations\r\n\r\nwhich have been given to the Bill internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to report to this House that the Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee of the N.T.U.C. met on Saturday,\r\n\r\n20th   May,  1967,  in  order  to  consider   certain\r\n\r\nrepresentations on the Bill which had been  submitted\r\n\r\nto  the  N.T.U.C. only a few  days  earlier  by  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E.,  and  after  due  consideration  agreed  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the Central Executive Committee of the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.,   after  having  listened   to   the\r\n\r\nexplanations offered by the Prime Minister  at\r\n\r\na  recent  meeting, was satisfied  beyond  all\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the Government's  bona  fides  in\r\n\r\nintroducing  this Bill were completely  above-board, and that the Bill was not aimed at  any\r\n\r\nparticular  trade union or at  any  particular\r\n\r\ntrade unionist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the N.T.U.C, was, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nconcerned   about  the  application   of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Bill,  and  to  this  end,\r\n\r\ncertain representations would have to be  made\r\n\r\nto  this  House by trade union representatives\r\n\r\nin  Parliament with regard to the  removal  of\r\n\r\ncertain  anomalies which might arise from  the\r\n\r\napplication of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to announce, both for national and\r\n\r\ninternational  information, that  almost  the  entire\r\n\r\nCentral  Committee  of  the N.T.U.C.,  including  Mr\r\n\r\nKandasamy,  accepted the bona fides of the Government\r\n\r\nas  being above board, and appreciated the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe Bill was not directed at any particular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  union, but was motivated by considerations  of\r\n\r\nthe national interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the Central Committee of the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. met  the Prime Minister last  week  and  he\r\n\r\nexplained  to  us exhaustively what he meant  by  the\r\n\r\n\"national  interest\",  and  I  do  not  recall   that\r\n\r\nanybody,    or   any   particular   trade   unionists\r\n\r\nrepresenting  employees  of the  public  sector  (who\r\n\r\nwould  be  primarily affected by this Bill) disagreed\r\n\r\nwith or in any way countered the considerations which\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself have laboured this point\r\n\r\nto  some  extent,  simply  because  the  N.T.U.C. is\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  squash,  once  and  for  all,  rumours\r\n\r\ngenerated  in  certain international  labour  circles\r\n\r\nwhich   tend  to  have  a  damaging  effect  on   the\r\n\r\ninternational  image of Singapore, which  we  in  the\r\n\r\npatriotic  trade union movement deem it our  duty  to\r\n\r\ncherish and uphold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I shall deal with some of the critical\r\n\r\nobservations   that  the  N.T.U.C. has   to   offer.\r\n\r\nNormally,  the  Minister  for  Labour  discusses  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  any proposed labour legislation  with\r\n\r\nthe N.T.U.C. This has happened on all past occasions,\r\n\r\nbut  this  time the N.T.U.C. was by-passed.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  an explanation from the Minister for Labour  as\r\n\r\nto  why  this  was  allowed to  happen.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nappreciated that relations of understanding  and  co-operation  between the Government and the  democratic\r\n\r\nlabour   movement   can  only   be   maintained   and\r\n\r\nstrengthened  through  closer  consultation  on   all\r\n\r\nmatters  affecting the interests of  labour;  not  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  we  are not afraid of the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement. At this moment we are very strong,\" and  so\r\n\r\non. I believe that closer consultation on all matters\r\n\r\nis very necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the applications of the provisions of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, it will have one unfortunate result,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the creation of a number of peanut  unions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Minister for Labour has said earlier\r\n\r\non  that  in the transport section, there are members\r\n\r\nfrom the P.U.B., members from the Housing Board,  and\r\n\r\nmembers  from other sections. If this Bill is  passed\r\n\r\ninto law,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead  of  solidifying  or  getting  the  employees\r\n\r\ntogether  to  form  a union, it will  create  a  wide\r\n\r\ndivision of workers and various small unions will  be\r\n\r\nformed. This, I think, is not in the interest of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  You  will remember that our Government  has\r\n\r\ndone a great deal in the past to do away with smaller\r\n\r\nunions  or  peanut unions. We all remember  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen  our  port  workers were divided into  at  least\r\n\r\neleven   peanut  unions.  Today,  as  a   result   of\r\n\r\nGovernment policy, the port workers of Singapore come\r\n\r\nunder  a  single union. A number of similar  examples\r\n\r\nmay  be  cited, but if this Bill is passed into  law,\r\n\r\nthe Government will have taken a backward step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine some of the implications. Employees\r\n\r\nof  the larger statutory boards, like the S.T.B., the\r\n\r\nP.U.B. and  the Housing and Development  Board,  can\r\n\r\nform  fairly  sizable  unions. Where  the  P.U.B. is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the Bill might indeed have a  progressive\r\n\r\neffect.  At  the moment, employees in the Water,  Gas\r\n\r\nand   Electricity  Departments  belong  to   separate\r\n\r\nunions,  while monthly-rated employees in the  P.U.B.\r\n\r\nbelong  to  yet another separate union. So where  the\r\n\r\nP.U.B. is concerned, this Bill would make it possible\r\n\r\nfor all P.U.B. employees to be united into one single\r\n\r\nunion,  rather  than  being  distributed  among  four\r\n\r\nseparate unions, as is the case at present.  This  is\r\n\r\nonly confined to a sizable union. But in the case  of\r\n\r\nthe  transport workers, it is not in their interests.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  as I said, where the P.U.B. is concerned,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  would have a progressive  and  beneficial\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees of the Housing and Development Board are\r\n\r\nalso  distributed at the moment between two different\r\n\r\nunions,  a  daily-rated union, and the A.U.P.E.  They\r\n\r\ntoo  will  now  be able to amalgamate into  a  single\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us take a look at the other side of the\r\n\r\ncoin.  Statutory bodies like the Currency Board,  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development  Board, the  Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund   Board,   the   Adult  Education   Board,   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic, the University of Singapore,  the  Asian\r\n\r\nSeamen's Club, the Seamen's Registry Board and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre are small-time employers.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  Boards  employ  as  few as  15  to  20  persons.\r\n\r\nEmployees  of  most of these Boards  are  at  present\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  the A.U.P.E. But  according  to  the \r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill, they will now have  to  form \r\n\r\nunions of their own, with the result that we will now \r\n\r\nhave  to  deal with at least nine new peanut  unions. \r\n\r\nThis  is  surely a retrogressive effect. It  is  true \r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill provides for a federation  of  unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting  statutory board employees,  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe prior approval of the Minister. But why should it\r\n\r\nbe   necessary   to   specify   that   trade   unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting  employees of statutory boards  may  not\r\n\r\nform  a federation without the prior approval of  the\r\n\r\nMinister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am prepared to accept that employees of statutory\r\n\r\nboards may not be affiliated to any other trade union\r\n\r\nor   federation  of  trade  unions  whose  membership\r\n\r\nincludes direct employees of the Government,  without\r\n\r\nthe  prior  approval of the Minister. But why  should\r\n\r\nsuch   prior   approval  be  necessary   for   unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting  employees  of  the  various   statutory\r\n\r\nboards  to  federate among themselves?  This,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  is  an unnecessary stipulation, and should  be\r\n\r\nspecifically deleted from the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wonders too whether it is really necessary to\r\n\r\nstipulate that it is in \"the national interest\"  that\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  representing  employees  of  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  may  only  affiliate with the  N.T.U.C.,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, subject to the approval of the Minister. It\r\n\r\nsurely  cannot  be  held  that  the  N.T.U.C. is   a\r\n\r\nsubversive organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that employees of statutory boards,\r\n\r\nwho  at  present belong to various unions,  may  have\r\n\r\ntheir own views as to how best they ought to organise\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I  am  therefore  to  suggest   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment that it should consider sending this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee, with a view to studying some\r\n\r\nof  the  undesirable results that may ensue from  the\r\n\r\napplication of the Bill, particularly the creation of\r\n\r\na  few peanut unions. The Select Committee would also\r\n\r\nbe  able  to consider representations from the  trade\r\n\r\nunions involved, so that necessary changes may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  made to the Bill with a view to securing  a  more\r\n\r\nintelligent   and  more  effective  organisation   of\r\n\r\nemployees  in  statutory boards. If the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention is good and sincere, and they wish to  make\r\n\r\nus  believe that, I appeal to the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nto  consider referring this Bill to Select Committee.\r\n\r\nI  hope  he  will  not  just  simply  steamroller  it\r\n\r\nthrough,  knowing  full well that he  is  capable  of\r\n\r\ndoing  it, as he has so many Back-benchers to support\r\n\r\nhim.  If this Bill is referred to a Select Committee,\r\n\r\nI feel it will do justice to the unions and they will\r\n\r\nbe  given  a chance to make their representations  on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Bras Basah who has disclosed  that\r\n\r\nthe  Central Executive Committee of the N.T.U.C. has\r\n\r\nexpressed  its support for this Bill. It leaves  very\r\n\r\nlittle for me to add to what I have already said just\r\n\r\nnow.  But  I do not understand why there is  so  much\r\n\r\nfuss from the two Members about asking workers in one\r\n\r\ngiant  union  to form their own exclusive  unions  to\r\n\r\ncater for their own interest. In one giant union,  as\r\n\r\nI  see it, the voice of a section of the workers  may\r\n\r\nbe  submerged, but in their own exclusive union  they\r\n\r\ncan  look after their own interests more closely  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss  matters more related to their conditions  of\r\n\r\nwork. The workers in the Port of Singapore Authority,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, which is one of our biggest  statutory\r\n\r\nboards employing a great number of workers, have  got\r\n\r\ntheir  own exclusive union for years. And nobody  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that this is violating the principle of freedom\r\n\r\nof association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has said that the\r\n\r\nBill  will lead to splinter unions, or what he  calls\r\n\r\n\"yellow unions\". But let me put forward one case. The\r\n\r\nworkers in the Telephone Board, for instance, who are\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  A.U.P.E., had their  own  exclusive\r\n\r\nunion  in 1959. Nobody said then that they were being\r\n\r\ndenied the right of freedom of association. Now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  only  asking them to go back  to  their  old\r\n\r\nposition. Was it a yellow union then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the workers will not lose anything.\r\n\r\nThey  can  have their own unions to look after  their\r\n\r\ninterests.  They can elect their own officials.  They\r\n\r\ncan  even have their own industrial disputes, but  so\r\n\r\nlong  as the industrial dispute or action is confined\r\n\r\nto  their field of work, it can be dealt with without\r\n\r\nmuch  harm  to the economy of the country. This  Bill\r\n\r\nmakes   it  less  possible  for  a  small  group   of\r\n\r\nirresponsible trade union leaders, who have  ulterior\r\n\r\nmotives  or  who  are  being manipulated  by  outside\r\n\r\nforces,  to  manoeuvre our workers in  their  bid  to\r\n\r\nbring  the economy of the country to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as  the workers are concerned, their  rights\r\n\r\nremain the same and they can still be represented  by\r\n\r\nunions  of their own choosing. I think, on the whole,\r\n\r\nthis Bill will benefit many of us in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that there are so many labour\r\n\r\nlaws which can be used to deal with the situation  in\r\n\r\nthe  event of a general strike in the public service.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, the Industrial Relations Ordinance can\r\n\r\nbe  used  to  refer  the dispute  to  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court,  thereby stopping  a  threatening\r\n\r\nstrike.  But  this is only true when  we  have  trade\r\n\r\nunionists who are prepared to play according  to  the\r\n\r\nrules of the game and who have the paramount interest\r\n\r\nof  the  country at heart. But when we come to  trade\r\n\r\nunionists who have ulterior motives or who refuse  to\r\n\r\nabide  by  the  law,  we  really  have  to  think  of\r\n\r\nsomething  to  deal  with them. We  saw  such  things\r\n\r\nhappen  in  February when the leaders of  the  public\r\n\r\ncleansing union decided to call an illegal strike. It\r\n\r\nis  in  this  situation that we have  to  review  our\r\n\r\nposition   and  tighten  up  our  laws,  leaving   no\r\n\r\nloopholes for them to exploit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah is worried about the\r\n\r\npeanut unions which may spring up after this Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed.  I  have already said earlier that for  those\r\n\r\nsections   of  workers  who  belong  to  very   small\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies  and  whose  work  is  of  a   less\r\n\r\nessential nature, they may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to remain in the same old union.

At present  when\r\n\r\nour  country  is  in the process of nation  building,\r\n\r\nmore   than  half  the  population  are  women.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment can tap the resources of such a  potential\r\n\r\nforce and raise their social and economic standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, an amendment is proposed to the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter. I cannot see how the suggested amendment  to\r\n\r\nclause  28  can benefit the women. I feel  that  when\r\n\r\nthis  amendment is implemented, the purpose for which\r\n\r\nit  is  intended will be defeated. Under the  present\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter,  there are  questions  relating  to\r\n\r\ndivorce  in respect of certain women who, because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  nature or their peculiar circumstances, cannot\r\n\r\nfulfil  their  matrimonial  relationship  with  their\r\n\r\nhusbands. Under the present law, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nno  provision for them to separate. Because  of  this\r\n\r\nspecial  consideration,  the  Minister  considers  it\r\n\r\ndesirable,  by  the introduction of an amendment,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  such  people with an opportunity  to  get  a\r\n\r\ndivorce. The motive of the Government is good. But we\r\n\r\nshould  put our heads together and think in terms  of\r\n\r\nwhether  more  problems  will  be  created  for   the\r\n\r\nmajority  when  we consider the interests  of  a  few\r\n\r\npeople, and whether this will be of any good  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry  or  the people as a whole. We  all  remember\r\n\r\nthat  in  1959  our society was one where  polygamous\r\n\r\nmarriages were allowed. The women in Singapore  were,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  in a very disadvantageous position.  Then\r\n\r\nat  that time, the P.A.P, decided to wipe out for all\r\n\r\ntime such a bad system. Thus the Women's Charter came\r\n\r\ninto  being to enhance the position of women  and  to\r\n\r\naccord  them  their rightful status and  position  in\r\n\r\ntheir family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look at the provisions of clause 28 of\r\n\r\nthis  (Amendment) Bill. We see that  there  are  many\r\n\r\nthings  which are detrimental to women. I would  like\r\n\r\nall  the  gentlemen M.P.s in this House to understand\r\n\r\nthat I do not only speak for women but also for them,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  this question arises it will affect  not\r\n\r\nonly  women  but  also all the  people  in  the  same\r\n\r\nsociety.  In  other words, if a couple disagree  with\r\n\r\neach other, they can avail themselves of clause 28 to\r\n\r\nseek a divorce. After they have lived separately  for\r\n\r\nseven years, the Judge can make use of the provisions\r\n\r\nof  this  clause  to  grant them a  divorce.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, there is no such amendment, and I wonder  how\r\n\r\nmany  husbands  secretly and stealthily  visit  their\r\n\r\nmistresses!  Although they have wives at  home,  they\r\n\r\nfrequent  bars and dance-halls where they meet  their\r\n\r\nmistresses or some other bad women. As a result,  the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial relationship is endangered and the family\r\n\r\nlife  is  disrupted, and this leads  to  divorce.  If\r\n\r\nclause  28  is  passed, it will afford  men  an  even\r\n\r\nbetter  opportunity  to  carry  out  their  nefarious\r\n\r\nactivities in the open. This is tantamount to the old\r\n\r\npractice  in  China where husbands were accorded  the\r\n\r\nright to divorce their wives with a stroke of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  pen.  Certain husbands in Singapore  will  avail\r\n\r\nthemselves of the opportunity and say, \"I cannot  get\r\n\r\nalong  with my wife. Our relationship is no  good.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  live  separately from her and  after  seven\r\n\r\nyears,  I  want  a divorce.\" Certain women  can  also\r\n\r\navail  themselves of the opportunity to do  likewise.\r\n\r\nThus the provisions of this clause will be abused and\r\n\r\nmany  problems will be created. So more  people  will\r\n\r\nabuse  the  provisions of this clause.  Fewer  people\r\n\r\nwill  get benefit from it. So there will be more harm\r\n\r\ndone than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee, the Minister said that\r\n\r\nhusbands  as well as wives can ask for a  divorce  on\r\n\r\nthe  grounds provided in this clause. But as  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  man  holds the economic power in our  society.\r\n\r\nVery few women hold economic power in their hands. In\r\n\r\nthe  history of Singapore, we can see that all  along\r\n\r\nwomen   have   been   subjected   to   colonial   and\r\n\r\nenvironmental suppression in society. Under the  yoke\r\n\r\nof  this  two-pronged suppression, the women of  this\r\n\r\ncountry have never been able to raise their heads. It\r\n\r\nwas  only  when  the P.A.P. assumed office  that  the\r\n\r\npeople were gradually able to play an active part  in\r\n\r\nthe economic, social and political life of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  means  that  it  is  still  the  womenfolk   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who were behind time, and it is  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  them to compete with men. At the moment,  as  we\r\n\r\nall  know, the victims are normally the women; seldom\r\n\r\nare  they  men. If there are any men who are victims,\r\n\r\nthen  it can be attributed to their ill-luck or  they\r\n\r\nhave themselves to blame. So if the clause is passed,\r\n\r\nI  should  think that women will still be the  losers\r\n\r\nand  men  can revert back to their former  polygamous\r\n\r\nposition and they can then openly cohabit with  their\r\n\r\nmistresses  outside and in the end will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmarry them. So it will create a very bad tradition in\r\n\r\nthe  family and I ask whether this tradition is  good\r\n\r\nfor  our  country. Obviously the answer is no.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  provision  should  be  amended.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is thinking only in terms of a  handful  of\r\n\r\nwomen who cannot get along with their husband, then I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is not quite necessary, because they  have\r\n\r\nevery opportunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the  present  law  to avail  themselves  of  a\r\n\r\ndivorce.  If  they want a divorce  and  if  there  is\r\n\r\ndisharmony between them and their husband, they  have\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the present law to get a divorce.  Now\r\n\r\nif  the  husband wants to get a divorce, he  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to get it under the provisions of clause 28  of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill. He can go outside and mix  with\r\n\r\nhis  mistresses and in the end he will get a divorce.\r\n\r\nSo  this  will  afford  man better  opportunities  or\r\n\r\nfacilities to carry out any misdeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that this question is not just one\r\n\r\nrelating  to  women. It is also a social problem  and\r\n\r\nall  Members  of  Parliament should give  it  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  concerning the objection raised by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Delta who considers that the 7-year period is too\r\n\r\nlong,  I think this does not really affect the issue.\r\n\r\nAlthough  seven years is fairly long, if  the  couple\r\n\r\nafter  separation feel that it is painful to both  of\r\n\r\nthem  to carry on separately and if they want to come\r\n\r\nback within this period, I do not think there is  any\r\n\r\ndisadvantage to the woman. The Member for  Delta  has\r\n\r\nalso  said that taking up divorce proceedings is  not\r\n\r\nthe  special  privilege  of the  man.  I  think  that\r\n\r\nrelates to both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether or not a marriage is\r\n\r\nsuccessful, it is up to both parties to see that they\r\n\r\nrespect each other. The Women's Charter is mainly  to\r\n\r\npromote the one-man-one-wife system. We can say  that\r\n\r\nit  has worked quite successfully. But the Member has\r\n\r\nalso  said that there are and there will be many  men\r\n\r\nwho  will have concubines or mistresses. I think this\r\n\r\nis  the  responsibility less of the man than  of  the\r\n\r\nwoman. If a woman is not vain and is willing to  take\r\n\r\nup  a  proper job, no one will force her to become  a\r\n\r\nconcubine  or  a mistress. If she were a  vain  woman\r\n\r\nlooking only for the luxuries of life, then it is her\r\n\r\nown  fault. So I hope that women will stand on  their\r\n\r\nown  feet  and show that they are strong of will  and\r\n\r\ndetermination,  and I also hope that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta, as a woman social\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker, will educate them to seek proper jobs and\r\n\r\ncompete with men for equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I say: no  divorce  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I sat on the Select Committee on the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter  (Amendment) Bill, and the Member  for  Delta\r\n\r\nwas also on the Select Committee. The suggestions put\r\n\r\nforward  by  her today had, if I remember  correctly,\r\n\r\nbeen  raised in the Select Committee. Now  that  this\r\n\r\nsame  amendment is raised again, I feel it is  rather\r\n\r\nredundant; actually it is not necessary to repeat the\r\n\r\nopinions already uttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally there are three very wrong opinions on the\r\n\r\npart of women on women's problems. Firstly, they take\r\n\r\npride  in being able to be on an equal take pride  in\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  be on equal footing  with  men.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  if a woman can drive or be a  pilot,  then\r\n\r\nshe  takes pride in it as symbolising her ability  to\r\n\r\ncompete with men. But for men, they do not take pride\r\n\r\nin   being   able  to  sew.  So  this  would   be   a\r\n\r\nretrogressive  attitude on the part  of  women.  They\r\n\r\nwant  to follow what men do - to be able to join  the\r\n\r\nArmy  and fight, etc. - then that would be the  glory\r\n\r\nof women. That is the first wrong concept on the part\r\n\r\nof some women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they regard women as a kind of material\r\n\r\nproperty. Even Plato talked of women as wives as well\r\n\r\nas  property, and the treatment of women as  chattels\r\n\r\nor property is also a wrong concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, women regard themselves as weaklings who\r\n\r\ncannot  compete with men in politics,  economics  and\r\n\r\nother  fields.  And  so  they want  to  seek  special\r\n\r\nprotection  under  the law or  some  other  means  of\r\n\r\nprotection.  Thus  it will impede  their  progressive\r\n\r\nmovement  and lead them to some other misguided  path\r\n\r\nand put them in dire difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has been harping on the fact\r\n\r\nthat women in the present society are unable to be on\r\n\r\nan  equal  status  with  men and,  therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  let them have some special  protection\r\n\r\nunder the law. Of course, we do not want to have  any\r\n\r\nlaws that will not protect women. But in the end when\r\n\r\nwomen  rely on legal protection alone, that  will  do\r\n\r\nmore harm than good to them. Because if they want  to\r\n\r\nenjoy bliss, one of the many types of bliss would  be\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  bliss,  i.e.,  to  have  a  good  family\r\n\r\nrelationship.  If  womenfolk are not  satisfied  with\r\n\r\ntheir  lot and though they lie on the same  bed  with\r\n\r\ntheir  husband  but have different dreams  -  seeking\r\n\r\nsome  other unrealistic aims - then they will be very\r\n\r\nunrealistic.   It   actually   amounts   to   seeking\r\n\r\nprivileges and advantages and not something  else  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a good family relationship. Thus  it  would\r\n\r\nbring  the  marriage relationship down to a  material\r\n\r\nlevel.   Because   there  are  some   men   who   are\r\n\r\neconomically less well-off than others,  if  material\r\n\r\nor  financial  resources are the  sole  yardstick  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  family harmony, then  it  will  put  the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial relationship on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, would you try to relate your\r\n\r\nremarks  to Madam Chan's opposition to the seven-year\r\n\r\nprovision?  Please speak on details  rather  than  on\r\n\r\ngeneral principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel\r\n\r\nI should direct my remarks to her because she regards\r\n\r\nwomen as the weaker sex. We should also pay attention\r\n\r\nto   another   point.  We  should  not  put   certain\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  women.  We  should  not  make  them\r\n\r\ncontinue with their unhappy family life after waiting\r\n\r\nfor seven years. Though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  provides that after  seven  years  of\r\n\r\nseparation  a  woman  can get a divorce,  it  is  not\r\n\r\ngiving   her   a   free   hand.   There   are   other\r\n\r\nconsiderations to be met before such a divorce can be\r\n\r\ngranted. I would like to draw your attention to  this\r\n\r\nwording in clause 28 (b):\" ... and is unlikely to be\r\n\r\nreconciled  with him.\" This clearly  says  that  even\r\n\r\nafter  seven  years' separation, the party  concerned\r\n\r\ncannot  get a divorce automatically. It is up to  the\r\n\r\nJudge  to  see that there are facts to show that  the\r\n\r\nparty  concerned is unlikely to be reconciled. So  if\r\n\r\nthere  are such facts, then the court will decide  in\r\n\r\nfavour of a divorce. Such a situation will affect the\r\n\r\ntwo  parties.  It  is  not just the  women  who  will\r\n\r\nsuffer.  It  is not because woman is the  weaker  sex\r\n\r\nthat she is willing to suffer such stark cruelty.  It\r\n\r\nis  not for us to make divorce more difficult to  get\r\n\r\nfrom  the legal point of view, and make the law  more\r\n\r\nrefined to prevent divorce. What the law should do is\r\n\r\nto simplify the position for reasonable marriages and\r\n\r\nto  simplify other matters. For instance, the British\r\n\r\nLaw Society has suggested that if both parties cannot\r\n\r\nlive together, then they can, by mutual consent,  get\r\n\r\na  divorce.  That  is something arising  out  of  the\r\n\r\nactual situation in England. We think this could be a\r\n\r\nvery good guide for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also pay attention to another point. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Delta has just now suggested the deletion\r\n\r\nof  paragraphs (a) and (b) in clause 28. But she  has\r\n\r\nnot  suggested  that the proposed new paragraphs  (c)\r\n\r\nand (d) in clause 28 should also be deleted. It would\r\n\r\nseem  that the Member's attitude is that a  wife  can\r\n\r\nhave  the right to seek a divorce after seven  years'\r\n\r\nseparation, but not the husband. So it would be  more\r\n\r\nproper  for us to take care also of the other  party,\r\n\r\nand  not  just  one party. Otherwise, it  would  give\r\n\r\npeople  the  impression that  this  is  something  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of women and that the Member would like  this\r\n\r\nto  be a woman's world. And she would rather see  men\r\n\r\nin dire difficulties. I feel that the amendment moved\r\n\r\nby the Member for Delta is not proper and it will put\r\n\r\nour society in dire difficulties. Therefore, I oppose\r\n\r\nher amendment and her views relating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthereto.

I  do  not  mean  to\r\n\r\nencourage divorces by quoting that example. At  least\r\n\r\nI  can  declare that I do not encourage it. I do  not\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  anybody,  including  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  asking  for a divorce on  unjustified  or\r\n\r\ntrifling grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  are  now discussing  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter.  Originally I did not intend to  speak.  But\r\n\r\nhaving  heard the speeches by various Members,  I  am\r\n\r\ncompelled to say something on this matter. Apart from\r\n\r\nthe fact that women have always accused men of having\r\n\r\ndone some misdeeds, they have always said that it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the men who are the victims, and divorce  always\r\n\r\nputs  women, not men, in a disadvantageous  position.\r\n\r\nThere  is a Hokkien saying about a woman being an  Oh\r\n\r\nyou tan. In such a case, if the man does not want  to\r\n\r\nget  a  divorce,  then  would he  have  to  become  a\r\n\r\n\"tortoise\"  of  some  sort? Can  a  man  endure  this\r\n\r\nwithout divorce? It is very correct then for  him  to\r\n\r\nseek  a  divorce.  Divorce is a  misfortune  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren. Who suffers? It is the children who suffer.\r\n\r\nI say that to get a divorce would be like getting rid\r\n\r\nof the sores or boils on the body. If the boil is not\r\n\r\ncut off, it will enlarge and endanger other parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  body. So I feel that it is justifiable to get  a\r\n\r\ndivorce on reasonable grounds. If it is true  that  a\r\n\r\ndivorce  will  encourage a  man  to  get  married  to\r\n\r\nanother  woman, then I will oppose such  a  thing.  I\r\n\r\ndisagree  with the saying that divorce means  another\r\n\r\nmarriage.  It is not correct. Who will do that?  Some\r\n\r\nwomen will do that. It is not something\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmen can help. If a woman does not want to get married\r\n\r\nto  a  married man, what can the man do? Who will  be\r\n\r\nwrong?  It  is such a woman who is wrong. Who  entice\r\n\r\nthe men? It is the women who use their feminine wiles\r\n\r\nto entice the men. So I say that when women have done\r\n\r\nsomething wrong, they should not claim that  the  men\r\n\r\nhave wronged them. The Chinese have a saying: If  you\r\n\r\nmarry  a dog you follow the dog; if you marry a cock,\r\n\r\nyou  follow  the  cock.  But  in  Singapore  this  is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  Very often women want to climb  over  the\r\n\r\nhead  of  men.  If  men  do not claim  divorce,  they\r\n\r\nshould.  I  do  not  encourage  divorces.  We  should\r\n\r\nunderstand that divorce is painful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should direct our remarks to\r\n\r\nthe  seven-year period. I feel that it should not  be\r\n\r\nso  long. If they do not wish to reconcile, it  would\r\n\r\nnot  work.  Even  after  70  years,  they  would  not\r\n\r\nreconcile  if they do not wish to. The most important\r\n\r\nthing  between the husband and wife is a feeling  for\r\n\r\neach  other. Without this feeling, there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Delta has said that men can\r\n\r\ngo  out and misbehave. Women too can do likewise.  So\r\n\r\ndo  you  want  the men to be some sort of \"tortoise\"?\r\n\r\nSeven  years  is  too long. It is not practicable.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  one  year. If  there  is  no  feeling\r\n\r\nbetween  the  husband and wife, what is  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncarrying  on for seven years? Can they be reconciled?\r\n\r\nThey  cannot  if there is no feeling for each  other.\r\n\r\nThe  most  important thing in marriage  is  that  the\r\n\r\nhusband and wife must feel for each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has said that most men want to\r\n\r\nget  concubines  or to get married once  more.  Whose\r\n\r\nfault is this? I can say that it is the fault of  the\r\n\r\nwomen who are willing to be concubines to men. Why do\r\n\r\nthey allow men to get concubines? This may be due  to\r\n\r\nsome sort of encouragement by women. If a man has two\r\n\r\nwives,  of  course, he has done wrong. But the  woman\r\n\r\nwho  is  willing  to be his second wife  is  also  to\r\n\r\nblame.  If a woman has two husbands, whose  fault  is\r\n\r\nit? Of course, it is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfault  of the woman. So we must decide each  case  on\r\n\r\nits  merits  or  demerits. What  I  mean  is  do  not\r\n\r\nencourage  all  to  get a divorce.  But  when  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to get a divorce, we must do so;  and  when\r\n\r\nit  is not necessary to get a divorce, we should not.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  does  not  mean that divorce  means  getting\r\n\r\nmarried again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, I do not\r\n\r\nwant to involve myself too deeply in this Bill. It is\r\n\r\nnot  that  I am altogether disinterested.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  I  will have to take  advantage  of  any\r\n\r\nclause that is proposed today. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nprevious  speakers in the House have somewhat  misled\r\n\r\nus  when they discussed whether or not divorce  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  thing.  The Member for Delta very  chivalrously\r\n\r\nprotected the rights of women. I do not know what the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education has to add to what  she  has\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, you must keep personalities\r\n\r\nout of the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Yes. But she presupposes that\r\n\r\nall  men are evil. On the other hand, the Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru presupposes that all women are evil. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  think  we are not here to discuss whether  men  or\r\n\r\nwomen are born evil; neither is the discussion on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of equality of women. The Member for  Delta\r\n\r\nhas   complained  that  the  economic  machinery   is\r\n\r\ncontrolled by men. I think it is through no fault  of\r\n\r\nmen.  With regard to advertisements in the newspapers\r\n\r\nfor  jobs as lorry drivers or tractor drivers, in  a.\r\n\r\nhundred  per  cent  of cases you do  not  find  women\r\n\r\napplying  for such jobs. They simply refuse to  apply\r\n\r\nfor   these  jobs  because  they  acknowledge   their\r\n\r\nphysiological inferiority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, we have to consider whether this piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation will build a happier community rather\r\n\r\nthan  discuss whether the men or the women  are  evil\r\n\r\nbeings. Sir, this is indeed a very advanced piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation. In some countries they are still looking\r\n\r\nforward to having this kind of legislation, but  they\r\n\r\nhave not so far got it. I think we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  perhaps among the first Asian countries to bring\r\n\r\nabout  this  legislation. To have two persons  living\r\n\r\ntogether  who are totally incompatible  is  not  only\r\n\r\ndisastrous to them, in that it is a mental strain  on\r\n\r\nboth parties, but it is also a definite detriment  to\r\n\r\nthe  family,  if  they  have any  children.  So  this\r\n\r\nprovision in the Bill is a means to regulate  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  and not to encourage divorce as  suggested\r\n\r\nby  some  hon.  Members in the House. It  provides  a\r\n\r\nsolution  for  this kind of cases. I do  not  believe\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  possibility of reconciliation  if  both\r\n\r\nparties  are simply incompatible. So this is a  means\r\n\r\nto  allow both parties to acquire freedom to  seek  a\r\n\r\ndivorce. They can still apply to court for a divorce,\r\n\r\nand if it is granted, then they are free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Merah has pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Delta has deliberately proposed\r\n\r\nto  delete  paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause  28  but\r\n\r\nretain  paragraphs (c) and (d) so that the women  can\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of the clause and put the  men  in  a\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous position. That is why there are  four\r\n\r\nparagraphs in that clause to provide equal rights and\r\n\r\nopportunities for both parties to seek a  divorce  or\r\n\r\nto  seek  a solution - freedom from the anxiety  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they  go  home  one evening,  they  might  find\r\n\r\nsomebody who is out to annoy him or annoy her, as the\r\n\r\ncase may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this clause 28 of the Bill and I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  make it clear that its aim is to provide  a\r\n\r\nsolution for some married people living in misery and\r\n\r\nnot  a  clause  specifically  provided  to  encourage\r\n\r\ndivorces in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, seeing\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Delta is the only rose among  the\r\n\r\nthorns  in this House, I think I will say a  word  on\r\n\r\nher behalf in view of what the Member for Bukit Merah\r\n\r\nhas  said.  It is true that she, as a member  of  the\r\n\r\nfair  sex, accepts the fact that in the present setup\r\n\r\nof  society, women play second fiddle and, more often\r\n\r\nthan  not, they are the injured party.

Although I do not agree  with\r\n\r\nall  that  she has said, I feel that, to be  fair  to\r\n\r\nher,  she  is  right  in standing  up  for  what  she\r\n\r\nconsiders to be necessary for the advancement of  her\r\n\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment\r\n\r\nto  clause  28  was raised for consideration  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta during the proceedings of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill, of which she was a Member, and\r\n\r\nwas   negatived   by  the  Committee  after   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I  think  the  Member   is   somewhat\r\n\r\nconcerned over this clause because she considers that\r\n\r\nits  provision may work against the interest of women\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. I should like to assure her that  this\r\n\r\nis  not so. All that we are proposing to do with this\r\n\r\nnew  provision is to create an additional ground  for\r\n\r\ndivorce,  and  this provision is  novel  in  that  it\r\n\r\nallows for divorce by consent, in addition, I repeat,\r\n\r\nto  the present grounds for divorce which are already\r\n\r\nprovided  for in the Women's Charter, but  with  this\r\n\r\ndifference.  Under  the  existing  provision,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  to  get  a divorce only  when  one  of  the\r\n\r\nparties   has   done  something  wrong,   e.g.,   the\r\n\r\ncommission  of  adultery, or is of incurably  unsound\r\n\r\nmind. It has been found that there are many instances\r\n\r\nwhere,  quite obviously, the marriage has failed  and\r\n\r\nit  is no longer in the interest of either party  for\r\n\r\nthe  marriage to continue, although neither  of  them\r\n\r\nhas  committed adultery or done anything wrong or  is\r\n\r\nof  incurably  unsound mind. I think the  Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta  will agree that in such circumstances it would\r\n\r\nbe   better   for   the   parties   to   part.   But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  they cannot get a divorce  under  the\r\n\r\npresent  law  which has no provision for  divorce  by\r\n\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  event of a divorce  by  consent  being\r\n\r\ngranted by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  court under the amended law, no disadvantage  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  accrue to the female party? She  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  claim  the usual relief in the  payment  of\r\n\r\nalimony  by her husband or apply for custody  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren,  if  any.  None of the existing  rights  or\r\n\r\nbenefits which the present law provides for women  in\r\n\r\ndivorce proceedings will be affected in any way.  The\r\n\r\nonly  thing is the provision for an additional ground\r\n\r\nfor divorce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  my  main  point  is why  there  should  be  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for the Women's Charter and  what  is  its\r\n\r\npurpose?  The  purpose,  I feel,  is  to  enable  our\r\n\r\nsociety  to be one in which the husband and the  wife\r\n\r\nin  a  family can have mutual respect for each  other\r\n\r\nand  to  encourage such families in our  society.  If\r\n\r\nparagraphs  (a) and (h) of clause 28 are  agreed  to,\r\n\r\nthen  they will clearly go counter to the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe  Women's  Charter, because, on the one  hand,  we\r\n\r\nwant to encourage people to have happy and harmonious\r\n\r\nfamilies, yet on the other hand, we will be providing\r\n\r\nmore grounds for divorce. Thus, I cannot get the true\r\n\r\nand  exact meaning and purpose of the Women's Charter\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, accept the assurance  given  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  just now on that point. I do not  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  provision will be detrimental to the wife after\r\n\r\nthe  divorce. But what I mean to say is that, at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  we  are not just looking after a handful  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  want  to  get a divorce  but  that  this\r\n\r\nprovision for divorce would be misused by some people\r\n\r\nwho  need  not  get  a  divorce  but  who  may  avail\r\n\r\nthemselves  of this provision to get a divorce.  That\r\n\r\nis one of my main grounds for proposing my amendment.\r\n\r\nI  do  not disagree if the divorce comes about  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the two parties not being able to get along\r\n\r\nany  more. But if this amendment is to resolve a  few\r\n\r\ncases,  then  we will be doing more harm  than  good.\r\n\r\nThat is the gist of my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has also said that by my\r\n\r\namendment I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshown  that I regard women as weaklings. I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  it is because of our present society that women\r\n\r\nare  still  not  able  to  raise  themselves  to  the\r\n\r\nstandard of men in the economic and other fields. Who\r\n\r\ndare  say  that women are the weaker sex? If  such  a\r\n\r\nperson  dares  to  say  that, let  him  see  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in China. It is mostly women who  lead  the\r\n\r\nRed Guards. We should say that the problems of women,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are weaklings or not, are attributable\r\n\r\nto the social system. Given the right opportunity,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that since there is no distinction in  capacity\r\n\r\nbetween  men and women, women will be able to achieve\r\n\r\nequality with men. So if the women's problems in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  are not solved as social problems,  then  we\r\n\r\nhave  yet to achieve a truly socialist society. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  mean  to say that the law is the only  means  to\r\n\r\nresolve  women's problems, because  this  is  a  very\r\n\r\npassive way of dealing with them. In actual fact, the\r\n\r\nGovernment should afford women more opportunities  to\r\n\r\ndo  their  part.  If  the  women,  having  .got  such\r\n\r\nopportunities,  still cannot be successful,  then  we\r\n\r\ncan  say that they are weaklings. But, at the moment,\r\n\r\nfrom the recruitment policy of the Government, we can\r\n\r\nsee that the ratio of men to women recruited is still\r\n\r\nin  favour  of men. If there are 10 positions,  women\r\n\r\ncan  only get two or three, and the rest will  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  men. So how can you describe women as weaklings?\r\n\r\nThis is a problem linked with the whole structure  of\r\n\r\nsociety,  and since we are not yet economically  able\r\n\r\nto  afford  women a better position,  we  should  not\r\n\r\nallow them to suffer any disadvantages and allow such\r\n\r\nan anomalous position to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As part\r\n\r\nof  their  liquidity requirements,  commercial  banks\r\n\r\nwere  allowed  to  hold  Government  securities   and\r\n\r\nTreasury Bills of the Singapore Government or of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government. Now that we  have  taken  over\r\n\r\nsupervision of the banking system in Singapore, banks\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  adjust their liquidity  holdings.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, if banks in Singapore are  now  holding\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Treasury Bills and securities,  they  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  convert  them to Singapore  securities  and\r\n\r\nTreasury  Bills.  Similarly, banks in  Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nhave   to   convert  their  holdings   of   Singapore\r\n\r\nsecurities  to  Malaysian  securities.  In  practice,\r\n\r\nhowever, banks in Singapore have been holding largely\r\n\r\nMalaysian securities and Treasury Bills. In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe adjustments now necessary, there will, therefore,\r\n\r\nbe a sudden increased demand for Singapore issues. It\r\n\r\nis, therefore, necessary for the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nto  issue more Treasury Bills to meet the demand  for\r\n\r\nsuch securities by the banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, besides the liquidity holdings by banks,\r\n\r\nthese  banks as well as other financial institutions,\r\n\r\nincluding  Government  statutory  bodies,  also  have\r\n\r\nshort-term  surplus funds which they wish  to  invest\r\n\r\nprofitably. Unless there is an outlet for such  funds\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, it is likely that the money will go to\r\n\r\nother financial centres. The Government, through  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  Treasury  Bills and  its  own  securities,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  provides an investment  outlet  for  such\r\n\r\nshort-term funds. Recent trends indicate that more of\r\n\r\nsuch  short-term  funds will be  forthcoming  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  Treasury  Bills  have  to  be  issued  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take up such funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may wish to know that Treasury Bills of 91\r\n\r\ndays'  maturity are issued on tap to statutory bodies\r\n\r\nand  are  offered on weekly tender to banks  and  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Tap Bills carry an interest rate  of  5  per\r\n\r\ncent  per  annum  while the average rate  for  Tender\r\n\r\nBills   is  4.9  per  cent  per  annum.  The   amount\r\n\r\noutstanding  on  these issues are: Tap  Bills  - $31.5\r\n\r\nmillion; Tender Bills - $109.7 million. In view of the\r\n\r\ntwo  developments which I have outlined above, it  is\r\n\r\nlikely  that the demand for such bills will increase.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Parliament is therefore requested to\r\n\r\nenable  Government to issue Treasury Bills up  to  an\r\n\r\namount not exceeding $500 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is hoped that by the issue of\r\n\r\nmore  Treasury Bills, there will develop in  time  an\r\n\r\neffective  short-term money market  for  such  bills.\r\n\r\nSuch  a money market will arise as, out of the  bills\r\n\r\nissued, a certain part or percentage would be held by\r\n\r\nbanks and other financial institutions on a revolving\r\n\r\nbasis.  In other words, when a certain issue of  such\r\n\r\nbills matures, they will be replaced by purchases  of\r\n\r\nnew  bills. Such bills will also be used by banks for\r\n\r\ntrading among themselves or for discounting with  the\r\n\r\nAccountant-General in order to meet deficits in their\r\n\r\ndaily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclearing.   The   larger  banks  in  Singapore   have\r\n\r\nindicated that they will be able to provide a  steady\r\n\r\nmarket for Treasury Bills to which they will be  able\r\n\r\nto service short-term investment funds of the smaller\r\n\r\nbanks. For instance, a small bank with a cash surplus\r\n\r\non a particular day may deposit such cash at a larger\r\n\r\nbank,  which will then purchase Treasury  Bills  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government. In this way, the smaller banks  will\r\n\r\nfind  profitable use for their surplus funds and  the\r\n\r\nbigger  banks will then provide a market for Treasury\r\n\r\nBills  from  the Government. In time  to  come,  such\r\n\r\noperations  will evolve into an active and  effective\r\n\r\nshort-term money market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves, in accordance with\r\n\r\nsection  2  of  the  Local Treasury  Bills  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  69),  that the Minister  be  authorised  to\r\n\r\nborrow,  by  the  issue  of  Treasury  Bills  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic, sums not exceeding Malayan $500,000,000  in\r\n\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date\r\n\r\nto be fixed.\" - [Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-six minutes to Eight o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
