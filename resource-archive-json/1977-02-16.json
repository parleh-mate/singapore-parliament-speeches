Member for Ulu Pandan in expressing  our\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the  President for  his  speech.  Several\r\n\r\nMembers  have, in fact, indicated that they  expected\r\n\r\nanother   diabolical  manifestation  of  what   other\r\n\r\nMembers  might describe as the negative  part  of  my\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the lifting of the Whip, and the\r\n\r\nassurance  given  by the Leader of the  House,  I  am\r\n\r\nstill  inhibited by the fear that being a  Member  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Bench, an amendment  might  well  be\r\n\r\nregarded as a gesture of disrespect to the President.\r\n\r\nFurther,  having  listened  to  the  gentlemanly  and\r\n\r\neloquent  delivery of the speech by the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Ulu  Pandan, I have come to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nany  amendment  to  the  Motion  will  certainly   be\r\n\r\nrepugnant.  I  decided, therefore,  that  the  Motion\r\n\r\nshould  remain  as it is, at least for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\netiquette,  and  I  shall  try,  though  not  without\r\n\r\ninvoluntary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestraint, to be less pungent in my remarks  at  this\r\n\r\nSitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without formally moving the amendment, I think that\r\n\r\nthe Motion should more appropriately read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore.\r\n\r\nexpress  our thanks to the President for  the  Speech\r\n\r\nwhich he delivered on behalf of the Government at the\r\n\r\nopening of the First Session of this Parliament,  but\r\n\r\nregret  to  note  the absence of any mention  on  the\r\n\r\ndeficiency of the Government in the understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of  the  people  in  the  process   of\r\n\r\nimplementing its policies'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously speaking, Mr Speaker, Sir, few can dispute\r\n\r\nthe  high  ideals expressed in the Addenda,  some  of\r\n\r\nwhich  are  so  colourfully  dressed  with  so   many\r\n\r\njargons,  except to marvel a little in  disbelief  in\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  many intangibles and  inadequacies  so\r\n\r\ninnocently confessed through the statements  in  both\r\n\r\nthe  Addenda  to  the Ministry of Education  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that some years ago, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  a  speech that typified  his  in-depth\r\n\r\nknowledge  in  the potentials and prejudices  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,   went  to  great  lengths  to   define   the\r\n\r\ncharacteristics   of  what  he  called   \"Westernised\r\n\r\nOriental  Gentlemen\", or WOGs  as  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister    endeared   these   people    with    that\r\n\r\nabbreviation.  That  speech was  both  enriching  and\r\n\r\ninvigorating.  Indeed,  it  provoked  serious   mind-searching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have been quite satisfied with my\r\n\r\ncomprehension  of that speech if I had  stopped  just\r\n\r\nthere.  However, in giving his observations a  little\r\n\r\nfurther probing, I discovered that the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  totally  free from the symptoms of such  decried\r\n\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to recapture just two previous instances\r\n\r\nwhich,  I hope, will suffice to demonstrate the  lack\r\n\r\nof  understanding  on the part of the  Government  in\r\n\r\nboth  the  culture and traditions, which  values  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  of  Education  and  Culture  so  doggedly\r\n\r\npromised in the Addenda to inculcate in our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, as a result of complaints of noise\r\n\r\npollution,  the Government imposed a partial  ban  on\r\n\r\ncracker-firing. The letting off of fire crackers  was\r\n\r\nmade  an  offence  except  in  places  designated  as\r\n\r\npermitted  areas, such as State-owned -  I  emphasise State-owned\r\n\r\n-  open  land  and  community centre compounds.  Many\r\n\r\nMembers are aware in my discussions with them, in the\r\n\r\nMembers'  Room, that I was quite vocal  against  this\r\n\r\nkind of a half-line action. I then held the view, and\r\n\r\nI  still hold the view now, that the partial ban  was\r\n\r\ndoomed  to  failure. If the firing  of  crackers  was\r\n\r\nregarded  as  obnoxious - indeed  it  proved  to   be\r\n\r\nunconducive  to our well-being, apart from  being  an\r\n\r\nannual money-wasting folly, then the ban should  have\r\n\r\nbeen total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This \"half-way-house\" policy succeeded only to\r\n\r\nexpose the Government's ignorance in our culture  and\r\n\r\nits complete lack of understanding of the meaning and\r\n\r\nsignificance of cracker firing. It was, and still is,\r\n\r\nbelieved  - total ban now notwithstanding,  that  the\r\n\r\near-shattering  explosions promise a  whole  host  of\r\n\r\nthings,  from scaring away evil spirits  to  bringing\r\n\r\ngood   luck  and  fortune  to  the  family  and   the\r\n\r\nhousehold, not to forget that noise-making  has  been\r\n\r\npart and parcel of the local mode of celebrations. In\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir,  in funerals we happen to make  the  most\r\n\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, therefore, would spend money to bring good\r\n\r\nluck    to    Government-owned   designated   places.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  these superstitious exercises  remained\r\n\r\nas   superstition,  for  otherwise,  those  who  took\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  that `leeway' would have succeeded  in\r\n\r\nbringing  good  fortune  to  the  designated  places,\r\n\r\nperhaps  even raised the land value which, of course,\r\n\r\nmust  consequently  be put up for  tender  under  the\r\n\r\nUrban Renewal Schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this `leeway' proved to be neither here nor\r\n\r\nthere. Eventually, as a result of a nasty accident, a\r\n\r\ntotal ban was slammed. The nett result of that short-lived\r\n\r\nconcession  was a 100% disagreement  from  the\r\n\r\npopulace.  For those who favoured total banning,  the\r\n\r\nfrightening sound of crackers could still be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheard;  and  for  those who refused to  warm  up  the\r\n\r\ndesignated  places, they were utterly frustrated.  So\r\n\r\nmuch  for one example of Government understanding  of\r\n\r\nour culture and tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak without inhibition now, and\r\n\r\nas  the Minister for Health is not here, it is not my\r\n\r\nintention  to dispute the success of family  planning\r\n\r\nin Singapore. On the contrary, I am confident that we\r\n\r\nwill  achieve  our target even more effectively,  now\r\n\r\nthat  the programme has been reinforced, I hope, with\r\n\r\nnew  vigor  and approach by the present Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time, Members will remember, when there\r\n\r\nwas  great  hullabaloo in this House on the  subject.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members will recall the day when the House  was\r\n\r\nentertained  to some very amusing definitions  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat an ideal family should be. Briefly, we were told\r\n\r\nthat  a one-child family would be too lonely for  the\r\n\r\npoor  child; two would of course be most ideal; three\r\n\r\nwould  be  a luxury; four would be unpardonably  anti\r\n\r\nsocial, and five, God forbid, criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population problem, in Singapore's context, is a\r\n\r\nproblem  not unrelated to Asian values. If a  Western\r\n\r\nsolution is the only feasible solution to this  Asian\r\n\r\nproblem, so be it. It has got to be done, and  so  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  done. I do not think that our people  would\r\n\r\nquarrel with the concept, or even with the incentives\r\n\r\nor  disincentives.  But the explanation,  propaganda,\r\n\r\npublicity and exhortations must necessarily be Asian.\r\n\r\nThere   are  equally  convincing  axioms   in   Asian\r\n\r\nteachings  and philosophies to get our people  around\r\n\r\nto adopt family planning without resorting to threats\r\n\r\nand name-calling. Here again is what I suspect to  be\r\n\r\nanother WOG thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent examples of WOGs at work in Government\r\n\r\npolicies are abundant, but it may be a relief for our\r\n\r\nMinisters  in the Front Bench to note that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot alone in the pursuit of this title. In fact, only\r\n\r\nyesterday,  they were mirrored in the appeal  by  one\r\n\r\nsuch  latest exponent. This time, however, the  title\r\n\r\naward must go to none other than the hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah, who so seriously advocated,\r\n\r\nof  course, with detectable traces here and there  of\r\n\r\nimperfect  imitation of the Dale Carnegie style,  for\r\n\r\nthe implementation of Daylight Saving Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am no geographer, neither am I a pilot. But I\r\n\r\ndo  know that Singapore is approximately situated  at\r\n\r\nLat. 1 degree 21 minutes from the equator, and if  it\r\n\r\npleases  the hon. Member for Telok Blangah.  I  might\r\n\r\nadd  that we are north of the equator, where the  sun\r\n\r\nrises  every  morning at about 6 am, and  sets  every\r\n\r\nevening  around  6.45  to  7.00 p.m.  Daylight  saving\r\n\r\ncertainly is useful to countries further to the north\r\n\r\nof the equator, such as the United Kingdom. (The hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah might even tell us that  he\r\n\r\nknows  exactly the latitude of London.) I was a  poor\r\n\r\ngeography  student  and I did not  quite  get  myself\r\n\r\nround to the coordinates of longitudes and latitudes.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  episode does not end here. A colleague  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, who happens to be on the other  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House, suggested to me out of kindness  that  an\r\n\r\nalternative  might  well be to  advance  the  working\r\n\r\nhours  by  one hour. Sir, in fact, last  evening,  we\r\n\r\nwere trying to extend the time up to 6 o'clock and  I\r\n\r\nwas  thinking that we ought to be home for dinner  at\r\n\r\nnot  to  forget,  that would be after  two  hours  of\r\n\r\nrecreation. Sir, that was a suggestion with the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  it  would not upset everybody or confusing  the\r\n\r\ngeographers or the pilots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received the suggestion with some reservation, as\r\n\r\nI  am  conscious  of  my  official  position  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Labour,  under  which  portfolio   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  working hours sometimes  constitutes  a\r\n\r\nrather  unpleasant  subject in negotiations.  I  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  leave  it to this kind  Gentleman  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side of the House to muster sufficient courage\r\n\r\nto  appease  the hon. Member for Telok  Blangah  with\r\n\r\nthat proposal. But to be fair to that Member, Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndid  caution him that in the event he decides to risk\r\n\r\nhis  reputation  in  offering this  counter  proposal\r\n\r\nseriously, his arguments had better be of  such  high\r\n\r\nstandard  so  that  he may not, at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nexchange of the conversation, emerge as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing one who is bemoaned of lacking in eloquence and\r\n\r\nfound wanting in wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must apologise to the House for wasting your\r\n\r\ntime by dwelling too lengthily and ironically on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of saving time by wasting your time.  Allow\r\n\r\nme now to acquaint you with a game which I shall call\r\n\r\n`cancelling-out' for the time being until we  find  a\r\n\r\nbetter  name.  The players in this game  involve  two\r\n\r\nparties,  namely,  the Ministry of Education  and  of\r\n\r\ncourse, its worthy opponent\r\n\r\n-  the  Ministry of Culture. [Laughter]  Let  us  not\r\n\r\nlaugh  and dismiss this game too lightly, because  in\r\n\r\nthe  end, we, the spectators, will turn out to be the\r\n\r\nreal losers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the game is very simple. The principle is:\r\n\r\nWhatever  you  can  do,  I can  cancel.  Accordingly,\r\n\r\nwhatever the Ministry of Education does, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture promptly cancels out with an equally, and\r\n\r\nsometimes more effective counter-action. This process\r\n\r\nis then repeated with the procedure reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first weigh the stake which we stand to lose\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  watch the game with  more  vested\r\n\r\ninterests. If this rather stupid game does not stop,\r\n\r\nI  fear  that the more successful the Ministries  of\r\n\r\nEducation and Culture in their efforts to -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on a point of clarification.

After  I  left,  I  cannot  vouch\r\n\r\nwhether  this Ministry is indeed the same as  before.\r\n\r\nApparently it is not, Sin, because now the cancelling-out\r\n\r\nexercise is so blatant and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall  relate  more  later, I had expected  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMinister for Health to take me on family planning.

I can also send him to my Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Population Board for advice, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I am sorry. Sir, the hon. Minister\r\n\r\nmissed  the  boat, as I' have mentioned  it  earlier.\r\n\r\nLest    he   gets   anxious,   those   remarks   were\r\n\r\ncomplimentary. I think I should know better, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nyou know what I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to go on, Sir. As I was saying, if this\r\n\r\nrather  stupid  game does not stop, I fear  that  the\r\n\r\nmore  successful  the  Ministries  of  Education  and\r\n\r\nCulture  in  their efforts to \"imbibe the  tried  and\r\n\r\ntested  Asian  cultural and moral values\",  the  more\r\n\r\nthey are successful, the more resentment we will have\r\n\r\nto   face.   There  will  be  more  antiestablishment\r\n\r\nsentiments,   not  so  much  due  to  the   lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding of our national problems on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  but  due  to our  own  default  in  not\r\n\r\nunderstanding them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, Sir, the questions that we should ask\r\n\r\nourselves  are:  Just  what  are  these  values   and\r\n\r\ntraditions  that are so vital to our  survival  as  a\r\n\r\nnation?  And how are we going to achieve these  great\r\n\r\nobjectives set out for us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No attempt has been made in the Addenda to list out\r\n\r\nwhat  those values, culture and traditions are.  Even\r\n\r\nif  the  Ministries did try, there must  be  so  many\r\n\r\ncontradictions  rendering  the  exercise   a   wholly\r\n\r\nfrustrating one. This might well be a case of the 10,\r\n\r\nin  this game two blind men trying to decide what  an\r\n\r\nelephant looked like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, their handicap left us with\r\n\r\nnothing but disorientated compasses with which we are\r\n\r\nto take part in this cultural treasure-hunt. The most\r\n\r\nprofitable approach in this confusion, I presume, is\r\n\r\nby taking stock of what has been going on and take a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncount on the scoreboards of these two players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should begin with a conclusion already at\r\n\r\nhand.  This  approach certainly appears  odd,  rather\r\n\r\nunprofessional, even unenlightened and unorthodox  to\r\n\r\nbegin studying a problem. The conclusion is:\r\n\r\ndiscourage all traditional operas, or wayangs as they\r\n\r\nare  known,  at  least  make it difficult  for  their\r\n\r\nstagings,  because  this will  be  the  best  way  to\r\n\r\n`encourage' one aspect of cultural heritage which our\r\n\r\npeople are endowed with - by killing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture, of course, pledged:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to organise a wide range of activities to promote a\r\n\r\nbetter  appreciation of our cultural  heritage.  This\r\n\r\nwill  provide  our young with the necessary  cultural\r\n\r\nballast against the erosion of traditional norms  and\r\n\r\nvalues.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what are these norms and how wide is this wide\r\n\r\nrange  of  activities? Music, or  Art  for  Everyone,\r\n\r\nlyrics competitions? How are these activities able to\r\n\r\nprovide the cultural ballast?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer, if possible, would be welcome. If not,\r\n\r\nthen   may  I  venture  to  provide  one:  All  these\r\n\r\nutterances have been repeated year after year in this\r\n\r\nHouse.  The  result:  rampant drug  abuse,  still  no\r\n\r\ncultural ballast in sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To define the meaning of \"traditional\", the Ministry\r\n\r\npreceded by stating that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is Government policy to develop Singapore's rich\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage derived from the  Malay,  Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndian and western civilisations'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Western civilisation enjoys the confidence of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture and becomes acceptable as part of\r\n\r\nour   tradition.  Interestingly,  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  has  different ideas.  It  stated  in  its\r\n\r\nAddendum:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...they will be taught not to adopt the life styles and\r\n\r\nvalues  of the West that are alien and pernicious  to\r\n\r\nSingapore society.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this is genuinely the case of the right\r\n\r\nhand not knowing what the left hand is doing, because\r\n\r\nif  indeed one hand knows exactly what the other hand\r\n\r\ndoes, then this mutually cancelling-out exercise must\r\n\r\ngive rise to doubts as to the seriousness and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsincerity of the Government in our cultural policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now take a look at a few more scores in this\r\n\r\ngame that has been going on for too long a time.  The\r\n\r\nschools encourage our young to be thrifty and this is\r\n\r\nchallenged  by the television which advises  them  to\r\n\r\nbuy,  or  pester their parents to buy  what  they  or\r\n\r\ntheir  parents do not need. The school says you  must\r\n\r\nsave  money and open a POSB account, and the same  TV\r\n\r\nteases you and the parents by suggesting why wait for\r\n\r\nsuch a long time to get so little money, buy Toto and\r\n\r\nyour problems will be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school reminds our children that there is no\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for  hard work, do not try  to  get  rich\r\n\r\nquick.  But  the TV says, \"Decidedly wrong!  The  Big\r\n\r\nSweep    is   the   alternative\".   In   fact,    the\r\n\r\nadvertisements for Toto and the Big Sweep sounded  so\r\n\r\nconvincing that few people regard it foolish  not  to\r\n\r\nthrow  away a good portion of their salary so as  not\r\n\r\nto be left out as non-starters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education regards Western life\r\n\r\nstyles   and  values  as  alien  and  pernicious   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  TV, however, offers effective  anti-thesis\r\n\r\nto this proposition, one of which is  through\r\n\r\nthe  sometimes  less than tasteful advertisement  for\r\n\r\nnew jeans. They say new generation jeans but they  do\r\n\r\nnot  tell you the period between two generations.  Is\r\n\r\nit six months or one year? So you buy new jeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Ministry of Education takes great pains\r\n\r\nin  including in its curricula subjects such as music\r\n\r\nappreciation, even resuscitate Civics under the cover\r\n\r\nof  Education  for  Living, and  finally  the  annual\r\n\r\ngigantic  Youth Festival. But the TV holds  steadfast\r\n\r\nto  their  ground.  TV programmes have  been  equally\r\n\r\nsuccessful in forcing down our throat poorly produced\r\n\r\nso  called local cultural shows, stuffed with  crazy,\r\n\r\nfrequently `electrifying' dances. Electrifying indeed\r\n\r\nthey  are - if only we can find out why those healthy\r\n\r\nand able-bodied young men and women struggle in agony\r\n\r\nresembling electric shocks or anything but  what  the\r\n\r\nEducation Ministry thinks of cultural dances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now come to the interesting part. Refusing\r\n\r\nto be sidelined in this cancelling-out ingenuity, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education also shoots into its own  goal.\r\n\r\nTo  encourage thrift, for example again, they  change\r\n\r\ntext  books  even  more frequently than  they  change\r\n\r\ntheir Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its zeal to recover its tarnished image, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education boldly stated in its\r\n\r\nAddendum:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The education system has been revised to improve\r\n\r\nits  effectiveness. Consequently the enormous wastage\r\n\r\nII  underline) in terms of pupils not benefiting from\r\n\r\nthe  system  and  having to leave school  prematurely\r\n\r\nwill be drastically reduced'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  this an ideal, or is it not, as it sounded in the\r\n\r\naddendum,  a statement amounting to an indictment  of\r\n\r\nall the previous efforts of the so many Ministers for\r\n\r\nEducation?   Enormous  wastage  will  be  drastically\r\n\r\nreduced. That means in the past there must have  been\r\n\r\nenormous wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of our education can best be reflected\r\n\r\nin  what  one  hon. Member described  to  me  as  the\r\n\r\n`Goondu'  TV  shows,  at which generous  prizes  were\r\n\r\ngiven  away  to hide embarrassment. In  this  series,\r\n\r\nsimple  questions were asked of the participants  and\r\n\r\ninvariably, astounding, if not outraging answers were\r\n\r\npromptly  proffered. Blessed is the poor  goondu  who\r\n\r\nfinds  the right answer to the question on  how  many\r\n\r\nMinisters for Education there were in the  last  17\r\n\r\nyears!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mischiefs of WOGs unfortunately, are only one of\r\n\r\nthe  shots  in a double barrel gun. The  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  rightfully claims  the  right  to\r\n\r\ntrigger off the second shot. This time it is not WOG,\r\n\r\nbut  Santa Claus is at fault. Building decent  houses\r\n\r\nfor the people is the responsibility of the Board and\r\n\r\nit  was  for this need that the Board was established\r\n\r\nin  1960.  Whilst it is true that the Board has  done\r\n\r\nmuch in what its Chief Executive is paid for, success\r\n\r\nhas  carried them away to the extent that  they,  and\r\n\r\nonly  they, are the saviours of Singapore. The  Board\r\n\r\nis the philanthropist for whom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhon.

Members are not capable to advise  the  Board,\r\n\r\nstill  less  influence  its  policy.  We  have   been\r\n\r\nassigned  a  task  only to explain its  actions  and,\r\n\r\nworse  still, to justify its misdoing. Sir, we  stand\r\n\r\non  the  platform. They do not. So we have to justify\r\n\r\ntheir misdoings. This, I am sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nnot  a  complaint only personal to myself.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi spoke on his part of the  woes  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  yesterday, and I am sure  other  Members\r\n\r\nwill also certainly have their share of woes too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mention is made in the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Addendum under the subject  on  \"Housing\r\n\r\nand  Public  Projects\" as to how the HDB proposes  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  plight  of  the  one-roomers.   Other\r\n\r\nhousing estates may not be that bad, but if you go to\r\n\r\nManila  Street  you will find that you have  communal\r\n\r\nkitchens.  Then you will know what it is. Many  years\r\n\r\nago,  I  cautioned  in this House that  the  one-room\r\n\r\nunits would degenerate into slums over a short period\r\n\r\nof   time.   No   heed  was  paid  to   Parliamentary\r\n\r\ndiscussion. To the HDB, we appear to them as  nothing\r\n\r\nmore than a debating society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind whoever lives under that illusion that\r\n\r\nwe  in  this  House survive because of his  or  their\r\n\r\nworks,  will  certainly  be  very  grossly  mistaken.\r\n\r\nAgain,  Sir,I cautioned about the high  plot  ratio\r\n\r\ncommercial  development  at the  city  centre,  which\r\n\r\ninevitably  must generate a high volume  of  traffic,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  Shenton Way and  the  Golden  Shoe\r\n\r\narea. Today, we have the CBD restriction and the Area\r\n\r\nLicensing as our jackpot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been a different matter if public\r\n\r\napplicants  from the traditional slum areas  were  to\r\n\r\napply  for  HDB accommodation, but the  one-roomers\r\n\r\nare,  hon. Members will agree, if I were to  describe\r\n\r\nthis  short-sighted design of first generation  flats\r\n\r\nas  Government Planned Modernised Slum. Has  not  the\r\n\r\nHDB  an  obligation to do something  for  these  poor\r\n\r\nfolks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite repeated appeals by Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nthe HDB has been completely oblivious to the problem.\r\n\r\nFrom  recent  statements, we have been  assured  that\r\n\r\naction  will  be taken to resettle these  one-roomers\r\n\r\ninto  larger units, but the whole process would  take\r\n\r\nthree  to  four years. Is this not an admission  that\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  has not been responding to appeals  by  MPs\r\n\r\nuntil recently?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various proposals were offered. One involved the\r\n\r\nconversion  of these one-room units into larger  two-room\r\n\r\nunits by combining them; another was to demolish\r\n\r\na  number  of blocks to make way for green areas  and\r\n\r\nplaying fields - this is a deficiency in planning now\r\n\r\nrequiring rectification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be worthwhile for HDB to take note of\r\n\r\nMembers'  views, if they accept that Parliament,  not\r\n\r\ntheir  drawing office, is the supreme  body  in  this\r\n\r\nRepublic. I must state that in this matter, we  shall\r\n\r\nnot succumb to their whims and fancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for us to look far for inspirations\r\n\r\nto  this  conversion programme. These one-room  units\r\n\r\ncan easily be retained and converted for a variety of\r\n\r\nuses, to name only a few:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Homes for the Aged - The design of these units\r\n\r\nis ideal for conversion into dormitories for the aged\r\n\r\nso  that they can live as part of the community in  a\r\n\r\nHDB  estate, without having to suffer the feeling  of\r\n\r\nbeing  treated as castaways in some remote homes.  In\r\n\r\nall  probability, some of these units might  actually\r\n\r\nbe  so  converted,  because I have great  confidence,\r\n\r\nvery rare confidence though, in the HDB's ability  in\r\n\r\nquickly  responding to the recent calls for the  care\r\n\r\nof the aged made by so many Ministers. One up for the\r\n\r\nHDB on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A less rewarding proposition for the HDB. For\r\n\r\nareas  urgently  in  need of  community  centres  and\r\n\r\nlacking  in  suitable sites a conversion may  be  the\r\n\r\nmost     expeditious    solution,    although     the\r\n\r\nsuperstructure  may  present some technical  problems\r\n\r\nbut these are not insurmountable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Conversion of some of these units to provide for\r\n\r\nalternative accommodations for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations affected by development  schemes\r\n\r\nor  urban renewal protects. One must not forget  that\r\n\r\nour  civic organisations, whilst handicapped  by  old\r\n\r\nfashioned  management methods, have proved themselves\r\n\r\nto  be  useful and effective in serving the community\r\n\r\nin  the  past. I have no doubt that given help,  they\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be so in the future. Through  their\r\n\r\nmutual  assistance,  such as  scholarship  for  their\r\n\r\nmembers'  children, they have been able to partially,\r\n\r\nmaybe  negligibly,  relieve the State  of  the  heavy\r\n\r\nburden  on education and social services. It is  only\r\n\r\ntoo  unfortunate  that nobody thought  it  useful  or\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  make  fuller  studies  into  the  more\r\n\r\npositive aspects of their works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Resettlement Department is the most\r\n\r\ncontroversial unit in this glamorous HDB outfit. This\r\n\r\nDepartment  is even more hard-pressed to perform  the\r\n\r\ndual  functions of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. A not  very\r\n\r\nhelpful Dr Jekyll but certainly a monstrous Mr  Hyde.\r\n\r\nI will tell you why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dr Jekyll role is portrayed through the\r\n\r\nhypocritical claim of help given to those affected by\r\n\r\nredevelopment.  The  common  claim  is   that   those\r\n\r\naffected  and entitled to resettlement benefits,  are\r\n\r\nreminded  that they enjoy concessionary  rents,  etc.\r\n\r\nLet  me say that these concessions are no concessions\r\n\r\nat  all.  They  are  entitlements. These  people  are\r\n\r\nentitled to these so-called goodies because they have\r\n\r\nbeen uprooted from their steady livelihood, having to\r\n\r\nplunge into uncertainties in the new environment  and\r\n\r\nto  re-establish themselves once again.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nover  and above all these `concessions' that the  HDB\r\n\r\ncan then justifiably claim to offer concessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hyde's role is understandably less humane.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents are not entitled to rehousing nor\r\n\r\nbusiness  premises. I agree that permanent  residents\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  entertained when  applying  for  HDB\r\n\r\naccommodation  under  the normal public  application,\r\n\r\nbut in the case of resettlement, it is highly immoral\r\n\r\nthat they be deprived of alternative housing or place\r\n\r\nof  business.  After all, the HDB  requires  them  to\r\n\r\nquit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise  they are quite contented with  the  status\r\n\r\nquo, and pose no burden on the HDB, knowing that they\r\n\r\ndo   not  qualify  for  HDB  accommodation  which   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  about  95  to  100  thousand  of  citizen\r\n\r\nfamilies are on the waiting list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, with a grand\r\n\r\nexample of how hypocritical one can be. Here,  may  I\r\n\r\ncall to mention the recent good deeds of our MPs,  so\r\n\r\npublicised  in the newspapers, notably our Ministers,\r\n\r\ngoing  round their constituencies offering  gifts  to\r\n\r\nthe  old  folks  so  that it has  been  so  gallantly\r\n\r\nclaimed that the less fortunate people may also enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  forthcoming new year. This is an  annual  affair\r\n\r\nand I salute those who do so much and so consistently\r\n\r\nover all these years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In resettlement action, however, being old and worse\r\n\r\nstill,   alone,   is  a  sin  and   consequently   an\r\n\r\nobstruction as far as the HDB is concerned. A single,\r\n\r\nold  aged citizen, I emphasize old aged citizen, will\r\n\r\nnot be able to secure an alternative accommodation on\r\n\r\nhis  own.  He  is compelled to go round the  affected\r\n\r\nneighbourhood    to   look   for   another    equally\r\n\r\nunfortunately, lonely, old soul so that if they  both\r\n\r\nagree, they may jointly be allocated a one-room unit.\r\n\r\nBut  if he happens to be the only such outcast,  (the\r\n\r\nterm  is what I suspect the HDB regards him as  such.\r\n\r\nIt  is not my term, Sir) then he is left to fend  for\r\n\r\nhis twilight years in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> In the slums!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> In the slums.

But old people are not animals.  They  are\r\n\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nThey  are senior citizens and here they have to  fend\r\n\r\nfor  themselves in the streets.

The  unanimity of the  House  in  your  re-election\r\n\r\nis  a  clear reflection  of  the  excellent\r\n\r\nmanner in which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou have always conducted the affairs of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meeting, Sir, in this Fourth Parliament is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  an occasion of gratitude for  the  total\r\n\r\nvictory of the People's Action Party at the polls and\r\n\r\nof  satisfaction  that our policies have  once  again\r\n\r\nbeen  endorsed  by  the  electorate.  Our  happiness,\r\n\r\nhowever,  has been diminished by the tragic  loss  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Radin Mas, who in the summer  of  his\r\n\r\nlife, has left vacant his seat in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice, as I remember, resounded vigorously in\r\n\r\nand out of Parliament, many a time, for the cause  of\r\n\r\nhis constituents and the workers of Singapore. As  an\r\n\r\nhon.   Member  and  a  trade  unionist,   he   worked\r\n\r\nunselfishly and unstintingly to improve the  standard\r\n\r\nof  living  and  quality of life of those  under  his\r\n\r\ncharge, despite the fact that his tired and sick body\r\n\r\ncould  no  longer take the pressures necessitated  by\r\n\r\nhis  dedicated life. He spent the evening  before  he\r\n\r\ndied  -  he  passed away in the small  hours  of  the\r\n\r\nmorning  -  in his constituency, giving away  Chinese\r\n\r\nNew   Year  ang  pows  to  those  in  less  fortunate\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I will miss him much, in  and  out  of\r\n\r\nthe House, as I am sure many will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the opening of the Third\r\n\r\nParliament    in    October    1972,    international\r\n\r\ndevelopments   have  had  serious  repercussions   on\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  today Singapore  and  the  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian  region  are  facing  a  whole  range  of   new\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, the President's Speech and Addenda\r\n\r\nindicated  optimism, with expectations  of  continued\r\n\r\neconomic growth and better lives for our citizens. We\r\n\r\nwere  then  enjoying a mini-boom and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance,  indicating continued economic  growth,  was\r\n\r\nable  to  assure us that there was no  need  for  any\r\n\r\nmajor  increases  in taxation or revenue  collection.\r\n\r\nHowever,  that prediction and euphoria did  not  last\r\n\r\nlong.  We were overtaken by circumstances beyond  our\r\n\r\ncontrol by inflation, increases in the price  of  oil\r\n\r\nand  international economic depression, resulting  in\r\n\r\nlower economic growth, the threat of unemployment and\r\n\r\nsocial insecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that the world in general has\r\n\r\nbeen able to cast off the shackles of stagflation and\r\n\r\nthe  future looks brighter than it did two years ago,\r\n\r\nnew  problems, that may rock the very foundations  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic societies in this region, are foreseeable,\r\n\r\nand  we have to be firm in our resolve to resist  and\r\n\r\nrepel   attempts   to  undermine  and   destroy   our\r\n\r\nindependence, our way of life and our security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the communist victory in Indochina, the\r\n\r\ndemocratic governments of neighbouring countries have\r\n\r\nbeen  threatened  overtly and  covertly  by  external\r\n\r\naggression  and  internal  insurgencies,   and   with\r\n\r\nphysical  and  moral support to communist  terrorists\r\n\r\nwithin.  We  in  Singapore have to be ever  vigilant;\r\n\r\nthere  must  be  no  let-up in our internal  security\r\n\r\nmeasures.  We  must not be misled by  the  peace  and\r\n\r\ntranquillity enjoyed by all in Singapore,  which  has\r\n\r\nonly  been  made possible by the firm measures  taken\r\n\r\nduring the past years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are only a few miles away from the hot-bed of\r\n\r\nterrorist  activities and our people must  be  warned\r\n\r\nand  constantly reminded of the speed with which  the\r\n\r\ncommunists can mount acts of terrorism against us  as\r\n\r\nthey have done in the neighbouring states of Thailand\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia. We must be on our guard at  all  times\r\n\r\nand  never  be lulled into a false sense of security.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, all that we have worked for, all that  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  have striven for, all that they have  built\r\n\r\nover  the  last  17  years will  be  destroyed  by  a\r\n\r\ncommunist  take-over. We have only to  take  note  of\r\n\r\nwhat  has  happened in Cambodia after  the  communist\r\n\r\ntake-over and the recent acts of violence on the Thai\r\n\r\nborder, to realise the sort of treatment that will be\r\n\r\nmeted  out  to our people if we are not vigilant  and\r\n\r\nallow   communist  infiltration.  I  am,   therefore,\r\n\r\ngrateful to the prominence and emphasis given to  the\r\n\r\nneed of security in the Presidential Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in sharp contrast to the optimistic tenor of\r\n\r\nthe  President's  Speech in 1972, we  have  now  been\r\n\r\nwarned  to prepare for a slower growth rate and  have\r\n\r\nbeen   advised   to   adjust  our   spending   habits\r\n\r\naccordingly both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  a Government and as individuals. The Government's\r\n\r\ndecision  to  economise  in governmental  expenditure\r\n\r\nbecame  noticeable  during the past  year.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of regret, however, that Singaporeans have not\r\n\r\nlearnt  to similarly restrain their spending  habits.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one could say that spending habits are still\r\n\r\nindifferent and reckless, tending towards adoption of\r\n\r\nWestern contemporary life styles, which do no good to\r\n\r\nour  citizens and our country. Indulgence in wasteful\r\n\r\nspending  can  be clearly seen in the market  places,\r\n\r\nshopping complexes, restaurants and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last Sunday, one of our local newspapers\r\n\r\nexposed  the gullibility of Singaporeans who, because\r\n\r\nof  a  desire to be up-to-date and fashion-conscious,\r\n\r\nhave  succumbed  to advertising expertise  and  high-pressure\r\n\r\nsalesmanship, and beguiled into  purchasing\r\n\r\nlocally-made  jeans and jackets, which are  exported,\r\n\r\nlabelled  with  a foreign trade mark, re-exported  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and sold at prices about five to six  times\r\n\r\nthe  original  cost of production  in  our  Singapore\r\n\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own mass media, especially our television, has\r\n\r\nin  no  small measure contributed to this unnecessary\r\n\r\nspending  and wasteful habits among our citizens.  We\r\n\r\nseem  to  be succumbing to the phenomenon  common  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries,  where  the  imported  product\r\n\r\nacquires snob value, mainly because it costs more and\r\n\r\npartly  because people wish to ape the  life  in  the\r\n\r\nWest,  in the mistaken belief that the West  are  the\r\n\r\ntrendsetters of fashion with a sophisticated  way  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that Singaporeans, falling prey to\r\n\r\nhigh-pressure   salesmanship  and  advertising,   are\r\n\r\nsquandering  their hard-earned money by indulging  in\r\n\r\nwasteful habits. If we are not careful and our people\r\n\r\nnot   warned, we  could  be  completely  misled  and\r\n\r\ncheated.  I read recently an account of the  exploits\r\n\r\nof  two enterprising young businessmen who decided to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the American consumers gullibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRealising that they could sell anything to Americans,\r\n\r\nif  the  goods  were packaged well and  attractively,\r\n\r\nthey made a fortune by selling 450 gms of plain earth\r\n\r\nfor  $25.00.  They  sold them  as  potting  soil  for\r\n\r\nplants,  in  chic  little  bags.  In  this  game   of\r\n\r\nexploiting  the  gullibility  of  consumers,  I  must\r\n\r\nreiterate that our RTS is where the shoe pinches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commercial television service appears to be\r\n\r\nguided   only   by   the  amount  of   revenue   that\r\n\r\nadvertisements bring in and is not concerned with the\r\n\r\ntype of advertisements. This matter. I must add,  has\r\n\r\nbeen mentioned in this House before and seems to have\r\n\r\nfallen  on  deaf  ears.  For  example,  although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  introduced  a  ban  on  tobacco  and\r\n\r\ncigarette advertisements and discourages smoking, our\r\n\r\ntelevision    commercial   service   quite    happily\r\n\r\nadvertises  cigarette lighters, which  is  a  product\r\n\r\nancillary to smoking. And, of course, there are other\r\n\r\nmisleading  advertisements, very skilfully portraying\r\n\r\nunnecessary  products,  such  as  expensive  imported\r\n\r\napparel, etc., with jingles to promote their sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nindicates that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singaporeans can enjoy an increasingly higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of living because we can pay for our  needs\r\n\r\nin  food, housing, education and health and for  more\r\n\r\nand better goods and services`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an encouraging assurance which will be\r\n\r\nwelcomed by all. The increase in our GDP, which makes\r\n\r\npossible  a  higher standard of living and  a  better\r\n\r\nlife,  represents the sum total of the output of  all\r\n\r\nin  our Republic. The largest contributor to our  GDP\r\n\r\nis  the industrial sector and we should therefore not\r\n\r\nforget that the productivity of the industrial sector\r\n\r\nrepresents   ultimately  the  productivity   of   the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be remembered as we enjoy the fruits\r\n\r\nof  our industry, that our industrial progress,  has,\r\n\r\nbecause  of certain omissions taken an undue toll  of\r\n\r\nhuman  suffering in mangled limbs and lives. Remedial\r\n\r\naction is called for immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore developed an industrial economy\r\n\r\nduring the past 17 years. In the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocess,  new  forms  of  machinery,  new  forms   of\r\n\r\nproduction,  new  forms  of  construction  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  in our Republic. They have  brought  with\r\n\r\nthem attendant hazards for the workers - the man  who\r\n\r\noperates  the  machines, the  man  who  services  and\r\n\r\nrepairs  the  ships, the man who works  on  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, about 15 years ago, there were hardly\r\n\r\nany  high-rise buildings. Construction was then quite\r\n\r\nsimple.   Wooden  scaffoldings  were   adequate   for\r\n\r\nconstruction  work. Steel girders seldom  had  to  be\r\n\r\nhauled  up to high places. Today, we have 30- to  40-\r\n\r\nstorey buildings springing up all over the Island and\r\n\r\nwooden   scaffolding  is  quite   inadequate.   Metal\r\n\r\nscaffoldings are necessary as steel girders  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  hauled to very high places. The whole concept  of\r\n\r\nconstruction has changed and brought with it  dangers\r\n\r\nto  the  workforce. But it is most  regrettable  that\r\n\r\nvery little has been done to retrain our workers  who\r\n\r\nwere  used  to the former methods of construction  to\r\n\r\ncope with the new situation. Old habits die hard  and\r\n\r\nthis  has  resulted in a number of serious  accidents\r\n\r\nand  deaths.  There has clearly been an  omission  on\r\n\r\nsomebody's  part to retrain our workers for  the  new\r\n\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Mr Speaker, Sir, Government legislation\r\n\r\nhas   been  very  slow  in  catering  for   the   new\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   It  is  not  as  if  the   Ministries\r\n\r\nconcerned were unaware of the hazards facing  workmen\r\n\r\nin  the  building  trade  as a  result  of  high-rise\r\n\r\ndevelopment. They must have observed the patterns  in\r\n\r\ncountries with high-rise buildings before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in factories the workers are faced with a\r\n\r\nwhole  range  of  threats  to  life  and  limb   from\r\n\r\nindustrial machines. The safety measures required  in\r\n\r\nthe  factories can easily be adapted to our needs  by\r\n\r\nobserving what goes on in the factories abroad.  But,\r\n\r\ninsufficient has been done and our workers are paying\r\n\r\nthe penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can hardly blame workers on ships to appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  dangers of gas in the ships' holds  and  of  the\r\n\r\nfires  that can be generated from a spark from  their\r\n\r\nshoes, when the dangers have not been explained Our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  are simple-minded people who concentrate  on\r\n\r\nthe  job  and on productivity, and it is  up  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers and the Government to ensure that they  are\r\n\r\ngiven  protection from the dangers of modern industry\r\n\r\nand chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that with the British pullout,\r\n\r\nbecause it posed a major problem, it received serious\r\n\r\nattention,  and among other things, training  schemes\r\n\r\nwere devised to retrain those who lost their jobs, to\r\n\r\nfit    them    for    other   work,    But    because\r\n\r\nindustrialisation has gone on quietly and steadily in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the re-training of our workers, to  enable\r\n\r\nthem to cope with new methods of production, with new\r\n\r\nforms  of  machinery, has received  scant  attention.\r\n\r\nSafety   measures   have  similarly   not   attracted\r\n\r\nsufficient scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the total percentage increase in the number\r\n\r\nof   accidents  over  1974  was  an  alarming  18.8%.\r\n\r\nAlthough for the same period the number of fatalities\r\n\r\ndropped, the position is still not under control. The\r\n\r\n1976 statistics is still to be made available by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour, but as I understand,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  marked  increase in  the  total  number  of\r\n\r\naccidents last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States in 1959, the long-term trend of\r\n\r\ndeclining  accident  rates  was  reversed   with   an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  industrial  activity,  influx  of   new\r\n\r\nworkers  and  a  more  rapid  introduction   of   new\r\n\r\nprocesses and activities. Legislation was immediately\r\n\r\nupdated and comprehensively provides for measures for\r\n\r\nthe prevention of industrial accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, however, although there was generally\r\n\r\nlittle increase in industrial activity, in the influx\r\n\r\nof  new workers, etc, the percentage of accidents, as\r\n\r\nI have said earlier, has increased tremendously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, attitudes have yet to be\r\n\r\nchanged.   Employers   show   little   interest    in\r\n\r\nimplementing  safe  working methods,  self-regulatory\r\n\r\nsystems, and in providing satisfactory safety apparel\r\n\r\nand   a   safe  working  environment,  with  machines\r\n\r\nregularly  maintained and guarded. Workers also  lack\r\n\r\nsafety consciousness, sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisobey safety rules and regulations and fail to  put\r\n\r\non personal protective equipment while on the job. In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  enforcement machinery lacks  adequate\r\n\r\nstrength   in  numbers,  discipline  and  dedication.\r\n\r\nInspections at factories and pressure vessels  seldom\r\n\r\nresult    in   severe   action   being   taken    for\r\n\r\ncontraventions of legislation. Similarly, seldom  are\r\n\r\neffective  recommendations made to  alleviate  common\r\n\r\nailments  such  as poor house-keeping and  misuse  or\r\n\r\nlack  of  safety appliances which could quite  easily\r\n\r\nresult in accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the important techniques of accident\r\n\r\nprevention is the analysis of accidents to  determine\r\n\r\ntheir  underlying causes so that positive action  can\r\n\r\nbe   taken   to  prevent  recurrence.  The   American\r\n\r\nStandards   Association  provides  a  procedure   for\r\n\r\nselecting,    classifying   and    summarising    the\r\n\r\nfundamental  factors in accidents. The Annual  Report\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry  of  Labour  lacks  vision  in  its\r\n\r\nstatistical data and leaves little room for employers\r\n\r\nand workers to pin-point the areas that need greatest\r\n\r\nvigilance.  In  addition,  it  must  to  some  extent\r\n\r\nhandicap  the Factory Inspectorate in its enforcement\r\n\r\nand  accident prevention duties. Before judgment  can\r\n\r\nbe  made  about  the  magnitude of  the  occupational\r\n\r\ndisability problem, aggregate data on the  number  of\r\n\r\ninjuries  and  deaths must be standardised.  To  draw\r\n\r\ncomparisons  between industries and  plants  or  even\r\n\r\nbetween  departments  in  a plant  or  factory,  such\r\n\r\nstandardised  data  would be of  tremendous  positive\r\n\r\nvalue  in  preventive  action. Standardised  accident\r\n\r\nfrequency  and severity rates therefore should  be  a\r\n\r\npart   of  the  responsibility  of  statutory  Safety\r\n\r\nCommittees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, registered with the Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nare more than 10,000 handicapped or disabled persons.\r\n\r\nBy  modest estimates, there could be as many that are\r\n\r\nnot registered. Their disablement is congenital or as\r\n\r\na  result of the toll taken by industrialisation.  Of\r\n\r\nthose   registered,  more  than  4,000  are  in   the\r\n\r\nemployable age-range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA quota scheme for the employment of disabled persons\r\n\r\nis  necessary. The scheme has to be strictly enforced\r\n\r\nif  it  is  to be successful and employers should  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  make quarterly returns  indicating  the\r\n\r\npercentage   of   disabled  persons  employed.   Dis-incentives\r\n\r\ncould  perhaps be  introduced  to  ensure\r\n\r\ncompliance with the quota scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those that are not employable should be given\r\n\r\nrealistic public assistance, This would also  include\r\n\r\nthe  aged.  It  is right not to encourage  misuse  of\r\n\r\npublic  assistance by increasing its quantum to  such\r\n\r\nan  extent  as  to  make  it  attractive  enough  for\r\n\r\ncitizens  to cease supporting their aged or disabled.\r\n\r\nIncentives introduced to ensure such support could be\r\n\r\nintroduced. But where such incentives cannot  benefit\r\n\r\nthose  who support the aged and disabled, the quantum\r\n\r\nof   public  assistance  must  be  realistic,  Humane\r\n\r\ntreatment by civil servants of those receiving public\r\n\r\nassistance is essential. I had occasion to take up  a\r\n\r\ncase  of a bed-ridden paralytic Constituent who lived\r\n\r\nwith  his unemployed, old and sick wife. Each  month,\r\n\r\nshe had to travel a good five miles from Jalan Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  to  collect her husband's allowance  from  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  Department. This  meant  a  one-mile\r\n\r\ntrudge   to   the  bus-stop  from  the  kampong,   an\r\n\r\nunnecessary  waste of bus-fare, a long  wait  at  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  Department and the tiresome  journey\r\n\r\nback home. All the while, her helpless husband lay on\r\n\r\nhis  back without her care, awaiting her return. Most\r\n\r\ncertainly,  the  authorities  concerned  could  quite\r\n\r\neasily  have saved her the strain and cost by  making\r\n\r\navailable at her house the public assistance  due  to\r\n\r\nthem. To make matters worse, when she was admitted to\r\n\r\nhospital    for   an   operation,   the    cost    of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation   was  deducted   from   the   public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowance leaving  them  a  mere  $20  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  for  the month. This inhuman practice  turns\r\n\r\nassistance  into cruelty. There surely must  be  many\r\n\r\nother such cases which merit immediate attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real incentive to labour organisation is\r\n\r\nthe  control  of the work environment, stemming  from\r\n\r\nthe  realisation that control over the conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment can be achieved only by workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho become organised and who act collectively. Hence,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  are the essential instrument  for  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of collective freedom, which  is  itself\r\n\r\nthe   prerequisite   for  the  protection   and   the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of  the  individual  worker.  Throughout\r\n\r\ntheir history trade unions have had to battle against\r\n\r\npowerful enemies, not the least of which has been the\r\n\r\nlaw.  The law seems to favour employers, and as such,\r\n\r\nthe  advantage they take against trade unions  leaves\r\n\r\nmuch  to  be  desired. Employers  have  even  lowered\r\n\r\nsalary and fringe benefits to workers the moment they\r\n\r\nare  organised in order to hit back at trade  unions,\r\n\r\nIf  there  is  to  be a continuation of  co-operation\r\n\r\namong  Government, unions and employers to  ensure  a\r\n\r\nunited   contribution  to  economic  growth  by   the\r\n\r\npromotion   of  a  stable  and  peaceful   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations climate, immediate steps must be  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure that employers do not act arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, job-hopping is not a symptomatic cure sought by\r\n\r\nworkers. It is also not a frivolity they are fond  of\r\n\r\nindulging  in.  Let us look at the reasons  for  job-hopping\r\n\r\nbefore we consider penalising job-hoppers  by\r\n\r\nreducing   their  share  of  the  NWC  wage  increase\r\n\r\nrecommended.  If  the  reasons  for  job-hopping  are\r\n\r\njustified,  I  do  not understand why  these  workers\r\n\r\nshould be penalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first reason that comes to mind for workers\r\n\r\nwho  job-hop  in Singapore is distance from  home  to\r\n\r\nplace  of work. With the rapid building of HDB  flats\r\n\r\nand  many  workers  wanting  to  live  in  them,  the\r\n\r\ntendency for them to move house is almost certain. In\r\n\r\naddition,  many  of our workers are  young  and  earn\r\n\r\nsmall  wages.  They usually live with their  parents.\r\n\r\nWith  greater number of people moving into HDB  flats\r\n\r\ndue  to resettlement and the need for them to improve\r\n\r\ntheir living conditions, they will have to move  away\r\n\r\nfrom  their  former abodes which in  most  cases  are\r\n\r\nclose to their working places. In addition, when they\r\n\r\nmarry, they normally make their own home, which means\r\n\r\nmovement  of both husband and wife from their  former\r\n\r\nabodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next reason is almost always due to inadequate\r\n\r\nwages. One cannot penalise a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker who goes for another job that pays more. After\r\n\r\nall, he is willing to give his best and why should he\r\n\r\nnot  receive  his worth? This situation  will  always\r\n\r\nexist  in order that a competitive labour market  can\r\n\r\nfunction   to   the  benefit  of  both  workers   and\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our workers who are not choosy and who\r\n\r\nrealise that a bird in hand is worth more than two in\r\n\r\nthe bush, accept jobs that they were neither educated\r\n\r\nfor nor trained for. After such time, when a suitable\r\n\r\njob,  commensurate  with his  training  comes  along,\r\n\r\nshould he not be at liberty to change jobs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other legitimate reasons for changing\r\n\r\njobs, such as an unreasonable and tyrannical employer\r\n\r\nwho   makes   life  miserable  for  employees.   Such\r\n\r\ncircumstances do not warrant the penalty of a loss in\r\n\r\nNWC  wage  increase recommendations, I must therefore\r\n\r\nstress that Government should take heed not to  upset\r\n\r\nthe  labour  market  by applying constraints  on  the\r\n\r\nindividual's freedom to choose his own employment and\r\n\r\nemployer. After all, does not the employer  have  the\r\n\r\nright  to hire and fire? So why should not the worker\r\n\r\nalso have the right to opt in or opt out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion\r\n\r\nof the Member for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's speech, mention has been made\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans should formulate their own way  of\r\n\r\nlife. This is of particular interest to me. Over  the\r\n\r\nlast decade, we have been groping our way about for a\r\n\r\nsolution. Today we can say that we have found  a  way\r\n\r\nout.  Just like what the English proverb says:  Where\r\n\r\nthere  is a will, there is a way. After some  effort,\r\n\r\nwe  have found a way out to a better future. It is to\r\n\r\nlearn  and  absorb Western science and technology  in\r\n\r\ntoto. By doing so, our life has bettered that some 10\r\n\r\nyears  ago. For instance, 10 years ago we built  many\r\n\r\none-room  units of flats to accommodate thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople. At that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime,  this  sort of flats was considered  good.  But\r\n\r\ntoday  these  flats do not appear to be good  enough.\r\n\r\nDuring the last general elections this type of  flats\r\n\r\nhad  been  given  an airing of views, Our  candidates\r\n\r\nmade a promise in the general elections saying, \"All.\r\n\r\nright,  we  will  modify these one-room  flats.\"  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has to improve them by converting two such\r\n\r\nunits into one bigger unit. Otherwise people will not\r\n\r\nwant  to  stay in such one-room flats. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  Government has to build four-room,  five-room\r\n\r\nand even six-room flats. As the people like  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  them,  the Government is even  prepared  to\r\n\r\nbuild luxurious flats and apartments as condominiums,\r\n\r\ncosting hundreds of thousands of dollars in order  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  their  needs, This is obviously  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  our  economic progress and the success  in  our\r\n\r\nfamily  planning. While the number of  members  in  a\r\n\r\nfamily has become smaller, the living area of a  flat\r\n\r\nhas   become  larger.  In  the  newspapers   and   in\r\n\r\nmagazines,  interior  decorators  have  designed  the\r\n\r\nlayout  of  a  flat  for a family  of  four.  Besides\r\n\r\ndesigning separate bedrooms for the parents  and  the\r\n\r\nchildren, they have also provided a bathroom in  each\r\n\r\nbedroom, or next to the hall a balcony is added.  The\r\n\r\nrooms will be well ventilated and bright, and flowers\r\n\r\nand  birds  have been added to turn the flat  into  a\r\n\r\nparadise.  So now the urge to work hard in  order  to\r\n\r\nmake more money so as to raise the standard of living\r\n\r\nhas  become the norm as well as a factor for progress\r\n\r\nin  this  pragmatic society. If we had discarded  the\r\n\r\nprinciples   of  \"reward  according  to  merit\"   and\r\n\r\n\"distribution according to labour\", our  construction\r\n\r\nprogramme would not have progressed so fast.  In  our\r\n\r\npresent  more and more westernised family  structure,\r\n\r\nusually  only two generations live together  separate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  grandparents, just as what  our  textbooks\r\n\r\nhave now taught our pupils. We find that the children\r\n\r\nare  taught that every morning when they get up  they\r\n\r\nmust  say  \"good morning\" to daddy and to mummy,  but\r\n\r\nthese  textbooks  do not include  \"good  morning\"  to\r\n\r\ngrandfather  and to grandmother. To the  majority  of\r\n\r\nus, we have parents and children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving together at the same time. The only difference\r\n\r\nis  that under the western influence parents stay  at\r\n\r\none  place whereas we ourselves and our children live\r\n\r\nat  another  place. So this has caused a twin  social\r\n\r\nproblem relating to two generations. On the one hand,\r\n\r\nthe  aged and weak parents have been forsaken by  the\r\n\r\nchildren   and  some,  when  they  are   faced   with\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  their  livelihood,  had  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to put them into a home for the  aged  so\r\n\r\nthat  they could pass away their twilight years under\r\n\r\nsome shelter,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem is the case with young couples\r\n\r\nwith children. If the wife finds that she cannot  get\r\n\r\na housemaid to help in the household chores, she will\r\n\r\nresign  from her employment to run the house  and  to\r\n\r\nteach the children. In this way, the family budget is\r\n\r\nincreased while income is reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays in view of the increasing number of\r\n\r\nGovernment  flats more and more children would  leave\r\n\r\ntheir  parents to live separately when they are ready\r\n\r\nto raise their own families, This gap between the two\r\n\r\ngenerations resulting in the twin social problem  has\r\n\r\nbecome  acute.  In  view  of  this  trend  in  family\r\n\r\nstructure,  I would like to ask the question  whether\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should accept in toto western  cultural\r\n\r\nvalues  and  concepts.  To  me,  personally  I  think\r\n\r\nwestern  science and technology is our life-line.  We\r\n\r\nmust endeavour to seek these for our own good. On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  we should not allow the individualistic\r\n\r\nliberalism  produced in the very rich  West  to  form\r\n\r\npart of our culture, because it will only divide  our\r\n\r\npeople  and weaken our thoughts and split our society\r\n\r\nso  that we become poor, weak and cannot stand on our\r\n\r\nown.  There  is  the  example of  Tan  Wah  Piow  who\r\n\r\nillegally  entered England. All along in his  way  of\r\n\r\nlife and education he has been thinking that the moon\r\n\r\nin the West is very round, much rounder than the moon\r\n\r\nin  the  East. He does not know that the moon in  the\r\n\r\nEast  is  just  as round. Thus he is  imbued  with  a\r\n\r\ndubious concept of values, which makes him think that\r\n\r\nto  be born a foreigner and to die a foreign ghost is\r\n\r\nvery  glorious to him. What I want to  point  out  is\r\n\r\nthat  after  all we are Singaporeans living  in  this\r\n\r\nstrategic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeographical area in Southeast Asia where western and\r\n\r\neastern  cultures meet, We have our own way of  life.\r\n\r\nWhile  there  is  certain similarity with  the  West,\r\n\r\nthere  is  also some difference from the  West.  Even\r\n\r\nwhen  compared with the Chinese, Indian or Indonesian\r\n\r\nways  of  life, there are differences in similarities\r\n\r\nand  there are also similarities in differences.  But\r\n\r\nthese are our characteristics. This goes to show that\r\n\r\nwe are ourselves, Singaporeans, masters of ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe are not the play-things of the colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once more I support the Motion of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Motion standing in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech has re-asserted the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  position  that, other  than  education,\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment and housing, nothing else will  be\r\n\r\nsubsidised by the Government. This position has  been\r\n\r\nwell  understood  and largely accepted  by  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  Singaporeans,  otherwise  the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  not have been returned  to  office\r\n\r\nwith the highest percentage of votes cast in the last\r\n\r\nsix  general  elections. But what many people  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  and have cause to grumble  about  is  why\r\n\r\nthey  are  sometimes made to pay over and  above  the\r\n\r\neconomic cost of certain commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the price of petrol. When oil\r\n\r\nprices were increased by the OPEC countries in recent\r\n\r\nyears,   oil   companies  in   Singapore   made   two\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  the  retail prices  of  petrol.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment also at the same time increased  its  duty\r\n\r\non  petrol correspondingly. Was this not imposing  an\r\n\r\nadditional financial burden on the consumers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the tax surcharge on the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  PUB utilities if  the  total  amount\r\n\r\nexceeds  $30  per month. The rates have already  been\r\n\r\nrevised  by the PUB in line with the additional  cost\r\n\r\nit  must  incur from increases in the price  of  oil.\r\n\r\nPeople can accept the fact that their consumption of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npetrol  and  PUB utilities cannot be subsidised,  and\r\n\r\nthey  must  be  prepared to pay for'  the  periodical\r\n\r\nincreases in the costs of these commodities. But what\r\n\r\nthey  find it a little difficult to swallow is having\r\n\r\nto  pay additional taxes over and above the increases\r\n\r\nin economic costs that they have to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that in relation to the commodities such\r\n\r\nas those I referred to, Singaporeans are not only not\r\n\r\nsubsidised  by  the Government but are  also  heavily\r\n\r\npenalised by the Government for their consumption  or\r\n\r\nuse  of those commodities. Whatever may have been the\r\n\r\nreason  for the Government to do this, the net effect\r\n\r\nis  that all this additional tax burden is passed  on\r\n\r\nby  the manufacturers, businessmen and shopkeepers to\r\n\r\nthe final consumers, most of whom are workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President stated in his address that the PAP won\r\n\r\nin   all  the  69  constituencies  with  the  highest\r\n\r\npercentage  of  votes cast in the  six  last  general\r\n\r\nelections.  He  went  on to say  that  this  vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  imposes  a  heavy responsibility  on  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  act fairly but firmly,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will   exercise   its   authority   with\r\n\r\ncircumspection and moderation. This is most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, life can never be too easy for the two\r\n\r\nmillion-odd Singaporeans because of the political and\r\n\r\nsocio-economic  circumstances  we  are  in.  We  must\r\n\r\nsometimes have tough policies to see us through if we\r\n\r\nwant  to  survive, prosper and progress as a  nation.\r\n\r\nThere  are  no  easy solutions to  the  problems  and\r\n\r\nchallenges  ahead  of us. This is  what  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  been  told and what Singaporeans have accepted.\r\n\r\nBut  sometimes we are asked to swallow pills that are\r\n\r\nunnecessarily   bitter;  at  least,   that   is   the\r\n\r\nimpression created. People do not expect the pills to\r\n\r\nbe  sugar-coated, but neither do they want them to be\r\n\r\nmore  bitter than is necessary. Take the case of  the\r\n\r\nrecent announcement by the Education Ministry that in\r\n\r\n1979,  students entering Pre-University classes  must\r\n\r\nhave  attained certain standards in their  first  and\r\n\r\nsecond  languages. I do not know what earthly purpose\r\n\r\ncan  this  move serve. Is it to achieve our objective\r\n\r\nof a multi-lingual society? Or is it to raise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacademic standards of undergraduates? I really do not\r\n\r\nknow,  But  what I do know is that this is  going  to\r\n\r\nimpose  an additional and unnecessary strain  on  the\r\n\r\nfuture  Pre-University  students.  By  imposing  this\r\n\r\nrequirement of proficiency in two languages,  how  is\r\n\r\nit  going  to help our future Pre-University students\r\n\r\nto   succeed  better  in  their  special  fields   of\r\n\r\nuniversity studies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Government not realise that a simple\r\n\r\nstatement  like that from the Education  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nalready  causing  such  a  widespread  anxiety  among\r\n\r\nparents with children aspiring for further studies in\r\n\r\n1979   and  thereafter?  The  parents  are  naturally\r\n\r\nconcerned over this recent announcement as it affects\r\n\r\ntheir children's chances of securing a place not only\r\n\r\nin  the  Pre-University classes but also, eventually,\r\n\r\nin   the  Singapore  society.  Is  this  acting  with\r\n\r\ncircumspection and moderation? It may be too  extreme\r\n\r\nto  dismiss it as a rash and an ill-conceived action,\r\n\r\nbut the element of consultation and public debate  on\r\n\r\nthe matter is conspicuously missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest service that the Education authorities\r\n\r\ncan do for education perhaps is not to come out every\r\n\r\nnow  and then with some startling new ideas which may\r\n\r\ncause  more  harm than good. Instead, the authorities\r\n\r\nshould  concentrate on testing every new scheme  more\r\n\r\ncarefully and thoroughly over a period of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been several policy\r\n\r\ndecisions  in  the  past where the raison  d'etre  is\r\n\r\nsound. But their implementation might sometimes  have\r\n\r\ncaused  unnecessary  hardship to  those  affected  by\r\n\r\nthem.  This  was  largely due to the over-zealousness\r\n\r\nand  the  lack  of experience of those in  charge  of\r\n\r\nimplementing the policy decisions. Perhaps it is  not\r\n\r\njust  the  future policies and actions of  Government\r\n\r\nthat   should  be  carried  out  in  moderation   and\r\n\r\ncircumspection. The Government should also review its\r\n\r\npast  policies  and  actions to ascertain,  with  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of hindsight, whether some of these policies\r\n\r\nand  actions  can in fact be carried  out  with  more\r\n\r\ncircumspection and moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the Area Licensing Scheme.

Whether we like it or not,  they  are\r\n\r\neither  the sons or daughters, fathers or mothers  of\r\n\r\nour  citizens, and they have nowhere else to  go.  We\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  stay.  We  even  allow  them  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as part of the family unit when  applying\r\n\r\nfor HDB flats. Giving them the citizenship in many of\r\n\r\nthese  cases  is  not going to impose  an  additional\r\n\r\nnational  burden  on the Republic's  resources.

The President has laid out the\r\n\r\nvarious Government policies and guidelines to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  the next five years. These  policies\r\n\r\nand  guidelines are very pragmatic and practical.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past  we have never had policies and  guidelines\r\n\r\nmore  realistic, more considerate to the  people  and\r\n\r\nmore  virtue-inspiring as those that have  just  been\r\n\r\npresented in this Fourth Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book of the Great Learning of ancient\r\n\r\nChinese  Scholars  there is the teaching  that  great\r\n\r\nlearning  lies  in understanding the virtues,  loving\r\n\r\nthe people and arriving at that which is perfect.  It\r\n\r\nmeans  to say that we must carry out good government,\r\n\r\nlove  the people like our own children, and  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  try  and do our best to look after the  people.\r\n\r\nThis is the way of good government valid universally.\r\n\r\nAs the seas and oceans are made up of water droplets,\r\n\r\ncountries are made up of people, the individuals. The\r\n\r\nstrength of the country lies in the security  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Therefore, although state policies are  based\r\n\r\non  national interest as the first premise, they must\r\n\r\nalso  be  able  to  take into account  the  immediate\r\n\r\ninterest  of the majority of the people. That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  the implementation of state policies must  suit\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the people in such a way  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  can bear it. That means we have to study  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss all plans and policies in depth carefully  in\r\n\r\norder  to understand the wishes and get the views  of\r\n\r\nthe people before implementing the policies, so as to\r\n\r\nensure  practicability and conformity. In  this  way,\r\n\r\nall beneficial policies which are implemented will be\r\n\r\naccepted by the people. If we can arrive at  a  state\r\n\r\nwhere  the  people regard the State with respect  and\r\n\r\nimportance and the State looks after the people  with\r\n\r\nesteem  and  care,  and there is harmony,  unity  and\r\n\r\ncooperation  between the State  and  the  people  for\r\n\r\nmutual progress, then it will be the great fortune of\r\n\r\nboth the people and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the present international situation\r\n\r\nwhich  has  great repercussions on  us  and  with  Mr\r\n\r\nCarter's  assumption of office as  the  new  American\r\n\r\nPresident,  there  is an air of  uncertainty  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational scene. The Southeast Asian situation is\r\n\r\nlike-wise not clear. The Middle East problem  is  not\r\n\r\nyet solved. The oil crisis is not over yet. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole  world  situation is in a state of fluctuation.\r\n\r\nWith  such  external  factors and internal  situation\r\n\r\nbefore  us, we are faced with problems in formulating\r\n\r\nand implementing Government policies laid down in the\r\n\r\nspeech  presented by the President. The way ahead  is\r\n\r\ndifficult, The future may not turn out to be what  we\r\n\r\nall expect. However, we have the will and capacity to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  succeed. We have the experience  gained\r\n\r\nfrom  the past years of independence to help  see  us\r\n\r\nthrough.  We have once more been given such  a  heavy\r\n\r\nmandate,  and so we must do our best not to  let  our\r\n\r\npeople down. But in circumstances beyond our control,\r\n\r\nthere may be some factors present to prevent us  from\r\n\r\nachieving or what we have set out to achieve. In this\r\n\r\ncase it then becomes our bounden duty to explain  and\r\n\r\nto  analyse  to the people what the causes  are  that\r\n\r\nprevented us from achieving our goal. Civil  servants\r\n\r\nalso   have  to  take  up  the  challenge   and   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to help the nation solve its problems.\r\n\r\nThey  also owe the people a duty to explain what  the\r\n\r\nproblems and hardships are. It is only when there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  general understanding of the situation  that\r\n\r\nthe people will be enabled to continue to support the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experience gained in the last general\r\n\r\nelections,  we  can  see  that  we  have   a   higher\r\n\r\npercentage  of  support from the lower income  groups\r\n\r\ncompared to the earlier elections. This heavy mandate\r\n\r\nplaced on Members of Parliament means that we must be\r\n\r\nfair  and  do our best to solve the problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. It is only then that we will not let down the\r\n\r\nvoters  who have put us in power. The PAP has  always\r\n\r\nbeen  pragmatic.  We are known for  not  making  wild\r\n\r\npromises.  In  spite  of  free  things  or  giveaways\r\n\r\npromised by the opposition, our voters have the  guts\r\n\r\nand  the  resolve  to discard these  wild  and  empty\r\n\r\npromises  of free things but opted for self-reliance.\r\n\r\nThey  have instead voted us in, It is from the people\r\n\r\nin the lower income group in the less developed parts\r\n\r\nof  Singapore who have given us more votes than  ever\r\n\r\nbefore. Without their support, we would not have been\r\n\r\nable  to  get  72.4%, the highest percentage  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of votes ever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncast.

To see is better\r\n\r\nthan  to know. To practise is better than to see.  The\r\n\r\nend of learning is to practise. He who practises is  a\r\n\r\nsage`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this proverb, Sir, we are told that there are many\r\n\r\nproblems in the world which the common people may not\r\n\r\nunderstand  fully.  It is only  those  who  have  the\r\n\r\nexperience,  who  have seen, and who have  practised.\r\n\r\nwill  they be able to appreciate the problems.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to be a sage nor do I claim to be  a  sage.\r\n\r\nNeither  do  my  colleagues in  this  House.  But  as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people we have  the  duty  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to reflect the views of  the  people.\r\n\r\nParticularly so, in this Parliament where all the MPs\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the  same Party and where the  Government\r\n\r\nWhip  has been lifted so that we can freely and fully\r\n\r\nreflect our views in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people hold the view that as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people we enjoy high  prestige\r\n\r\nand  a good life. But in my humble opinion that is  a\r\n\r\nwrong concept. On the contrary, as representatives of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  we  act as the bridge of  communication\r\n\r\nbetween the Government on the one hand and the people\r\n\r\non the other. The Government has its policies and the\r\n\r\npeople  have  their  difficulties.  Our  position  in\r\n\r\nbetween  these two forces always makes  us  feel  the\r\n\r\npinch and the worse off. As MPs, we do not expect  to\r\n\r\nbe  rewarded for doing this. We do not expect  to  be\r\n\r\nappreciated  or thanked for what we do.  In  my  many\r\n\r\nyears  of  service to the people as a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse, I can say that I understand this truth. If new\r\n\r\nMembers  have  the attitude of expecting  rewards  or\r\n\r\nthanks  for doing a service to the people, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  greatly  disappointed. They  can  also  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople that it is not easy to be a Member of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament. But after the elections they would have a\r\n\r\ndifferent  view  to  what they  had  when  they  were\r\n\r\nfielded  as  candidates,  because  they  would   have\r\n\r\nrealised that things are not completely within  their\r\n\r\ncontrol.  To  serve the people, you have to  dedicate\r\n\r\nyourself to the point of making sacrifices and  this,\r\n\r\nI  am sure, is the experience they have gained during\r\n\r\nthese past few months. Take the case of the late hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Radin  Mas.  He dedicated  his  services\r\n\r\nwithout  any expectation of reward or thanks.  During\r\n\r\nhis life time the late Member for Radin Mas dedicated\r\n\r\nhimself  to  the service of the people. Even  on  the\r\n\r\nlast  day of his life he went to his constituency  to\r\n\r\ndistribute ang pews to the old and needy people. This\r\n\r\nis  the  kind  of Member of Parliament  who  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse  command the respect of his constituents.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  he is dead, who will look after his family?  We\r\n\r\nhave to look up the Parliamentary Pensions Act to see\r\n\r\nwhether our late MP is due for any entitlement  under\r\n\r\nthis   Act.  If  there  is  no  provision  for   such\r\n\r\nentitlement,  I  think an amendment  Bill  should  be\r\n\r\ntabled  in  this House to ensure that an MP  who  has\r\n\r\nrendered his services in the interests of the  people\r\n\r\nwill  have  something provided in  the  Act  for  his\r\n\r\nfamily in the event of his death,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my career as a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament  I  have gone through different  kinds  of\r\n\r\nexperience at the elections. In 1963 I tasted defeat.\r\n\r\nIn  1968 and 1972 I had the experience of winning the\r\n\r\nelections by contest and in 1976 I had another  round\r\n\r\nof experience of the election in which I was returned\r\n\r\nunopposed.  Some  people might say  that  I  had  won\r\n\r\nwithout effort, and the newspapers also said that  we\r\n\r\ngot  it  without effort. Regrettably, even our  Petir\r\n\r\nalso  said  that  16 MPs have been  returned  without\r\n\r\neffort. In other words, you got something without any\r\n\r\neffort. But I would say that 1 5 MPs at least  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  included  in this category. There  is  only  one,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  new  MP, who can be said  to  have  won\r\n\r\nwithout any effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> It is\r\n\r\nnot his fault!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But the 15 old MPs\r\n\r\ncannot be classified in this category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have difficult responsibilities as MPs. In this\r\n\r\nHouse,  we  spend a lot of time debating  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement.  Before we can do that, we have  to  study\r\n\r\nthe  speech  and the addenda, and then  to  test  the\r\n\r\nground  by  finding out the views of the  people.  We\r\n\r\nspend so much time and effort to get to the ground in\r\n\r\norder to reflect their views in this House. The press\r\n\r\nalso  labours to carry out speeches. After all  these\r\n\r\nefforts, my question is this: Do civil servants spend\r\n\r\nas  much time to study the Hansard so as to find  out\r\n\r\nhow  problems  should be solved?  Or  how  the  views\r\n\r\nreflected  by  MPs  in this House could  be  properly\r\n\r\ndealt  with? Do they think that we come here just  to\r\n\r\nmake noise and to fill up a beautiful looking Hansard\r\n\r\nwithout any follow-up action?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech the President\r\n\r\nreferred  to the simple truth that to get  from  each\r\n\r\nhis  best, rewards and recognition must go  to  those\r\n\r\nwho excel in consistently high performance. There  is\r\n\r\nno  dispute  about  this simple  truth.  Rewards  and\r\n\r\npunishment must be clear and well-defined. It is only\r\n\r\nthen  that the people will take the trouble of facing\r\n\r\nall difficulties and to do what they are supposed  to\r\n\r\ndo  and be inspired with a forward-looking spirit for\r\n\r\nexcellence. Rewarding according to performance is, in\r\n\r\nfact, a motivating measure for our national progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in the promotion and rewarding of civil\r\n\r\nservants, the people are often given a bad impression\r\n\r\nthat  civil servants have been rewarded and  promoted\r\n\r\nnot  because  of  their outstanding  performance  but\r\n\r\nbecause of their outstanding merit-seeking cum profit-making.\r\n\r\nThe plans and schemes proposed and submitted\r\n\r\nby  such  civil servants are aimed at increasing  the\r\n\r\nrevenue and to curry favour with the Minister and  be\r\n\r\nin  the good books of the Minister so as to secure  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  assessment of their  performance.  In  so\r\n\r\ndoing,   such   civil  servants  have  forgotten   or\r\n\r\noverlooked the political consequences and  the  chain\r\n\r\nof social problems that might be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaused. In the case of the working class we have  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court to act as the  tribunal\r\n\r\nto  judge  who  is to be properly rewarded  for  high\r\n\r\nperformance. In the case of the civil service,  there\r\n\r\nis no such tribunal or proper authority to assess the\r\n\r\nperformance  or  the  merits  or  demerits  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  We have a number of senior civil  servants\r\n\r\nholding different corporate posts. According  to  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times of today, we can see that  Temasek  is\r\n\r\nthe biggest holding company in Southeast Asia with  a\r\n\r\nnumber   of   subsidiaries,  including  SIA,   Keppel\r\n\r\nShipyard, Sembawang Shipyard, etc, all with Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  participation. Who is the  Chairman?  SIA\r\n\r\nChairman  is also the Chairman of this giant  holding\r\n\r\ncompany,  and  he  continues to be on  the  board  of\r\n\r\ndirectors  of  so many other companies.  How  do  you\r\n\r\nassess  the  actual performance of such a person?  If\r\n\r\nyou  want to know his actual performance, I will deal\r\n\r\nwith it in depth later on. There is a duplication  of\r\n\r\nposts. The directors of the new Temasek Holdings  are\r\n\r\nthe directors of the other subsidiary companies under\r\n\r\nthe  Temasek  group.  Who is there  to  assess  their\r\n\r\nperformances  with such a duplication  of  directors.\r\n\r\nYou  have  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  Committee to examine public accounts,  but\r\n\r\nthere  is no such committee with the rights or  power\r\n\r\nto look into the accounts of such companies. These so-called\r\n\r\ndirectors  have  become  directors   without\r\n\r\ncontributing a single cent to capital. They  are  all\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  who  have become  directors  without\r\n\r\nhaving to contribute any capital themselves, They are\r\n\r\ndifferent  from directors of private enterprises.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case of a private enterprise, if a person  wants\r\n\r\nto  be the managing director or the Chairman, he  has\r\n\r\nsomething  at stake or has a vested interest  whereas\r\n\r\ncivil  servants become directors without  any  vested\r\n\r\ninterest.  They  have  not contributed  any  capital.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing at stake. How many such  companies\r\n\r\nhave  lost  their business? There is no  report.  Who\r\n\r\nlooks into them? Nobody. Are they capable? How do  we\r\n\r\nknow  whether  or  not they are capable?  What  about\r\n\r\nthose companies that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave suffered losses? We have the case of the Granite\r\n\r\nHouse purchased in London which lost tens of millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars  - public money contributed by  the  hard\r\n\r\nwork and sweat of the people of Singapore. And now we\r\n\r\nhave exonerated the director who had dealings in  the\r\n\r\nGranite House affair and awarded him director-ship to\r\n\r\na  profit-making  company  elsewhere  -  chairman  of\r\n\r\nTemasek  Holdings. Who can say that he is capable  or\r\n\r\nnot capable? There is no proper accountability in the\r\n\r\ncase  of a State-owned company. So you have one civil\r\n\r\nservant  responsible for the failure of one  business\r\n\r\nat one time and now promoted to another capacity in a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  company.  He is  thus  rewarded,  but  no\r\n\r\npenalty for the failure of his action. So how can you\r\n\r\nsay  \"to  each according to his worth\"?  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there are civil servants holding several posts.\r\n\r\nTheir plans and schemes for the Government are mostly\r\n\r\nprofit-orientated for their own credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the President also stated that \"no\r\n\r\nmajor  policy or legislation should be passed without\r\n\r\nthe  closest scrutiny and passed only after the  most\r\n\r\nthorough debate\" in this House. This again are  words\r\n\r\nwhich we must pay heed to. However, my colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthe  previous Parliament sittings had also  reflected\r\n\r\ntheir grievances and levelled criticisms against some\r\n\r\nIegisIations  being rushed through the House  in  all\r\n\r\nthree  Readings without adequate time for  study  and\r\n\r\ndebate. This has been a very common occurrence.  Very\r\n\r\noften  we come to this House after only a glimpse  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill itself when it was tabled. Where have we got\r\n\r\nthe time to study the Bill for a thorough debate?  In\r\n\r\na  case  like this, Members of Parliament  cannot  be\r\n\r\nblamed  for  not having studied the Bills  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures.  You can blame the Ministers for this.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  responsible for the Bill  should  supervise\r\n\r\nits  drafting by civil servants. If the drafting  was\r\n\r\ndone  in a hurry, there will always be omissions  and\r\n\r\nflaws  in the Bill. Sometimes more haste would result\r\n\r\nin more delay. There were occasions when Ministers in\r\n\r\nmoving  the  Bills  were not  very  clear  about  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  principles and spirit therein.  So  very often\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment  Bills had to tabled within  a  few  months\r\n\r\nafter passing the original Bills. This is well within\r\n\r\nthe knowledge and experience of many hon. Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. In some cases even Ministers responsible\r\n\r\nfor such Bills did not know the actual meaning of the\r\n\r\nBills  because  we  tell from their  answers  to  the\r\n\r\nquestions  raised by Members of Parliament  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters did not really know what they were saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are also examples to show\r\n\r\nthat  within  two  or three months of  a  Bill  being\r\n\r\npassed in this House an Amendment Bill was brought in\r\n\r\nagain   to   look   after  a  certain   interest   or\r\n\r\ndeficiencies.  All  these are illustrations  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  when Bills are passed without a thorough debate\r\n\r\nor  scrutiny,  the blame cannot be  entirely  put  on\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House. The Ministers  have  also  a\r\n\r\ncertain measure of responsibiltiy for all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the reference to the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nand other tertiary institutions as hotbeds or targets\r\n\r\nof  recruitment  for  the Communist  Party,  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that we must be vigilant about.  We  learn\r\n\r\nfrom  experience that it is only when dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nexists  that it can be made use of as a tool  against\r\n\r\nthe  Government  or  the  people.  According  to   my\r\n\r\nunderstanding, the reasons for dissatisfaction  among\r\n\r\nstudents of the Polytechnic and other institutions of\r\n\r\nhigher   learning   are  that   some   students   are\r\n\r\npessimistic   and   uncertain  about   their   future\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities and are  dissatisfied  with\r\n\r\nthe existing conditions. Thus they lend themselves to\r\n\r\nmanipulation. Take Nanyang University,  for  example.\r\n\r\nIt  is  still fresh in our memory that from the  late\r\n\r\n1950s  up to the early 1 960s Nanyang University  was\r\n\r\ninfiltrated by the communists. Nanyang University was\r\n\r\nthen  still under the old system. There was a feeling\r\n\r\nof  dissatisfaction among the students then  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation  was  exploited  by  the  communists.   The\r\n\r\nstudents were made use of for all kinds of agitation.\r\n\r\nThus,  Nanyang University was in a state  of  turmoil\r\n\r\nand  unable  to make any headway. To remove  all  the\r\n\r\nroot  causes leading to the dissatisfaction, negative\r\n\r\nprevention is not the basic solution The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental solution lies in the removal of the  root\r\n\r\ncauses  of  the dissatisfaction. We must resolve  the\r\n\r\nstudents'   problem   of  employment   opportunities.\r\n\r\nStudents are also dissatisfied with their status quo.\r\n\r\nWe   must   look   for  a  proper  diagnosis   before\r\n\r\nadministering  medicine. Although the Government  has\r\n\r\naccorded  equal  treatment to Nanyang University  and\r\n\r\nthe   University  of  Singapore,  frankly   speaking.\r\n\r\nNanyang University needs a Vice-Chancellor with drive\r\n\r\nand some efficient senior executives of high academic\r\n\r\nstanding  in  order to raise academic  standards.  It\r\n\r\nshould  open its door to students of different  races\r\n\r\nin  keeping with our national policy so that  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  may  develop to the  same  level  as  the\r\n\r\nUniversity   of   Singapore.   Ideally,   where   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore does not  want  to  conduct\r\n\r\ncertain  courses  they  can be conducted  at  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and vice-versa. There must be cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween the two universities and no duplication which\r\n\r\nwill  cause  wastage.  In this  way  the  feeling  of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  can  be eliminated  psychologically,\r\n\r\nwastage of manpower will be avoided and the graduates\r\n\r\nwill  also  not  have  a sense of  uncertainty  about\r\n\r\nemployment  outlet.  The academic  standards  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  will  also be improved and  its  prestige\r\n\r\nenhanced internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for several years I did not have a\r\n\r\nchance to speak for my constituents. This is the time\r\n\r\nfor  all the one hundred flowers to bloom. Now we are\r\n\r\nalso  allowed free expression in this House. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say something and do something for  my  own\r\n\r\nrural  constituency, (In English) This  is  the  first\r\n\r\ntime. I had no chance before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) In the Nee Soon constituency 80% of\r\n\r\nthe  votes  came from the rural areas. I  am  not  as\r\n\r\nfortunate as the other Members of Parliament who have\r\n\r\nthe  HLJDC or HDB flat dwellers to support  them.  My\r\n\r\nconstituents in Nee Soon have not had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto   enjoy  public  facilities  available  in   other\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  They only enjoy  limited  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided  by the Urban and Rural Services  Committee.\r\n\r\nMany of my voters who live in the rural areas are not\r\n\r\nserved by metalled roads. Their houses or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvillages are not accessible to vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\nThe funds provided by URSC for the development of the\r\n\r\nconstituency  are  not  sufficient,  particularly  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  road  development. Up to  date.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  requests in hand which  need  at  least  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  to  develop roads over the next five  years.\r\n\r\nThe  amount allocated each year is quite limited, and\r\n\r\nI  can  anticipate many roads cannot be completed  by\r\n\r\nthen. How are we to satisfy the rural voters in their\r\n\r\ndemands?  How are we to express our appreciation  for\r\n\r\nthe 72.4% votes which had been cast in our favour  as\r\n\r\nan expression of the confidence that they have in us?\r\n\r\nIf  this  rate of progress is continued,  in  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency, even if I can carry on for the next ten\r\n\r\nyears  -  they  would  not be able  to  complete  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  the  roads  with  the  meagre   sum\r\n\r\nprovided. It is my hope that the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nwill allocate more funds for road construction in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. This is also in keeping with  what  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister had said after the elections - that we\r\n\r\nmust look after the needs of the people in the poorer\r\n\r\nareas. This is the time for such care to be given. If\r\n\r\nit is not possible to allocate more funds to the URSC\r\n\r\nfor  the development of the rural areas, then perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development could study the\r\n\r\nquestion  that for any request for more than $100,000\r\n\r\nprovision for road construction, whether the work -an\r\n\r\nbe  done  by the PWD direct instead of going  through\r\n\r\nthe URSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nee Soon area, more than half the number of\r\n\r\nshops have been affected by road development and have\r\n\r\nto be resettled elsewhere. The remaining shops cannot\r\n\r\nmeet  the  requirements  of  the  people  there,  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has no plan or intention  to  build  more\r\n\r\nshops   or   shopping  centres  in   Nee   Soon   for\r\n\r\nreplacement,  as in the case of Thomson constituency.\r\n\r\nIt  is therefore my hope that the Government will  be\r\n\r\nflexible  enough  in  formulating  policies  and   in\r\n\r\nimplementing  them, that is to say,  where  there  is\r\n\r\nvacant  private land available by the side of  public\r\n\r\nroads, shops may be allowed to be erected there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in road construction development,\r\n\r\nthere  is one thing we cannot accept, that is a wrong\r\n\r\nassessment of the width of the road. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nsuch  wrong  assessment by civil servants responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  project,  more land  and  shops  have  been\r\n\r\nacquired  than  necessary. This was discovered  after\r\n\r\nconstruction work had actually begun. As a result the\r\n\r\nland  by  the  road upon which the  shops  have  been\r\n\r\nacquired   is   still  in  the  possession   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Now the shopkeepers or shop-owners  have\r\n\r\nto  apply to the Government or to tender for the  use\r\n\r\nof  their shop premises and land. This is an  example\r\n\r\nof  a  lack of proper planning which becomes  obvious\r\n\r\nafter  the completion of the project. But the  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  affected  suffer  at  the  lack  of  proper\r\n\r\nplanning.  So  when we talk about  rewards  for  high\r\n\r\nperformance and so on, the civil servants responsible\r\n\r\ncan  tell  the Minister that they have completed  the\r\n\r\nproject  and  hope  to get some  promotion  which  is\r\n\r\nobtained at the expense of a lot of people as in this\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, in the north-eastern part of Nee\r\n\r\nSoon  constituency, in the Simpang area, certain land\r\n\r\nhas   been  under  acquisition  or  redesignated  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  purposes,  giving  rise  to  resettlement\r\n\r\nproblems.  Of  course, the Government has  its  fixed\r\n\r\npolicy  in  regard to the compensations that  may  be\r\n\r\ngiven to the farmers. Farmers in this area have  been\r\n\r\nencouraged and influenced by the experimental farm of\r\n\r\nthe Primary Production Department to grow orchids and\r\n\r\nrear  tropical fish as an occupation. The  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not have a fixed policy on compensation in this\r\n\r\nrespect.   So  I  hope  that  when  resettlement   is\r\n\r\nunderway,  the Primary Production Department  or  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development can think out  some\r\n\r\nsuitable  measures  to help the  people  affected  by\r\n\r\nresettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to deal with the hawker problem\r\n\r\nas other Members have already touched on this matter.\r\n\r\nBut I must emphasise that all the matters that I have\r\n\r\nbrought up should receive the proper attention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, as the Prime Minister has said after  the\r\n\r\nelections that we must give greater attention to  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the poorer groups of our people or people who had\r\n\r\nbeen neglected in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H.

Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to support the Motion in the name of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my friends was complaining the other day that\r\n\r\nhe  has to earn $1 in order to spend 50c, as he is in\r\n\r\nthe  50%  income  tax bracket. He  did  not  seem  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that he is one of the fortunate few  at  the\r\n\r\ntop  of  the income ladder and that in 1975,  141,485\r\n\r\nout  of 638,432 or 22% of the CPF contributors earned\r\n\r\nbelow  $200 per month in wages. Many of these workers\r\n\r\nhave families to support. Imagine. Sir, the plight of\r\n\r\na  widow  in her forties, who is illiterate  and  has\r\n\r\nthree or four children still in school. She qualifies\r\n\r\nonly to be a sweeper or cleaner, earning no more than\r\n\r\n$200  per month. Out of this amount, $26 goes to  the\r\n\r\nHDB  for  the cheapest one-room emergency-type  flat,\r\n\r\n$30  or  so  goes to the PUB; the rest of the  paltry\r\n\r\nwage must sustain a family of four or five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy, therefore, to read the Addendum on\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's  Office  that  Government   is\r\n\r\ncommitted to help the most needy. May I venture  some\r\n\r\nsuggestions?  First  of all, the Hawkers'  Department\r\n\r\nshould  be  less stingy in issuing hawkers' licences,\r\n\r\nparticularly to widows, old people and people who are\r\n\r\nunfit  for  other work. Apparently,  there  is  a  5%\r\n\r\nprovision  for hardship cases but, in practice,  very\r\n\r\nfew actual hardship cases are granted licences as the\r\n\r\nrules  laid down are too rigid and nobody  knows  how\r\n\r\nthe 5% rule is really interpreted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that, when revisions are\r\n\r\nnecessary in respect of health, education and  rental\r\n\r\ncharges, we should bear in mind the plight of the low-income\r\n\r\npeople.  A  $2  charge  means  nothing  to  a\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary or Deputy Secretary, but it means\r\n\r\na lot to the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that the PUB should make a\r\n\r\nspecial effort to estimate bills for the poor  fairly\r\n\r\nand  accurately. An extra $10 per month in  estimated\r\n\r\ncharges is a big blow to a poor person; moreover, the\r\n\r\nextra estimate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  require an increase in the PUB deposit,  not  to\r\n\r\nmention the surcharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noticed that the HDB tends to provide\r\n\r\nmore  open spaces and recreational facilities  nearer\r\n\r\nthe  three-room, four-room and five-room flats,  This\r\n\r\nis  certainly  true  in Balestier  Estate.  The  more\r\n\r\npressing  needs  of the people who live  in  one-room\r\n\r\nflats should be given priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand also that the HDB is planning to\r\n\r\nremodel  the old one-room emergency flats to  convert\r\n\r\nthem  into  two-room units. My colleague, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Chai  Chee, referred to  this  earlier.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  seems  to be  an  improvement,  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering  what will happen to the present  dwellers.\r\n\r\nTheir present rental of $26 per month will surely  be\r\n\r\nincreased.  This happened to four blocks of  the  old\r\n\r\nemergency  flats in Whampoa some three or four  years\r\n\r\nago.  The  people were just moved out of these  flats\r\n\r\nand  they  had to move to more expensive flats  as  a\r\n\r\nresult.  I  would  therefore urge  the  HDB  to  make\r\n\r\nimprovements in ventilation and lighting but  without\r\n\r\ndepriving residents of their cheap rental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The Member for Katong is rather\r\n\r\nconcerned  about this. I think he has such  flats  in\r\n\r\nhis  constituency. Well, if they do not have  private\r\n\r\ntoilets, then I would say instal the private toilets.\r\n\r\nBut  make  sure that the HDB does not add on  to  the\r\n\r\nrental for the inclusion of the toilets. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nas  I said earlier, more recreational facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe poor people can be provided nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like the HDB to reexamine its\r\n\r\nconcept of family income used in its housing rules. A\r\n\r\nfamily income of $600 per month earned by the head of\r\n\r\nhousehold  is meaningful, but when the sum is  earned\r\n\r\nby  himself  and  three or four  children,  what  the\r\n\r\nfamily  has at its disposal depends on the generosity\r\n\r\nof  the  children and you cannot expect a  young  man\r\n\r\nearning $150 or $200 to contribute more than $20. $30\r\n\r\nor  at  the most $50 per month to the family. A rigid\r\n\r\napplication of the family income rules,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore,  imposes hardship on some people  who  are\r\n\r\nforced  to buy instead of renting their flats or  who\r\n\r\nare  forced in many cases to accept bigger flats than\r\n\r\nthey would wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to suggest that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Social  Affairs should re-examine the quantum  of\r\n\r\nwelfare   relief  payable  to  needy  and   destitute\r\n\r\npersons.  An old person with no children or relatives\r\n\r\nto  support them and who has no savings and is unable\r\n\r\nto work cannot possibly survive on the $40 or $50 per\r\n\r\nmonth  given  by  the Social Welfare Department.  For\r\n\r\nsuch  destitute cases, Sir, there is no  question  of\r\n\r\ndisincentives   for  working  that   higher   welfare\r\n\r\npayments might bring to the able-bodied,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office also\r\n\r\nstates  that we have achieved a more equal  and  more\r\n\r\njust  society than it has ever been in  the  past.  I\r\n\r\nfully  agree with the observation, Sir, but  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask why there is no provision of legal  aid\r\n\r\nfor  criminal cases apart from murder cases.  A  poor\r\n\r\nperson who is unfortunate enough to be involved in  a\r\n\r\ncriminal  case  and  who cannot afford  a  lawyer  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to suffer more injustice. I hope hon. Members\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  the  legal profession  will  give  some\r\n\r\nthought  to  this  and perhaps even  volunteer  their\r\n\r\nlegal services to the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I understand, of course, that poor\r\n\r\nlawyers  have got a living to make but some  of  them\r\n\r\nmake it rather comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I make some further reference to the HDB.\r\n\r\nRecently,  some  of the coffee-shop operators  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  were  summoned for placing  tables  and\r\n\r\nchairs for the use of customers in the five-foot  way\r\n\r\nand   public  concourse  areas  nearby.  I   appealed\r\n\r\nunsuccessfully to the HDB to allow them to do  so  as\r\n\r\nthe  customers  clearly prefer  the  open  air.  Sir,\r\n\r\nobstruction  can be prevented by careful  delineation\r\n\r\nand  the  HDB can certainly charge additional  rental\r\n\r\nfor  a  specified number of chairs and tables  placed\r\n\r\noutside the coffee-shop and proprietors can be held\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nresponsible  for  maintaining  cleanliness  and   for\r\n\r\nkeeping  noise to a minimum. Sir, in many  countries,\r\n\r\nas in Singapore, side-walk cafes are very popular.  I\r\n\r\ndo not see why the HDB should so unreasonably confine\r\n\r\ncoffee-shop operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nstates  that 55% of our population is already  living\r\n\r\nin  HDB flats and that by 1980, two million residents\r\n\r\nare  expected.  Sir,  I  have noticed  that  the  HDB\r\n\r\ninsists  on  a  lot of uniformity,  for  example,  in\r\n\r\ndesigns of window grilles and iron-doors. Why  cannot\r\n\r\nthe  Board  allow residents some variety?  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat,  as  the  vast  majority  of  our  people  will\r\n\r\neventually live in HDB flats, the housing regulations\r\n\r\nshould   be   carefully  examined  to   prevent   the\r\n\r\nimposition of unnecessarily drab uniformity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum on the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  it is stated that the Ministry  intends\r\n\r\nto  move  unlicensed hawkers into  vacant  stalls  in\r\n\r\nexisting hawker centres whether they like it or  not.\r\n\r\nFrom  my  knowledge of hawker centres. Sir, vacancies\r\n\r\npersist only in those centres where business is poor.\r\n\r\nI  think, therefore, that it would be unfair to  move\r\n\r\nhawkers  forcibly  into sites  which  are  likely  to\r\n\r\nresult  in  poor business or even losses. Instead.  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Hawkers' Department and HDB  to  make\r\n\r\ncareful  studies of the sites of proposed new  Hawker\r\n\r\nCentres  to  ensure that business will be there  when\r\n\r\nthey are operational. Population concentrations, easy\r\n\r\naccessibility  and  ample parking  places  are  three\r\n\r\ncritical   factors,  With  regard  to  the   proposed\r\n\r\nincreases  in hawker licence fees. I would  urge  for\r\n\r\ncareful  study to prevent an escalation  of  cost-of-living\r\n\r\nincreases to workers. Moreover, not all hawker\r\n\r\ncentres are equally prosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last year I heard that the Hawkers'\r\n\r\nDepartment intends to phase out Pasar Malam sites.  I\r\n\r\nthink it would be a pity to phase out what has become\r\n\r\na  colourful feature of our night life. Sir, even  in\r\n\r\nadvanced countries, bazaars are popular and colourful\r\n\r\nevents.  We  should not be over-anxious to  establish\r\n\r\nsuch an orderly existence that life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloses  some  of its colour, Furthermore, Pasar  Malam\r\n\r\nallows  hawkers  that extra elbowroom  to  earn  that\r\n\r\nextra  margin that makes life more tolerable. Already\r\n\r\nthe  urbanisation and rapid development of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  unsettled  lives  and removed  some  traditional\r\n\r\nmeans  of livelihood. We should therefore make  every\r\n\r\neffort   to   provide  a  little  leeway  for   small\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Ministries' Addenda referred to the problems\r\n\r\nof   the   young,  particularly  the  Ministries   of\r\n\r\nEducation, Home Affairs and Social Affairs.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  emphasis  is  very  necessary.  I  welcome,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, the greater efforts being expended by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports Council. However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  that  Constituency Sports Clubs  be  given\r\n\r\nmore  generous funds in order to cater adequately  to\r\n\r\nthe   needs   of  the  young  and  to  promote   mass\r\n\r\nparticipation in sports. In Whampoa, for  example,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  look for $1 5,000 this year to finance  the\r\n\r\nenthusiastic plans of my Sports Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the needs of the young, Sir, I should\r\n\r\nalso like to urge the National Library to set up more\r\n\r\nbranches, at least one in every housing estate.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe costs of encouraging healthy pursuits like sports\r\n\r\nand  reading will bring rich dividends like  reducing\r\n\r\ndrug addiction and delinquency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aged also need increasing attention, as the\r\n\r\nMinistries  of Health and Social Affairs  remind  us.\r\n\r\nOver  the last few days, MPs and Ministers have  been\r\n\r\nhanding out ang pows and hampers to the aged.  And  I\r\n\r\nam  doing so tonight. If I may say so, this is a fine\r\n\r\ngesture. However, let us also think about how some of\r\n\r\nthese destitute old people are going to survive until\r\n\r\nthe  next  distribution of ang pows. Government  will\r\n\r\nhave to do more for the aged. Unfortunately, this may\r\n\r\nalso in the process encourage the abandonment of  the\r\n\r\naged  by their children and grandchildren who  simply\r\n\r\npass  the  buck  to the government.  Nevertheless  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  allow ourselves to be deterred.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  we  should make every  effort  to  instil\r\n\r\nfilial piety in our youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two Members, the Members for Marine Parade\r\n\r\nand Toa Payoh, spoke about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of job-hopping among young workers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives. I agree substantially with both  of  them\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  refrain from unnecessary  and  even\r\n\r\ndetrimental  action.  Job-hopping  usually  increases\r\n\r\nwhen  there is more rapid economic growth.  Over  the\r\n\r\nlast  two  years there seemed to be fewer  complaints\r\n\r\nabout it because our economic growth had slowed down.\r\n\r\nTo  some extent, of course, job-hopping reflects  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  adjustment that  result  from  lack  of\r\n\r\ninformation  about  the jobs undertaken.  Perhaps  we\r\n\r\nshould  provide more counselling in schools, colleges\r\n\r\nand  universities to help graduates pick the  careers\r\n\r\nmore suited to their temperament and attitudes and so\r\n\r\non, instead of penalising them later for hopping from\r\n\r\njob to job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour, in its Addendum, rightly\r\n\r\nreiterates that our workers must work harder, upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills and increase their productivity. Despite\r\n\r\nthe  efforts of the Labour Ministry and the  National\r\n\r\nWages Council, productivity is still not sufficiently\r\n\r\nunderstood as a concept and as a principle  governing\r\n\r\nour  livelihood.  Put  simply,  productivity  is  the\r\n\r\nrelation between output ,(what is produced) and input\r\n\r\n(what is used in the production process). Output  can\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  form  of  goods such  as  cloth,  shoes,\r\n\r\ntransistors,  watches,  etc, or  services  such   as\r\n\r\ntyping,  transport,  serving in  a  restaurant,  etc.\r\n\r\nInputs  are the labour expended by workers,  machine-time\r\n\r\nand  materials used in the production  process.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  crucially dependent on the  degree  of\r\n\r\nproductivity of all of us who work. Since we have  no\r\n\r\nnatural  resources, we make use of imported  machines\r\n\r\nand  materials  and  export our goods  and  services,\r\n\r\nearning our livelihood in the process. The process is\r\n\r\nthe  same, whether we are engaged in entrepot  trade,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  or  financial and other  services.  It\r\n\r\nfollows,  therefore, that we can better our standards\r\n\r\nof  living only if we become more and more productive\r\n\r\nor efficient, in other words, only if we can increase\r\n\r\nour  output without increasing our input or if we can\r\n\r\nincrease  our  output  faster than  we  increase  our\r\n\r\ninput.  This is meant by increasing our productivity.\r\n\r\nHence we can see that if we increase our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwages  without  increasing our productivity  we  will\r\n\r\nraise  the  prices  for  our  exports  of  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices.  If foreigners find other countries'  goods\r\n\r\nand  services  to be cheaper, we shall  lose  out  in\r\n\r\nexport sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me on to the unfavourable world economic\r\n\r\nconditions  referred to by the Ministry  of  Finance,\r\n\r\nEarly  last  year,  in this Chamber,  I  warned  that\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery in the industrial countries  might\r\n\r\nstall  because of insufficient new investments.  This\r\n\r\nhas  been  clearly  vindicated by  events.  The  main\r\n\r\nreason  is that the rate of technological innovations\r\n\r\nappears   to   have  slowed  down  in  the   advanced\r\n\r\ncountries, therefore leading to fewer investments. At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  the aging population  structure  in\r\n\r\nthose  countries has altered the pattern  of  demand,\r\n\r\nnecessitating  painful  and  difficult   changes   in\r\n\r\nproduction patterns because in the aftermath  of  the\r\n\r\nSecond World War there was a big population boom  all\r\n\r\nover  the world, even in the advanced countries. This\r\n\r\nbig  population  boom gave rise to a lot  of  demand,\r\n\r\ninitially    for   maternity   services,   nurseries,\r\n\r\nkindergartens, schools, colleges, universities, teen-age\r\n\r\nfashions like 2nd generation jeans and so on and\r\n\r\nso  forth. But since the early sixties, the  rate  of\r\n\r\npopulation  growth  in  the  advanced  countries  had\r\n\r\ndeclined  very  drastically so that  the  numbers  of\r\n\r\nyoung  people in some cases, have gone down not  only\r\n\r\nas  a  proportion of population but also in  absolute\r\n\r\nnumbers. So those industries catering to the  demands\r\n\r\nof the young suffer excess capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, there are many more older\r\n\r\npeople  proportionately as well as absolutely in  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries, and we are catching up  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  In America, I understand about 10%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  are above the age of 60. This means  that\r\n\r\nthey  would demand wheel chairs, nursing care and  so\r\n\r\non  and  so forth. But they lack the effective demand\r\n\r\nto  buy  those goods and services. So it is difficult\r\n\r\nand  painful for the industries there to adjust their\r\n\r\nproduction  patterns. Therefore, both on  the  supply\r\n\r\nside and the demand side, there has been these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   Indeed,   Sir,   the    studies    of\r\n\r\nproductivity and profitability in America have  shown\r\n\r\nthat   both  rates  have  declined  since  the  early\r\n\r\nsixties. If this is true, then we are in for a period\r\n\r\nof  painful  adjustments which  monetary  and  fiscal\r\n\r\nmeasures will do little to alleviate, In fact, my own\r\n\r\nbelief is that both these policies will lead to  more\r\n\r\ninflation  rather than more employment. In  addition,\r\n\r\nenergy prices are expected to rise inexorably for the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, too many of us allow ourselves to\r\n\r\nbe  beguiled  by  the  talk of alternative  forms  of\r\n\r\nenergy,  like  solar  energy, gasification  of  coal,\r\n\r\nthermonuclear  energy, and so on  and  so  forth,  In\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  the alternative forms  of  energy  are\r\n\r\nstill far off in the future. Even Edward Teller,  the\r\n\r\nfather  of  the  H-bomb, says that the hydrogen  bomb\r\n\r\nprinciple   as  a  form  of  energy   will   not   be\r\n\r\ncommercially practicable until the 21st  century.  In\r\n\r\nthe  meantime  the  known reserve  of  oil  is  being\r\n\r\nrapidly  depleted. We read of new oil fields  in  the\r\n\r\nNorth  Sea, in the Arctic, in China, and so  on.  But\r\n\r\nthese are marginal fields in the sense that the costs\r\n\r\nof  production are very high. What good does it do if\r\n\r\nit takes $10 per barrel to extract a barrel of oil in\r\n\r\nthe  Arctic circle to sell for $1 1 a barrel. In  net\r\n\r\nterms  we  only  realise $1 worth of  oil.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  takes energy to recover  energy.  So  one\r\n\r\nshould  not  be beguiled by the actual numbers  which\r\n\r\nare  bandied about. Right now, there is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nseverest winters in America which is highlighting the\r\n\r\nenergy crisis in no uncertain terms, particularly  in\r\n\r\nterms of the gas shortage. I think we should take the\r\n\r\nwarning  very  seriously indeed here in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nnote  that a lot of new office buildings and shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes have got central air-conditioning. Even  in\r\n\r\nthis  very Chamber, a lot of my colleagues and myself\r\n\r\nhave  to  put on sweaters and coats. I think  we  can\r\n\r\nshow a good example by raising the thermostat here in\r\n\r\nthis  very  Chamber to conserve energy. I would  urge\r\n\r\nthat,   in   designs   for  new  buildings,   natural\r\n\r\nventilation should be provided for. I have seen  some\r\n\r\nof   the   buildings  which  have  got   no   windows\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  If  the  air-conditioning  breaks  down,\r\n\r\nthere is just no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnatural ventilation, It would be very stifling. There\r\n\r\nis a lot of wastage. A lot of common corridors and so\r\n\r\non have got central air-conditioning. Very often they\r\n\r\nare  so  cold that when the number of people  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  one  just cannot stand the  cold  or  one\r\n\r\ncatches flu in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
