Salaries of regular officers and men were increased early last year. The pay increases and other efforts of MINDEF had a favourable impact on the recruitment and retention of regular SAF servicemen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had been a general slowdown in the recruitment of regulars since 1978, with an especially large drop in 1981 when the job market in Singapore was extremely competitive. The number of officers recruited in 1981 was 229, compared to a yearly average of 430 for 1978-80. But officer recruitment has improved since 1982, after the salary revision. Between April and December 1982, 398 officers were recruited, an increase of 229 (or 135%) over the number recruited over the same period in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of other ranks also was much better. In 1981 we had approximately 1,410, compared to a yearly average of 2,416 for 1978-80, Since June 1982, when other rank salaries were revised, recruitment has picked up. 1,016 were recruited from June to December 1982, an increase of 351 (or 53%) over the number recruited over the same period in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, resignations of officers and other ranks have dropped. The number of resignations among officers from April to December 1982 was 55, compared to 85 in the same period in 1981, Among other ranks, the number who resigned from June to December 1982, was 71, compared to 360 for the same period in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retention rate, ie, the percentage of contract servicemen who extend their serice rather than leave the SAF on expiry of heir contract, has also improved, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> although this improvement is not quite as dramatic as that for recruitment. From April to December 1982, the retention rate for officers was 67%, compared to 60% for the same period in 1981. The retention rate for other ranks rose from 44% to 47%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further improve recruitment and retention, MINDEF recognizes that increasing salaries alone is not sufficient. Neither is it desirable to have people joining the SAF as regulars simply because of better pay. What the higher salaries allow MINDEF to do is to attract a much larger pool of better candidates. In the SAF, where men's lives depend so much on the quality of those who lead and organize them, we have to look for intellect and skills, as well as other attributes like trustworthiness, selflessness, loyalty, and commitment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are more likely to stay in the SAF if the organizational climate is one where they have a sense of pride and belonging, and where they can contribute actively towards making it a better organization. We are beginning to see this in the quality of officers and men choosing to stay on in the SAF after their initial contracts expired. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the hon. Minister of State, if the condition on contract were to be removed, would it not help the SAF better? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the productive period, in other words, the period during which the officer or other rank can make a contribution to the organization, is relatively short by comparison with the period required for his training, and therefore in order to ensure that public funds are properly utilized, there should be a reasonable period of contract when an officer or other rank is employed by the SAF. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> If that is the case, would it not make service in the Armed Forces less attractive in view of the contractual time? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, we are aware that service in the SAF is less attractive than jobs which require comparable edu- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cational qualifications and experience. Hence it is MINDEF's policy to ensure that the salaries are much better than those for comparable jobs in the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, would it not be right to say that on the expiry of their contract, these officers or other ranks would have to look for alternative employment in other sectors, bearing in mind the fact that they have already done some service in the specialised form or whatever? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, our objective is to ensure that the better officers and other ranks should choose to remain with us in the SAF and, as I have indicated in my answer to the Oral Question, more than two-thirds of the officers have chosen to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Saidi Haji Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Sheriff (Kaki Bukit):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am curious to know from the Minister how does he measure an applicant's sense of commitment, loyalty and national consciousness in his recruitment exercise? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, these are obviously criteria for which there is no simple rule that one can pick out of a textbooK and apply immediately at the point of recruitment. But what we do have are experienced officers who, through a whole series of interviews, by talking to the individual candidates and applicants, are able to ascertain within limits, of course, the reliability, trustworthiness, loyalty and commitment of the candidate or applicant. We hope that we are not too far off but, as with so many other things concerning the individual's character, it is difficult to be 100% sure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SUPPLY AND SUPPLEMENTARY SUPPLY BILLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Business Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>2.44 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the second and third readings of the Supply Bill for the financial year 1st April, 1983 to 31st \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> March, 1984 and the Supplementary Supply Bill for the financial year 1st April, 1982 to 31st March, 1983 may be proceeded with immediately on the conclusion of the proceedings on the Budget for the financial year 1st April, 1983 to 31st March, 1984. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [4th March, 1983] [2nd Allotted Day], \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1983 to 31st March, 1984.\". - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debate started in the House yesterday, we have heard about economic growth, economic recession, protectionism, productivity, GNP, etc. I propose to depart from these traditional points while keeping within the general framework of this debate, and discuss a problem which I feel is of concern to many of us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have had good government for close to 24 years now. There is no doubt that Government policies over the past two decades or so have contributed to Singapore the success it has achieved, unpopular though some of these policies might have been. It is recognised that the best of policies, no matter how carefully formulated, cannot please all the people all the time. Indeed it is one of the fundamental tenets of policy formulating that the interest of the majority must come first, even if a minority are left unhappy. It is this concept of Government without fear or favour that has been the hallmark of PAP policies for so long. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to question today is not so much policies themselves but the implementation and explanation of policies which, I feel, leaves much to be desired. I venture as far as to say that failure to explain policies properly or to implement \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> them correctly can result in unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Our Ministers, as we all know, take great pains to explain policies but even the best of intentions can be suspect if at the grassroot level they are not properly explained or wrongly implemented. I know it is always very convenient for politicians to make the administrative arm of Government, i.e. the civil service, the whipping boy. It is not my purpose to do as such but I think in this respect it must bear part of the blame. Towards the end of the 1950s and in the early 1960s we inherited a civil service from the British colonial government. Over the course of many years we have been able to develop and build our own civil service, one that is to its credit able to identify with the aspirations of the nation and which is also known for its ruthless efficiency. I use the word 'ruthless' for exactly what it means, for how else can you describe a civil service that is well known for telling you the answer is no as its starting point. I can think of some instances. No new hawker licences are issued because existing empty stalls are reserved for resettlement of street hawkers. No new applications for taxi drivers' vocational licences are considered because the Registry of Vehicles still has a backlog of applications to process. An applicant for public housing has to follow the first-come-first-served system because, to be fair to all, there cannot be queue-jumping. As I stated earlier I for one, and I am sure most of us here, do not quarrel with these policies and we know that properly explained, people can be made to understand the rationale behind such policies. Yet you will find that in such instances the advice often dished out by Government departments is \"Go and see your MP, he can get it for you.\" Of course, all of us in this House know what an MP can do; quite often, nothing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the MP can help salvage the situation, neutralize the resentment by explaining to his disgruntled constituent why he cannot get his taxi driver's licence, his hawker stall or his HDB flat. But what about the many hundreds, or thousands, who do not see their MP? For them, their everlasting impression of their Govern- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ment has been that moment of contact with the civil servant on the front line and it would have left them dejected and demoralized. In the end, it would be the political leadership that suffers because having been in power for more than two decades the political leadership and the civil service have become so closely intertwined. And do not forget, Sir, civil servants have a way of becoming Ministers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there is a fair amount of resentment in Singapore, not so much against Government policies at large because people have over the course of 24 years grown to trust the wisdom of this Government, but more because of a lack of understanding of the rationale behind certain policies. How else can we explain the results of a recent survey that showed that while almost everyone in Singapore has heard of productivity most have missed the message behind the whole campaign? How is it that 75% of those surveyed felt that the whole campaign was more for the benefit of companies and employers than for workers? What is significant to note is that these cynical feelings were equally strong amongst the better educated as well as the less educated. Something must be seriously wrong if in spite of exhortations by Ministers, M P's, trade unionists, people still fail to see the point. I hope we can go back to the drawing board and study why in this case even Teamy has failed to pack in the sting it is supposed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I for one believe in giving credit where credit is due. I would like to illustrate an example of how careful explanation of Government policies can clear a lot of misunderstanding. If the Medisave scheme eventually achieves its objectives, and I have no doubt it will, we must attribute this not only to the soundness of the whole plan but also to what I feel has been one of the most carefully thought-out public relations exercise by any Government Ministry in recent years. From MPs to community leaders, to the ordinary man-in-the-street, no stone has been left unturned to clear nagging doubts about something that will affect the lives of each and every Singaporean. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiply this effort across the whole spectrum of Government, one can see how a lot of misunderstanding can be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> removed. And misunderstanding there has been aplenty judging by the number of letters written to the press as well as the type of letters written, i.e. mostly complaints. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good public relations is what is needed in most departments and ministries. We cannot expect counter clerks to explain adequately all aspects of Government policies. They are not trained to do so, neither have they the time. To blame them would therefore not be fair. But suitably-trained persons can make the difference. As our electorate becomes an increasingly sophisticated one, it demands clearer explanations, not mere enunciations. What the Government can do is to capitalize on the goodwill that could be generated through the implementation of its policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to all this is salesmanship. It is often said that a good product without a good salesman will not sell, but a good salesman can sell almost anything, even if it is a shoddy product as the Member for Toa Payoh will bear me out. Fortunately, this Government has got good products: its policies are sound, but good salesmanship is what is needed to bring closer the bond between the people and the Government. We have to iron out the irritations that rightly or wrongly irk some of our people, and these irritations are widespread. People have to continue to perceive us as a Government of the people, by the people and for the people. Only in this way can we ensure that Singaporeans will continue to enjoy the benefits of not just good government, but better government. \n  <br>2.56 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year this time round, speaking in my first Budget speech, I said that the Budget debate in this House provided us an opportunity, as it were, to state our goals for our society and to see how far we have progressed along the road set for ourselves in the year under review. Sir I am not going to again set out the goals. i take it that we are all agreed on our goal and that is a caring society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we have heard from the Hon. Minister, in presenting his Budget, that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> road last year has been a dismal one for us and that there is very little prospect ahead of us to mitigate the hardship or the suffering that might be brought about by the world-wide recession. May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, without any disrespect to the Hon. Minister, that it did not need him saying that. I think all of us are aware, or should be aware, of this world-wide recession; that all around us there is an economic slump. People are not buying the goods that are being produced because they do not have enough money and workers are being thrown out of employment. And we are all aware that Singapore particularly will be hit by economic forces outside Singapore. It does not need saying. It is obvious, as we are a country without any natural resources to cushion us against hard times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, without appearing to be presumptuous, that in presenting its economic plan to the nation for the year ahead, the Government must plan to do two things. First, it must plan for economic growth in the year ahead. In this, it should go on to spell out the measures that the Government proposes to take to maintain the economic growth or to accelerate the growth, if that were possible. Secondly, it must go on to see that the acquisition of wealth in the country or the subsisting wealth in the country is equitably and equally divided among all those who call this country theirs and who belong to it and who have some claim to the wealth that is being generated in this country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to examine how this statement meets these two objectives. But before I do that, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that the Budget Statement must address itself to all our people. I have just heard the hon. Member, speaking before me, say that the Government must legislate, take action, for the greatest number in the community and not be concerned with the needs of a minority. It is the majority with which the Government must be concerned, not the minority. And it must address itself, as I say, in its Budget to all our people. It must have something to say to everyone in our country; what it is doing to meet their needs, what it is doing to alleviate their hardships, what it is doing to give them \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> relief, if relief were needed. In my respectful submission, Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall try and show that in this respect the Budget Statement fails abysmally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Statement, the Minister says that we are not alone in recognizing the fundamental truth that our people are our greatest resource. I should have thought, Mr Speaker, Sir, that our people are our only resource. But of that resource, the greatest share or the greatest contribution is made by our working class, by our workforce. Now, how does this Budget Statement, this annual statement of the Government's intention, address itself to the workers who are our greatest resource? I say this without disparaging the contribution that is made by others, the capitalists, the entrepreneurs, But I say, without any hesitation, that our greatest resource comes from the workforce that we have in Singapore, and of which we can be justifiably proud. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the Minister acknowledged, albeit a little grudgingly, the contribution of our workers to the economy of the country. Of course, we must remember that our economic growth in 1981 was greater than the one under review. He said then: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A large part of this (economic growth) came from the efforts of individual Singaporeans. They worked harder and smarter...' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I am sorry to see that the Minister has not made any acknowledgment of the contribution made by our workforce to the economic growth last year. May I point out that, in spite of the depression around us, our economy still continues to grow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I hear Members saying \"hear, hear\", and I say \"hear, hear\" too. But I say, \"Please acknowledge the contribution made by our workers to this economic growth.\" Is it because the productivity has dropped? And has it dropped because it is thought perhaps our workers were not pulling their weight in our country? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the drop in productivity cannot be blamed on our workforce or our workers. It is due to a number of factors over which we have no control. They are mostly external. The Minister's Statement, however, does not, in my humble view, go far enough in spelling out the measures that the Government intends to introduce to increase this productivity in the year that lies ahead of us. It is, if I may say so, Sir, without again being disrespectful, full of exhortations and pious hopes, without actually spelling out what measures the Government proposes to take in the coming year to see our people through the recession that is, we are told, undoubtedly in store for them in the coming year. It is not enough, may I say, Sir, to indulge in pious hopes and exhortations. it is the business of the Government to spell out the measures, and it will be my endeavour to show that the Statement does not do this adequately. It is, as I have said, filled with exhortations and pious hopes that somehow everything will be all right if we can only tighten our belts. May I say again, talking about tightening our belts, this exhortation would appear to be addressed mainly to our workers. Why is it - I know that it is not only in this country but all over the world - that when people are being asked to tighten their belts, it is the workers who are being asked to do this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to examine the Budget Statement to see how it has met with the two objectives that I have outlined, may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, a few words generally about the recession, I, of course, appreciate that I am no economist. The past year has seen a contraction in the OECD industrial output which has been particularly severe in the European community and in the united States. As the Minister has pointed out, and I say this again, it did not come as a surprise, Singapore suffered as a result. We are subject very much to what happens outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in Singapore's growth rate last year, even though commendable when compared with other countries, was largely due, if not wholly, to these unfavourable external events. But having said that, we must ask whether our own economic policy has in any way exacer- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> bated the decline. The Minister hints at this when he says that we must continue to ensure that our traders and export-oriented manufacturing firms are not handicapped by an over-valued Singapore dollar or unduly high domestic interest rates. We should ask whether the decline has been exacerbated, Mr Speaker, Sir, by our pursuing an unduly tight interest and exchange rate policy which undoubtedly resulted in the substantial decline in the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. The fall by 6% in the manufacturing sector is a far more severe decline than in 1975 and, whilst it is not as large as in the United States and Europe, it is much greater than in Japan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister draws satisfaction from the fall in the inflation rate. It should be noted, however, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I understand from economists, that in the theory of those who give most prominence to the control of inflation, it is only the real wage resistance which poses a problem to the reconciliation of internal with external balances, and not inflation. Singapore up till now has had no labour market problem. Bargaining is centralized and controlled by the Government which determines the appropriate level of nominal wages in accordance with macro-economic targets. I am glad to see that the Minister has drawn attention to a possible pitfall in continuing this practice of a centralized body determining the wages. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is there perhaps a lesson for us to be learned from Germany which has paid excessive attention to the control of domestic inflation resulting in deteriorating economic performance in terms of growth rates of industrial output and rising unemployment since the mid-70s? It has grown much lower than Japan, the United States or France over this period. The downturn in manufacturing productivity indicates that employers are hoarding labour and, if recovery in demand does not take place, unemployment can become a problem. On the other hand, the Minister has drawn attention to a possible problem if the economy picks up and demand for labour increases. He warns that we may once face a tight labour market which under- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mine our economic restructuring and that the problem could be worse with the repatriation of foreign workers over the next few years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose now to try and see how the Statement tries to meet the objectives that I have outlined for it. First of all, how far it goes to provide the measures that the Government proposes for economic growth - to sustain or accelerate our economic growth in the year that lies ahead. The Minister said, and I quote him: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To successfully attract highly-automated projects, our non-labour costs namely, the cost of land, factory buildings, utilities and supporting services - must be kept competitive. We will therefore work towards moderating the increases in these costs.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one does not have to be a Friedman or a Galbraith, two economists whose names come to mind, to know that Singapore's economy depends very largely on what we can produce with our labour, what we can turn out in our factories, and it is not good enough just to turn them out. We have got to sell them. We have got to sell them not only in Singapore where there is a diminishing market or a small market but we have- got to sell them outside. We have got to find the markets and we do not need the Minister to tell us that all the other countries are trying to do the same. There is less and less demand for goods, especially in a recession. So it does not need very much thinking to know that if we are going to survive, we have got to produce goods cheaper than the other man does, and you have got to produce not shoddy goods but quality goods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> How? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, that is for the Minister to outline. And this is why l.say he has failed. Of course, may I assure the Members that when we take over, we will outline the measures. But at the moment I am here to ask the Minister how he proposes to do this. It is not for me to answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister what does the Government propose to do to, as he says, moderate the increase in non-labour costs, the cost of land, factory \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> buildings, utilities and supporting services? Are the statutory boards that are responsible for the building and letting out of our factories getting the message that they must not keep increasing their rents to the factory owners or those who are turning out goods for export? Unless there is a clear direction from the Government on this, I suppose the statutory boards may feel that they have to keep increasing to keep pace with the market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we unnecessarily pushing up rents in Singapore so that it makes it no longer economically productive for our manufacturers? And it is not just factories we are concerned with. We are also concerned with offices for the services that we provide in this place. I do not have to remind Members of this House that rents for office space have shot up dramatically, astronomically. What are we doing about it to make it worthwhile for companies to come here because land is available at a moderate cost to manufacture or to provide services? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about our supporting services, utilities? Are we doing anything to keep these costs within manageable limits? These are what our manufacturers and those who provide services contributing to the economy of the country would want to know. They just are not content with exhortations that they must produce better goods cheaply to compete with the world. They want to know what are you doing to help them. And it is not just the cost of land, factory buildings, the rents. There are other overheads. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Mr Speaker, Sir, burdened the employers, people who are in the manuacturing sector among others, with taxes. We have, first of all, the payroll tax. This was introduced when we were in Malaysia by the Parliament in Kuala Lumpur, and I remember that there was objection to it here. Should the Government not consider whether it is still necessary to burden our employers, the manufacturing sector, the other sectors, with this payroll tax? I shall have something more to say about this when we come to the Estimates on the Ministry of Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the Skills Development Fund. We learnt last week, in reply to a question by the hon. Member for Rochore, that we have accumulated $313.8 million in the Skills Development Fund but only $27.5 million have so far been paid out. So we have quite a substantial amount. Is it perhaps not prudent, I ask the Minister, for the Government to consider whether the collection of this Fund should now be suspended, if not done away with altogether, until the economy picks up again? I would like the Minister to say what he thinks about this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of the CPF contributions. We have been told that the contributions to the CPF, both from the employer and the employee, will be raised in order to pay for the Medisave scheme, or medical care. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that our manufacturers expect some help from the Government. If they are to help our people here, I think we should give it to them when they are facing a recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that we must continue to ensure that our traders and export-oriented manufacturing firms are not handicapped by an over-valued Singapore dollar or unduly high domestic interest rates. I think it is becoming clear, Mr Speaker, Sir, that domestic interest rates are perhaps too high now in relation to the expected level of domestic inflation and to the desirable level of the exchange rate. Has the Minister got anything to say about this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to manpower development, the Minister tells us, which I think we knew, that more than half a million of our workers have less than Primary 6 education, and he says that upgrading their basic numerate and literate ability will not be an easy undertaking. Sir, why have we come to this pass that more than half a million of our workers have less than Primary 6 education? What has gone wrong with our education system, Mr Speaker, Sir? What does the Government propose to do about this? What we are doing now are panic measures. We are conducting a basic education for skills training programme, duplicating our costs, efforts, spending more money on something that should have been done at the commencement when these workers were in schools, in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> primary schools. Why are we now put to the expense of this BEST programme. It is simply because we have failed. Why have we failed in our education system? Would the Minister answer that? And what does the Government propose to do to see that our workers get the best education when they are in school, primary schools because that is where we start? You do not weed them out for the construction brigade by this streaming that we have got and then complain that they are not good enough. Why are they being condemned to this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wages problem, the Minister says in his Statement that it is the intention of the Government to promote more direct bargaining between employers and the unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, was it in the December sitting of this House that we drew out all the teeth of the trade unions? Are we to understand now that the Government thinks that the trade unions should be strengthened? Some power should be given back to them so that they can bargain directly with their employers on the question of wages. Is it the intention of the Government now to strengthen the trade union movement? I would welcome that assurance from the Minister because, I say, a strong trade union movement helps us in maintaining our economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, motivation of our workers. This is crucial. We have heard this time and time again. We know about Productivity campaigns. We hear from the Minister that in spite of the productivity campaign last year, productivity has slumped. Obviously the campaign is not getting through. Why? Why do we not ask ourselves the question honestly? Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say.in this House that you will not get the best out of our workers unless you give them a stake in their employment. You give them a stake in the prosperity of their employers, the company they work for, and you give them a stake in the prosperity of this country. So long as you continue to treat them as though they were recipients of charity, to take whatever is given to them, you are not going to get the best out of our workers. I would ask the Government to think about this. We can only get the best from a man, from anybody, if you con- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> vince him that his future is closely bound up with the organization or the company that he is working for, that he has a stake in the prosperity of that company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we giving this stake to our workers? I have spoken before, not once but several times in this House, about the lack of security that is felt by our workers in their employment. I do not want to repeat what I have said before. Our employment laws are archaic. Is it not time we moved on a bit further and had progressive labour laws which guarantee basic rights for our workers? Why do we have to have colonial, archaic laws? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, homes. What are we doing about providing our workers with proper homes? I said this last year and I say it again, homes within their workplaces, decent homes, so that they can feel proud of them. What are we doing? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about medical care? What are we doing to ensure that they and their families will be properly cared for in the event of any illness or sickness hitting them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Medisave! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, Medisave. We will talk about Medisave when we come to debate it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Mr Speaker, Sir, I asked about the question of giving our workers an equity in the companies that they work for. Is it not time we thought of a scheme linking workers' pay directly to the productivity and profitability of the enterprises they work for? This could be done, Mr Speaker, Sir, by linking yearly bonus to a fixed percentage of total current cost profits, as defined by standard accounting conventions. It should also be possible for workers to participate directly in the ownership of the companies they work for. This could be done through distribution of bonuses for long serving employees in the form of equity. Tax incentives could be given to private sector companies to encourage them to do this. In addition, part of the employers' CPF contributions might take the form of equity in the companies themselves. It will be best if public sector enterprises took the lead in this direction. We in the Workers' Party hope eventually to see the employees of public \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sector companies owning shares in the companies, with the result that they share directly in the need for risk-taking and improvement efficiency which at present involves only management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I remind Members that it is standard practice in the advanced capitalist countries for senior management to receive part of their remuneration in the form of shares in the company they work for. Why should this not be extended to the workers? Let us start thinking about all this, Mr Speaker, Sir. Let us not go on year after year with archaic labour legislation, treating our workers as though they were only recipients of charity. Give them the dignity that they deserve. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is running on, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I shall no doubt be told very shortly that I am exceeding my time limit, and may I move on to this other matter about energy and water conservation. The Minister has mentioned the installation of thimbles in many high-rise buildings - schools, hospitals, public toilets and other premises. He says, \"Water consumption in these places has dropped by 12%.\" He said \"in many high-rise buildings\". I know that most of the high-rise buildings in Singapore are those built by the Housing and Development Board occupied by our people. Are these thimbles for the conservation of water installed only in these HDB buildings, or is it being uniformly applied also to private properties? Or are private properties being spared this water conservation? If water is to be saved, it must be the task of not only our dwellers in HDB flats but it must also be the task of all those who live in private properties. What is the Government doing to see that this contribution is made by everybody, not just by our workers largely living in HDB flats? I know, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in many private properties - I have seen this myself - water is being used to spray on to the grass and the trees; there is considerable waste. I am sure Members are aware of this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to Construction. He says Construction is the only bright feature in the dismal year that we have just gone through. He talks about Singaporeans aspiring to own their own homes at a price \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> within their means and that they can look forward to have their aspirations fulfilled. Only yesterday afternoon I was asking about the rise in the prices of HUDC apartments and drew attention to people opting out. What is being done by the Government to ensure that these homes are going to be kept within the reach of our people, and that they are being built not just for those who come here from abroad with large bank balances to buy properties in Singapore? We were told yesterday that the HUDC was not making any loss. That was before it was taken over by the HDB, but somehow the HDB has, by its accounting suddenly discovered that the cost should be at least 78% to 143% more than what it used to be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other construction that he has referred to, and that is the construction of the Mass Rapid Transit system. Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome the construction of this Mass Rapid Transit system at the present moment, but I would ask whether the Government would take steps to ensure that some of the money that is being spent goes to our own people. We know that we spent $10 million in getting advisors from abroad just to come and tell us whether we should have MRT or whether we should have something else in preference. I do not know why it was not possible to find advisors from our own universities. What is wrong with our own university, with our own education system? So let us take care that a lot of this money does not go out. And let us take care also that when they do come here they bring their technological know-how and impart it to our workers, that access to the technological know-how is made available to our people and that it is not kept secret by these companies. Would the Minister tell us what steps the Government is taking in this regard? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn, Mr Speaker, Sir, lo, what I call, the distribution or the caring for all sections of the community, This, of course, concerns the tax reliefs that the Minister announced in his Budget Statement. The Minister says he is not introducing any new taxes and for that we have to be thankful for small mercies, but he is going to give tax reliefs to a very small minority of the community. I shall come to these tax \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reliefs, that he is giving in his Statement, a little later because I want to talk about the tax reliefs that he has not given and which concern not a minority but the majority of our people in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am of course referring to the personal tax reliefs that are being given to our people in Singapore under our Income Tax laws. As I said in my speech last year on the Budget Statement, the Income Tax Ordinance was introduced in 1947 and at that time the personal relief that was given, was $3,000 to the taxpayer, an individual; and if he had a wife living with him, there was an additional $2,000, making it $5,000 for a husband and wife. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, was a relief that was given by a colonial government to its subject people, the colonialists. In 1959, we changed our colonial masters to local masters. In 1960, not very long after, our masters took steps to remedy this. They said we were getting far too much, $5,000 for a husband and wife. It had to come down. And so it came down, Mr Speaker, Sir, to $2.000 for the husband, for the man, and $1,000 for the wife - a $5,000 relief reduced to $3,000. Of course, there was thrown in the earned income relief. Today, the relief stands at $4,000 for a husband and wife. It is $2,000 for the taxpayer, $1,000 for the wife and $1,000 for earned income relief. So it stands at less than what was given in 1947. And this is 1983, Mr Speaker, Sir. As I said then, it was not a question of not increasing it; it was a question of deliberately reducing it. Why? Is it not thought possible to increase it now? On that debate last year, 3rd March, a number of our hon. Members of this House spoke about that. I see that yesterday none has spoken this year on it. There is a growing discontent, may I assure the Minister - the hon. Members speaking before me then mentioned about the growing discontent - may I tell the Minister and to the Government Ministers that there is a growing discontent in Singapore about the inadequacy of the tax relief. We do not have to go very far, Mr Speaker, Sir. Across the Causeway the tax relief, as I pointed out, is $7,000 for a husband and wife. We lire supposed to be an affluent society. We claim to be affluent. We say everybody is very affluent. Yet we say we cannot afford to give, leave alone $7,000, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> but we cannot afford to give $5,000. I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a betrayal of the trust of our people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I move on, Sir, to the other glaring omission, and that is the absence of any increase in the relief for aged dependants. Mr Speaker, Sir, this relief was introduced some years ago, and it was put at $300. We. along with other parties, protested at this pittance. It was then raised to $750, and last year it was raised to $1,000. We have heard, particularly over recent months, a lot about the filial duty of children to their parents, how children should look after their parents, how it is their moral duty and what a virtue it is for children to look after their parents. May I say from this House, Sir, that the people of Singapore could do with a little less of this moralizing, this moral preaching. They could do with a little bit of practical help. That is what they want. They want to know how the Government is going to help them to look after their aged parents. They are prepared to do it. I do not think that our people are unmindful of their duty to their parents. Let us not preach to them. Let us help them a little bit to carry out these duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only yesterday, Mr Speaker, there was a letter in the Straits Times. I am sure the Minister and the other Ministers must have seen this letter. The writer speaks about her aged parents. She says her mother is bedridden, and I think they are both over 70 years old. The writer says she is the only child. The mother is bedridden and the father has to struggle - it is a struggle for him to look after his wife - and she says that the father has grown thinner. The writer says she worries very much about them while at work and abroad, and ends with a plea for some practical help. That is what she wants. That writer does not need any moral preaching. She knows what her duties are, So I say to the Minister and to the Government: let us help where it is needed. But this Budget Statement does not do that. It does not meet the needs of our people, and that is the duty, I say, of any government which seeks to be a government, as an hon. Member said, of the people. This is not a government of the people. Let us not delude ourselves any more. You go out- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> side and you talk to the man in the coffeeshop, in the street, and he will tell you that this Government has long ceased to be a government of the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministers go on preaching day after day. We were told a little while ago about the Hong Kong syndrome, about the flaunting of wealth by the rich. Has the Minister who spoke this or the other Ministers sat down to think who was responsible for this state of affairs? If the rich are flaunting their wealth, who has contributed to this? I say this Government has, with its accent on the pursuit of wealth, as though that was the only thing that mattered, as though human needs do not matter, human suffering does not matter. Pursuit of wealth is the main object in life, the be-all and end-all of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the beginning of this century, a notable Prime Minister in England spoke of his country as being a country of two nations - a nation of the rich and a nation of the poor. I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is what we are becoming in Singapore today. I tell this Government: take care that you do not accelerate this; take care to stop this trend towards Singapore becoming a two-nation country; caring or looking after only those with money, those who are able to pay, and be indifferent to the needs of those who are unable to pay. Let us restore in this country of ours dignity of the human being. Let us not despise the sick, the aged. They also have dignity. Let us give them the dignity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said I would talk about the relief that has been given. I do not think I have the time, Mr Speaker, Sir, to talk about all the reliefs. But I want to talk about one relief that has been given, and this is the enhanced child relief for specially qualified married women. Why has this minority in our community being singled out again for another relief? In the 1981 Budget Statement - and last year we passed an Act to implement it - we handed back $3 million to them by way of tax relief when we provided that income from investments of earned income would also be assessed separately. This year we are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> going to hand back $1.4 million. Why do they need it? As somebody pointed out in a letter to the Straits Times, this has a snob appeal. Who is responsible for this? Why is it that only specially qualified women should get this help? What about the countless other working wives who have got children to care for? Why are we singling out this minority and ignoring the majority? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out, it is the duty of the Government, of any government which is sensitive of its needs, of its responsibilities, to look after the majority in the community. But this Government goes on caring for selected minorities, completely ignoring the majority of this country. The Minister says that it is because the cost of domestic help has gone up. Of course, it has. Everybody knows that. But why should they be given relief? And has the Minister wondered whether in every case there would be domestic help engaged? I take it that domestic help here is domestic help to look after the children. What is the position in families where they do not need any domestic help? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Your hour is up, Mr Jeyaretnam. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I knew you would call me up. Mr Speaker, may I just end by saying -- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. Your time is up, Mr Jeyaretnam. You have spoken for one whole hour. \n  <br>3.56 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard a lot from somebody that the PAP Government, which has been in power for over 20 years, is not a government of the people or for the majority of the people but a government that serves the interest of the minority. I would like to give two clear examples for the reference of all. We have heard that the HDB has been building flats for over 20 years for the majority of our people, i.e. the workers. This is what he himself said. It \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is not for the minority, the rich men. I do not know whether it could be achieved by a capitalist government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven days ago, on 4th March, the Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs had, in his reply to a question in this House, explained how the Government acquired land to build more houses for the majority of the people. The second example is the Medisave scheme. Like what the Member for Alexandra has said, we all know that this is a scheme to look after the workers who comprise the majority of our population. The rich people do not need Medisave scheme because they can afford to go to first class wards in the hospitals. However expensive it is, they are able to pay. Therefore, I say this Medisave scheme is for the care and welfare of the majority of the people. I would say that the Budget proposed by the Minister for Trade and Industry is a farsighted budget which will show us the way into the next 10 years. If we just look at the present but not plan for the future, then we will be short-sighted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Government saying we should encourage the aged and also the housewives to come out to work. What is wrong with giving them some tax concessions? Is there anything wrong with encouraging the handicapped persons to be on their own by giving them certain tax concessions? What is wrong with that? The Government does these things to look after as many people as possible. To increase Government revenue, if you are able to pay more, you can afford to pay more for your cigarettes. So what is wrong with paying a little bit more tax? If you are able to pay for your liquor, what is wrong with paying a little bit more tax on liquors? The Member for Yio Chu Kang yesterday suggested that if you want more revenue, you should tax more on tobacco and cigarettes. Mr Speaker, Sir, you know better than I that if one should stop smoking one would not die, but if one should smoke excessively, one has a better chance of contracting cancer. So I agree that, if necessary, other than increasing taxes on tobacco, we should levy more tax on liquors also, because one also would not die from stopping drinking. If you drink too much, you will not necessarily forget \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> every worry, you will be in a state where you will lose your senses and do something harmful against your conscience Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government finds it necessary to have more money, then the Government should tax more on people who indulge in luxury such as smoking and drinking. I feel all the people will give their support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether those people who have been criticising the Government of caring only for a few have done so with any thinking. I have been thinking: the French Government, in implementing protectionism, wilfully claimed that our goods did not bear the name in the French language and so were not allowed to be imported into France. Yet, under these circumstances, some of our people still want to drink wine and brandy imported from Paris, France. Sir, do you not think this is a strange phenomenon? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me quote what the Prime Minister has said 10 years ago in his 1973 New Year message. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cultural values determine what a people consider to be desirable goals for the individual and the nation. If a people believe that happiness is obtained by enjoyment they see advertised, they will fall prey to the hedonist cult by consuming more of the good things. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer society tends to make pleasure the main purpose of life. The stimulation of the physical senses, whether by food, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, sex, is regarded as the chief good and an end in itself.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this time of world economic recession and prevailing protectionism and at a time when Russia is relentlessly pursuing its Communist expansionism in this region through Vietnam, we should be clear of our purpose and stand upright as Singaporeans, as members of ASEAN and not agent of Britain or France. If the French Government wants to harass us, then we should let the Mitterand government know that the socialism that he is pursuing as a government of the workers is far from the fragrance of wine. If the Australian Government wants to bully us, then we should let the new Hawke Government know that since he has derided the previous Fraser Government as no good and thereby replaced it, then he himself, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Hawke government, should not be like the previous Government antagonistic towards ASEAN countries in such matters as air flights and shipping. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are developing our economy through upgrading of skills and technology by computerization and automation, we should also propagate, the field of culture, our seasoned cultural values, for we should then be able to overcome difficulties and obstacles, and make Singapore so attractive that many tourists would like to come to Singapore. Some people are concerned that the number of tourists is too few while the number of hotels is too many. In the short run, there is inevitably the worry that supply exceeds demand, but I feel that in the long run since Singapore does not have natural resources, tourist industry will be one of the main pillars of an enduring economy to ensure economic development and continued survival. So we must develop tourism and make it a success. In fact, there are several factors which must be given attention in order to succeed. If there is political stability, law and order, easy communication, good environment, good services and the like, then tourists will flock to Singapore. On the other hand, even if the world economic situation is fine and the tourist trade in many other countries is flourishing, if in Singapore some other wolfish government were to be in power and claiming itself to be better than the PAP Government, there could be no political stability but social disorder and rampant crimes. In such a situation, I would like to ask: \"Would you as a tourist like to go to such a place for a holiday?\" No, neither would I like to risk my life in such a foreign country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, for the past few years, the Tourist Promotion Board has done quite a lot, but I feel that there is still much more it can do. For instance, it is very important, to provide good services to the tourists. I can give my personal experience as an example. While my family and I were in Hong Kong on holiday, a guide-photographer offered to take our photograph at the cost of HK$5. I agreed. But the following day when he turned up with the photographs, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> he demanded more than HK$100. He had mounted one or two photographs on some poor quality ceramic plates. He made use of this as a pretext to extort a large sum of money. This is an example. Here in Singapore if we do not take precautionary measures but allow some trishaw riders, taxi drivers or businessmen to cheat the tourists, then we would be following Hong Kong's example. The whole world will then feel that we are a people of mean character whose conscience is wont to be blinded by greed, that we are mean persons and not gentlemen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after I have carefully read the Budget Statement, I feel that the contents in the Budget Statement reflect a magnificent spirit of loyalty and patriotism of a gentleman. Therefore, I am sure that in the light of such inspiration, we shall succeed and the people will certainly support it. On this note, I give my support to this motion. \n  <br>4.10 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a sympathy for Ministers for Finance who have to balance the Budget, but this year's Budget could be aptly called \"The Battle of the Bulge\". The bulge I am referring to is the astounding and unprecedented Budget surplus of nearly $2 billion, $2,000 million, for 1983. This is a surplus arising out an estimated revenue of $8.8 billion that will be collected for the next financial year. The ratio of surplus to revenue is 22%. You can call that ratio a very handsome profit, assuming that the Singapore Government is behaving like an incorporated company. This, of course, leads to two questions, namely, how did this surplus come about? Does the Minister for Trade and Industry budget for a surplus, budget for a deficit, or have a balanced budget? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to speak briefly on two points, one from the point of view of the taxpayer, the household and the company, and secondly, from the point of view of assisting industry, particularly in a recession year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, listening to the speakers yesterday, it would seem to me that there have been, quite correctly, allegations of over-budgetting by Government Ministries, and this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> over-budgetting tends to stimulate the collection of excessive revenue or taxes. I can give three examples where there has been a gross over-budgetting of development expenditure for FY 81-82. Take the Ministry of Finance. It over-estimated by $707 million; the Ministry of National Development over-estimated by $68 million, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry by $91 million. These are the Economic Ministries which have over-budgetted very grossly indeed and have stimulated a greater collection of taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister for Trade and Industry has warned that there may be a reduction in income tax, I do not see this happening because Class I taxes, i.e. direct and indirect taxes, will increase by 42% over the figures for 1980. It is an increase over a three-year period. Class 11 revenue, which comes from the sales of goods and services, will increase by 118% a kid Class 3 revenue, which comes from interest and dividends, will increase by a modest 5%. So the deficit, which the Minister for Trade and Industry predicted would happen in the financial year 1983, will probably not come about. He has given personal deductions or reliefs amounting to $3.8 million, and deductions for companies, $6.2 million, a total of $10 million, but the tax increase for 1983 on tobacco and liquor will yield altogether $54 million and he has assured us that there will be a $2 billion surplus. I would like very much, indeed, if those who frame the Budget policy will return to the old practice of presenting a comprehensive budget so that the taxpayer and the company that has to invest and to prepare its own budget, will be in a better position to know that their liabilities are. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it has been the practice in recent years to adopt a \"striptease\" budget - show a little, but not too much. The painful part of paying for what you have seen will come sometime in the middle of the year. So I have scrutinised [Laughter] not the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry, but his Budget. I notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there will be a 24% increase in revenue from the Ministry of Health and its hospitals. And there will be a 34% increase in revenue from the Registry of Vehicles. I have no idea what other \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> new levies or new rates will be imposed during the coming fiscal year. But I think it is very unfair indeed for households and businesses to be caught in the middle of their own fiscal year with new rates, new levies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a serious point that I am presenting, namely, that a comprehensive budget be given to the House so that there will be a frank and honest assessment of what it is going to cost the taxpayer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has been a hiving off of Government departments into statutory bodies. Obviously, statutory bodies are public bodies. They must be accountable to the public and we would like to know which Ministries are responsible for these statutory bodies. What is the contribution of these statutory bodies to Government revenue? What is the contribution of Government companies, of which there are quite a number, to Government revenue? Can their contributions help to alleviate income tax collections or other levies which are made on fixed charges? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Over the last few years it has consistently been giving the Government a handsome dividend of $100 million. And it is estimated to provide another $100 million for FY 83. I am very pleased indeed that with assets of $8.3 billion as of 31st March 1982, the Monetary Authority is able to provide a consistent dividend of $100 million. Of course, I am more pleased to learn that its assets have now grown to $31.3 billion but it made me ask, from its holdings of gold and foreign exchange, how did $8.3 billion suddenly increase to $31.3 billion? I find it irksome indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I should read all this in Fortune when all this should really be reported to the taxpayers in Singapore, to Parliament, because the Act which governs the operations of the MAS spells out that the MAS should present annually a report to Parliament. Will the Minister for Finance assure us that the activities of the Government Investment Corporation and its balance sheet will be included in the next annual report of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and submitted to Parliament? I think it is of considerable concern to all of us who have savings in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Central Provident Fund. Others would like to know how did these surpluses accumulate. After all, the MAS is not only the central banker for the Government but is also the financial agency of the Government. So I presume that it also handles all surplus funds, including the $2 billion surplus for FY 83. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we do not trust the Monetary Authority, but when we hear or read that it is an unusual practice for a central bank to form subsidiary companies, then it would be more comfortable if we could hear from the Monetary Authority itself about its investments and how profitable it has been. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not remind Members of the House that there was the case of Granite House which was discussed by the Public Accounts Committee in 1976. I think the Government bought Granite House for o22 million. Then when the property market in the United Kingdom collapsed, it was worth very much less than o22 million. If we had bought property in Queensland or Brisbane, it would have been that much less by 10%. So as a public body that is accountable, it is the right of Parliament to be kept fully informed by a report from the Monetary Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Governments do not and cannot create wealth but they can create the environment that will make it either more or less likely that the productive sector of society will, in fact, create wealth.\" I did not say that, Mr Speaker, Sir. This is a quotation from Mr Donald Regan, Secretary of the United States Treasury. And the Minister for Trade and Industry is absolutely correct when he said that economic growth and full employment will depend on the corporate sector remaining strong and vigorous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give my point of view on how we can make the corporate sector strong and vigorous so that we can ensure full employment. I go back to a passage during Question Time last week when I pointed out to the Minister for Finance the increasing cost of labour incurred by companies contributing to the Central Provident Fund, payroll tax and Skills Deve- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lopment Fund. It is proposed under the Medisave Scheme that the CPF contributions will be increased to a total of 50%; 25% will be paid by the worker, 25% by the employer. From the point of view of the employee, it must mean that his take-home pay will be one quarter less. The starting point of wage negotiations or collective agreements with unions is the take-home pay. So when workers' take-home pay is reduced by one quarter, they will ask their employers to top it up. So you have a spiralling increase in wages. For the employer he is paying proportionately 25% in CPF contributions, a payroll tax of 2% on income, a skills development tax of 4%, again, on income. That adds up to a total of 31% on income. Even before he starts business, he will have to examine the cost of labour. On top of that, what are his dues in terms of property tax? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over four years from 1978 to 1982, property tax collections have increased by 108%. For this year, I am told that some companies have received notices increasing their property tax by 150% to 250%. The argument behind these increases has not been spelt out. And I know from my own personal experience that although you have the right to appeal you are never heard at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recession year, I think there should be a little more flexibility on the part of the Government in alleviating levies or taxes that they collect from companies. Because if companies go down, then of course the workers will be out in the streets. The Minister for Trade and Industry cannot deplore the drift of labour from manufacturing into the trade sector, simply because if we were to automate or mechanize the manufacturing industry, which is quite relatively easy to do, surplus labour must move off into the trade sector which is labour-intensive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we calculate productivity or added value per dollar salary, instead of added value per worker, and if the added value remains constant, we will find that with increasing salaries productivity must come down. If there is no gross operating profit that a company can make, there will be no added value at all. So productivity must be zero. In other words, it might be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> useful for the Government to consider setting up a committee to examine the impact of its proportionate taxes. They are proportionate to income - the higher the income, the higher the levies that are made on CPF, payroll tax, Skills Development Fund and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I casually mentioned to the Minister of State for National Development that there was this levy of 3% on live entertainment. It is discouraging to the tourist to find that he has got to pay to be entertained in Singapore. What is it that the tourist comes to Singapore for? Has he come here to admire the flats in Toa Payoh? I do not believe that any of us in our adventures abroad goes around to admire high-rise buildings! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another unfair levy, a 3% levy which is payable to the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. This levy begun several years ago was quite correctly to collect money to promote tourism. Over the years, the catchment for this levy has increased enormously by the increase in the number of hotels, restaurants, boarding houses and so on. The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board finds that it has a surplus and excess funds but from the point of view of the operator of a restaurant or cafeteria, his prices are marked up. So all this adds up to making Singapore less competitive in the export market, whether in the export of goods or in the export of services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like indeed the Government, the Minister for Finance in particular, to examine some of these taxes that we have been collecting so far. In the early years, in the 1960s when we were hard-up for cash, when a surplus of $10 million or even $100 million was considered a windfall, these taxes were appropriate. Now we have a surplus of $2 billion, so are we not over-collecting? I think this is a point worth examining or looking into. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some questions to put to the Minister for Trade and Industry, and I would like him to clarify. What is the impact on Singapore's economy if the price of oil falls down to US$29 per barrel? What effect will it have on Government revenue, particularly on excise duty, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> because, as I understand it, tax is collected ad valorem. Will consumers of electricity and motorists benefit from the drop in the price of oil? What is the future of the Petrochemical Complex to which the Govern- ment has committed a billion dollars? These are questions which occupy our minds but which have not been touched upon by the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>4.31 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Saidi Haji Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Shariff (Kaki Bukit):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened with close attention and keen interest to the views of my PAP Members of Parliament who spoke yesterday as well as today in support of our Government financial policy for the year 1983-84 as outlined in the Annual Budget Statement. Our able Minister for Trade and Industry was most eloquent and precise when he presented his painless Budget on the 4th instant. He gave a realistic and frank appraisal of the problems confronting our nation in the year ahead and, in his concluding remarks on the economic policy, he presented practical suggestions as to how we should face the rough times ahead. I must therefore confess to feeling somewhat inadequate to make any critical comment or even to suggest an answer to our economic problems. But, as a Singaporean, I would nevertheless like to make some remarks in support of the Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest challenge we face today, in view of the problems that beset the world and the difficult years ahead of us, is first and foremost to ensure that we continue to have political stability and that our country is run by an honest and effective government and to maintain a high work performance and competitive efficiency which we have established through years of hard work. We must totally eradicate careless work attitude and take pride in our jobs. Our aim is to develop Singapore into a Centre of excellence, not only in the areas of finance and tourism but also competence in the field of science and technology. Despite our small size we must ensure that we are able to stand solidly on our own feet. At present there is a growing trend among our community for an ostentatious life-style and self-centred \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> outlook fostered by our own seemingly growing affluence and constantly abetted by advertising. Thrift has become unfashionable in the race for conspicuous spending. Whatever the latent philosophy may be, it is an unhealthy trend which is alien to our Eastern tradition. We must reorientate an attitude of mind towards facing reality and not wallow in soft options like shorter working hours, longer vacations and earlier retirement. History has shown that the greatness of nations depends on the people; and a nation like ours depends entirely on our people's discipline, thrift and indomitable will to work. We need to have a positive attitude towards life and an appreciation of the demands of successful and satisfying community living. One of the most important of these demands is that of caring and concern for those who need help since we are apt in the pursuit of good life to forget those who have not had similar opportunities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As citizens, our best contribution to ensure the survival of Singapore in the midst of a competitive world beset with a chaotic economic situation and political troubles, is to increase our productivity at our workplace. There is presently already an increasing awareness of productivity among employers. This productivity awareness must be enhanced not only among workers on the factory floor and in offices but also among our people in their homes and students in schools. Let the concept of productivity be driven hard to be the work consciousness and philosophy of our people to ensure at all times that our products and services are of the highest standard. Computerization and robotization will push further our drive for increased productivity but it must be remembered that it is people who make the organization or company tick. Hence there is need for an effective personnel management approach being adopted by employers. Apart from fostering team spirit, improving staff morale, implementing welfare schemes and incentive bonus payments, there is need to develop human relationship skills at all levels of the workforce in any organization. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> In view of the stress and strains of our present-day living in an urban environment and fast working pace, we need to develop a very informal and friendly social atmosphere or environment where our people could live and work happily, and this goes a long way to motivating them to excel for higher output. It is my hope that with cooperation between the Government, management and labour, we will be able to increase productivity to offset the effects of recession and protectionism. I am confident that with this effort from all quarters, we can increase or at least maintain an economic growth in the year ahead though at a lower rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note I fully endorse the Hon. Minister's decision to allocate 80% of the Development budget fol- expenditure on public housing, infrastructural, industrial and commercial development as well as education and manpower training. This, I hope, will adequately help to achieve the three-pronged objectives of our economic policy. I also do not grudge the allocation of 70% of the recurrent budget for combined expenditure on education, defence and public debt servicing. It is my hope that the allocation for recurrent expenditure is adequate to maintain the existing level of Government services and cater for expansion of essential functions such as education and manpower training. It is satisfying to note that funds have been provided for greater mechanization, automation and computerization in the Civil Service, as these will improve productivity and restrain the growth in recurrent expenditure and manpower. However, every care should be taken by those responsible for the implementation of Government policies in the provision of public services that they do not overlook the commitment of our Government to do the best for the mostest people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement, the Hon. Minister has decided to give three concessions to encourage the older- workers and specially qualified married women to remain in the workforce and thereby contribute to our economy. There would be a revenue loss of about $2.4 million by increasing the earned income relief from $2,000 to $3,000 for those over 55 years old and from $3,000 to $4,000 for those \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> over 60 years old. I wonder how many of the senior citizens will benefit from this concession. I also wonder whether by remaining in the workforce they would be depriving our school leavers of job opportunities in future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other suggestions that I would like to make on the concessions, but since this has been brought up by the previous speakers I would like to end my speech here. On that note I support the Annual Budget Statement by the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>4.38 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Liew Kok Pun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Liew Kok Pun (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I join my colleagues in congratulating the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry on presenting to us such a painless Budget this year. In such a time as this, we can consider ourselves fortunate as we look at this year's Budget Statement. All around us, the world is fraught with anxieties, tensions, crises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is global recession. People elsewhere are thrown out of work. Unemployment is so massive that people have to work shorter hours and agree to lower wages in order that more jobs can be made available. Next, there is the dithering international financial system - threatened by the very people who cannot repay the debts they owe to the tune of hundreds of billions of US dollars. Then there are the atrocities of massacres and wars and blatant invasions. And yet, despite all this stormy weather, we are still able to have a painless Budget. It is clear to us all that being able to afford such a Budget against the backdrop of a gloomy world economy did not come to us by accident but by design, by good government. It is the result of farsighted, prudent monetary and fiscal policies, giving us a secure buffer of three years to see us through the lean times. It speaks of a maturity, a vision in planning and in good government which we can be proud of. This is our forte. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget is a means of allocating scarce resources according to our needs and priorities. In considering the Budget, the thoughts uppermost in my mind are: This is our country, our land, our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> people. What must we do to ensure our survival, to ensure that each Singaporean is being developed to the fullest so that we can have a safe and secure homeland? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, as I pondered on each part of the Budget, I asked myself such simple questions as: In what ways is it good for the people? Is it well balanced? Does it correct a weakness? Is it the best way out? Is it enough or too little? Who will benefit from it and who will be affected by it? What is the price we have to pay? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues before me have covered a number of areas in this debate. I would first like to comment on two points which stick out in Section Ill of the Budget Statement, namely, the enhanced child relief for specially qualified women, and the first year depreciation for computers and office automation equipment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at the outset state that I fully support the provision of enhanced child relief to encourage the more highly qualified married women to continue to work even after they have children. Sir, the reasons are compelling. The latest Labour Force Survey reveals that about 2,000 or 17.5% of women with tertiary education rejected job offers because of home and child-care responsibilities. Sir, this is not a small number. Married women who are highly qualified should be encouraged to work and give the rest of society the benefit of their talents and abilities. However, the quantum of enhanced child relief is not sufficiently attractive. It is peanuts. It is also neither here nor there - a half-hearted measure that will not solve the problem. Moreover, restricting the enhanced child relief to specially qualified women only discriminates against the rest who form the bulk of the female workforce, about 97.2%. They too are partners in contributing to the economic development of our country. The restrictive enhanced child relief is not only unfair but socially unacceptable. I urge the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry to lift the restriction and extend it to all female workers. I would like to ask what the cost to revenue will be if the enhanced child relief also benefits the other female workers. Sir, there are other equally cogent reasons why we must examine all other incentives \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to get more women back into the workforce. First, the female labour force participation rate in Singapore is regrettably low. Only 45% of our women are working. Secondly, in a labour-deficit economy with a small workforce of about 1.2 million and a two-child family norm, we cannot afford to have a low female labour participation rate. The result of this is the need to bring in a large number of foreign workers, which is socially undesirable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would strongly suggest that the Government consider a long term plan to encourage more female workers to continue to work even after they have children. The Government has already set this direction of long term planning with all the features of prudence, foresight and sound judgement, as in housing, transportation, education and health. A similar long range social plan is badly needed. We would need to look at a tax relief which would make it worthwhile for women to come out and work. More important, we would also need to provide adequate creches and child-care centres if we want to get more women back into the workforce. This then is the crux of the problem. We do not have enough creches and childcare centres for the mother to place her children during the day so that she can work. Hence, from physical facilities, like buildings for creches and child-care centres, to professional expertise in the form of qualified teachers and nurses, a long range social plan has to be thoroughly worked out. We are aware of the importance of the mother looking after the children, but if she feels secure that they are in good hands, she may find it possible and attractive to return to work and thus also contribute to the economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to the incentive given to enterprises to automate and computerize their operations by allowing all expenditure on computers and office automation equipment to be written off in a year. In strong contrast to the enhanced child-relief incentive, this is an attractive one and would certainly have the intended effect of speeding up the computerization and automation of more enterprises in Singapore. I am sure it would spur more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enterprises to re-examine their labour-intensive operations. We have actually no choice - it is either automate and computerize or die. Our workers should welcome this as it would take away the repetitive and monotonous tasks, and replace them with more skill-intensive work, and hence higher wages. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as we look at automation, particularly the large scale robot-led automation, we have to anticipate what it can bring in its wake. We must study the impact it can have on our workers. We must take cognizance of what has happened in other countries, especially Japan. In other words, we have to prepare our workers to cope with a rapidly changing work environment, a machine-dominated environment. The first effect of large scale automation and computerization is the displacement of workers to different jobs. Psychologically, workers would have to be prepared to undertake different jobs during their careers. They may need to have multiple skills. It is therefore necessary to reorientate our workers' attitudes towards retraining, life-long learning, acquiring multiple skills and more frequent job rotation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore look forward in future Budget Statements to seeing provisions that reflect a well considered and long term plan of action, first, to prepare our workers to look forward to automation; secondly, to educate them to take the adjustment problems arising from job displacement in their stride; thirdly, to look after those threatened by obsolescence by equipping them with alternative skills so that they do not become a burden to themselves or to society; fourthly, to analyse the machine-dominated environment and its impact on workers; and fifthly, to provide the necessary facilities for training, counselling and other measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, this plan should give the worker a fair chance in the face of psychological and social problems which automation may cause him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my comments on these two points in the Budget have been prompted by my concern that we cannot afford any wastage in the only resource \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our country can claim to, and that is our human resource. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now touch on a matter totally unrelated to the first two topics. This concerns the subject of the excessively high Additional Registration Fee (ARF) charged on school and private-hire buses. Sir, before I continue I must hasten to add that although I am working in the transport cooperative, I am speaking on the subject mainly for the public interest and from the point of view of bringing about a more efficient school and hire-bus service. The ARF charged on these buses is 55% of the price of the new vehicle, whereas in the case of SBS and CSS buses, it is only 5%. I would like to draw the attention of the Hon. Minister for Finance to the problems faced by the 7,000 school and private-hire bus operators. According to the latest available 1981 statistics, there were 2,840 school and private-hire buses, or about 41% of the total, which were 10 years old and above. The problem with these buses is that they emit a lot of black smoke; their owners are often summoned by the traffic police and the ROV for excessive smoke emission of their vehicles; and the buses, especially the very old ones, cannot pass the ROV inspection tests - the passing rate being very low, and hence a number of them have been taken off the road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all for the strict control on pollution and the high standards required in maintenance and in passing the vehicle inspec- tions. However, it must be pointed out that these buses, being old, are extremely difficult to maintain. In other words, to provide a better bus service without too much pollution and lay-offs, many of these old buses need to be scrapped and replaced with new buses. The bus operators appreciate this and are willing to replace their buses. But when they are faced with such a hefty ARF of 55% charged on new school and private-hire buses, they simply cannot afford to pay for it. A 44-seater bus would cost more than $100,000 to bring it on the road. Even if the bus is efficiently used, the bus driver would find the monthly loan instalment prohibitive. The alternative is to increase the bus subscription fare substantially for children and workers. And this is definitely not desirable. Sir, the 7,000 school and private-hire buses provide an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> important and indispensable supplementary service to the public bus transportation service. They now provide an efficient service to the commuting public. They help to take part of the load off during the peak hours and hence alleviate the shortage of buses during this period. It can be argued therefore that the school and private-hire buses themselves provide a public transportation service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to appeal to the Hon. Minister for Finance to reduce the ARF charged for school and private-hire buses, or alternatively to set a realistic ARF ceiling or an ARF quantum according to the age of the vehicle rather than to apply a straight percentage formula of 55%. This is the case for taxis where the ARF charged for a new replacement taxi depends on the age of the scrapped vehicle. The purpose is to provide monetary incentives so that we can have a younger fleet of taxis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I gather from press reports that the Ministry of Communications is inclined to be sympathetic to the appeal of the school and private bus owners. Their case is cogent. It is a positive step which will encourage the replacement of old buses with new, trouble-free ones so as to improve the bus service. Thus, my appeal to the Minister for Finance is a simple one and, that is, for a speedy decision to be made on the review of the ARF for school and private-hire buses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this note, I support the motion by the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>4.56 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (Bukit Batok)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister presented to this House a sombre Budget on March 4th, stressing grave world economic problems we are facing today. These problems we all would like to wish them away if we could. It is impossible. There is no choice but to face them squarely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Economic Survey for 1982, our Financial and Business Services Sector contributed 36% to the Real Growth in Domestic Product. This growth rate is the fastest of all sectors in our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The Minister made it very clear that it is the Government's intention to further encourage the growth of this sector. I fully support this move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a densely populated metropolitan state situated at the cross-roads of the world. Our weak point of having too many people to feed can also be our strong point if our people are able to provide high value-added services sought after by other countries especially by our ASEAN neighbours. Financial and Business Services are among the high value-added services we are capable of providing. Every encouragement must be given by the Government to upgrade the quality and reduce the costs of these services. The Minister's decision to grant five years' tax holiday to income earned by Asian Currency Units of banks and financial institutions in syndication loan activities is a good move. It has the effect of increasing profitability for ACUs operating in Singapore. It also enables progressive ACU managers to reduce their spreads to get more business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's position as an important financial centre in Asia has grown from strength to strength. Its free enterprise economy and open-door financial policy in attracting foreign expertise have contributed considerably to this growth. The bankers and finance managers operating in Singapore are among the best in terms of trustworthiness, experience and skills. I am sure they will respond favourably to the Minister's desire of further promoting Singapore's status as the key centre for Asian Dollars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this objective, our bankers and financial institutions must do their best to make their services more conveniently available and cheaper. Convenience and costs are the two most important factors affecting corporate managers' funding decisions. Singapore is in an envious position of being able to contact London and New York in the same business day. Our bankers should make better use of this geographical advantage by prolonging their banking hours. In Hong Kong the banking hours are longer than ours. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cheaper services, it occurs to me that there exists in Singapore a curious service charge known as Commission in Lieu of Exchange. It is levied by local ACU managers on foreign currency remittance passing through them. This levy is usually a flat 1/8% of the amount of remittance. For example, Mr A remits US$800,000 from Hong Kong to Mr B's ACU account in Singapore. If Mr A's banker does not remit to Mr B's Account direct, Mr B is unable to get the full amount of US$800,000. He has to pay US$1,000 as Commission in Lieu of Exchange plus another US$15 cable charge to the intermediary banker. The service charge is said to be laid down by the Bankers Association. I cannot see the rationale for this arbitrary levy. It is unreasonable as it has no bearing on either the risks involved or the amount of work put in by the intermediary banker. I hope the Minister will do something to have it removed. As a matter of fact, I am against all percentage charges that have no bearing on the quantum of work done or the extent of risks involved. If our aim of making Singapore as a brain-service centre is to be more successful, all professional services should be charged proportionate to amount of work undertaken or risks shouldered, and not as an arbitrary percentage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to take the Suspension now.

We managed to maintain full employment. Yet it will be foolhardy for us not to make preparations for the more difficult times ahead. The world economic outlook continues to be depressing, with prospects of recovery in 1983 uncertain. To formulate a Budget in these troubled times is, indeed, a difficult task. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Industry for formulating a Budget which will enable us to take advantage of the recessionary times to build and develop our human and physical infrastructure. We must be ready to seize the opportunities when the upturn comes. I am greatly relieved that because of our prudent management in the past, we had accumulated sufficient resources to enable us to avoid having to cut back on our development programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to touch on the following areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Manpower Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1983 Budget continues to have, as one of its principal objectives a programme to increase the supply of skilled, technical and professional manpower. We must prepare ourselves to attract the future industries which will be highly automated and computerized. The challenge is to upgrade the numeracy and literacy skills of our workforce. This is a difficult task as we have almost 600,000 workers with less than primary six education. This massive undertaking has been launched with the trade unions under the leadership of the National Trades Union Congress, taking the lead by first organizing the Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST) Programme. Now, others have followed the lead. This is indeed a fine example of the deep sense of responsibility which our trade unions have. It shows the strength and capability of our trade unions. The best way to safeguard the workers' welfare is to make sure that they have the ability and skills which are relevant to the needs of the time. Only in this way can they always continue to be employable. As our workers upgrade their skills or acquire new skills to satisfy the demands and requirements of the future industries, they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can look forward confidently to earning better salaries and will then be able to provide their families with a better quality of life. We must provide the necessary encouragement to the employers to invest in the re-training of their employees during the current slack period. Here, it is important for the Skills Development Fund to play a more active role in the training of our workers. As at 31st December, 1982, a total of about $313.8 million was collected for the Fund. According to the Economic Survey, as at the end of 1982, only about $110 million or a third of the funds available had been committed for the training of 86,059 workers. This is only a small portion of the workforce. We need to step up the use of the Skills Development Fund to train more workers. It is necessary for the Skills Development Fund to take the initiative to work together with the training institutions to organize programmes for training of the workers in the skills which have been identified as necessary to meet the manpower requirements of the type of industries we want to attract to Singapore. The Fund should not only wait for applications from the employers but must be able to act on its own. One of the objectives of the Fund is the re-training of retrenched workers. In view of the poor economic outlook, the Fund should begin to gear itself to this crucial task and not wait until it is too late to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of skills training for our workers, we have, amongst our workers, those who have picked up their skills \"on the job\". They learned their skills from their supervisors through years of hard and painstaking work. Hence, we have a pool of such skilled workers in the industries, the shipyards and also in some statutory boards, like the Public Utilities Board, where we have electricians, fitters and artisans who started off as unskilled daily-rated employees and who have slowly moved up the skills ladder. Since they lack formal educational qualifications, they find it difficult to be channelled into the training institutions like the VITB because of the present system of admission. We should look at ways to tap their talents and help them to upgrade their skills. Perhaps one way is for the training institutions like the VITB to consider a system by which they can undergo some form of trade testing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which will test practical skills rather than theoretical skill. If they are given the recognition they richly deserve, they can be encouraged and motivated to pick up the literacy and numeracy skills to enable their skills to be further upgraded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Trade Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could not have found a better time to set up the Trade Development Board. In 1982, our domestic exports fell by 1%, the first decline since 1975. The prolonged recession has caused many countries to turn to protectionistic measures to safeguard employment. The TDB will have to urgently formulate a trade development strategy which will help our manufacturers, especially the local manufacturers, to win overseas markets in these difficult times. Without the opportunity to sell our goods and services in the international markets, particularly now that our exports are unfairly hindered by protectionistic and restrictive trade policies of the developed countries, our industries cannot survive and, if they fail, our workers will suffer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Singapore participated in various overseas trade missions, fairs and in-store promotion% in 1982. In 1983, more such trade missions and fairs will be organized. The question I would like to ask is: how much can we rely on these fairs and missions to help our manufacturers, especially the local manufacturers, to win overseas markets? How effective have they been? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board must closely monitor the trade policies of our trading partners and quickly alert our traders so that they would not be caught unprepared by the new trading practices imposed by them, some of which may be \"clever\" forms of protectionism. The Board must also act quickly to remove any disadvantages which our exporters will face which will only dampen their competitive edge. Here, the Minister has taken note of the need to ensure that our traders and exporters are not handicapped by an over-valued Singapore dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TDB must work towards developing Singapore's reputation as an honest and reliable supplier of high quality goods and services. Our workers, be they production workers, supervisors, managers, traders, etc, must understand that they have the prime responsibility to help us develop and maintain this reputation in the world market. This is indeed crucial for our survival. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Wages and Inflation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message that we will have to tighten our belts and lower our expectations for wage increases in 1983 will not comfort the lower income workers. As it is, they have enjoyed only a small increase in real income in 1982. Although the inflation rate has dampened, most of them are already hard-pressed by their expenditures on basic items like housing, bus fares and public utilities, which seems always to go up but never down. If things get really bad, with companies having to close down their operations or to introduce shorter work weeks and so on, leading to loss of income, individual as well as family incomes, we should consider ways to help the lower income group. Perhaps one way is to consider giving them an income tax rebate in the same way as was done previously but this time to be applicable only to the lower income groups, say, those earning chargeable incomes of, say, $7,500 per annum and below. The tax rebate could be in the region of 20% or thereabouts. I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry will consider this and also other ways to help the lower income workers if the economic conditions become really bad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this year's Budget continues to be a careful and cautious one. It will help us to stay trim and fighting fit to meet any difficulties ahead. It will also help us to seize the opportunities when the developed economies recover. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this note I support the Budget Statement. \n  <br>5.48 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Chau Sik Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Chau Sik Ting (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join my colleagues in sup- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> port of the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must congratulate the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry for giving the citizens of Singapore yet another breather, so to speak. It is a serious but painless budget. Even the habitual smokers and drinkers will not feel the pain. If they do, it is goo.d for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current world-wide recession, certain sectors of the economy have performed below expectation. The Budget should provide greater encouragement and inducements to sectors of the economy which are in the doldrums, specifically the manufacturing sector. Among the pillars of growth in the Eighties, the manufacturing sector is supposed to be the dynamic prime mover for high and sustained rates of economic growth with its expected share of contribution to the GDP lifted to 31% by the end of this decade. Growth in the manufacturing sector, unfortunately, has stagnated in the last two years and for 1982, it registered a negative growth. Our Government should be prepared to provide in greater depth the incentives that are now available to the manufacturing sector. Today, we have a sizable industrial base in Singapore with capacity for further growth. Singapore has built up a good name in a number of industries, including ship-building and ship-repairing, oil rigs and ancillary equipment, electronic components, petroleum-based products, iron and steel, food and plastic products. We should, therefore, capitalize on the strength of our existing industries which have room for further growth and expansion when the economic situation improves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be a need to review the role and scope of the incentive schemes for industries. Presently, the various incentive schemes seem to be geared primarily for new industries, thus somewhat neglecting the existing industries which have the potential for further expansion, growth and diversification. Our industrial base has expanded substantially over the years and today, the existing industries provide the bulk of our new industrial investments in Singapore. If more assistance, in terms of incentives, can be given to these industries \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to encourage them to expand, diversify and, equally important, to develop markets, these industries are likely to invest more and should provide us with the additional growth so necessary to meet our long-term objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industries today complain about our strong Singapore dollar and high overheads. A strong and stable currency, as we all know, has both advantages and disadvantages. But certainly a strong and stable currency is much preferred over a weak and unstable currency. Our Government, however, will continue to ensure that our traders and export-oriented manufacturing firms are not handicapped by an overvalued Singapore dollar. As for overhead costs, such as land, factory premises, utilities, wages, skill development fund, and property taxes, etc., I am glad that our Government is now doing its best to moderate such increases. In fact, with the present economic downturn such increases, if any, should be minimal. Here, I am in agreement with the Member for Anson that statutory boards need to assist our manufacturers. The Jurong Town Corporation, for example, needs to rethink about its intended upward revision of up to 50% of industrial land rentals applicable this year. Likewise, the tariffs on utility charges should be reduced proportionately in view of the reduced fuel price. As for Skills Development Fund, I agree with the hon. Member for Chong Boon that it is a heavy cost burden for our manufacturers. Since only 8.8% (or $27.5 million) of the total contribution of $313.8 million had been disbursed as at 31st December, 1982, it would appear that at the present rate of disbursement and contribution, the interest accrued will be adequate to meet the current disbursements. It is perhaps timely, under the present economic environment, to review the necessity to maintain the current rate of contribution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are noted for our pragmatism, we should be realistic enough to make suitable adjustments when necessary. Any reduction of the SDF levy can always be readjusted when our economy improves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree with the hon. Member for Kebun Baru when he stated that since corporate profits showed an increase last year, our industries therefore did not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> appear to be affected by SDF levy. In fact, total manufacturing output for 1982 has dropped by 6% and its contribution to our GDP has correspondingly dropped. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of our industries in Singapore will depend on its competitiveness and its ability to secure contracts overseas. The competitiveness of selling prices of our products for both domestic and overseas markets is the deciding factor. Unless we provide greater assistance to make our industries more competitive, our hope to see the 31% contribution to GDP by the manufacturing sector by the end of this decade will not materialize. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On ASEAN, the Hon. Minister has reported that our regional trade under the ASEAN Preferential Trading Arrangements has continued to grow. From press reports, it is noted that our Government is investing in Australia, and USA particularly in real estate. As mentioned in this House yesterday by the Member for Whampoa, the returns on such investment had been grossly under-estimated for FY 82. There is no doubt that we have made sound investments and that our reserves are well maintained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may, however, be useful for our Government to further look out for similar investment opportunities in the ASEAN region, which is expected to be one of the fastest growing regions in the world in the years to come. At the same time, this will enhance our existing close cooperation with the ASEAN countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to comment on another point regarding enhanced child relief for specially qualified married women. According to the Minister in his Budget Statement, from the next financial year, apart from the normal tax relief, they will enjoy an additional relief of 5% of their annual earned income for each of their children, subject to a maximum of three. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that at present the term \"specially qualified married women\" refers only to women who are University graduates and the idea is to encourage such married women who have gone through some years of tertiary university \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> education to continue to work even after they have children. If this is the rationale behind the move to allow enhanced child relief for such women, there are other categories of married women who have some form of tertiary training and education but it is not at the university level. These categories of women also ought to be included for such a concession of enhanced child relief. Among others, I am referring to the fairly large numbers of such women in two occupations, namely, the trained nurses and the non-graduate teachers. My information is that at present there are 5,124 trained nurses registered in Singapore. One can make an educated guess that there might be more than 600 of them who, because of their children, are not able to get to work. While I do not think that by including them for the tax concession would induce all of them to return to work as nurses, it would certainly make those contemplating to resign to think twice before doing so. From the figures of the National Health Plan, it is quite obvious that with the proposed increase in the development of hospitals, both in the private and public sectors in the next 10 years, the need for active working nurses is very great. This would then be an added reason why such married nurses who are presently not working should be encouraged to do so by being included in the categories for enhanced child relief. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same line of argument could be applied to those teachers who have undergone certain tertiary training at the Institute of Education or the former Teachers Training College not amounting to University level degree. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be even more non-working married women among female teachers from the figures I have obtained. For example, there are now over 21,000 trained teachers of both sexes of whom only 4,293 are university graduates. Over the last 10 years over 3,000 teachers of both sexes have resigned. It is possible that some might have changed their occupation. Nevertheless among this group of trained female teachers, there are over 2,000 who are not working because of their marital status. I believe the Ministry of Education requires at least an additional 1,000 teachers at present. These non-work- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ing trained teachers should also be encouraged to work by including them in this enhanced child relief concession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the motion. 6.00 p.m \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few days several Members of Parliament had given their refined opinions on the financial policy of the Government. Allow me to touch on certain policies of the Government particularly those which concern our workers. Sir, compared with the past few years, 1982 is a year when our economic growth was the lowest. Almost every sector of our economy had been affected by world economic recession, in particular the manufacturing sector. Total industrial production has in fact been reduced by 6%. Last year 7,500 workers were retrenched, among whom 90% were employed in the manufacturing sector. What should be noted is that the number of retrenchments does not entirely reflect the effect of economic recession on the income of our people. Because of a reduction of overtime and shorter work-week, many workers have, in fact, had their income reduced to a great extent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics say that Singapore workers are not loyal to their jobs and are wont to job-hop. I feel this is an unfair criticism on the majority of our workers. In fact, older workers who have family burden to bear all hope to have a stable job and are willing to accept overtime work to augment family income. To such workers, economic recession and retrenchment are a great blow to them. Even though there are vacancies available, companies are generally more willing to employ,younger employees because they are lower paid. For a young worker who gets $300-odd per month, it is not difficult for him to get new employment with the same pay after retrenchment. But the same cannot be said of those older workers who have families to support and who are earning $800-$1,000 per month. After their retrenchment it would be very difficult for them to get another job with similar pay, as employers would be hesitant to employ such workers with higher salary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>6.05 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, their past experience and skill may not be of any use in their new jobs and will go to waste. The Budget Statement has stressed the importance of skills training in order to ensure the success of our economic restructuring. I feel that we should make sure that retrenched workers are given the opportunity to be trained in order to facilitate them to get new jobs. The question is whether those who have a family burden can afford to attend full time training without getting any salary. Although the Skills Development Fund provides grants to assist companies in the training of workers, this mainly applies to workers who are already in employment and is of no use to workers who are out of job. Thus they have no chance to be re-trained. I hope the Government will pay close attention to this point. The Government should map out the overall manpower plan and identify the types of skills that will be required in Singapore in the coming years. It should encourage those unemployed workers to enrol for skill training in such approved courses and at the same time give them financial assistance to enable them to receive re-training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our country is advancing towards higher technology industries, we must continually try to raise the educational level of our people. Last year the NTUC introduced the BEST programme for the training of workers in English and Mathematics. With the assistance of the Government, this programme has now become part of a nation-wide system of continuing education. I am glad that the Government has paid serious attention to this scheme and I hope that many more companies will set up such classes in their establishments to train their workers, and I also hope that more workers will avail themselves of the opportunity to attend such courses conducted by NTUC and their factories. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to employees' salaries, from 1979 to 1981, the National Wages Council has for the three-year duration recommended high wage increases in line with the policy of economic restructuring. In 1982, the NWC recommendations were \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more realistic in reflecting the growth and prospect of our economy and productivity. Some people doubt that after being used to receiving high wage increase over the last three years, whether our workers will be able to adapt to the new situation where there will be lower wage increase. Facts have proved that trade unions and workers of Singapore are realistic and responsible. We are able to face the challenges and, with concerted effort, to ensure the competitiveness of our products in local and foreign markets. But we must point out that while our workers are exhorted to tighten their belts, exercise self-restraint and increase productivity, our management personnel and professionals as well as executives should also exercise the same kind of restraint. Their salaries have increased by leaps and bounds in recent years. In an attempt to attract and retain talents, the Government has continually increased the salary of senior officers. As a result, the private sector also followed suit. If this competition goes on indefinitely, pushing salaries up to unrealistic levels, it will create an unfavourable effect on our effort to attract foreign capital and on our commercial and industrial development. I am not begrudging the high pay drawn by the professionals and the administrators. In Singapore, our professionals are in short supply and therefore command high wages. What I am worried about is that if we want to attract industries of high technology to come to Singapore, we must have quality technicians, engineers and graduates who are prepared to draw reasonable wages. If these people want wages higher than that of their counterparts in the advanced countries, how can we successfully attract these industries to invest here? How can we successfully attract foreign companies to bring their research work to Singapore? Compared with Taiwan and South Korea, are we not losing our competitiveness in this respect? I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry will carefully consider these problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to bring up to the attention of the Minister is that besides wages, the Government must also exercise restraint over such things as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rentals of industrial land and utility charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make some comments on the tax policy this year. The new tax policy gives specially qualified married women a special tax concession on their children. This is to encourage these qualified women to remain in the work-force by increasing their child's relief. I agree to the suggestions made by some Members that when we are faced with labour shortage, we should not only encourage these qualified professional women to come out and work, but must also encourage all the other women who can contribute to our nation's economy to come out to work. This will not only increase the income of the family but will also alleviate our dependence on imported labour. This tax relief should be applied to all working women and not limited to some professional women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item of tax concession offered by the Government is permitting 100% depreciation allowance on computers and automation equipment in the first year. This measure of encouragement for computerization is most welcome. In order to improve our work efficiency arid productivity we must actively promote automation and computerization. Our employers must understand that the implementation of automation will not only save labour but also, more importantly, raise work efficiency and the quality of products. Even in England, although the problem of unemployment is extremely serious as thousands of workers cannot find jobs, the British government is strongly encouraging automation in order to improve productivity. For instance, the government is prepared to subsidize as much as onethird of the total cost of the purchase of industrial robots. Evidently if the manufacturers want to increase productivity and maintain its competitiveness, they must incessantly improve on their production processes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Singapore still depends a lot on foreign labour. We must make good use of this period of labour shortage to expedite our modernization and mechanization programme and train our workers to handle the new machines and to learn new techniques. This will not only raise \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the income and the standard of living of our people, but can also alleviate our dependence on foreign workers, thus achieving our objective of building up a quality and highly efficient Singaporean workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion on the financial policy of the Government. \n  <br>6.14 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> I rise in support of the Minister for Trade and Industry on his balanced and painless budget presented to Parliament on the 4th March. This is especially commendable in view of the world-wide depressed economic conditions. I think credit should also go to the Government for having taken some tough measures in the past which make it possible today to have a painless budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are just two matters to which I would invite the Minister's attention. The first is the question of Estate Duty, and the second is enhanced relief for the third child. Estate duty is not compatible with Government's philosophy of encouraging people to work hard and to save. The people toil and save, and build up their assets. But what happens at the end of the day when they die? The Government takes away a big chunk of what they have worked so hard to save. Is it not better to spend it during your lifetime than letting the Government take it away on your death? Are we not encouraging consumption? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estate duty discourages saving. It is also an anomaly. Your liability to pay estate duty depends upon what assets you own on your death. If you own a house worth, say, $10 million, it is estate duty-free. On the other hand, if you own shares worth $10 million, estate duty takes away 60%. Should you die when the prices of shares are high and if you have to pay duty later at a time when the prices of shares are low, all the proceeds from the sale of shares may not be enough to pay estate duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You have a house. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You may have to sell your house indeed! If you own assets outside Singapore, there is no estate duty \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> payable. It therefore encourages outflow of funds from Singapore. While Singapore aspires to be a financial centre and trying its best to attract funds into Singapore, estate duty is doing just the opposite - encouraging funds to flow out of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, estate duty is inequitable in that the really wealthy can always escape estate duty by proper planning. It is only the middle-class who are not too poor nor too rich and who work all their.life to build up a little nest-egg who will find that when they die the Government takes a big chunk away. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of estate duty collected compared to the total collection of the Inland Revenue Department, that is to say, excluding import duty and excise duty, is insignificant. According to the Report of the Inland Revenue Department, in 1981, for example, estate duty collected was $47,585,000 compared to a total collection of $3,920,109,000, that is to say, estate duty forms only 1.2% of the total revenue collected by the Inland Revenue Department. Again, for the first half of 1982, January to June 1982, the amount of estate duty collected was $21,539,000 whereas the total revenue collected was $2,227,774,000, that is to say, 0.96%. The figures for 1980 and 1979 are: 1980, 0.82% ; 1979, 1.7%. This percentage of the estate duty, compared to total revenue collected, will further reduce because of the exemption of one dwelling house from estate duty. It is not that the Government needs the money. Then why create all this ill-will for such an insignificant sum? I would therefore urge the Government to abolish estate duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of estate duty also creates certain anomalies. On a person's death all his assets are frozen and until an executor or an administrator is appointed by the court to administer the estate, his assets cannot be touched. Yet under the Estate Duty Act, duty is payable from the date of death and interest on the amount of duty payable is charged at 3% from the date of death to the date of payment, although on the date of death nobody knows how much duty is payable, not even the Estate Duty Commissioner, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> yet interest is chargeable on the duty that is subsequently assessed to be payable. Is this not absurd? So I would urge the Minister to do away with the provision to charge interest on estate duty payable from the date of death, even if he were not prepared to do away with estate duty altogether. If interest is payable at all, it should be from the date of the grant of probate or letter of administration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to say a few words about child relief for specially qualified married women. I agree with my colleagues who say that if enhanced child relief is payable at all it should be payable to all working women. Why specially qualified women? I wonder whether the Minister has figures to show how effective the earlier enhanced child relief is and how many more specially qualified women, with the new provision, would be encouraged to come out to work? I personally believe that the effect is marginal. Married women work because they either need the money or because they want to work, and if they are specially qualified they will work whether or not you give them any enhanced child relief over and above the other married women. I am not begrudging my specially qualified married working sisters. Good luck to them for the bonus which the Government is now handing out. But is it not inconsistent with Government policy to give enhanced relief for the third child when the Government encourages people to stop at two? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, apart from these two points, I support the Budget. \n  <br>6.22 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (West Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the year 1982 was indeed a grim year not only for the industrialized West and other developing countries but also for Singapore. Though we still managed to achieve a GDP growth of 6.3% which is more than respectable by any standard, the fact that our GDP growth has declined from 9.9% in 1981 to 6.3% in 1982 augurs badly for the future. This rapid decline in our growth rate has indicated to us just how vulnerable our eco- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nomy is. We are not immune to the state of health of the world economy. For quite some time, the economic experts around the world do not seem to be able to forecast correctly the arrival of the elusive economic recovery. While we must hope for the best, we must be prepared for the worst. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under the circumstances, I must say that the Budget Statement placed before the House by the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry is fair, positive and realistic. The proposed Budget does not shirk or avoid facing up to the grim economic situation that is being experienced by Singapore and the rest of the world. That Singapore seems to weather the present unfavourable economic situation better than many a highly industrialized country is in itself an eloquent testimony to the far-sighted and rational policies of the Government in fiscal and economic matters up to now. The proposed Budget is, likewise, laying the foundation for Singapore to take advantage of any economic recovery in the world economic situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we are also fortunate that over the years our workers and especially our unions have been very enlightened. They have been reasonable and realistic. They have always responded positively to the calls to tighten their belts as and when necessary. This was clearly manifested in last year's NWC negotiations, They have demonstrated that they realized and understood the seriousness of the worsening world economic situation and its impact on our own economy. With the sterling performance of 9.9% GDP growth in 1981, most workers and unionists in other countries would have been tempted to ask for a high wage increase. But instead they have responded positively to the call for wage restraint. They knew that it was in the long-term interest of our workers and our nation. Unfortunately, this year is still very uncertain and unpromising. And I am convinced that once again our unions, workers as well as the managers will continue to act responsibly. While there should not be unnecessarily high expectations this year, the efforts of the workers to help increase productivity must be rewarded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think any reasonable Member in this House will object to the granting of tax incentives which should ultimately strengthen the economy of Singapore. I personally find it gratifying that the proposed Budget does not contain any tax increases except where it is consistent with the policies of the Government to increase taxes in areas where the consumption is either luxurious or undesirable. For example, the increase in taxes on tobacco and alcohol products is consistent with the Government's policy to discourage the consumption of these two products. And I fully agree with several other hon. Members who have spoken that the increases have been too mild to have any effect on the habitual consumers of these two products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am generally happy with the Budget, I wish the Budget proposals would have devoted some attention or reference to the plight of those Singaporeans who are not able to cope with life as well as others, even in a normal economic situation. In an economic down-turn it is conceivable that the plight of these unfortunate Singaporeans would worsen. Moreover, it is not peculiar to Singapore alone that some of its citizens are in such unenviable position. Even in highly developed countries there are segments of the population needing more public help and assistance than others. As it is, there are some Singaporeans who are not able to avail themselves of Singapore's comprehensive and enlightened programme of public housing without some form of public assistance, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my concern today, however, is directed particularly to that small but significant group of workers who are in the greatest danger of being left out, high and dry, by our programme for the restructuring of the economy. As Members of the House know, the restructuring of our economy necessarily entails the adaptation of our workforce to more advanced and sophisticated industries incorporating the latest technology. What this means in plain words is that the workers have to learn new skills or upgrade their existing skills in order to be able to continue working in the restructured economy of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that NTUC initiated the \"Basic Education for Skills Training\" or commonly known as BEST, which is now administered by the VITB on a nation-wide basis because they have the material and manpower resources to manage such a huge project. Similarly, the Government established the Skills Development Fund to promote and finance the development of the skills of our workers. The VITB and the Skills Development Fund Board are doing a good job in helping workers to gain new skills or upgrade existing skills. But do all categories of workers benefit from the various schemes of education and skills training? Who do the employers choose to send for skill upgrading? Are all workers qualified to attend or capable of following even the BEST programme? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am not happy about is that the plight of a small but significant group of workers has been apparently overlooked and completely ignored. The workers I refer to are those who are either less endowed by nature, or who have never been to school for one reason or another or who might be too old to start education all over again. There are others who are good with their hands but who might find formal schooling inappropriate. All VITB skill training courses require certain minimum academic qualifications. To expect this group of workers to go through BEST programme and then the skill training courses would take them years. With a family to take care of and after eight hours of hard work, this is hardly practical. Whatever the explanation, they represent a forgotten group of workers who are not able to participate in, and benefit from, the BEST programme or other skill training programme financed by the Skills Development Fund. We have limited manpower resources and everyone counts. More importantly, let us not forget that these workers have contributed a lot in the past and they can continue to make their contributions in the restructured economy. Everyone has a role to play. And everyone must play his role if Singapore is to continue to thrive. If we do nothing for them, we are being very unjust. In addition our small country cannot afford to carry passengers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, employers who have established training programmes for the upgrading of the skills of their workers usually select the good workers in their service. Similarly, some workers who do not have any training programme in their place of work and who are keen to better themselves can enrol themselves in the BEST programme or other programmes presently conducted by the VITB. In short, workers who are able or are eager to benefit from any programme to upgrade their skills are adequately catered for by the various programmes conducted or sponsored by the VITB or the Skills Development Fund in association with the employers, PAP educational centres and trade unions. But the group of workers, who either have cause for thinking or have convinced themselves into believing that they are unable to take part in any programme or upgrading of skills, would find themselves in a worsening situation as time goes on. Without new skills or upgraded skills, these workers would find themselves among the first to be retrenched in any establishment and among the last to obtain new employment after retrenchment. If these workers are unable to obtain gainful employment to support themselves and their families, they may have to require public assistance in one form or other. It is not a healthy or desirable state of affairs for the workers, their dependants and Singapore. We must not spare any effort to persuade them and to design special courses to enable them to upgrade their skills or gain new skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, to attend any training programme of VITB, a worker must possess minimum educational qualifications. The BEST programme thus enables workers to obtain the requisite qualifications. I would urge VITB to also conduct short practical courses in skill training for workers who do not possess the prescribed minimum educational qualifications. There are workers who do not have an aptitude for any form of formal schooling but who are able to benefit from practical experience. A very good example are the car mechanics and some other technical workers who may not have gone through a formal education at all and know nothing about the theories. Yet they are excellent in their jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have in mind is that the VITB and other training bodies should conduct training courses not only at different levels but also in different modes. In place of or in addition to training courses which consist of lectures or lecture-cum-practical demonstrations, the VITB should design training programmes that wholly consist of repetitive sessions of practical demonstrations to enable workers with very low educational levels to acquire new skills or improve their existing skills. The practiceoriented courses should be of short duration, that is, one to three months at the most, and should be precise and to the point, that is, without needless theorizing. The Skills Development Fund Board should give its fullest support to such projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we should also ensure that all the resources, energy and time we spend on the training of our workers are not wasted. Proper guidance and advice should be given to the workers as to the requirements of future skills. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, another concern is the productivity movement which we are embarking on. Trade unions and workers have responded wholeheartedly and enthusiastically to the call by the Government to increase productivity. Trade unions and workers similarly co-operate with employers to raise productivity in their places of work. But do all employers appreciate the efforts of their workers in raising productivity? I am afraid not. Some employers think it is good business practice to use the productivity gains from the efforts of their workers to retrench workers, since less workers are needed to do the same amount of work. Some other employers even think it is good business practice to take advantage of the productivity campaign for reorganization and get rid of the older workers at the top of their wage-scales. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether these employers are good businessmen, if you consider that such business practice would save one cent today and lose one dollar tomorrow. If workers see that whatever contributions they make towards raising their productivity will be used to terminate their employment, it is unlikely that they will cooperate with their employers in any future productivity campaign. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the same employers can do a lot to make their workers productivity fans. If productivity gains result in less workers being needed to do a given piece of work, the excess workers can be re-deployed to do other work, work which the management always wanted to do but were unable to do so because of manpower shortages. The employers can also arrange for the workers who can be spared to go for skill-upgrading courses so as to be able to increase their productivity further. What is required of employers in this kind of situation is that they use their management skills and ingenuity to derive the maximum benefit from productivity gains instead of jeopardising their own productivity campaign by their own short-sighted action of cooking the goose as well as the egg. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accepted that trained manpower is our only significant natural resource. On that count alone, we should explore and exploit every avenue to enable every worker, even those who are less endowed by nature, to participate in and benefit from the restructuring of our economy. We should particularly ensure that those workers who work well and hard to raise their productivity benefit and not suffer from their contributions to productivity gains. Workers must be made to see that the gains of their companies are also their own gains. If we do not do so, future calls for greater efforts in productivity improvement will be futile and consequently the workers, their dependants, the enterprises as well as Singapore will suffer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion by the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>6.40 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Tanah Merah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, speaking towards the end of a debate has its disadvantage. There is hardly any ground that is left uncovered. On the other hand, the advantage is that I need not go through the rationale in detail as the backdrop has been fully painted by others. I would, therefore, be very specific without making reference to all the statistics and figures. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a welcome development over the last few years is that there have been fewer surprise taxation measures introduced in between Budgets. I hope this tradition will prevail. Although I appreciate that there is no particular reason, other than being logical, why tax changes must be introduced together with the financial policy of the Government during the Budget, we should not introduce too many surprise elements in the financial management of the State. This is especially so if such changes have been conceived as part of the financial package of the Budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the recent Budget Statement, there was a fear of a hefty increase in the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) on motor vehicles. Thankfully, this was not the case. However, I find it difficult to reconcile the increases in the estimated revenue to be derived from the ARF with that from road tax. Under Tax on Production and Expenditure, the road tax on motor vehicles is estimated at $297 million, a reasonable 13% increase over the 1982 figure. On the other hand, there is a 60% jump in the revenue from ARF for 1982 of $245 million as against the estimated figure of $390 million for 1983. It implies that either the Government has a plan to increase the ARF sometime during the year or that other measures will be introduced which will increase the revenue from ARF while holding down the road tax at a reasonable level. I would like to have the assurance from the Minister that a hefty increase in ARF has not already been planned. Perhaps he would care to explain the discrepancy in revenue from these two items. I fear that I may be looking at the show which the Member for Rochore was watching with scrutinizing eyes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years our Government has been trying to develop Singapore as a service and training centre. The taxation policy, however, does not appear to be moving in the same direction. In 1978 the Finance Minister announced a 20% concessionary tax rate on income derived from providing consultancy and technical services overseas. The legislation was enacted in 1979. Unfortunately, it is primarily meant for the construction and building industry and, moreover, it is only \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> applicable to consultancy service performed on approved overseas projects and provided the company has a minimum gross annual revenue of $1 million from such a source. I believe very few, if any at all, local firms can take advantage of the incentives. They only benefit the large multinational concerns using Singapore as an offshore base which will not necessarily result in a transfer of technology. Many find the requirement of obtaining prior approval and a minimum $1 million revenue unrealistic and impracticable. They find it more convenient and less taxing, perhaps I should say no tax, by not repatriating such offshore income back to Singapore. The net result is the loss of revenue and the loss of foreign exchange earnings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service sector, Sir, is less vulnerable to protectionism than the manufacturing industry. Over the years we have accumulated considerable expertise in many aspects of the service sector. But we have yet to exploit the advantage fully. I would like to urge the Minister, therefore, to give the necessary encouragement and support to the development of the service sector. There is no reason why, for example, similar tax incentives and support available only to the manufacturing sector cannot be applied to the service sector. Similarly, there is also no reason why they should only be confined to one particular industry, We are equally strong in other disciplines, such as accountancy and the legal services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been talking of developing Singapore as a service centre for years. In the face of recession perhaps we need the impetus from the Government to make it a reality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget speech, the Minister mentioned that the Government intends to focus on three major areas for further development of Singapore as a financial centre. Unfortunately, the Minister only elaborated on measures to encourage the development of the gold market and the international loan syndication. He has not made known the position nor the intention of the Government with regard to the development of offshore fund mana- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> gement. Of obvious interest is whether he would now consider granting net earnings from such activities concessionary tax rates as in gold and ACU dealings. Other financial centres such as Hong Kong have a more attractive package than us. We must make it attractive for the financial institutions to use Singapore as an operational base. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the manufacturing sector has borne the major brunt of the world recession. At the same time, our local industries are facing the strangling pincer of high production cost and the effect of a very strong Singapore dollar. We are grateful to the Minister for highlighting the adverse effects of a strong Singapore dollar to our trades. Unfortunately, we could not possibly expect the Minister to announce any redeeming measures on the foreign exchange rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, on such issues such as production cost, particularly overhead cost, he can. First, there is rental for land and factory premises. Singapore manufacturers have to pay a higher rental than our competitors in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. To fuel the situation further, the Jurong Town Corporation has recently decided to increase most industrial land rentals by the maximum 50% under the five-year revision scheme. The argument is that it is below the market value. I believe the argument is rather ridiculous. The entire Jurong Town is practically owned by the JTC. There is no such thing as market value nor any other base line to work on. Such increase, though legitimate as contained in the lease agreement, is I think unjustifiable at this point of time, especially as JTC has just shown a very hefty increase in revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have one of the highest statutory contributions in the world. Total contribution to CPF, SDF and payroll tax amounts to more than 50% of the payroll. With the introduction of the Medisave scheme, it is possible that it will go up even higher. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to repeat the arguments so eloquently put forward by my colleagues except to remind the Minister of a statement made by the Finance Minister in 1979. While explaining the rationale for the skills development levy, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> he said that the levy, together with the increase in employer's CPF contribution, 4% for that year, provided a buffer which \"in the event of a deep recession could be removed or lowered to moderate wage cost increases of the employers.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is an opportune time for the Minister to examine the whole issue of statutory contributions rather than its individual components. Similarly, I hope the Minister will also examine seriously the question of containing high overhead costs and reviewing the total package of tax incentives for investment and trade development so as to make it more flexible for the manufacturers and exporters to compete in the world market effectively. In the face of a shrinking world market and in order not to lose out, we must adopt a more innovative strategy for the coming year. I am sure the Minister is more than capable of doing that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of world-wide recession, we could not have expected a better budget from the Minister. Although we are not here to shower him with compliments, I would like to join all my colleagues in congratulating him for his masterpiece. \n  <br>6.50 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like, first of all, to thank all the hon. Members for their constructive suggestions and the keen interest which they have taken in the Budget debate. While not glossing over the difficult economic times which we are now going through, Members in their speeches have in my view reflected a sense of determination, a sense of readiness to come to grips with economic realities that must augur well for Singapore as we tackle the somewhat rocky road that lies ahead of us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the matters brought up by the hon. Members in the debate, for example, the increased rates of public assistance allowances mentioned by the Member for Serangoon Gardens, more financial assistance for Government-aided primary and secondary schools raised by the Member for Buona Vista, are I think more within the ambit of particular Ministries. I do not think it is appropriate for me to discuss \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> such matters in detail in my reply, but I do hope that the Members concerned will raise the questions again at the appropriate time in the Committee of Supply. I am quite sure that my colleagues in the Cabinet will be very glad to answer their questions in detail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply, I shall first discuss the economic and financial policy of the Government and then go on to discuss particular taxation issues raised by various Members. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the economic circumstances in which this Budget has been framed have been amply spelt out in the Budget Statement and further commented on eloquently by the Member for Chong Boon, the Member for Whampoa and other Members in their speeches. I do not intend to go over familiar ground. Members already know that we do not expect an easy road ahead. But Members may have read in the press recently about the upturn in the leading economic indicators in the United States for January. Some may wonder whether this signifies, as has been claimed by a number of U.S. administration officials, that the recession has ended and the recovery has begun. Unfortunately, January 1983 is not the only month in which the index of leading economic indicators has shown an upturn. In fact, if we were to study the index carefully, we will find that the index has been predicting a recovery in nine out of 10 months since April last year. And yet the U.S. economy continues to be in recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 1982, the U.S. economy only showed marginal growth, 0.7%. In the fourth quarter of last year, the U.S. economy actually declined by more than 2%. I am therefore inclined to view the rise in the January index with some caution. And indeed after the initial euphoria, senior economic advisers in the United States Government have also started to warn the public and to express their reservations that the January rise may not indeed mark the beginning of the long awaited recovery. And I think that their caution is understandable. Although the rise in the January index was indeed substantial, the highest in 33 years, it was due mainly to the sharp increase in the money supply which resulted from a sure \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in the public investing in the new money market deposit instruments which banks and savings institutions in the U.S. can now offer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in April 1982, when the index of leading indicators also showed a significant upturn, the financial components were also a principal factor for the rise in the index. In January, although almost all the components of the index rose, one important component fell. Industry orders for equipment declined and this shows that businessmen are still very hesitant about investing in new equipment. Such a lack of confidence does not augur well for a sustained economic recovery. And it is only with a sustained recovery that our industries and our economy can benefit. While I, like all of us, would like to see an early recovery in the U.S. economy, I think that it is only prudent for us to guard against being taken in by a false spring. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in oil prices announced last night will undoubtedly be good for the world in the long run, and therefore it will be good for Singapore. But in the short-term, it may be disadvantageous for us. The drop in oil prices will, for example, affect the export revenues of those of our neighbours who are producing oil and this, in turn, must affect our trade with them. Furthermore, a decline in oil prices must hit those economic activities which service the oil exploration programme in the seas around us. And as we have all read in the press, production at our refineries has also been affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the refinery programme is concerned, the Member for Whampoa has asked whether in the light of the present downturn in oil prices whether Government should continue to encourage oil refining activities. The Government has actually not given any tax incentives for any increase in basic crude distilling capacity in recent years. But due to the changing petroleum product patterns resulting from energy conservation, the oil refineries have been forced to modify their refining plants through upgrading projects such as visbreakers, hydrocrackers and platformers. These units essentially take one or perhaps more product streams \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from a refinery and upgrade them to higher value products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment in the Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore, which has also been a subject of some comments from Members, was committed in 1977. At that time, of course, there was no oil glut. There have been no new investments committed in the complex apart from what was originally envisaged as forming part of this complex. The latest downstream project to produce ethylene glycol was committed in January this year. But it still remains an integral part of the complex as it was originally planned. It is not possible to operate the complex economically without this particular downstream unit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, this complex will find the going very tough for the next few years. I do not think that we should try to hide this fact. But we have invested heavily in the complex together with our Japanese partners and we must regard this project as an investment for the long term. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Rochore has queried about the impact on Government revenues as a consequence of the decline in oil prices. He mentioned particularly the excise duty on petroleum, It is too early for us to try and work out what will be the decline, although there will undoubtedly be a drop in Government revenue from this source. It will depend upon what are the final prices quoted at the petrol pumps. In connection with this matter, the Member for Thomson has raised the matter of PUB electricity tariffs and suggested that they should also go down when the oil price goes down. I fully agree with him. He will remember that since August 1982 the PUB has adopted a system of three-monthly automatic adjustment of the electricity tariffs. I think this system is more equitable as the consumers will be charged the prevailing fuel oil price paid by the PUB. When the price goes down, then of course the tariff must go down. Indeed in November last year, following a decline in the fuel oil price, the PUB reduced the electricity tariff by 1/2 cent per kilowatt hour. This resulted in a reduction of between 2 1/2 % and 3% in the average electricity rate to our industries and consumers. Since November last year the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> posted prices of fuel oil have actually not changed, although the spot price of oil has changed. This is why for the three-month period commencing 1st February 1983, there has been no change in our electricity tariffs. The next adjustment will be on 1st May, 1983, and it is likely that we can look forward to good news. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protectionism is another subject which has been mentioned by several Members in their speeches. I think many Members have also highlighted the increasing tendency of countries to resort to non-tariff barriers which are particularly detrimental to our exports. Singapore, as we all know, is an open economy. We rely significantly on our export of goods and services to sustain our economic growth. However, this does not mean that we are helpless or cannot take any action against the adverse influences of protectionism. I think we can mitigate these effects, first, by searching for new markets not only in the non-traditional countries, like the newly developed countries, but also in new product areas which are less susceptible to protectionism, for example, in the high value-added items such as computer peripherals and sophisticated machinery. Members will also know that we have formed the Trade Development Board to assist our manufacturers and traders to promote their products abroad. I am pleased to inform the Member for Geylang Serai that the TDB has an active programme of export promotion, including beefing up our overseas trade offices, increasing the frequency of our trade missions abroad as well as concentrating on improving the core of marketing expertise within Singapore. The Government is also keeping a close watch on developments in protectionist legislation abroad and our offices are always on the alert against such moves and we intend to protest vigorously against any unfair measures to restrict trade. But above all, we must continue to improve our products and services with a view to enhancing quality and reducing cost. We must move towards the production of high quality, sophisticated high value-added products and services because where there are trade restrictions in the form of tariff duties, so long as our products and services can be competitive we can still overcome such tariff and we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can also capitalize on economies of scale in order to lower our production cost. By working as a group with our ASEAN neighbours we can also improve trading relationships with other countries. I would like in this respect to mention that the impact of ASEAN as an economic grouping has gained recognition throughout the world. In the last round of our multi-fibre negotiations with the EEC, for example, it was because ASEAN negotiated as a group that each of us, each of the five ASEAN countries, was able to get better benefits than if each of us had negotiated individually. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has mentioned that he is more hopeful that this time the international monetary system will not suffer a breakdown because more people are now aware of the problem and are talking about the massive overhang of debts which, as we all know, is giving international bankers recurrent nightmares. We must all hope that he is right and that my fears will prove to be unfounded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various proposals have been floated in the international financial press about solutions to the debt problem. In particular a person named Felix Rohatyn, a New York merchant banker, suggested an expanded version of the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC), which was the instrument he devised to save New York from bankruptcy. In the present case this would mean that it would have to be an international institution guaranteed by governments which would take over the bank debts owed by the developing countries and convert these debts into long-term debts at lower interest rates. The banks who had lent the money would then have greater security of getting their money back but they would suffer a loss in recurrent earnings. Such a scheme would, however, require legislative approval from the major developed countries, particularly the United States. I think we all know that Congress is already known to be unhappy about being asked to use taxpayers' money to bail out banks which have got into trouble through their imprudent lending. The situation may change when there is a crisis because adversity concentrates the mind wonder- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fully. The question is whether such international cooperative effort can be activated without a major economic crisis to stir Congressmen and Parliaments into action. We have to wait and see. But governments today have more contacts with each other and hopefully we have learnt some lessons from the Great Depression in the 1930s when grievous policy errors were made. I am hopeful that even if we should have another economic disaster, this will not be as prolonged as in the 1930s when the Great Depression lasted for ten years. Under today's circumstances, with the political pressure which the unemployed can exert on legislators, I think that governments will be forced to act in concert and hopefully the Second Great Depression, if it comes, will be over not in ten years but in three to four years. But in those three to four years, we must make sure that our economic structure is not permanently damaged and that hardship to our citizens is minimized where possible. I think the key must be to keep unemployment as low as possible and to keep as many people in the workforce as possible so that their skills will not go stale with disuse, their time is not wasted, and when the depression ends we shall have a head start over other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject of local companies, which was raised by the Member for Chong Boon and also by the Member for Kebun Baru. In 1982, local investments amounted to $540 million, which constituted 31% of our total investment commit- ments. These commitments came from both new investment projects as well as projects to upgrade existing manufacturing operations through automation. Investments were in sectors which covered the Petroleum, Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing, Iron and Steel Fabrication, Metal Products, Food and Plastic industries. It is encouraging to note that increasingly new local investment commitments are being made in high growth, high technology sectors, such as computers and computer peripheral equipment, photo voltaic cells and industrial robots. Local companies have also invested in sophisticated equipment to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provide the critical components which are needed for the fast growing computer peripheral industry in Singapore. Realizing the importance for local companies to upgrade and automate their operations and diversify into new high technology industries, EDB has instructed its international network of promotion offices to help any local company who wishes to establish contact with appropriate foreign firms. EDB will continue to grant generous tax and financial incentives for such joint venture projects which involve the manufacture and development of high technology products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the help given by Government, some statistics on applications to the Interest Grant for Mechanization Scheme would be relevant. In this case, for example, last year out of 398 applications received from local companies for the Interest Grant for Mechanization Scheme, two-thirds or 260 had been approved. Another problem which local companies also face is lack of finance. In this case the Government established the Small Industries Finance scheme in 1976. Under this scheme, long-term fixed interest rate finance is provided by Government to participating banks for onward lending to small viable local manufacturing or technical service companies in order to assist their technical modernization and expansion. This scheme has been very successful. The scheme with a little bit of modification is now also extended to cover medium-sized local companies with fixed assets of between $2 million and $5 million. As at the 31st of January this year, a total of $235 million in loans have been granted to 626 local small companies under the SIF scheme. The EDB has also a comprehensive package of tax incentives to assist our local companies to invest in, develop high technology and capital-intensive products. Many local industries have taken advantage of these tax incentives. Again as at 31st January this year, wholly local companies and joint venture companies (that is, a joint venture between a local company and a foreign company) have been granted 43% of the total number of Pioneer Certificates and 68% of the total number of total investment allowance certificates granted by the EDB. Overall, in fact, the local and the joint venture \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> companies have been granted 44% of the total amount of tax incentives granted to industries. This reflects that the Government is alive to the problems which are faced by our local companies and also we realize that there is a need for local companies to acquire technical assistance for them to upgrade into high technology areas. In this case, we have come out with what we call the Small Industries Technical Assistance Scheme (SITAS) which is to encourage small companies to obtain the use of technical consultants to help them in their upgrading effort. Under this scheme, 90% of the approved costs of engaging such consultants can be reimbursed by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the point on the Science Park which was brought up by the Member for Chong Boon. There are, in fact, quite a number of companies which have negotiated to be residents of the Science Park. Their identities will be made public at the appropriate time. EDB is fully aware of the need for proper incentives to be given to attract good tenants to the Science Park. Among the tax incentives, for example, the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Research and Development Grants are available to potential tenants. Also the rentals which were originally $22.75 per square metre for standard factory buildings in the Science Park have now been lowered to $19 per square metre which is comparable to the JTC ground floor rent. For selected Park tenants, EDB is also prepared to negotiate a further reduction in rentals on a case-by-case basis. With regard to the lease rate for land, this is $11.60 per square metre per year. I think we all agree that this is quite reasonable and there is no further need to reduce this rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has brought up the point that Government needs to give some assistance to manufacturing in these difficult times. In fact, of all the sectors in our economy, manufacturing has benefited more than any other sector from Government incentives. In fact, in some ways, they have benefited a little too much. The incentives which are available are investment allowances, investment grants for mechanization, grants for raining costs, research and development \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> grants, the Product Development Assistance Scheme whereby grants are given to local companies and double deduction of expenses of R&amp;D operating costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of JTC rentals was brought up by the Member for Tanah Merah and also the Member for Thomson. We all know that land is a scarce resource in Singapore. It is a primary requirement for all economic activities and in the manufacturing sector in particular. Like all factors of production, we need to ensure that our land resources are used to the maximum efficiency that is possible. JTC's primary objective is to provide industrial land at low cost to industries and to ensure that this land is used efficiently. Members know that JTC does not sell land. JTC leases industrial land on 30 years' tenure to manufacturing firms who are required to pay an annual rental instead of a lump sum payment. This prevents firms from speculating on the rise in the price of land but rather forces them to concentrate on maximizing the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing operations. It also prevents the hoarding of land by manufacturing firms beyond what they actually need. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC land rentals are revised every five years subject to a maximum increase of 50%. The last five-year revision of JTC land rentals was made in 1978. Since then land rentals have generally increased by at least two to three-fold. Revision of JTC land rentals is scheduled for this year. For this revision in 1983, JTC has taken several factors into consideration. This includes the current recession, the Government's economic policy to maintain our competitive edge as compared to other countries, the rentals paid by the existing lessees as compared to new lessees and the need again to ensure the maximum usage of land. After careful deliberation, JTC implemented a three-tier increase in land rentals in January this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there is no increase in rentals for existing lessees who are paying the current market rental. For those who are paying a very low rental, the increase is 50% and for those paying slightly higher rentals, which are still below the market rates, the increase is 40%. Out of the 1,791 existing lessees, 57% are affected by the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 50% increase and 26% by the 40% increase. Even after the revision of 40% or 50%, existing lessees still pay very low rentals as compared to new lessees. For example, the lessees who are occupying inland sites in Jurong pay 78 cents to $2.70 per square metre per annum and, after a 50% rental adjustment, this will rise to $1.17 to $4.05 per square metre per annum. This is approximately 14% to 48% of the current market rental of $8.40 per square metre per annum. Also to assist firms from having to bear a large rental revision every five years, JTC has given the firms the option to opt for a new yearly rental revision scheme whereby land rentals will be revised every year subject to a maximum increase of 7.6% each year. The rental revision by JTC is necessary to ensure that those companies which lease land from JTC at very cheap rentals many years ago will pay rentals somewhat closer to the economic value of the land today. The new industries which have gone into JTC recently have not been affected by the land rental revision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon has brought up the matter of PUB installing thimbles and suggested that this be encouraged. This was started by the PUB in 1979 to instal thimbles in private high-rise apartments and also in HDB flats. By the end of 1982, the PUB had completed its programme of installing thimbles in approximately 150,000 existing high-rise apartments and HDB flats. New high-rise apartments and HDB flats will have the thimbles installed at the same time when their water meters are installed. Following the Save Water campaign in October 1981, owners of recreational complexes comprising public swimming pools, clubs, cinemas and places of interest were requested to instal water saving devices such as self-closing, delayed action taps or showers and constant flow regulators in their public washrooms. I am pleased to say that the response from the owners has been encouraging. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the commercial, construction and industrial sectors, the use of thimbles is not so effective because of the different nature of their usage of water. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> These sectors account for about 30% of the total water consumed in the Republic. I believe that it is in these sectors that we can do more to reduce wastage. The manufacturing industries can, for example, look into reducing consumption of potable water by re-cycling their water. They could use sea-water or industrial water in their manufacturing processes. The JTC is undertaking a programme to see how water can be saved in these sectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens suggested that we encourage the formation of science and technology clubs in community centres. Judging from the runaway success of the computer clubs, this shows some promise in promoting the further understanding and appreciation of new developments in science and technology. I shall ask the Science Council to follow up this suggestion of the Member. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for West Coast brought up a very important point, i.e. the effect of automation and mechanization on jobs. The rapid pace of mechanization and automation in Singapore has brought about significant structural changes in our economy. So far we have been able to harness the new wave of automation and mechanization to help solve our labour shortage problems and reduce our dependence on foreign workers. On the whole, automation and mechanization have been beneficial. It has not only helped to increase output per worker but it has also reduced the absolute number of workers required in existing economic activities and enable employers to deploy these workers in other activities. The workers who have been displaced by automation and mechanization should be trained for new jobs within their existing firms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to mention and to bring to the notice of Members the recent agreement by the Japanese company Nissan who has signed an agreement with the trade unions whereby the trade unions have undertaken to help the company to introduce robots to mechanize the operations, but on the understanding that no workers will be displaced or lose their jobs as a consequence of the introduction of these robots. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> This is a far-sighted move and should be emulated by our employers in Singapore. Workers must never fear that their jobs are put at risk by the robots, by the new equipment, which have been introduced by employers and companies, and it is foolish of companies and employers to use mechanization and robots as a means of reducing their workers and creating unemployment. This is the surest way to ensure that such a programme will fail, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken about the BEST programme. Here, I would like to acknowledge the assistance of our trade union movement, the NTUC, in getting this programme off the ground. In all fairness, we must recognize that it was the trade union movement who first recognized the need to upgrade the skill not only of those young people who are going to join the workforce but of those people who are already in the workforce so that the workers will be able to work in the new type of industries which we are attracting to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST) Programme, a suggestion was made by the Member for Boon Lay, whether workers who had been retrenched and could not find employment could be enrolled in Government-approved training courses and receive Government assistance while undergoing training. On the whole, I would agree with the Member that, as far as possible, we should help retrenched workers to enrol in our training centres and to acquire new and relevant skills which will improve their chances of re-employment. I am not sure whether giving them a subsidy by way of direct financial assistance is a good measure in the long run. The experience of several Western countries has shown that the existence of such benefits is often a disincentive to people to look for work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, getting a job has not been too difficult in Singapore because we still have a labour shortage. But the Government will do its part to encourage companies to keep their workers and to retrain them. In this respect the Skills Development Fund is prepared to give generous financial support. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for West Coast has also raised the point about those workers who have not been to school at all or who are too old to have the potential to study English and Mathematics which are the aims of the BEST programme. In this respect we must realize that the BEST programme is still at a very early stage. Once the Continuing Education and Training Department of VITB, which is responsible for the BEST programme, has acquired enough experience in running the BEST programme, it should turn its attention to the categories of workers which have been referred to by the Member for West Coast. Perhaps one possible way is to teach them simple practical skills which do not require a knowledge of English or Mathematics. For example, these can be simple mechanical skills. However, there is a limit to what we can do to train employees for these simple mechanical skills. If workers want to upgrade themselves, then at some stage they must at least learn the rudiments of Mathematics or English so that they can handle the more complex machinery which our companies will introduce. In this respect the trade unions can help the Government significantly to reduce any difficulty which the older workers may have in this area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of views have been expressed by Members regarding the Skills Development Fund. The Members for Leng Kee, Chong Boon and Thomson feel that the scheme should be reviewed. The Member for Kebun Baru is a strong champion of the SDF. We should not just look at the disbursement figure of $27 1/2 million which has been mentioned several times. A further sum of $102 million is due to be paid out when companies complete their approved training programmes. I do not think that small companies are at a disadvantage as there are many avenues through which they can avail themselves of the SDF funds, for example, by using the Interest Grant for Mechanization scheme. Moreover, several trade or industry associations, like the textile trade and the hotel trade, have joined together to set up industrial training programmes which are funded by the SDF. It is in this way that our small local companies can make use of the SDF funds which they have contributed. In fact, almost two-thirds of the total SDF \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> grants have gone to our local companies. Since most of our local companies are small, this shows that our small companies have also made use of the SDF funds. Furthermore, the annual commitments of SDF grants have been increasing. In 1980 it was about 18% of the annual collections, in 1981, 49%, and in 1982, 60%. Perhaps in 1983 it will reach 100%. The number of applications received in 1982 has more than doubled compared to that received in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that the momentum in training is quickly building up, although I would like to remind Members that we are still a far cry from the state when training is required as an integral part of a company's operations. My fear is that with the present recession some companies may be tempted to cut back on their training programmes in order to reduce costs. This is most undesirable. Not only will it be a setback for us but I believe it will also impair the ability of companies to take advantage of the recovery which must come one of these days. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yio Chu Kang has speculated that fees for training courses have gone up because it is so easy to get money from the SDF. This may be true, but the SDF has built into its criteria an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the training programmes which it subsidizes. Companies have also been advised that they should weigh the likely benefits of the training programmes to which they send their workers. If the prog ramme is not cost effective, the SDF will reduce the level of support which it gives or, indeed, reject the applications from the companies. If companies wish to pay a high price for some programmes, that is their privilege, but the SDF will make sure that this is not at the cost of the SDF funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yio Chu Kang has also brought up a number of points on the development of Singapore as a financial centre, particularly with regard to the management fees incurred for managing funds. Members will know that these management fees are incurred by companies which deal in stocks and shares and are fully deductible if they are part and parcel \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the expenses in buying and selling the stocks and shares and the profits from these sales are subject to tax. But, on the other hand, companies which are engaged in investment holding and do not deal in stocks and shares are subject to tax only on the investment income, not on the profits realized from the sale of such stocks and shares. Companies will have to make up their minds whether they wish to be dealing companies or to be investment holding companies. They cannot have the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance has been most generous in giving a concession by allowing a deduction of 50% of the management fees incurred by the investment holding company. Furthermore, there is the problem of defining what is capital gain and what is dealing gain. There is, in fact, an abundance of case laws which can give guidance in deciding whether in any particular case the gain is income gain or a capital gain. In fact, to my knowledge, no country in the world has given an explicit explanation of what is an income gain as against a capital gain. If the Member for Yio Chu Kang has any information which we do not know, I would be very pleased to hear from him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards land, this is a topic which has been raised by several Members, including the Members for Clementi, Whampoa and Rochore. We must use land carefully in Singapore because it is a finite resource. We must also ensure that there is always sufficient land set aside to generate economic growth while, at the same time, to satisfy the housing, recreational and social needs of our population. We all know that developers of land for economic use are motivated by profit consideration, as are all businessmen. I am not sure whether it is wise for the Government to direct businessmen to build hotels, offices or condominiums. I think it is best to leave such decisions to the businessmen. But it is right that the Government should make sure that as much informati6n as possible is available to the businessmen so that they can make a careful and considered judgement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is monitoring the situation to ensure that our Master Plan continues to be relevant and appropriate in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the light of new economic and social circumstances. I think that with the high pace of construction and high usage of land likely in the next few years, I am inclined to agree with the Member for Whampoa that perhaps it is time now for the Government to make an overall study of the economic use of land in Singapore in order to ensure that this finite resource can be put to the most efficient use. This is a matter which we will take up with the Ministry of National Development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, do I have to stop at 8.00 o'clock.? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> I shall move a little faster now. The Member for Serangoon Gardens also talked about ASEAN, particularly the ASEAN industrial projects which have not moved as much as we would like. Basically, the reason is that the conditions under which all the five countries have to participate in the projects are becoming a little difficult for the projects to get off the ground. My own feeling is that the new agreement on the ASEAN industrial joint ventures is a much more promising approach. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to say a few words on the expenditure budget, since the Member for Rochore has commented that he has scrutinized acutely our strip-tease Budget. This has also been commented on by the Member for Whampoa. He has expressed concern over what he called the serious budgetary lapses that have occurred each year when the expenditure and revenue estimates presented by the Government differ markedly from what is actually spent and earned. For example, in FY 1982-83, Government revenues were under-estimated by 22% while development expenditure was over-estimated by 15%. This under-estimation of revenue and over-estimation of expenditure, in my view, reflects the conservative and prudent approach taken by the Government in the management of public finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir. It was an under-estimate of recurrent expenditure, an over-estimate of development expenditure and an underestimate of revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> I am grateful to the Member for Whampoa. But he has brought up a very serious point, and that is that the Budget presented annually to Government does not include the expenditure of our major statutory boards and also of the Government companies which the Member for Rochore mentioned, I would like to point out here that the annual budget does state the amounts that are being provided by Government to statutory boards by way of operating or capital grants and loans. Of course, the budget does not reflect the revenues and expenditures of those statutory boards which are self-financing. However, this does not mean that Parliament is not kept informed of the spending plans of the various statutory boards. Each statutory board is required to present its budget as well as its audited statement of accounts annually to Parliament. Further, the parent Ministry of each statutory board regularly monitors the board's activities and its financial performance. Finally, as a further measure, the Ministry of Finance will be introducing a computerized system to monitor the long-term recurrent and capital expenditure commitments of all the statutory boards, including those which are self-financing. This should ensure that the expenditure of statutory boards is under adequate Government control. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point brought up by the Member for Whampoa which deserves to be discussed is the increase in Government spending in the last few years. This is necessary because of the fact that we are in an economic recession. During such times, it is necessary for the Government to take an active part in spending while the private sector is hesitant to expand its operations. The Government will reduce its role when the economy recovers in order to ensure that there is no crowding out of resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members also know that a large part of Government spending is in development projects which will improve the social and economic infrastructure of Singapore. This is an area where the private sector does not venture into - public housing, power supply, industrial land, port development, telecommunications, which will bring lasting benefit to us. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time is short, I will skip over some of the specific taxation issues brought up by various Members. I hope they will bring them up again in the form of Oral Questions so that we will have time to give them a reply. This includes taxation on foreign source income brought up by the Member for Chong Boon. I would like, however, to say a few words about estate duty. There seems to be a concerted campaign during this debate to question the need for estate duty. I would just like to mention here that we are reviewing whether estate duty is necessary in Singapore and, if so, what can be done. Perhaps by next year I will be able to let Members have more information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the enhanced child relief given to specially qualified women, several Members have suggested that this be extended to all working women. I am not sure whether there is a valid case for it. But I am sympathetic to the suggestion by the Member for Thomson that qualified teachers in schools and nurses should perhaps be considered. I will recommend this to the Ministry of Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Members have brought up points like taxation on venture capital and the Member for Tanah Merah brought up the point on international consultancy companies which I do not have time to reply today. I hope he will ask the question again in due course. I think I have covered all the material points which have been brought up by Members in the Budget debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will turn now to the comments of the Member for Anson. He has spoken, according to my watch, for 60 minutes but has said nothing that is new or relevant but a lot that is confusing. Indeed his speech seems to be a hotch potch of unrelated ideas, and I really think that he should confine himself to speaking on subjects with which he is familiar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked why we have not spelt out the measures to see how we can see our Singapore economy through the present recession. I would have thought that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whole budget speech is devoted to that particular theme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he has raised some new concepts which I am not familiar with, for example, tying bonuses to current cost profits. I believe that the term is current cost accounting. He has criticized the fact that Government may be using unduly tight interest rate and exchange rate policies which hamper our exporters and manufacturers. You cannot have tight interest rates and tight exchange rates at the same time. If interest rates are low, then your dollar will go down. So I think you have got to choose one or the other. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has a fairly predictable frame of mind. So I have taken the precaution of preparing a number of schedules relating to the points which he has raised in this debate. He has said that one defect in this budget is that workers have not been given a fair share in the prosperity of the company. I suppose this means that most of the profits have been siphoned off to the companies and that workers are only left with the crumbs. The Clerk of Parliament will distribute this schedule (Cols. 915 - 916) which shows average annual remuneration per worker in manufacturing over the last 23 years since 1960. Manufacturing is indicative of the other economic sectors and the figures have been adjusted for inflation so that they are comparable. [Copies distributed to Members.] \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830315/19830315-HA-0420915.htm\">schedule (Cols. 915 - 916)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will see straightaway that the average annual remuneration per worker in manufacturing has, in fact, more than doubled from $5,705 in 1960 to $11,521 in 1982 and these are real wages to reflect the increase in purchasing power which the average worker in manufacturing has been able to enjoy in the last 23 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very striking figure in the schedule is the average CPF balances of workers. In 1960, the average balance was $1,089. In 1982, the average balance was $9,074, an increase of over eight times. Again these figures have been adjusted for inflation and they are all stated in 1982 dollars. Half of the increase of eight times represents the increased contribution from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the workers, half represents the increased contribution from their employers. So we can see that not only have the workers been able to spend more on the necessities and luxuries of life but they have also been able to save more. What is more remarkable to me is that the higher CPF balances have come about even after deducting the commitments on HDB mortgages which is the means by which we have enabled the vast majority of our population to have the hope that one of these days they can own their own homes. I think this is a promise that no other government has been able to give to its people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> The Member for Anson has also suggested that the Government should provide workers with homes within their work places. This is a new concept of worker benefit which I am not familiar with. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I said \"near to their work places.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Did you not say, \"within\"? Perhaps we should go back to the old cottage industries where the home is the work place! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on a more serious subject, the Member has criticized the Government's taxation policy with regard to reliefs and implied that the Government is managing our economy and our financial policy only to the benefit of those who are rich while neglecting those who are poor. In other words, we are squeezing the poor in order to benefit the rich. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what the average man thinks. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Let me just pass this schedule (Cols. 917 - 918) around which shows the distribution of personal income tax based on assessments completed in 1982 [Copies distributed to Members.] \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830315/19830315-HA-0420917.htm\">schedule - DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX BASED ON ASSESSMENTS COMPLETED IN 1982 (Cols. 917 - 918)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to say more. It shows that the bulk of our personal income tax is in fact collected from the higher income groups. 75% of our taxpayers numbering \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> some 369,000 people with chargeable incomes of less than $10,000 pay only 8.7% of the total tax that is assessed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other end of the scale, are those taxpayers with chargeable income above $100,000. This comprises some 5,091 taxpayers assessed last year. They were only 1% of the total number of taxpayers. They paid $265 million or more than one-third of the total tax assessed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained that our personal reliefs are too low and has compared us unfavourably with reliefs given by a neighbouring country. I think he should not only take tax reliefs into consideration but also the tax rates. In Singapore, our tax rate for the first chargeable group of $5,000 is only at 4% whereas in that neighbouring country the lowest rate is 6%. So I do not think that he can compare one thing with another unless he takes the whole thing in perspective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am running out of time, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, but I think that this has been a very interesting Budget debate and I thank all hon. Members for their constructive suggestions and their comments. As I have said in my concluding remarks in the Budget speech, many Members have noted in their speeches that we live in perilous times. While I am apprehensive I am not discouraged. We have seen the dangers ahead and we have taken the necessary precautions. We have a population that is well tested, that has been exposed to equally perilous dangers in the past and each time we have overcome what appeared to be insurmountable obstacles. Our children will inherit a Singapore that will be a far cry from the riot stricken, impoverished city which was the lot of some of us in this House in our younger days. Our children will have the benefit of being better prepared to face the world in the 1980s and the 1990s. From time to time, no doubt some of us may have occasional doubts as to whether the younger generation will have the moral fibre, the resoluteness that is characteristic of Singaporeans and symbolized by the hard-headed, realistic, honest policies pursued by our Government over the last 24 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> years. The ways of the young may appear to be somewhat strange to us but I believe that lessons learnt by the old have not been wasted. These lessons can be transmitted to those who are now in schools, doing their national service, in the universities and those who are embarking on their first jobs. All of us are human. One of these days all of us will pass away from the scene.
