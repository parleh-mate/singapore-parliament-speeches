The project\r\n\r\nis  undertaken with the assistance from the United\r\n\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and with  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank as its Executing Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the MTS, which is in two phases, is to\r\n\r\nassist  the  Government in the  formulation  of  a\r\n\r\ntransportation  programme that  would  efficiently\r\n\r\nserve  present  and  future needs  and  complement\r\n\r\noverall  plans for long-range development  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Phase  I  of  the  Study  will  provide\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for development of  mass  transit\r\n\r\nservices  based  on comprehensive  evaluation  and\r\n\r\nanalysis of available transportation alternatives.\r\n\r\nPhase II will be a detailed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeasibility study of the recommended system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I of the Study was recently completed and\r\n\r\nthe Consultants are expected to submit their Final\r\n\r\nReport around the end of this month. On receipt of\r\n\r\nthe  Final  Report,  the  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nConsultants  would be reviewed  and  submitted  to\r\n\r\nGovernment for decision.

These  measures  include\r\n\r\nreserved  bus lanes some of which are  already  in\r\n\r\noperation,  as  well as measures to  restrain  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the private car population.

Since Singapore Bus Services  Ltd.\r\n\r\n(SBS)  took  over  operation  of  the  public  bus\r\n\r\nservice   from  the  three  former   companies   - Amalgamated Bus Co. (ABC), Associated Bus  Service\r\n\r\n(ABS)  and United Bus Co. (UBC) - on 1st  November\r\n\r\nlast  year,  it has been required to submit  daily\r\n\r\nreturns to the Ministry of Communications and  the\r\n\r\nBus  Services Reorganisation Committee  (BSRC)  on\r\n\r\nthe  bus operations. Included in these returns are\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  breakdowns occurring  daily.  The\r\n\r\nreturns  show  an  average of 35 breakdowns  daily\r\n\r\nover  the  four  months  from  November  1973   to\r\n\r\nFebruary 1974. The breakdown figures were counter-checked with daily reports from the Police for the months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof November and December only. This represents 2.5\r\n\r\nper cent of the daily average operational fleet of\r\n\r\n1,400.  It  should be noted the buses operate  for\r\n\r\nabout  18  hours  a  day,  often  under  congested\r\n\r\ntraffic  conditions and severely overloaded.  This\r\n\r\nwould strain even the best of equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are as concerned as the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  that buses breaking down by  the  roads\r\n\r\nshould  be  quickly  removed and  not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nobstruct traffic. Through efforts of the BSRC. SBS\r\n\r\nentered  into  an agreement with a  private  motor\r\n\r\nrepairer  to  tow away and repair its buses  which\r\n\r\nbreakdown by the roadside in the city area. At the\r\n\r\nrequest of the BSRC, SBS also undertook to  obtain\r\n\r\nother  private  motor repairers to assist  in  the\r\n\r\nrepair  of  its buses which break down,  including\r\n\r\nthose    breaking    down   by    the    roadside.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements   inviting   such   private   motor\r\n\r\nrepairers to undertake this work were published by\r\n\r\nSBS in the Press on 14th, 19th, and 20th February.\r\n\r\nIt   is  expected  that  SBS  would  finalise  the\r\n\r\narrangements  with those companies which  respond,\r\n\r\nshortly.  SBS is also finalising arrangements  for\r\n\r\ninstallation of mobile VHF communication equipment\r\n\r\nin  its repair vehicles with the control centre at\r\n\r\nits  main  workshop. This, when  installed,  would\r\n\r\nspeed up the repair of roadside breakdowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Road Traffic (Removal of\r\n\r\nVehicles)  Rules,  the  Police  are  empowered  to\r\n\r\nremove  broken  down vehicles on the  roads  which\r\n\r\ncause  obstruction and to charge  the  owners  for\r\n\r\nremoval  and  storage  fees. The  present  removal\r\n\r\ncharge for a bus is $60 and the storage charge  is\r\n\r\n$20  per day. The Registry of Vehicles and Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice   are  reviewing  this  with  a   view   to\r\n\r\nincreasing  the rates as a deterrent  to  roadside\r\n\r\nbreakdowns  and  incentive to better  maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe   Traffic  Police  are  also  arranging   with\r\n\r\nsuitable  private contractors for towing  away  of\r\n\r\nbuses  broken down by the roadside which  are  too\r\n\r\nlarge   to   be   towed  away  by  their   present\r\n\r\ncontractor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key, Sir, to reducing the number of buses\r\n\r\nbreaking  down  by the roadside  is,  however,  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the buses properly. SBS inherited most of\r\n\r\nits  present bus fleet from the three  former  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies, and many of these buses, I am sorry  to\r\n\r\nsay,  were very poorly maintained. More  than  400\r\n\r\nwere  out  of  repair and laid up when  SBS  began\r\n\r\noperations on 1st November last year. Through  the\r\n\r\nefforts of the BSRC, an agreement was entered into\r\n\r\nby  SBS  with a private motor repairer  to  repair\r\n\r\nthese  400  buses  at an estimated  cost  of  $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion  and to put them back on the road as  soon\r\n\r\nas possible over the six months from November 1973\r\n\r\nto  April  1974. Unfortunately, owing to the  poor\r\n\r\nstate  of  maintenance, many of  these  buses  are\r\n\r\nirreparable   without   replacement    of    major\r\n\r\ncomponents.  Up to 28th February last month,  only\r\n\r\n43  of  the buses have been repaired and put  back\r\n\r\ninto  operation. However, SBS now has,  on  order,\r\n\r\n227   replacement  engines,  gearboxes  and  axles\r\n\r\ncosting  an  estimated  $2  million.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nundertaking  some  of the repairs  itself  and  is\r\n\r\narranging  with  additional private  repairers  to\r\n\r\nassist in the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure higher standards of maintenance of the\r\n\r\nbuses  in future, SBS is leasing a 17.6-acre  site\r\n\r\nat Braddell Road for 15 years from the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to put up a proper central depot\r\n\r\nand workshop. Plans for the workshop are now being\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  by the architects commissioned  by  SBS\r\n\r\nwith  the  assistance of consultants from  certain\r\n\r\nmajor motor suppliers and repairers. SBS has  also\r\n\r\nemployed   a  qualified  mechanical  engineer   to\r\n\r\nsupervise  its workshops operations.  Arrangements\r\n\r\nhave,  in  addition, been made for SBS to  recruit\r\n\r\nmore  motor  mechanics and to undertake  a  proper\r\n\r\nscheme  for motor mechanic trainees in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  the  Registry  of Vehicles,  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board and the Singapore Industrial Labour\r\n\r\nOrganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All public buses are required to be inspected and\r\n\r\ncertified fit by the Mechanical Inspection Unit of\r\n\r\nthe  Registry of Vehicles once every  six  months.\r\n\r\nThese   inspections  have  been  intensified   and\r\n\r\nproposals are being studied by the BSRC to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat buses appearing for inspection in future have\r\n\r\nproperly  documented and certified service  record\r\n\r\ncards. Under the proposals, these cards would show\r\n\r\nthe  repair jobs and servicing carried out on  the\r\n\r\nbuses in the six months preceding each inspection.\r\n\r\nBuses   which   do  not  meet  the  standards   of\r\n\r\nmaintenance specified by the Registry of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nwould  not be passed for use on the roads and  the\r\n\r\nbus company would be penalised for operating buses\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not up to the standard of  maintenance\r\n\r\nrequired.  False  certification  of  the   service\r\n\r\nrecord cards would also be subject to penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Sembawang may be assured that\r\n\r\nevery  effort  is being directed towards  ensuring\r\n\r\nproper maintenance of our public buses with a view\r\n\r\nto  avoiding  roadside breakdowns and providing  a\r\n\r\nmaximum operational fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfully sympathise with the Minister on the state of\r\n\r\nthe  bus  service  in Singapore. From  the  points\r\n\r\nwhich he has raised, I would like to ask him a few\r\n\r\nsupplementary questions. Firstly, it would seem to\r\n\r\nme  that  the introduction of bus lanes on certain\r\n\r\nroads  has created new problems. The right of  way\r\n\r\nfor  smaller vehicles is one such problem.  It  is\r\n\r\nall  right if we are in a mini-car alongside a big\r\n\r\nbus.  Actually out of fear for our own safety,  we\r\n\r\ngive way to the bus. What happens if an army truck\r\n\r\nhappens to be parked at the red light next to  the\r\n\r\nbus? Who has the right of way to turn left?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of bus lanes also leads to a\r\n\r\nslowing  down  of  traffic.  All  buses  following\r\n\r\nbehind  a  bus  that  stops at  a  bus  stop  will\r\n\r\nnaturally  have to stop. This will mean  that  the\r\n\r\nentire chain of buses have to stop, whether or not\r\n\r\nthere  are passengers getting off from the second,\r\n\r\nthird or fourth bus. I am sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese problems have been thought over carefully by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  and the Minister  will  have  good\r\n\r\nanswers to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question concerns the efforts made by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Communications to encourage  more\r\n\r\nand  more people to use public transport. I notice\r\n\r\nthat there are no schedules of routes at bus stops\r\n\r\nto help commuters. I think it would be a good idea\r\n\r\nif  the Ministry could ask SBS to publicise at all\r\n\r\nbus  stops  a schedule of all the buses that  come\r\n\r\nthat way, giving the routes and Service number  of\r\n\r\nevery  bus. I am sure this can be done and  should\r\n\r\nbe done with haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I notice that the SBS has recently\r\n\r\nintroduced  some 40 to 50 jumbo buses. This  jumbo\r\n\r\nbus  can  carry 90 passengers. I am told  that  at\r\n\r\ncertain  junctions cars following  closely  behind\r\n\r\nthis  jumbo  bus have got to reverse in  order  to\r\n\r\nallow this jumbo bus to turn into a small lane.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  the  Ministry can also ask  the  SBS  to\r\n\r\nreschedule  bus routes so that these  jumbo  buses\r\n\r\nwill   not   cause  any  inconvenience  to   other\r\n\r\ncommuters on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the question of conductors, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  provision of just one conductor  for  a\r\n\r\njumbo bus is going to create more problems for the\r\n\r\ncommuters  and also for the bus conductors.  I  am\r\n\r\ninclined   to  believe  that  unhealthy  incidents\r\n\r\nbetween  commuters and conductors may increasingly\r\n\r\noccur  if we do not provide one more conductor  to\r\n\r\neach jumbo bus. Let us say that we should have two\r\n\r\nconductors instead of one conductor in each  jumbo\r\n\r\nbus. Can I have the answers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I shall endeavour to\r\n\r\nanswer  the rather long-winded question  with  its\r\n\r\nmany  provisos.  Firstly, on the question  of  the\r\n\r\nreserved  bus  lanes  and  the  problems   arising\r\n\r\ntherefrom.  Problems  will always  arise  when  we\r\n\r\nstart  on  something new. There will  be  teething\r\n\r\nproblems.  Even the bus drivers and bus conductors\r\n\r\nrealise for the first time now that they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  right of way when they are in the bus  lanes.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question of right of way is very\r\n\r\nsimple.  When  there is a reserved bus  lane,  the\r\n\r\nright of way is the privilege of the buses. Anyone\r\n\r\ngetting into this lane will be booked, and he will\r\n\r\nhave  to exercise greater care. If a driver  of  a\r\n\r\nvehicle, be it an army truck, wishes to turn left,\r\n\r\nthen if there is a bus lane on his left, he should\r\n\r\nfirst have to give the right of way to the bus. He\r\n\r\nshould be more patient before turning left because\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  see that the passage is clear  before\r\n\r\nmaking  his turn. Otherwise he will get  a  ticket\r\n\r\nfor the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question about the change of\r\n\r\nbuses  and  so on and whether adequate steps  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken to review the situation, I can  assure\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member, as well as members of the public,\r\n\r\nthat this matter is constantly under review. If it\r\n\r\nis  found that certain adjustments have to be made\r\n\r\nto improve the flow of traffic, we will do so. May\r\n\r\nI  also assure the hon. Member that it is not just\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Communications and a few officials\r\n\r\nin  the  Registry of Vehicles who are involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  drawing  of  lines on the  road.  We  have  a\r\n\r\ntechnical team of road engineers and planners from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of National Development. They are the\r\n\r\nones  who  really plan the whole  scheme  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it did receive our criticism as  well  as\r\n\r\nthat of the Traffic Police in the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.  The whole scheme of reserved  bus  lanes\r\n\r\nwas not just the work of one Ministry. I would say\r\n\r\nthat at least three Ministries were involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about encouraging more\r\n\r\ncommuters  by  providing certain facilities  which\r\n\r\nthe   hon.   Member  considers   should   be   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the bus company.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the bus company should do  much  more\r\n\r\nthan  just  print some bus guides.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  will  have to make up for  lost  time  by\r\n\r\nhaving  more officers appointed so that  they  can\r\n\r\ncommunicate with the public,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the business of the BSRC is to ensure that the\r\n\r\nneeds of commuters are looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Member is that at\r\n\r\neach  of  the  main  terminals  there  should   be\r\n\r\nsufficient boards to indicate routes of the  buses\r\n\r\nthat  leave the terminus, and so on. This takes  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of time to eventuate. I can assure him,\r\n\r\nhowever, that every effort will be made to get the\r\n\r\nSBS to provide a public bus service that is up  to\r\n\r\nstandard.  But we have our difficulties,  and  the\r\n\r\nfirst is the objective to get 400 buses, which are\r\n\r\nnow off the road, to be back on the road. Once the\r\n\r\npublic  get  the buses to travel in, then  we  can\r\n\r\nthink of other improvements to the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his last suggestion about having two\r\n\r\nconductors to one bus, may I say that  it  is  our\r\n\r\nhope  that  ultimately there will be no conductors\r\n\r\nin  the  bus. But that is a long way yet. This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  we  would  like  to  see   -that\r\n\r\nultimately  each bus will be operated  by  only  a\r\n\r\ndriver  and the commuters need only to drop  their\r\n\r\nshillings  for a ride, depending on distance,  and\r\n\r\nthere would not be any conductors at all. But I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to agitate my good Friend,  who  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge   of   the   Singapore  Industrial   Labour\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  by  causing a  ripple  amongst  his\r\n\r\nmidst.

What I would like to know and very  firmly\r\n\r\nask is whether the bus service is going to improve\r\n\r\nin  three months' time, or never at all? Or is the\r\n\r\nHon. Minister for Communications still thinking of\r\n\r\ndoctoring the SBS and \"transplanting\" engines  and\r\n\r\nwhatnots, rather than performing the last rites of\r\n\r\nthe SBS and the funeral service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am sorry to hear that\r\n\r\nthe  hon.

Having seen the collapse of one bus  company\r\n\r\n(the Singapore Traction Company) in December 1971,\r\n\r\nit  is my last wish that the SBS will collapse.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfair that we should give the bus company some time\r\n\r\nto get on its feet, because it is only four months\r\n\r\nsince  the company started operations as a  single\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, there are a number of\r\n\r\ndeficiencies, including 400 buses not put  on  the\r\n\r\nroad.  To be fair, I must say that SBS has entered\r\n\r\ninto  a  contract with a motor repairer to  repair\r\n\r\nthe  400  buses in six months' time, that  is,  by\r\n\r\nApril  1974.  We  should therefore  not  judge  it\r\n\r\nbefore  then.  If  it is necessary  for  \"surgical\r\n\r\noperations\" to be done, perhaps I would  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to do it then, but not now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, there has been\r\n\r\nSome   talk   that   public   transport   may   be\r\n\r\nnationalised.

There  are  no  statistics\r\n\r\navailable for private buildings at the moment. But\r\n\r\nwith  the introduction of the Buildings and Common\r\n\r\nProperty   (Maintenance  and   Management)   Rules\r\n\r\nsometime  this year, statistics of lifts  in  such\r\n\r\nbuildings  will  become available.  The  lifts  in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  flats are installed in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  Board's specifications  and  under  the\r\n\r\nsupervision  of the Board's electrical  engineers.\r\n\r\nThe  lifts  are tested for a period of  two  weeks\r\n\r\nbefore   use.

As  this  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation is not adequate to cope with the high-rise  developments, the Building Control  Division\r\n\r\nhas  been given the responsibility for the control\r\n\r\nand  installation of lifts and escalators  by  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Act of this year.  The  Division\r\n\r\nproposes   to  introduce  regulations  that   will\r\n\r\nrequire lifts to be installed and maintained by  a\r\n\r\nprofessional engineer in accordance with the  code\r\n\r\nof   practice  for  installation,  operation,  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of lifts. The code is being  finalised\r\n\r\nin  conjunction  with the Singapore  Institute  of\r\n\r\nStandards and Industrial Research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the Building Control Act which I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned,  action has also  been  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  the proper maintenance of lifts in private\r\n\r\nbuildings under the Buildings and Common  Property\r\n\r\n(Maintenance  and Management) Rules which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned. The Commissioner of Buildings  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible to ensure that owners keep their lifts\r\n\r\nin clean and proper working condition at all times\r\n\r\nand  have  them  serviced  monthly  and  inspected\r\n\r\nannually at least. It is not practicable  to  make\r\n\r\nit compulsory for all lifts to be operated by lift\r\n\r\nattendants,  as too large a number  of  attendants\r\n\r\nwill be needed and it will be difficult to recruit\r\n\r\nor   retain   such   persons.

Allowing\r\n\r\nfor  the  large price increases during  the  year,\r\n\r\nreal  GNP probably grew by only 11 per cent, which\r\n\r\nis  not altogether surprising considering the many\r\n\r\nuncertainties   in   the   international    scene,\r\n\r\nparticularly those caused by the \"oil crisis\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose therefore, as in previous years, to\r\n\r\nsurvey external developments of direct bearing  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's welfare before analysing the State  of\r\n\r\nthe Domestic Economy in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Survey of international Economic Events</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International economic developments in the past\r\n\r\ntwo years have shown by their effects on the world\r\n\r\neconomy   the   strong  interdependence   of   all\r\n\r\ncountries,  but  more especially  of  those  which\r\n\r\ndepend  substantially  upon  international  trade,\r\n\r\ncapital   flows  and  tourist  spending  for   the\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  domestic  output  and  employment.\r\n\r\nSingapore,  by  virtue of its size and  geographic\r\n\r\nlocation,   cannot  help  but  be  influenced   by\r\n\r\nexternal economic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>\"Oil Crisis\"</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of frequency and intensity, the economic\r\n\r\ncrises  of  1973 surpassed those of  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear.  Of  greatest impact was  the  \"oil  crisis\"\r\n\r\nwhich   threatened  the  very  fabric  of  Japan's\r\n\r\nprosperity. The \"economic miracle\" of  its  rapid,\r\n\r\nsustained development post-war was worked  on  the\r\n\r\nincreasingly larger importation of cheap petroleum\r\n\r\nenergy  resources for its industries, mainly  from\r\n\r\nthe  Middle East. Although less dependent  on  oil\r\n\r\nsupplies for its economies, other major industrial\r\n\r\ncountries  including  the  United  Kingdom,   West\r\n\r\nGermany  and  France, and to a lesser extent,  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, were not spared. The warning  signs\r\n\r\nof impending petroleum shortages had appeared some\r\n\r\ntime before but the \"oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrisis\"   was  actually  triggered   off   by   an\r\n\r\nannouncement  by the Arab oil-producing  countries\r\n\r\nin  October  1973  that  oil  would  be  embargoed\r\n\r\nagainst  certain  countries  and  that  production\r\n\r\nwould  be  reduced by 5 per cent every month  with\r\n\r\neffect from the end of September. In November, the\r\n\r\ncutback was proposed to be raised to 25 per  cent,\r\n\r\nbut  was  subsequently relaxed by 10 per  cent  in\r\n\r\nDecember.  The real problem remained, however,  in\r\n\r\nthe  phenomenal  increases in  oil  prices.  Since\r\n\r\nOctober, the posted prices of crude oil (on  which\r\n\r\ntaxes and royalties to the oil-producing countries\r\n\r\nare  calculated) had been escalating,  threatening\r\n\r\noil-consuming countries with catastrophic  balance\r\n\r\nof  payments problems. The unilateral increase  of\r\n\r\n70 per cent in posted prices by the Gulf States in\r\n\r\nOctober 1973 was followed by further increases  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1973,  bringing  the  posted  prices  to\r\n\r\nUS$11.60 per barrel, a four-fold increase compared\r\n\r\nto the pre-October prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production cutback, oil embargo and the high\r\n\r\noil prices accentuated the underlying recessionary\r\n\r\npressures   on   major  industrialised   countries\r\n\r\nalready existing before the oil crisis and it  was\r\n\r\nfeared  that  the  economic growth  of  the  major\r\n\r\nindustrialised   countries   would   be   severely\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Slow-down in the Industrial Countries</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boom conditions which prevailed in the major\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries in the latter half  of  1972\r\n\r\ncontinued  into 1973; the average growth  in  real\r\n\r\nGNP  for  these  countries was estimated  to  have\r\n\r\nincreased by 6.5 per cent as compared with 5.5 per\r\n\r\ncent the previous year. The rate of growth in  the\r\n\r\ntwo    halves    of   1973,   however,    differed\r\n\r\nconsiderably. Real output in the first half of the\r\n\r\nyear  accelerated as expansionary policies adopted\r\n\r\nearlier began to take effect. In the second  half,\r\n\r\nthere   was  a  tapering  off,  with  real  growth\r\n\r\nestimated at 4.5 per cent against 7.2 per cent  in\r\n\r\nthe first half. Several factors contributed to the\r\n\r\nslower  growth rate. To counter inflation, several\r\n\r\ncountries had adopted restrictive measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   subsequently  curbed   growth   as\r\n\r\naggregate  demand moderated. Physical constraints,\r\n\r\nincluding  high rates of capacity utilization  and\r\n\r\ntightness   in  labour  markets,  set  limits   to\r\n\r\ncontinuing  expansion.  The  growth  momentum  was\r\n\r\nfurther  checked  when  the oil  crisis  developed\r\n\r\ntowards the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Worldwide inflation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1973 was also characterised by high prices\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  world. An  excessive  demand  for\r\n\r\nprimary  commodities  reflecting  the  upsurge  in\r\n\r\neconomic   activities  propelled  prices  upwards,\r\n\r\nwhile  a  shortfall  in  agricultural  output  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent   steep  increases   in   food   prices\r\n\r\nreinforced the inflationary momentum. Despite  the\r\n\r\nlater  anti-inflationary policies adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nmajor  industrial countries, prices  continued  to\r\n\r\nspiral.   The   GNP  deflator  (a  commonly   used\r\n\r\nindicator  of  the  inflation rate)  rose  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States by 7.1 per cent in 1973 (against 3.3\r\n\r\nper  cent  in 1972), Japan 10.5 per cent (4.8  per\r\n\r\ncent),  West Germany 6.2 per cent (6.1  per  cent)\r\n\r\nand  the  industrial countries as a whole 6.9  per\r\n\r\ncent  (4.7 per cent). Consumer prices rose at even\r\n\r\nhigher  rates, being 8.4 per cent for  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  (compared to 3.5 per cent in 1972),  Japan\r\n\r\n19.9 per cent (4.8 per cent) and West Germany  8.3\r\n\r\nper  cent (5.8 per cent). The developing countries\r\n\r\nwere not spared, as the rapid price increases were\r\n\r\ntransmitted to them via imports. In 1973, consumer\r\n\r\nprices rose in Hong Kong by something of the order\r\n\r\nof  24  per cent against 6.1 per cent in 1972  and\r\n\r\n9.5  per  cent  against 4.9 per  cent  in  Taiwan.\r\n\r\nSingapore's own rise in consumer prices  over  the\r\n\r\ntwo  years of 22.9 per cent and 2.1 per  cent  did\r\n\r\nnot  therefore appear excessive, having regard  to\r\n\r\nthe fact of our being non-food producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>International Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel with the upswing in economic activity in\r\n\r\n1973,   international  trade   registered   marked\r\n\r\nincreases.  In  terms of volume, world  trade  was\r\n\r\nestimated to have risen by 13.6 per cent  compared\r\n\r\nto 8.6 per cent for 1972. In terms of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue  in  US Dollars, the growth of international\r\n\r\ntrade was even more remarkable with an increase of\r\n\r\nover  37  per cent or more than twice the rate  of\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year.  The  increase  reflects  the\r\n\r\ndepreciation of the US Dollar for the larger  part\r\n\r\nof the year as well as the high rate of inflation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this rapid expansion in world trade  was\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  growing  shortages   of   certain\r\n\r\ncommodities and policies restricting exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be the most significant event in 1973\r\n\r\nrelating  to  international trade set a  hopefully\r\n\r\nopposite trend away from restrictive policies.  At\r\n\r\nthe    Multilateral   Trade   Negotiations   (MTN)\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Meeting in Tokyo, in September  1973,\r\n\r\ncountries  including non-GATT  members  agreed  to\r\n\r\nenter  into multilateral trade negotiations  aimed\r\n\r\nat the expansion and liberalization of world trade\r\n\r\nwith  consideration also to increasing the exports\r\n\r\nof  developing  countries to developed  countries.\r\n\r\nHowever, as progress in the MTN would be dependent\r\n\r\non so many factors, including an early solution to\r\n\r\nthe   problems  of  the  disordered  international\r\n\r\nmonetary system, it was expected that negotiations\r\n\r\nwould  be  extended over a couple  of  years.  Any\r\n\r\nassessment  of  the  outcome  of  the  MTN   would\r\n\r\ntherefore he premature at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other developments of note in 1973 was the\r\n\r\nentry  of Britain into the European Common Market,\r\n\r\nwhen  she  began to align her customs  tariffs  to\r\n\r\nthose   of   the  EEC,  and  to  phase   out   her\r\n\r\nCommonwealth preferences. Singapore's  exports  to\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  were  affected,  though  not\r\n\r\nseverely. As against this, we were able,  together\r\n\r\nwith our ASEAN neighbours, to secure the EEC's in-principle  agreement  for  improvements   to   its\r\n\r\nGeneralised System of Preferences for our exports,\r\n\r\nespecially  in regarding as within the  percentage\r\n\r\nrequirements  of its rules of origin of  products,\r\n\r\nthe    proportion   contributed   by    cumulative\r\n\r\nmanufacture  in  countries  of  the  ASEAN  region\r\n\r\ninstead of by manufature\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin  Singapore  alone.  The  EEC  also\r\n\r\nagreed  to recognise Singapore's special  position\r\n\r\nas  a  Market for primary commodities produced  in\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>International Monetary Situation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Budget Statement last year, I made\r\n\r\nreference  to  1972  as a year  of  high  monetary\r\n\r\ninstability  and  to  the  unsettling  effects  of\r\n\r\ncurrency   developments   in   early   1973.   The\r\n\r\nsubsequent  part of 1973 witnessed no  significant\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the situation. In  fact,  the  oil\r\n\r\ncrisis during its period of buildup and subsequent\r\n\r\ndevelopment  added further elements of uncertainty\r\n\r\nand instability to the monetary situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the devaluation of the US Dollar in\r\n\r\nFebruary for the second time in 14 months and  the\r\n\r\nfloating of major currencies of the world, the  US\r\n\r\nDollar  continued to weaken for some months  after\r\n\r\nits  devaluation and only strengthened towards the\r\n\r\nclosing months of the year. These developments had\r\n\r\ntheir  repercussions on Singapore, for the earlier\r\n\r\nweakness  of  the  US  Dollar  led  to   a   large\r\n\r\nspeculative   capital  inflow,  with  inflationary\r\n\r\neffects  caused  by  domestic over-liquidity.  The\r\n\r\nneed  to  curb  this inflow, coupled with  concern\r\n\r\nover  imported inflation, led to the  decision  to\r\n\r\nfloat  the  Singapore Dollar  on  June  21,  1973.\r\n\r\nSeveral  other countries revalued their currencies\r\n\r\nin 1973 citing the curtailment of inflation as the\r\n\r\nmain   reason.   These  countries   included   the\r\n\r\nNetherlands, Norway, Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Dollar staged a dramatic recovery towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1973 as her balance of trade improved\r\n\r\nand  as her own large domestic energy sources gave\r\n\r\nrise to a general expectation that the US would be\r\n\r\nrelatively  less badly hit by the oil crisis  than\r\n\r\nother industrial countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depreciation of the Japanese yen in late 1973\r\n\r\nresulted  from a deteriorating balance of payments\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the  threat of economic  dislocation\r\n\r\narising from the Arab countries' oil cutbacks.  In\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom, the Pound continued to weaken\r\n\r\nin the face of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest,  and intensified  inflationary\r\n\r\npressures.  The French franc and the Italian  lira\r\n\r\nalso   showed   weakness  stemming   mainly   from\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest and certain political factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These violent changes in major currency exchange\r\n\r\nrates   point  to  the  need  for  an  early   and\r\n\r\nsatisfactory reform of the international  monetary\r\n\r\nsystem.  However, only minor progress was made  by\r\n\r\nthe  IMF and its Committee of Twenty during  1973.\r\n\r\nThe  first outline of reform was presented to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of Governors of the Fund at the IMF  Annual\r\n\r\nMeeting  at  Nairobi in September 1973. Discussion\r\n\r\nof   the  changes  recommended  was  taken  up  by\r\n\r\ntechnical  groups.  Developments  since  the   IMF\r\n\r\nAnnual  Meeting have changed somewhat the  outlook\r\n\r\nfor reform. First, the termination of the 1968 two-tier gold agreement followed by the termination of\r\n\r\nthe  IMF Agreement on South African gold sales  to\r\n\r\nfinance    payments   deficits    indicate    some\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  the desire to  de-sterilize  gold\r\n\r\nreserves for use by central banks and the  urgency\r\n\r\nof  agreeing on the future role of gold  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nreserve  currencies. Secondly, the effect  of  the\r\n\r\nenergy  crisis  would probably  be  to  delay  the\r\n\r\ndeadline  for  Agreement of Reform originally  set\r\n\r\nfor  July  31, 1974 by up to 1\ufffd-2 years. Moreover,\r\n\r\nbalance  of  payments difficulties caused  by  the\r\n\r\nenergy crisis have changed the positions on reform\r\n\r\nwhich  various countries have taken. Some of  them\r\n\r\nwill  no  doubt  re-examine the  effect  on  their\r\n\r\nindividual  interests  of  the  reform  proposals.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  the current economic  uncertainties\r\n\r\nindicate  the desirability of reaching an  interim\r\n\r\nsolution  which  could  be further  developed  and\r\n\r\nmodified  over a period of time until  a  complete\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the international monetary system\r\n\r\nis  achieved. There is some consensus that in such\r\n\r\na system, the existing flexibility for adjustments\r\n\r\nin  exchange  rates would be useful in  cushioning\r\n\r\nany  sudden  shocks caused by extreme  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments  difficulties arising  from  the  massive\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the petroleum import  bill  of  oil-consuming countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>State of the Economy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the domestic economy. We shall look\r\n\r\nfirst  at  Singapore's performance as measured  by\r\n\r\nits Gross Domestic Product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, according to preliminary figures, our\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic Product at current prices grew  at\r\n\r\nthe  record  rate of 22.0 per cent. But inflation,\r\n\r\nwhich  had  over the years been at  very  moderate\r\n\r\nrates  in  Singapore,  even when  it  was  rampant\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  finally caught up with  us.  The  very\r\n\r\nrapid rate of GDP growth is attributable partly to\r\n\r\nthe  large  price  increases in 1973.  Discounting\r\n\r\nthese  increases, the growth of GDP at 1972 prices\r\n\r\nis  estimated at only around 11 per cent, which is\r\n\r\nlower than the average growth of 12.5 per cent for\r\n\r\nthe   past  four  years.  In  analysing  the  main\r\n\r\ncomponents  of  Singapore's  growth  which  I  now\r\n\r\npropose to do, it is necessary, if one is  not  to\r\n\r\nbe   lulled  by  the  apparently  expansive   boom\r\n\r\nconditions of 1973 into a state of euphoria,  that\r\n\r\none  should remember to mentally deflate  all  the\r\n\r\nfigures  which  are  given at  current  prices  to\r\n\r\narrive at the more sober real growth rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Product by Industrial Origin</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector continued to be the\r\n\r\nleading   growth  sector  in  our   economy.   Its\r\n\r\ncontribution   to   the  Gross  Domestic   Product\r\n\r\nincreased to 26.2 per cent in 1973 from  24.6  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1972. The growth in construction  slowed\r\n\r\ndown in 1973, resulting in a slight decline of its\r\n\r\nshare  in total GDP from 7.6 per cent in  1972  to\r\n\r\n6.7  per  cent  in  1973. This  relatively  poorer\r\n\r\nperformance   of  the  construction  sector   was,\r\n\r\nhowever,  compensated by the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nwholesale  and retail trade sector which  grew  at\r\n\r\n25.8  per  cent  compared  to  6.1  per  cent  the\r\n\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industries contributed a total\r\n\r\nof $2,378.8 million to GDP in 1973, an increase of\r\n\r\n$545.6 million or 29.8 per cent (compared with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.2  per cent in 1972 and 25.0 per cent in 1971).\r\n\r\nThis   increase  in  the  value   added   by   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector accounted for about one-third\r\n\r\nof  the total increase of $1,637.9 million in GDP.\r\n\r\nAs a result of its rapid growth, the manufacturing\r\n\r\nshare  of GDP has increased from 16.7 per cent  in\r\n\r\n1967 to 26.2 per cent in 1973, and with its direct\r\n\r\neffect  in generating trade in the imports of  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  exports of manufactures,  and  its\r\n\r\nindirect effect on the services sector, maintained\r\n\r\nits  position  as the most dynamic sector  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries continued to show\r\n\r\nincreasing orientation towards exports and  higher\r\n\r\nquality products. Overall, some 45 per cent of our\r\n\r\ndomestic  manufactures  were  exported.  In  1973,\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  continued  to  be  our  main\r\n\r\nexport market absorbing about half of our domestic\r\n\r\nexports,  as  compared to less than  one-fifth  in\r\n\r\n1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While increases in output and value added were\r\n\r\nregistered in all the major industry groups,  some\r\n\r\nindustries  have continued to be the mainstays  of\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing sector. Petroleum  refining  is\r\n\r\nstill the largest individual industry in the value\r\n\r\nof  its products, its contribution to total output\r\n\r\nof  the  manufacturing sector accounting for  25.6\r\n\r\nper cent. Its rate of growth in output was 9.9 per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1973, compared to 8.2 per cent in  1972.\r\n\r\nHowever, the contribution of petroleum refining to\r\n\r\nthe  total  value  added to  the  product  by  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  process in Singapore  has  declined\r\n\r\nfrom  15.7  per cent in 1972 to 13.4 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1973.    The    electrical   machinery    industry\r\n\r\ncontribution  is  larger than  that  of  petroleum\r\n\r\nrefining, its value added accounting for 23.1  per\r\n\r\ncent of total value added. Petroleum refining  has\r\n\r\nin   this  respect  also  been  overtaken  by  the\r\n\r\ntransport     equipment    industry     (including\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and ship-repairing). The  manufacture\r\n\r\nof  textiles and garments and the more traditional\r\n\r\nfood,  beverages and tobacco industries are  other\r\n\r\nlarge sectors taking 9.8 per cent and 8.9 per cent\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1973 has therefore been a good year for\r\n\r\nSingapore's manufacturing sector, in spite of  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties   prevailing  in  the  international\r\n\r\nmonetary  situation as well as  the  \"oil  crisis\"\r\n\r\nwhich  developed towards the end of the year.

Most of the investment commitments\r\n\r\nwere   for   higher  technology   industries,   in\r\n\r\nparticular  petroleum and petrochemical  products,\r\n\r\nchemical   products,   metal   products/mechanical\r\n\r\nengineering  and  professional,  scientific,   and\r\n\r\nprecision  equipment.  These  industries  together\r\n\r\naccounted   for  86.7  per  cent  of   the   total\r\n\r\ninvestments committed in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Construction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry in 1973 faced shortages\r\n\r\nas  well  as  high prices of labour  and  building\r\n\r\nmaterials,  and managed to grow by  only  9.1  per\r\n\r\ncent  as compared with 39.1 per cent in 1972.  Its\r\n\r\npercentage  share of GDP accordingly dropped  from\r\n\r\n7.6 per cent in 1972 to 6.7 per cent in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private non-residential construction as a whole\r\n\r\nshowed  a  decline of $26.5 million in 1973  or  a\r\n\r\nnegative growth of 6.7 per cent primarily  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  completion  of  work on new  oil  refineries.\r\n\r\nHowever,  other types of nonresidential  buildings\r\n\r\nsuch  as  shopping and office complexes registered\r\n\r\nincreased growth. In the public sector, the growth\r\n\r\nwas  mainly  attributable to the  construction  of\r\n\r\npublic housing which grew by $86.2 million or 34.8\r\n\r\nper   cent.   Some  contribution  to   growth   in\r\n\r\nconstruction  was also provided by the  relatively\r\n\r\nhigh   increase  of  21.2  per  cent  in   private\r\n\r\nresidential construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i> Wholesale and Retail Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution from Wholesale and Retail Trade\r\n\r\nactivities  which had been slowing  down  for  the\r\n\r\npast  five years picked up in 1973, increasing  at\r\n\r\nthe  record  rate of 25.8 per cent which  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  four  times the rate achieved  in  1972  and\r\n\r\nabout 1\ufffd times the average rate of growth for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  1967-73. As a result, the  share  of  this\r\n\r\nsector  in GDP grew from 26.3 per cent in 1972  to\r\n\r\n27.1 per cent in 1973. The main cause for the high\r\n\r\nrate  of  increase in 1973 was the world commodity\r\n\r\nboom,  and  in particular the high produce  prices\r\n\r\nespecially   those  of  rubber   and   other   raw\r\n\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is shown by the fact that of the total\r\n\r\nincrease of $505.8 million in contribution to  GDP\r\n\r\nby  this  sector,  entrepot  trade  accounted  for\r\n\r\n$259.5 million, while domestic trade accounted for\r\n\r\nthe  remaining $246.3 million. The value added for\r\n\r\nthe  entrepot trade sector registered a growth  of\r\n\r\n38.4  per  cent in 1973 (as compared to a negative\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  0.8  per cent in 1972) while  domestic\r\n\r\ntrade  grew by 19.2 per cent (as compared to  10.1\r\n\r\nper cent in 1972). As a result of its large growth\r\n\r\nin  prices, not in volume, the relative  share  of\r\n\r\nthe entrepot trade in the total GDP which had been\r\n\r\nregistering a declining trend since 1969 showed an\r\n\r\nincrease  from 9.1 per cent in 1972  to  10.3  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1973,  while that of the domestic  trade\r\n\r\nsector  in the total GDP showed a marginal decline\r\n\r\nfrom 17.2 per cent to 16.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>External Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of total external trade in 1973 soared\r\n\r\nto new heights with increased prices registering a\r\n\r\nrecord  increase of 36.9 per cent over 1972  which\r\n\r\nmore  than  trebled the 11.8 per cent accomplished\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year  despite  the  world  currency\r\n\r\nproblems and energy crisis. Of the total value  of\r\n\r\n$21,476 million of external trade, $12,562 million\r\n\r\nwas  imports and $8,914 million exports.  For  the\r\n\r\nsecond  year  running, the  rate  of  increase  of\r\n\r\nexports exceeded that for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimports,  the  former reaching a spectacular  45.0\r\n\r\nper  cent  and  the latter 31.7  per  cent.  Both,\r\n\r\nhowever, showed higher rates of growth as compared\r\n\r\nto  14.5  per  cent and 10.1 per cent  over  1972,\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigorous expansion of external trade in 1973\r\n\r\nwas  due  to the larger volume of trade  with  our\r\n\r\ntrading  partners, the significant price increases\r\n\r\nin  most primary commodities such as rubber,  palm\r\n\r\noil  and  timber, as well as the general worldwide\r\n\r\ninflation. High prices of primary commodities also\r\n\r\naccounted  for the very high growth of  re-exports\r\n\r\nin  1973  of  35.3  per  cent  far  exceeding  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding  rate of 1.7 per cent  achieved  the\r\n\r\nprevious year. It is heartening to note that  even\r\n\r\nafter  eliminating the effects of price increases,\r\n\r\ntotal exports still registered an increase of 14.1\r\n\r\nper  cent  which  is as high as that  attained  in\r\n\r\n1972,  while  re-exports  grew  at  6.0  per  cent\r\n\r\n(thrice  the  rate  of 1.7 per  cent  achieved  in\r\n\r\n1972).  On  the other hand, the growth in  imports\r\n\r\nafter discounting for price increases was slightly\r\n\r\nlower  at  some 6.2 per cent compared to 10.1  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  the  previous year. The high  growth  in\r\n\r\nexports  was  made possible mainly  by  the  rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion  in our domestic exports,  the  bulk  of\r\n\r\nwhich  comprises  local manufactures.  At  current\r\n\r\nprices, domestic exports reached $4,791 million in\r\n\r\n1973, representing an increase of 54.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia remained Singapore's leading trading\r\n\r\npartner,  accounting for 17 per cent of our  total\r\n\r\ntrade based on estimates of January-November  1973\r\n\r\nfigures. The currency split, the severance of  the\r\n\r\nrubber  market, the separation of the joint  stock\r\n\r\nexchange   as   well   as  the  establishment   of\r\n\r\nindependent   timber  boards  in   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  emphasised further the  separateness  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  economies. These have had only a minimal\r\n\r\neffect  upon  Singapore's trade  performance.  Our\r\n\r\ntrade  with  Malaysia remained buoyant.  Our  next\r\n\r\nthree   largest  trading  partners  in  order   of\r\n\r\nimportance  continued  to be  the  United  States,\r\n\r\nJapan and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Government Services and Public Utilities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, Government services contributed $559.7\r\n\r\nmillion to GDP, an increase of 18.2 per cent  over\r\n\r\nthat  in  1972.  This rate of  growth  was  almost\r\n\r\ntreble  the previous year's rate of 6.7  per  cent\r\n\r\nand was also higher than the average annual growth\r\n\r\nrate  of  13.3 per cent for the 6-year  period  in\r\n\r\n1967-73. However, the share of Government services\r\n\r\nin  the total GDP was 6.2 per cent for 1973, which\r\n\r\nwas  slightly lower than that of 6.3 per cent  for\r\n\r\n1972.  The  main  increases  were  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nservices   provided  for  internal  security   and\r\n\r\ndefence, education and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public utilities sector maintained a steady\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  of 13.8 per cent which  is  slightly\r\n\r\nhigher  than the 13.1 per cent achieved  in  1972.\r\n\r\nIts  share  of  GDP, however, declined  marginally\r\n\r\nfrom 2.3 per cent to 2.2 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Ownership of Dwellings</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value added by ownership of dwellings to GDP\r\n\r\nincreased  by  about  19.9 per  cent  from  $343.2\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1972 to $411.4 million in  1973.  The\r\n\r\nrelatively  high growth rate was,  however,  lower\r\n\r\nthan  the 24.5 per cent achieved in 1972,  leading\r\n\r\ntherefore to a slight decline in its share of  GDP\r\n\r\nfrom 4.6 per cent to 4.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Services</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of this sector to GDP increased\r\n\r\nby  $315.6  million  or 16.6  per  cent  to  reach\r\n\r\n$2,221.9 million in 1973. The performance of  this\r\n\r\nsector  was attributable mainly to the  growth  of\r\n\r\nthe banking and insurance, and tourism services in\r\n\r\nthe   private   sector,  as  well  as  Government-controlled  enterprises,  such  as  the  Port   of\r\n\r\nSingapore Authority and the Singapore Airlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the Government's effort to promote\r\n\r\nSingapore as a major financial centre of Asia, the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of the banking and insurance  sector\r\n\r\nto GDP increased by $35.3 million or 23.8 per cent\r\n\r\nin   1973.

This high  growth\r\n\r\nrate  is the result of the rapid growth of tourist\r\n\r\narrivals.  The number of visitors to Singapore  by\r\n\r\nair  and  sea passed the million mark in  1973.  A\r\n\r\ntotal  of  1,134,000  visitors (including  149,800\r\n\r\nMalaysian visitors from West Malaysia) arrived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore by air and sea, representing an increase\r\n\r\nof  28.9 per cent over the corresponding total for\r\n\r\n1972.

However,  the\r\n\r\nfastest  growing market was Japan which  generated\r\n\r\n113,400  visitors or an increase of 59.1 per  cent\r\n\r\nover the preceding year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign military expenditure showed an increase\r\n\r\nof  11.4  percent, from $141.1 million in 1972  to\r\n\r\n$157.2 million in 1973. However, as a component of\r\n\r\ntotal GDP, its share declined from 1.9 per cent in\r\n\r\n1972 to 1.7 per cent in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine the other indicator of\r\n\r\neconomic  health, the Gross Domestic  Expenditure.\r\n\r\nIn  1973, estimated Gross Domestic Expenditure  at\r\n\r\ncurrent  prices,  consisting  of  consumption  and\r\n\r\ncapital  formation, showed an increase of $1,655.3\r\n\r\nmillion,  or 21.2 per cent over that in  1972,  to\r\n\r\nreach a total of $9,450.6 million. The higher rate\r\n\r\nof  increase compared to that experienced in  1972\r\n\r\nof  about  15.5  per  cent is to  a  large  extent\r\n\r\nbecause   of   price   increases   especially   in\r\n\r\nconsumption goods. The high growth rate of GDE was\r\n\r\nreflected  mainly in the relatively higher  growth\r\n\r\nof  consumption of goods and services of 25.4  per\r\n\r\ncent   as   compared  to  that  of  fixed  capital\r\n\r\nformation of 11.6 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consumption</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both private and public consumption grew\r\n\r\nconsiderably in 1973, the former by 25.7 per  cent\r\n\r\nfrom  $4,545.1 million in 1972 to $5,714.3 million\r\n\r\nin  1973,  and  the latter by 23.7 per  cent  from\r\n\r\n$905.2  million  to  $1,119.8  million.  Inflation\r\n\r\nespecially in imported food prices was responsible\r\n\r\nfor a large part of this growth. The corresponding\r\n\r\ngrowth  rates in 1972 were 11.2 per cent and  14.5\r\n\r\nper cent, respectively, which had already begun to\r\n\r\nreflect  price  increases although at  much  lower\r\n\r\nlevels than 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every major component of private\r\n\r\nconsumption showed large increases in 1973,  three\r\n\r\ncomponents,  food,  clothing  and  transport   and\r\n\r\ncommunications registered the fastest growth  with\r\n\r\nrates  of more than twice or three times those  of\r\n\r\n1972. Expenditure on food, accounting for 15.8 per\r\n\r\ncent  of total GDE, grew by $366.3 million or 32.5\r\n\r\nper  cent  to  $1,491.9  million,  reflecting  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  rise  in prices of  food,  especially\r\n\r\nrice.  Clothing  expenditure increased  by  $208.2\r\n\r\nmillion  or  31.6  per  cent  to  $867.6  million.\r\n\r\nExpenditure   on   transport  and   communications\r\n\r\nincreased  by $179.5 million or 28.9 per  cent  to\r\n\r\n$801.5  million. Another component of  consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure that more than doubled the growth rate\r\n\r\nin  1972  was expenditure on beverages and tobacco\r\n\r\nwhich  grew by 19.7 per cent to $442.3 million  in\r\n\r\n1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Gross Fixed Capital Formation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building, other construction and works comprised\r\n\r\n46.1 per cent of the total fixed capital formation\r\n\r\nin   1973.  Capital  formation  in  machinery  and\r\n\r\nequipment, largely directed towards expanding  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector, accounted for  another  35.4\r\n\r\nper  cent while expenditure on transport equipment\r\n\r\naccounted for the remaining 18.5 per cent. Of  the\r\n\r\nthree components of capital formation, expenditure\r\n\r\non transport equipment registered the highest rate\r\n\r\nof  increase of 61.8 per cent as compared to  only\r\n\r\n3.9 per cent in 1972. A large part of the increase\r\n\r\nwas  due  to the purchase of aircraft. Expenditure\r\n\r\non buildings,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother construction and works grew by 9.2 per cent,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  disappointingly low compared  with  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  39.9 per cent in 1972.  So  was  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure on machinery and equipment, which,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  declined by 1.6 per cent as compared to  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  19.1  per cent in 1972.  The  dismal\r\n\r\nperformance of these two categories of expenditure\r\n\r\nwas due partly to the fact that the balance of the\r\n\r\nconstruction  work  for  the  oil  refineries  was\r\n\r\ncompleted in early 1973, and partly perhaps to the\r\n\r\nfall  in  investment commitments in  1972  arising\r\n\r\nfrom currency uncertainties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall slower growth of Gross Fixed Capital\r\n\r\nFormation  was experienced by both the public  and\r\n\r\nprivate sectors, which grew by only 15.6 per  cent\r\n\r\n(as compared to 54.8 per cent in 1972) and 9.8 per\r\n\r\ncent (16.0 per cent), respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disquieting that the growth in 1973 should\r\n\r\nhave been stimulated mainly by large increases  in\r\n\r\nconsumption   expenditure  while   gross   capital\r\n\r\nformation  showed relatively low growth. Moreover,\r\n\r\neven  the  low  growth  achieved  in  gross  fixed\r\n\r\ncapital  formation  was  contributed  largely   by\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  transport  equipment   and   only\r\n\r\nmarginally by machinery and equipment. The latter,\r\n\r\nin  fact, registered a decline. Growth in 1973 was\r\n\r\nregrettably  generated substantially by  increased\r\n\r\nconsumption  spending,  which  was  manifested  in\r\n\r\nhigher  imports, while investments  declined  from\r\n\r\n31.5  per cent in 1972 to 28.8 per cent of GDP  in\r\n\r\n1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Inflation and Prices</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I mentioned it briefly in the early part\r\n\r\nof  this  Statement, it is necessary to expand  on\r\n\r\nthe  problem of inflation. This is in the main  of\r\n\r\nexternal origin. The consumer price index rose  by\r\n\r\nan  average of 22.9 per cent in 1973, compared  to\r\n\r\n2.1 per cent in 1972. Food prices rose even faster\r\n\r\nat  35.5  per  cent, compared to 2.7 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1972.  Even  this did not reflect the increase  in\r\n\r\nprice of rice, the staple food of the majority  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Assisted  by a  ban  on  exports  from\r\n\r\nThailand, the retail price of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThai  rice  rose spectacularly from  35  cents  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1972 to $1.07 cents per kati in December\r\n\r\n1973,  or  an  increase of more than three  times.\r\n\r\nThis  was  the  sharpest increase in prices  since\r\n\r\n1960  when  the  consumer price  index  was  first\r\n\r\nintroduced. Most of this inflation was  caused  by\r\n\r\nexternal  forces,  outside our control.  Estimates\r\n\r\nbased on the unit value index for imports revealed\r\n\r\nthat  import prices rose by 12.5 per cent in  1973\r\n\r\nwhile  food import prices rose by as much as  19.1\r\n\r\nper  cent. Actual import price increases have,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, been higher than these indices showed,  as\r\n\r\nthe  estimates have a downwards bias.  As  a  very\r\n\r\nopen  economy which imports most of its  food  and\r\n\r\nraw  material  requirements from other  countries,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is inevitably affected by any  rise  in\r\n\r\ntheir   prices.  Inflation  measured  by  consumer\r\n\r\nprices  in the advanced countries has been running\r\n\r\nat rates of between 8.0 per cent to 20 per cent. A\r\n\r\ngood   indicator  of  the  worldwide  inflationary\r\n\r\npressures  can  be  found in the  World  Commodity\r\n\r\nPrice  Index compiled by the Economist. This shows\r\n\r\nthat  the price of food commodities rose  by  56.5\r\n\r\npercentage   points  during  1973,  a   percentage\r\n\r\nincrease  of 35 per cent over the same period  one\r\n\r\nyear  ago.  The corresponding figures  for  fibres\r\n\r\nwere 109.1 percentage points and 56 per cent,  and\r\n\r\nfor  all items 73.3 percentage points and  51  per\r\n\r\ncent, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, domestic forces worked to accentuate the\r\n\r\n\"imported inflation\". While increases in prices of\r\n\r\nfinished   goods  could  be  expected   from   the\r\n\r\nincreased   cost  of  imports  or  of   production\r\n\r\n(including  higher  materials  import  cost),  the\r\n\r\ninflationary  situation  gave  rise   to   greater\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  profiteering,   and   traders,\r\n\r\nincluding producers, often marked up prices higher\r\n\r\nthan  required  by the increase in costs.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, consumers often over-reacted  to  the\r\n\r\ninflationary   situation  by  panic   buying   and\r\n\r\nhoarding  of  certain  commodities,  creating   or\r\n\r\naggravating a tight supply situation, and  causing\r\n\r\nthe much higher prices they feared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government took whatever measures were\r\n\r\npractical to tackle the inflation problem locally.\r\n\r\nApart  from  monetary and fiscal  policies,  which\r\n\r\nwill be discussed below, the Government thought it\r\n\r\ndesirable  to diversify the sources  of  our  most\r\n\r\nessential  food supplies as well  as  of  the  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials for our industries. It decided to revive\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  for  a  rice  stockpile  which  would\r\n\r\neliminate  any  fear  of  shortages  by   ensuring\r\n\r\navailability of supplies for six months and  would\r\n\r\nresult in more stable prices for consumers.  Also,\r\n\r\nthe   Sugar  Industry  of  Singapore,   in   which\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  an interest, by  prudent  forward\r\n\r\npurchasing, had assured the availability and price\r\n\r\nstability of its sugar supplies. Some panic buying\r\n\r\nof  sugar occurred on one or two occasions  during\r\n\r\nthe  year, but confidence was quickly restored  by\r\n\r\nplentiful supplies being quickly made available by\r\n\r\nthe  Company  at the same unchanged  price  of  45\r\n\r\ncents  per  kati, which it undertook to  maintain.\r\n\r\nMoves  to  stamp out or reduce profiteering  which\r\n\r\nwas undoubtedly the cause of these and other panic\r\n\r\nsituations   have,   so  far,  proved   difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever,  credit  must be given to  the  Community\r\n\r\nCentres  which  helped to sell rice and  publicise\r\n\r\nits availability at reasonable prices, to the NTUC\r\n\r\nfor  the  good start it made in helping to  ensure\r\n\r\nlower    prices   for   consumers   through    its\r\n\r\nestablishment of Welcome Supermarkets, and to  the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  which also opened  its  first  SAFE\r\n\r\nSupermarket. These actions served notice upon  our\r\n\r\nwholesalers  and retailers that their  greedy  and\r\n\r\nanti-social actions will lead to consumer  support\r\n\r\ngoing   permanently  to  public  and  quasi-public\r\n\r\nenterprise  and corporations and affect  adversely\r\n\r\ntheir  system of private enterprise, which if  not\r\n\r\nabused  during periods of shortages, is  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient as it allows for free competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employment and Wages</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch briefly on the employment\r\n\r\nposition  in 1973. It is estimated that more  than\r\n\r\n50,000 new jobs were created in 1973, the bulk  of\r\n\r\nwhich was found in manufacturing (24,400), trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(11,700), transport and communications (4,200) and\r\n\r\nother  services  (7,300). Such a massive  new  job\r\n\r\ncreation  was,  however, not in  accord  with  our\r\n\r\nstrategy  of raising the productivity  of  labour.\r\n\r\nThis  increased by only 3.6 per cent in 1973, less\r\n\r\nthan  half that achieved during 1970-72 which  was\r\n\r\n7.7  per cent, a result which runs counter to  our\r\n\r\nobjective  of  enhancing  efficiency  through  the\r\n\r\nupgrading   of   industries   and   orderly    but\r\n\r\nsignificantly  large enough wage  increases.  Home\r\n\r\nmarket  supply activities (wholesale,  retail  and\r\n\r\nother   services  activities)  in   which   labour\r\n\r\nproductivity  was far below the national  average,\r\n\r\ncontinued to absorb large numbers of workers which\r\n\r\nshould,  for  the  greater part,  have  gone  into\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council increase for the\r\n\r\nlowest paid workers in 1973 was 9 per cent with no\r\n\r\nsetoff  of wage benefits given under normal yearly\r\n\r\nincrements   in  wage  schemes.  But  even   this,\r\n\r\nequivalent  to an increase of about  15  per  cent\r\n\r\nmonthly  wages, was in due course  offset  by  the\r\n\r\nrapid  rise in the cost of living which, according\r\n\r\nto  the  present imperfect cost of  living  index,\r\n\r\naveraged  22.9 per cent last year. Real wages  for\r\n\r\nworkers therefore declined. Furthermore, as prices\r\n\r\nincreased, on the very rough figures available, it\r\n\r\nis  thought that business profit margins  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   sector   as   a   whole   expanded\r\n\r\nconsiderably  over the previous  year.  Therefore,\r\n\r\ndespite  having  to pay the NWC  agreed  increased\r\n\r\nwages  in 1973, employers apparently did not  feel\r\n\r\nsufficiently  induced  to  economise   on   scarce\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Domestic Monetary Situation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now examine our domestic monetary\r\n\r\nsituation.  Singapore continued to grow vigorously\r\n\r\nas  a  financial  centre  in  1973  despite  anti-inflationary policies restraining credit expansion\r\n\r\nand   the  influx  of  US  dollars.  As  Singapore\r\n\r\nexpanded  its  international financial  links  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped   increasing   sophistication   in   its\r\n\r\ndomestic  monetary institutions  and  instruments,\r\n\r\nthe   monetary  and  other  sectors  became   more\r\n\r\ninterdependent.  It is therefore  of  interest  to\r\n\r\nreview the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor developments in the domestic monetary sector\r\n\r\nin the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Institutions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1973 witnessed a growing sophistication in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our money and capital markets, with\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of 11 new banks and one merger,\r\n\r\nbringing the total number of banks as at  the  end\r\n\r\nof December to 54. One local bank (the first local\r\n\r\nbank  to be formed since the establishment of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank of Singapore in 1968)  commenced\r\n\r\noperation  in February 1974. Total bank assets  in\r\n\r\n1973  grew  by  31 per cent which, although  lower\r\n\r\nthan  the  35  per  cent  achieved  in  1972,  was\r\n\r\nattained  in  spite of monetary measures  to  curb\r\n\r\ncredit expansion. Total deposits increased  by  23\r\n\r\nper  cent,  slightly  lower than  in  1972.  Total\r\n\r\nassets  of  finance companies  rose  at  a  higher\r\n\r\nannual growth rate of 33 per cent compared with 23\r\n\r\nper  cent in 1972. Deposits also grew at a  higher\r\n\r\nannual  rate of 25 per cent compared with  24  per\r\n\r\ncent  the  previous  year while  total  loans  and\r\n\r\nadvances  grew at the even higher rate of  45  per\r\n\r\ncent  as  against  28  per  cent  for  1972.  Hire\r\n\r\npurchase  finance and housing loans again absorbed\r\n\r\nthe  major  portion  of finance companies'  credit\r\n\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its fifth year, the Asian Dollar Market\r\n\r\ncontinued to expand rapidly, stimulated partly  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  tax  concessions  and  exchange\r\n\r\ncontrol   liberalisation  measures.  The  market's\r\n\r\nresources  swelled  to over  $15.5  billion  (over\r\n\r\nUS$6.3  billion)  by the end of  1973,  showing  a\r\n\r\ngrowth rate of almost 85 per cent during the year.\r\n\r\nAlthough  in percentage terms this is  lower  than\r\n\r\nthe  growth  rates of previous years, in  absolute\r\n\r\nterms,  the  increase is still the largest  annual\r\n\r\nincrease  so  far  and  the  Asian  Dollar  Market\r\n\r\ncontinued to generate international confidence and\r\n\r\ninterest in Singapore as a financial centre. There\r\n\r\nwere  significant developments also in  the  Asian\r\n\r\nDollar  bond  market with the  floating  in  early\r\n\r\nNovember  1973 of the United Overseas  Bank  US$30\r\n\r\nmillion convertible Asian Dollar bearer bonds, and\r\n\r\nin early December 1973 of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUS$10  million  Asian Dollar bonds by  the  Orient\r\n\r\nLeasing  Company of Japan. Further, Asian Currency\r\n\r\nUnits   (ACUs)  have  been  participating  in   an\r\n\r\nincreased number of consortia loans in 1973. As at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  1973,  17 merchant  banks,  actively\r\n\r\ninvolved in the underwriting business and  in  the\r\n\r\nAsian Dollar Market, supplemented and complimented\r\n\r\nthe services provided by banks. The three discount\r\n\r\nhouses   grew  significantly  with  total   assets\r\n\r\nexpanding more than seven times, from $49  million\r\n\r\nas  at the end of November 1972 to $369 million as\r\n\r\nat the end of December 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1973 saw two events affecting the Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  in  Singapore, namely, the establishment\r\n\r\nof  the  Securities  Industry Council  in  January\r\n\r\n1973, and the break-up of the joint Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia and Singapore in May 1973 along  with\r\n\r\nthe termination of the Currency Interchangeability\r\n\r\nAgreement  with  Malaysia  and  the  new  exchange\r\n\r\ncontrol  measures  imposed by  Malaysia.  However,\r\n\r\npractically all the counters which were listed  in\r\n\r\nthe  previous joint Stock Exchange were listed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Stock  Exchange of Singapore  throughout  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  year. The rate of new  listings  of\r\n\r\nSingapore incorporated companies was also  stepped\r\n\r\nup. The new Stock Exchange therefore went off to a\r\n\r\ngood  start in June 1973 and the current depressed\r\n\r\nstate  of  the  Stock Market must be  regarded  as\r\n\r\ncontemporary  with  similar  conditions  in  major\r\n\r\nstock markets round the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Monetary Policies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the uncertainties of the\r\n\r\ninternational    currency    markets    and    the\r\n\r\ninflationary  pressures within  the  economy,  our\r\n\r\nmonetary  policies were designed to stabilise  the\r\n\r\neconomy without adverse effects on our growth as a\r\n\r\nfinancial   centre.   Anti-inflationary   monetary\r\n\r\nmeasures   implemented  in   1973   included   the\r\n\r\nimposition of a 5 per cent (subsequently raised to\r\n\r\n9  per  cent)  Special Deposit on the net  foreign\r\n\r\nliabilities  of banks, the raising of the  minimum\r\n\r\nreserve ratios for banks and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinance   companies  and  the  increase  of   bank\r\n\r\ninterest  rates for deposits and loans  by  \ufffd  per\r\n\r\ncent  in April and subsequently by another  1  per\r\n\r\ncent in December. Banks were also requested by the\r\n\r\nMonetary Authority of Singapore in early  1973  to\r\n\r\nexercise   caution   in   extending   loans    for\r\n\r\nspeculation  in the then feverishly bullish  stock\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures were intended to counter unstable\r\n\r\ndevelopments   in   the   international   monetary\r\n\r\nsituation which were contributing increasingly  to\r\n\r\nimported  inflation  in  Singapore.  Despite   the\r\n\r\ndevaluation  of the US Dollar for the second  time\r\n\r\nin  February  1973,  the US  Dollar  continued  to\r\n\r\nremain under speculative pressure in international\r\n\r\ncurrency markets. The situation developed into one\r\n\r\nof widespread floating exchange rates in March. As\r\n\r\nthe  major  EEC  currencies and the  Japanese  yen\r\n\r\nfloated upwards against the US Dollar to which the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar was then pegged, an artificially\r\n\r\nlow  external  value resulted  for  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar,   which   thereby   attracted   a    large\r\n\r\nspeculative   inflow   of   foreign   funds   into\r\n\r\nSingapore,   swelling   the   already    excessive\r\n\r\nliquidity in the economy. It was therefore decided\r\n\r\nin  June  1973  to allow the Singapore  dollar  to\r\n\r\nfloat  upwards  to  stem  any  further  inflow  of\r\n\r\nunwanted  funds. The Singapore Dollar went  up  to\r\n\r\n11.8  per cent over par exchange rate with the  US\r\n\r\nDollar  in  July 1973. At present  it  is  ranging\r\n\r\nbetween 2-3 per cent above par.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as an anti-inflationary monetary\r\n\r\npolicy  was adopted, the need to promote a healthy\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the  monetary sector  was  recognised.\r\n\r\nMeasures  to  stimulate the  growth  of  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  included the reduction of  corporate\r\n\r\ntax on income earned on offshore loans from 40 per\r\n\r\ncent  to  10  per  cent,  exemption  from  tax  on\r\n\r\ninterest  received from Asian Dollar bonds  issued\r\n\r\nin Singapore and the waiver of stamp duty on Asian\r\n\r\nDollar bond certificates and promissory notes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissued  by  or in favour of or negotiated  through\r\n\r\nmerchant banks. Exchange controls were liberalised\r\n\r\nin  July  1973 and Singapore residents were  given\r\n\r\npermission to invest up to specified limits in the\r\n\r\nAsian   Dollar  Market.  The  Monetary   Authority\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  provide  the discount  houses  with\r\n\r\nlender  of  last resort facilities with occasional\r\n\r\nintervention  in  the money  market  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsmoothen out unhealthy fluctuations. Priority  was\r\n\r\nalso  given  for the establishment of  a  training\r\n\r\nprogramme to upgrade the skills of bank officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Balance of Payments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of uncertainties in international trade\r\n\r\nand  of  monetary  instability,  our  balance   of\r\n\r\npayments  for  1973  continued to  be  favourable,\r\n\r\nalthough the overall surplus of $333.6 million for\r\n\r\n1973 was lower than the $582.6 million surplus for\r\n\r\n1972.  One  reason which slowed down  the  further\r\n\r\naccumulation  of official foreign reserves  during\r\n\r\n1973  was that in June 1973, the Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\nwas floated upwards to relieve the pressure caused\r\n\r\nby  an  abnormal  influx  of  US  dollars  due  to\r\n\r\ninternational  investors seeking a safer  currency\r\n\r\nthan the then weak US Dollar. Under the regime  of\r\n\r\na   floating   exchange  rate,  there   was   less\r\n\r\nspeculative  incentive to convert  into  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persistent trade deficit, which increased in\r\n\r\n1973  by  $301  million  to  $3,471  million,  was\r\n\r\nfinanced largely, as in the past, by earnings from\r\n\r\nthe services sector as well as by capital inflows.\r\n\r\nRecorded  net earnings from services increased  by\r\n\r\n$102  million to $901 million, largely on  account\r\n\r\nof  higher  net  receipts from investment  income,\r\n\r\ntravel and other transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capital account, net long-term capital\r\n\r\nimports  fell by $117.6 million to $622.5 million.\r\n\r\nGovernment   official  long-term  borrowing   also\r\n\r\ndeclined as there were in 1973 no substantial  new\r\n\r\nloans of the nature of the DM bond or Asian Dollar\r\n\r\nloan  of 1972. Private long-term capital, however,\r\n\r\nincreased by $24.9 million to $577.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Official Reserves</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year ended with Singapore's total official\r\n\r\nassets  standing at $5,707.5 million, an  increase\r\n\r\nof  $776.6 million from the $4,930.9 million  held\r\n\r\nat   the  end  of  1972.  The  healthy  state   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's reserves will stand us in  good  stead\r\n\r\nto  weather  any storms which the oil crisis,  the\r\n\r\nworldwide inflation, or the international monetary\r\n\r\nand balance of payments uncertainties may bring in\r\n\r\n1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>[The Minister for Finance continued --]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be useful for me here to recapitulate\r\n\r\nthe  main  points of this Economic Survey  and  to\r\n\r\nstate what I consider to be its main conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Survey has shown that despite\r\n\r\nadverse    circumstances,   Singapore    performed\r\n\r\nreasonably well in 1973 to achieve the high growth\r\n\r\nin  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices\r\n\r\nof  22.0 per cent. We have not yet constructed  an\r\n\r\naccurate GDP deflator. An estimate of real  growth\r\n\r\nis  around 11 per cent. Our leading growth sector,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, continued to maintain its buoyancy,\r\n\r\ngrowing   at   29.8  per  cent.   External   trade\r\n\r\nregistered a record increase of 36.9 per cent with\r\n\r\nexports  growing at a very high rate of  45.0  per\r\n\r\ncent,  exceeding the growth rate  for  imports  of\r\n\r\n31.7  per  cent. The contribution to  GDP  of  the\r\n\r\nwholesale  and retail trade sector (consisting  of\r\n\r\nentrepot and domestic trade) grew at 25.8 per cent\r\n\r\nwhich was more than four times the growth achieved\r\n\r\nin   1972.  The  value  added  by  entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nincreased at a record rate of 38.4 per cent  while\r\n\r\nthat  of  domestic trade grew by  19.2  per  cent.\r\n\r\nOther  Sectors  registering high  growth  included\r\n\r\ngovernment services (which grew at 18.2 per cent),\r\n\r\npublic  utilities  (13.8 per cent),  ownership  of\r\n\r\ndwellings  (19.9 per cent), banking and  insurance\r\n\r\n(23.8 per cent), and tourism (27.9 per cent).  The\r\n\r\ncontribution  of foreign military  expenditure  to\r\n\r\nGDP   rose   by   11.4  per  cent.  However,   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector showed a poorer  performance,\r\n\r\ngrowing at only 9.1 per cent. The surplus  in  our\r\n\r\nbalance of payments was maintained although at a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduced  sum  of $333.6 million, and our  official\r\n\r\nreserves  ended  the year with a healthy  $5,707.5\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the economy expanded creditably in 1973,\r\n\r\nthere were major weaknesses or adverse factors  in\r\n\r\nour  economic  position. First,  despite  a  full-employment  situation, economic growth  last  year\r\n\r\nwas contributed largely by a quantitative increase\r\n\r\nin  the  labour  force rather  than  by  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity.  More  than  50,000  new  jobs  were\r\n\r\ncreated, representing an increase of 7.7 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the employed labour force. The value-added per\r\n\r\nworker  rose by only 3.6 per cent, less than  half\r\n\r\nthat achieved over the period 1970-1972. This runs\r\n\r\ncounter to the results we expected from our policy\r\n\r\nmeasures   for   an  increasingly  labour   scarce\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the high growth of Gross Domestic\r\n\r\nExpenditure was achieved largely through  a  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  consumption of 25.4  per  cent,  while\r\n\r\ngross  fixed capital formation rose by  only  11.6\r\n\r\nper   cent.   Economic  expansion  was   therefore\r\n\r\nsustained mainly by rising consumption rather than\r\n\r\nby  increased  savings channelled into  productive\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while there was high economic growth,\r\n\r\nthere  were  also strong inflationary  conditions.\r\n\r\nConsumer  prices rose by an average  of  22.9  per\r\n\r\ncent over the previous year, largely the result of\r\n\r\nimporting  worldwide inflation. As  inflation  for\r\n\r\nmany  countries was at equally high or even higher\r\n\r\nrates,  our export competitiveness was fortunately\r\n\r\nnot  jeopardized.  However,  the  rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  severely  affected  the  real  income   or\r\n\r\npurchasing  power of the earnings of our  workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the lower income groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there appeared to be no solution in\r\n\r\nsight    to   the   problems   of   a   disordered\r\n\r\ninternational  monetary  system,  and  the   sharp\r\n\r\nchanges in rates and general uncertainties of  the\r\n\r\nmajor currencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, 1973 saw the beginnings of the\r\n\r\nenergy crisis and the problems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  a reduction in oil supplies and higher  oil\r\n\r\nprices  would bring upon all economic  and  social\r\n\r\nactivities  as  well  as  upon  the  international\r\n\r\nbalance of payments position of different nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning our attention from the economic scene in\r\n\r\n1973 to that of the current year, what can we  see\r\n\r\nregarding  our  prospects for economic  growth  in\r\n\r\n1974?  And  what  are the broad economic  policies\r\n\r\nthat are required to overcome the problems that we\r\n\r\nare likely to face in the coming months?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my earlier budgets, it was possible for me to\r\n\r\ndescribe  external factors such  as  international\r\n\r\ninflationary   conditions,  monetary  instability,\r\n\r\neconomic  stagnation or recession as looming  over\r\n\r\nthe  horizon  or posing a threat. But  they  never\r\n\r\nposed   as  immediate  threats  to  the  continued\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  our  domestic economy.  We  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  in  that,  it  seems  to  us  now,   happy\r\n\r\nposition. These recent external events have become\r\n\r\nfactors unfavourable to our domestic economy.  The\r\n\r\nproblems   carried  over  from  1973   which   are\r\n\r\npresented  by the oil crisis, and by inter-related\r\n\r\nworldwide  inflation,  monetary  instability   and\r\n\r\ncurrency   rate  uncertainties,  restrictions   on\r\n\r\ninternational  trade  and economic  stagnation  or\r\n\r\nrecession,  will  directly  affect  our   internal\r\n\r\nconditions  either for growth or stagnation.  Some\r\n\r\nexamination  of  the  impact  of  these   external\r\n\r\nfactors  on our economy would therefore be  useful\r\n\r\nbefore we examine the purely domestic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>External Factors: The Oil Crisis</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world entered 1974 in a somewhat better state\r\n\r\nin  regard  to oil supplies than it had  dared  to\r\n\r\nhope  during the earlier months of the oil crisis.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of the decision in late December  to\r\n\r\nrestore  production cut-backs from 25 per cent  to\r\n\r\n15  per  cent  of  the September 1973  level,  the\r\n\r\nthreat  of oil starvation in 1974 becomes somewhat\r\n\r\nless likely. However, until a final settlement  is\r\n\r\nreached in the Middle East negotiations for peace,\r\n\r\nit would be premature to assume that oil embargoes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand production cut-backs could not be extended and\r\n\r\nreimposed  or made even more severe  than  in  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of higher oil prices, in any case,\r\n\r\nremains.  The average price of crude  oil  is  now\r\n\r\nwell  over US$8 a barrel, a four-fold increase  in\r\n\r\nprice over the pre-October 1973 rate. It may  rise\r\n\r\neven  higher  depending on  the  price  which  oil\r\n\r\nproducers  may have to pay to the OPEC states  for\r\n\r\nwhat  is known to the industry as \"buy back\"  oil,\r\n\r\noil which producing countries are free to sell  to\r\n\r\nthird  parties  if  they choose.  Some  very  high\r\n\r\nprices indeed have been paid in a few auctions  of\r\n\r\nsuch  oil,  which could eventually  influence  oil\r\n\r\nproducers' and therefore oil consumers' prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High oil prices impose very large burdens on the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  payments of consumer  nations.  These\r\n\r\nburdens on developing nations with limited foreign\r\n\r\nreserves  and  rapidly dwindling foreign  aid  may\r\n\r\nprove  unmanageable. They also add to the  already\r\n\r\nsevere  inflationary pressures affecting  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  economies of the world since the second  half\r\n\r\nof  last  year. Of course, they bring to  the  oil\r\n\r\nproducing countries greatly increased oil revenues\r\n\r\nwhich they are unable to absorb by expenditure  on\r\n\r\neven  massive  development projects at  home.  The\r\n\r\nresulting revenue surpluses accordingly accumulate\r\n\r\nas  very  large  holdings  of  external  reserves,\r\n\r\nestimated  to grow at over $50 billion or  more  a\r\n\r\nyear.   Reserves   of   such   magnitude,   unless\r\n\r\nsterilized in long term asset holdings, are likely\r\n\r\nto cause monetary instability and violent currency\r\n\r\nrate   fluctuations  by  its  movements  in  large\r\n\r\ncapital  flows  and  reflows,  from  currency   to\r\n\r\ncurrency  seeking  the most profitable  or  safest\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These disturbances could have disastrous\r\n\r\ninternational consequences. Much depends upon  how\r\n\r\nthe  large  oil importing and exporting  countries\r\n\r\nreact  to the oil shortages and increased  prices.\r\n\r\nAlready,  there have been sharp movements  in  the\r\n\r\nexchange  rates of major currencies. The date  for\r\n\r\nthe  reform  of the international monetary  system\r\n\r\nwill be set back indefinitely as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  major  developed countries  turn  from  their\r\n\r\ncontemplation    of    its   seemingly    academic\r\n\r\ncomplexities  to  grapple with  their  own  urgent\r\n\r\nmonetary   problems.  An  economic   slowdown   is\r\n\r\nexpected   in  the  major  industrial   countries,\r\n\r\naccentuating  the trend which was developing  even\r\n\r\nbefore  the  oil  crisis. According  to  the  OECD\r\n\r\nestimates, made in December, 1973, the forecast of\r\n\r\ngrowth  has been scaled down in the United  States\r\n\r\nto  only  2 per cent in 1974 (from 6 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1973),  in Japan to 8 per cent (from 11 per cent),\r\n\r\nand  in  West  Germany to 3 per cent (from  6  per\r\n\r\ncent).  If,  in addition, the large oil  importing\r\n\r\ncountries pursue beggar-thy-neighbour policies  by\r\n\r\nresorting  to competitive devaluations to  promote\r\n\r\nexports  and  setting up trade  barriers  to  curb\r\n\r\nimports  and  reduce  their  balance  of  payments\r\n\r\ndeficits,  then  the world will head  for  a  very\r\n\r\nsevere economic depression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are welcome signs of a\r\n\r\ngeneral, if not unanimous, recognition by both oil\r\n\r\nconsuming and producing nations that the  problems\r\n\r\nof  energy shortages and pricing should be  solved\r\n\r\nby  consultation together, and not by the attempts\r\n\r\nof  individual  countries or groups  of  countries\r\n\r\nacting  alone without regard to their  effects  on\r\n\r\nother  countries. There is awareness also  of  the\r\n\r\nneed to avoid a disruption of the world trade  and\r\n\r\nmonetary  system. There even is growing acceptance\r\n\r\nof   a  moral  obligation  by  the  oil  producing\r\n\r\ncountries  to channel part of their oil  surpluses\r\n\r\nthrough  the  IMF, the World Bank or other  multi-national  banks  to the developing  countries,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  to  assist them in their  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments  and  development financing difficulties.\r\n\r\nThere  is  hope therefore of an accommodation  and\r\n\r\nadjustment between oil consuming and oil producing\r\n\r\nnations,  and  of  a new equilibrium  between  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  oil  and of other goods and  services,\r\n\r\nwhich will remove or reduce the present resort  to\r\n\r\nbartering  with  the  oil  producing  nations  and\r\n\r\nrestore  the  trade  and payments  functions  once\r\n\r\nagain to the world economic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an equilibrium must, in any case, eventually\r\n\r\nbe reached even without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeliberate agreement. In the long  term,  the\r\n\r\nprice   of   oil  must  take  into   account   the\r\n\r\npossibilities  and the cost of working  previously\r\n\r\nuneconomic oil deposits, of winning oil from shale\r\n\r\nor  tar  sands, and of discovering large  new  oil\r\n\r\nsources through the intense exploration which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  stimulated in other areas. And it would also\r\n\r\ncertainly  have  regard to the ready  availability\r\n\r\nand  cost of alternative proven sources of energy,\r\n\r\nsuch as nuclear power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore's Economic Situation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such an equilibrium is reached, whether\r\n\r\nsooner  or later, each country must cope, as  best\r\n\r\nit  can and without beggaring its neighbour,  with\r\n\r\nthe   problems  as  they  affect  its   individual\r\n\r\neconomy. How will Singapore manage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One effect of the oil crisis will be on our\r\n\r\nbalance  of  payments. Unless we  can  reduce  our\r\n\r\npresent  domestic consumption of oil of  around  2\r\n\r\nmillion  tons  annually, Singapore  will  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  more  than $290 million this  year  on  oil\r\n\r\nimports for purely domestic consumption equivalent\r\n\r\nto 6 per cent of the value of Singapore's domestic\r\n\r\nexports last year. If there is no serious downturn\r\n\r\nin  international trade, however, we may expect to\r\n\r\nrecover  some  of the increased  cost  of  oil  by\r\n\r\nhigher   export   earnings   on   those   of   our\r\n\r\nmanufactures, including petroleum products,  which\r\n\r\nuse  higher cost oil among their inputs.  We  need\r\n\r\nnot  fear being undersold as our competitors  will\r\n\r\nalso  have to pass on such higher costs  to  their\r\n\r\ncustomers. It is possible also that with the  OPEC\r\n\r\ncountries'    large    oil    revenues     seeking\r\n\r\ninternational investments, capital inflows into  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre such as Singapore  can  be  more\r\n\r\nthan  sustained. However, if, by a combination  of\r\n\r\nadverse circumstances, we should end the year with\r\n\r\nan  overall  adverse balance of payments  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time in many years, we shall, in any  case,\r\n\r\nhave  more than adequate reserves to tide us  over\r\n\r\nthe   period  until  stability  returns  into  the\r\n\r\ninternational economic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effect will be on the already serious\r\n\r\ninflation in Singapore. The oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry has estimated that an increase of US$1 in\r\n\r\nthe  price  of crude oil would raise the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  or the rate of inflation by 1 per cent  in\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries. Though the impact  would\r\n\r\nbe  less  for a country like Singapore,  there  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  to be any relief for us from the  burden\r\n\r\nof imported inflation this year or from the direct\r\n\r\neffects  of  the higher price of oil  on  our  own\r\n\r\nmanufactures. Inflation will, unfortunately,  work\r\n\r\nits relentless way into our economy through higher\r\n\r\nprices  in  partially oil based products  such  as\r\n\r\nchemical  fertilisers for food; steel, cement  and\r\n\r\nother   building   materials;   paper,   synthetic\r\n\r\ntextiles,   plastics  and  many  other   essential\r\n\r\ncommodities  we  have to import, and  through  the\r\n\r\nescalating   costs   of   transportation,   public\r\n\r\nutilities  and other services. In spite of  better\r\n\r\nweather and better harvests, there appears also no\r\n\r\nsign  as yet of any substantial drop in the prices\r\n\r\nof  food grains or other agricultural commodities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  exporters are holding back sales to  keep\r\n\r\nup  high prices and importers are buying more than\r\n\r\ntheir  immediate  needs to store  against  a  poor\r\n\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little one can do about such high\r\n\r\nimport prices except to ensure that these are  not\r\n\r\naggravated  by manipulation and profiteering.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  take measures  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\neffects  of inflation. Tariffs will be continually\r\n\r\nreviewed  for the purpose of removing or  reducing\r\n\r\nthem,  where  possible, to  curb  inflation.  More\r\n\r\nconsumer     cooperatives     and     Welcome-type\r\n\r\nsupermarkets  will be helped to set themselves  up\r\n\r\nin  the  main population centres. But, I  strongly\r\n\r\nurge  that  our  people  should  restrain  demand,\r\n\r\nrefraining from hoarding and purchasing in advance\r\n\r\nof their normal requirements. People should become\r\n\r\nmore  selective  in their shopping  for  essential\r\n\r\ncommodities.   Cutting   down   expenditures    on\r\n\r\nunnecessary purchases and increasing their savings\r\n\r\nand  channelling them into productive investments,\r\n\r\nour people can help themselves to fight inflation.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time,  traders caught  manipulating\r\n\r\nsupplies  to raise prices, retailers giving  short\r\n\r\nweight of rice or bread will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind  their  business  cut off  by  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nsupplies or licences to import or export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, price controls are not suitable as a\r\n\r\nmeans  of curbing inflation in a very open economy\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore's. Even large countries, like  the\r\n\r\nUSA which is less dependent upon imports and which\r\n\r\nhas adopted the system of price controls, have had\r\n\r\nonly  modest  and  temporary  success  in  curbing\r\n\r\ninflation. When controls continue beyond realistic\r\n\r\nlimits,  goods  disappear. So  when  controls  are\r\n\r\nlifted,  another  bout  of large  price  increases\r\n\r\nimmediately occurs. My view is that it  is  better\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore to let market forces  operate.  But\r\n\r\nchecks  will be mounted to ensure that wholesalers\r\n\r\nwill  deal  fairly with the public, and themselves\r\n\r\nhelp the Government to check the manipulation of a\r\n\r\nminority,  for  which they, as a  class,  get  the\r\n\r\nblame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of inflation is a complex one with\r\n\r\nimplications  on  growth.  If  the  wrong  set  of\r\n\r\nsolutions  is  implemented, economic  growth  will\r\n\r\nsuffer,  generating unemployment which is  a  more\r\n\r\nserious problem than that of an inflation. As long\r\n\r\nas  the  economy  is  able through  larger  export\r\n\r\nearnings to bear the increase in import prices due\r\n\r\nto  inflation,  we shall be able to  maintain  our\r\n\r\neconomic  growth. There may be need,  however,  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  the adverse effects of inflation  on  the\r\n\r\nreal  wages of workers and this will no  doubt  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  due course in the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil's  recommendations on wage increases  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fiscal and Monetary Policies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation of rising prices, the Government\r\n\r\nis  faced with a difficult policy choice. There is\r\n\r\nan   inherent  conflict  between  the   need   for\r\n\r\nincreased expenditure to sustain expansion of  the\r\n\r\neconomy   and   the   equal  need   to   alleviate\r\n\r\ninflationary    pressures   by   curbing    public\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  And in deciding policy  we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake   note  of  the  economic  recession   widely\r\n\r\nforecasted  in America and the industrial  centres\r\n\r\nin the latter part of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A policy of cutting down public expenditure\r\n\r\nindiscriminately would sacrifice growth,  and  not\r\n\r\nhelp  reduce,  to  any significant  extent,  price\r\n\r\nincreases.  The best policy in these circumstances\r\n\r\nis  to  dampen increases in recurrent expenditure,\r\n\r\nbut  at  the  same  time, to  allow  in  full  all\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure required for the expansion\r\n\r\nof   productive  capacity  essential  to  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  The  budgets of Government,  and  of  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, will therefore  be  scrutinised\r\n\r\nboth  for their growth potential as well as  their\r\n\r\ninflationary impact. The measures we  take  should\r\n\r\nhave  the  beneficial effect of increasing  public\r\n\r\nsavings and investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monetary policy will likewise balance the\r\n\r\nobjective  of achieving sustained economic  growth\r\n\r\nand the need to dampen inflationary pressures. The\r\n\r\nexisting  anti-inflationary monetary  policy  will\r\n\r\nnot be relaxed, but consideration will be given to\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  minimising as far as possible  any\r\n\r\nfinancial  constraints  to  economic  growth.   To\r\n\r\nreinforce  this objective, a package  of  monetary\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  be  implemented  by  the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Authority is consulting with the\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Banks to raise interest  rates  on\r\n\r\ndeposits to encourage higher savings. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime  banks'  prime lending rate  will  be  raised\r\n\r\nslightly to check wasteful spending as well as  to\r\n\r\nalign it with comparable interest rates to reflect\r\n\r\nthe real cost of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Special Deposit ratio which was\r\n\r\nmodified from 9 per cent to 5 per cent in December\r\n\r\n1973  will  be  reduced to  zero  per  cent.  This\r\n\r\nSpecial  Deposit requirement was imposed to  check\r\n\r\nthe  large  influx of foreign funds in early  1973\r\n\r\nand  has  served  its purpose. The funds  released\r\n\r\nwill   be   available  for  financing   productive\r\n\r\nactivities  within  a system of  selective  credit\r\n\r\ncontrol administered by the Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Authority would also be ready to\r\n\r\nconsider some reduction in the reserves ratios  of\r\n\r\nbanks and finance companies provided the resources\r\n\r\nare  used  to  finance investment  and  productive\r\n\r\nactivities in priority sectors in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy. Banks and finance companies will have  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  monthly  data  on  their  loan  operations\r\n\r\nrelating  to  changes  and  usage  of  credit   by\r\n\r\npurposes.   This  information  will   be   closely\r\n\r\nmonitored  by the Authority within a framework  of\r\n\r\nceilings  and  guidelines for  credit  to  various\r\n\r\nsectors.  Where  credit is being  channelled  into\r\n\r\nproductive activities the Authority will  be  more\r\n\r\nflexible. But credit for inflationary spending and\r\n\r\nspeculation will be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these efforts, we may still find\r\n\r\ninflation  too obstinate a disease to  respond  to\r\n\r\nlocal  treatment.  We need not  be  overcome  with\r\n\r\ngloom  if  these unsettling economic circumstances\r\n\r\npersist.  Nor  should we be  dismayed  if  in  the\r\n\r\nlatter  part  of  this year, as a  consequence  of\r\n\r\ninflation  and the inability of the major  nations\r\n\r\nto  keep up demand at inflated prices, a recession\r\n\r\nof  serious proportions sets in. This is  not  the\r\n\r\nfirst nor will it be the last time that we have to\r\n\r\nmeet   the   challenge   of  adverse   conditions.\r\n\r\nSingapore  overcame successfully even more  severe\r\n\r\ndisruptions like separation from Malaysia in  1965\r\n\r\nand  the  rundown of British Bases  in  1968.  Our\r\n\r\nsurvival  depends, as then, upon a robust approach\r\n\r\nto  life, that the world does not owe us a living.\r\n\r\nNothing is for free. Hence, the virtues of  thrift\r\n\r\nand  hard work and our resilience and capacity  to\r\n\r\nadapt  to  changing circumstances saw us  through.\r\n\r\nThe  question is whether we have not already  been\r\n\r\nsoftened  by  the  increasing  affluence  now   so\r\n\r\nclearly  and  even  delightfully  evident  in  the\r\n\r\ncolourful dress and appearance of our bright young\r\n\r\nthings. This change in life style is shown in  our\r\n\r\nsombre statistics indicating a propensity to  save\r\n\r\nless and consume more. With annual economic growth\r\n\r\nno  longer  to be expected as of right,  we  shall\r\n\r\nhave to rely on the qualities of hard work, thrift\r\n\r\nand grit to see us through a difficult time ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, we are in better shape than we were in\r\n\r\n1965  or  1968  to  deal with  a  severe  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.  First,  there  is now  full,  or  perhaps\r\n\r\noverfull, employment to cushion the shock of any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  recession  and  retrenchment.   If   our\r\n\r\neconomy does not grow quite as fast as in the past\r\n\r\nor even if it stagnates for some time, we need not\r\n\r\nfear,  as  we  did  in the past,  the  spectre  of\r\n\r\nwidespread unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our economy is now more diversified\r\n\r\nthan  it  was  in the Sixties. Being more  broadly\r\n\r\nbased   on   manufacturing,  trade,  construction,\r\n\r\ntransportation,  tourism and a  growing  financial\r\n\r\nsector,  the  economy should  be  better  able  to\r\n\r\nwithstand a recession in any one sector or market.\r\n\r\nSpecific anti-recession measures could be  put  in\r\n\r\nhand,  if  necessary.  For example,  the  enormous\r\n\r\nbacklog  of Housing Board building could  take  up\r\n\r\nany  slack of building activity as well as provide\r\n\r\njob  opportunities for those thrown out  of  work.\r\n\r\nOther public sector projects can also be used  for\r\n\r\nthe  same  purposes. Short of a  disastrous  world\r\n\r\nslump, which economic forecasts consider unlikely,\r\n\r\nSingapore should be able to earn a modest, if  not\r\n\r\ncomfortable, livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, however, improve our ability to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  present  circumstances.  What  specific\r\n\r\nremedies can we devise in each sector?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leading growth sector of our economy,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   will  continue  to   receive   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's full encouragement and support either\r\n\r\nfor  new  industries or for expansion of  existing\r\n\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of industries must finally lie with\r\n\r\nthe  investors or entrepreneurs. But the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   its   agency,   the    Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  will  always  give  help   on\r\n\r\npreferred   new  industries  or  assist   in   the\r\n\r\nupgrading of existing ones which take into account\r\n\r\nSingapore's existing and future factor endowments.\r\n\r\nWe   shall  press  forward  with  our  policy   of\r\n\r\npromoting    skill-intensive,   high    technology\r\n\r\nindustries.  This policy is showing  results.  The\r\n\r\nprogress  in  upgrading industries can  be  gauged\r\n\r\nfrom the expected labour productivity (measured by\r\n\r\nvalue added per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker)  of  the  new  industries.  It  has   been\r\n\r\nestimated that the average value added per  worker\r\n\r\nof the major new projects under implementation and\r\n\r\nin  the pipeline will show a 120 per cent increase\r\n\r\nover  that of similar industry groups in 1973.  We\r\n\r\ndo  well  therefore to concentrate our efforts  on\r\n\r\nthe  industrial  promotion of these  higher  value\r\n\r\nadded  industries  and to offer  them  appropriate\r\n\r\nincentives.  Moreover, our strategy  of  enhancing\r\n\r\nthe value added by our manufacturing operations is\r\n\r\nentirely  appropriate in the current situation  of\r\n\r\nrising freight, fuel and raw material costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High technology industries require a large supply\r\n\r\nof  skilled  workers.  While the  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue for the time being to be liberal  in  its\r\n\r\nimmigration  policy  towards skilled  workers,  an\r\n\r\nadequate solution can be provided only by creating\r\n\r\nour  own ample supply of trained workers. We  will\r\n\r\naccordingly  continue  to  make  substantial  sums\r\n\r\navailable  for  massive technical  and  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining,  and the Government has earmarked  $12.3\r\n\r\nmillion  for such training in FY 1974 compared  to\r\n\r\n$9.7  million  in  FY  1973. With  the  successful\r\n\r\nimplementation of our industrial training  policy,\r\n\r\nour  dependence on immigration of foreign  workers\r\n\r\nfor   growth  can  then  be  scaled  down  to   an\r\n\r\nacceptably modest level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board now has under its\r\n\r\nadministration  various  training  programmes  for\r\n\r\nworkers. In industrial training, we have the joint\r\n\r\ntraining  programme, overseas training  programme,\r\n\r\nindustrial  development  scholarship  scheme   and\r\n\r\napprenticeship training scheme. There is also  the\r\n\r\nnew   industrial  training  subsidy   scheme   for\r\n\r\nsophisticated  industries  which  I  announced  in\r\n\r\nOctober   1973.  The  response  to  this  training\r\n\r\nsubsidy  scheme  has been very good.  So  far,  42\r\n\r\ncompanies have expressed interest and 12 have  put\r\n\r\nup concrete proposals for training. Moreover, last\r\n\r\nyear,  53  trainees were sent overseas  under  the\r\n\r\noverseas  training  programme and  177  machinists\r\n\r\nunderwent   training  under  the  joint   training\r\n\r\nprogramme. All the training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes I have mentioned are regularly reviewed\r\n\r\nso that our targets of building up and providing a\r\n\r\nlarge  reservoir of skilled workers can be met  in\r\n\r\nthe most efficient way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our industrialisation gathering momentum, I\r\n\r\nexpect  that  in 1974 our strategies in  upgrading\r\n\r\nindustries  and providing adequate incentives  and\r\n\r\ntraining  subsidies  for  manufacturers  will   be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to cushion any decline in  performance\r\n\r\nby the manufacturing sector caused by the economic\r\n\r\nslowdown   in   the  industrial   countries.   Our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries should be  able  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe challenges posed by the energy crisis, without\r\n\r\ntoo serious a dislocation of their operations. The\r\n\r\nhigh  oil  prices should be reflected in terms  of\r\n\r\nhigher  prices  for our industrial  goods.  In  an\r\n\r\ninflation-prone world, when other countries with a\r\n\r\nhigher base in manufacturing costs are expected to\r\n\r\ninflate by 7-12 per cent in 1974 (depending on the\r\n\r\ncountries  concerned),  our  competitive  edge  in\r\n\r\noverseas  markets  will be maintained,  as  buyers\r\n\r\nwill   still   find  Singapore  goods   relatively\r\n\r\ncompetitive even at the new prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employment, Productivity and Wages</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation of full employment, labour\r\n\r\nproductivity   through   the   modernisation   and\r\n\r\nupgrading   of  industries  can  be  promoted   by\r\n\r\nappropriate  wage policies, formulated  to  induce\r\n\r\nemployers to be more efficient in their  usage  of\r\n\r\nscarce  labour. A desirable secondary  product  of\r\n\r\nsuch  policies  is  to help workers,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose in the lower income brackets, to recover  by\r\n\r\nwage increases the loss in their real incomes  due\r\n\r\nto inflation. But these wage increases would still\r\n\r\nhave  to  be related to productivity increases  to\r\n\r\navoid generating further inflationary pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade industries and raise productivity,\r\n\r\nwages  must  be made sufficiently high to  attract\r\n\r\nlabour  from  low productivity sectors  which  are\r\n\r\nless  able  to  afford such wages  into  the  high\r\n\r\nproductivity sectors. There need not be any  undue\r\n\r\nconcern that somewhat higher increases in wages in\r\n\r\n1974   for  Singapore  workers  will  affect   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin    overseas   markets.   According    to    the\r\n\r\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO) Year  Book\r\n\r\nof  Statistics 1972, manufacturing wages in  Korea\r\n\r\nsince  1967 have gone up by 37.8 per cent  and  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong by 14 per cent. These countries are  our\r\n\r\nmajor competitors. On the other hand, according to\r\n\r\nour own Census of Industrial Production, Singapore\r\n\r\nexperienced increases in wages in manufacturing by\r\n\r\nmuch  less  over  the same period. Moreover,  when\r\n\r\ncompared  to the developed countries  to  which  a\r\n\r\nmajor portion of our exports are destined, that is\r\n\r\nthe  United States of America, the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nJapan  and  West  Germany,  workers  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nobtained much lower wages, compared to workers  of\r\n\r\nthe United States of America who draw six times as\r\n\r\nmuch,  of  the United Kingdom 3.6 times, of  Japan\r\n\r\n3.1  times  and of West Germany 3.7 times.  Higher\r\n\r\nwage  increases for Singapore in 1974 will  narrow\r\n\r\nthis  differential only very slightly,  given  the\r\n\r\nwage cost spirals in these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater concern would be the risk of\r\n\r\nunemployment considered in the economy as a whole,\r\n\r\nwhich we must weigh against the beneficial effects\r\n\r\nof  a  higher  wage rise. Although  employers  are\r\n\r\nexpected to pass on at least a part of their  wage\r\n\r\nincreases in prices to their customers,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  the  possibility  of  an  undesirably  high\r\n\r\ndegree  of  unemployment.  In  our  labour  scarce\r\n\r\neconomy, however, a slackening only of the present\r\n\r\noverfull employment situation could be beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the international monetary uncertainties\r\n\r\nand  the  oil  crisis, Singapore's external  trade\r\n\r\ngrew  at  a record rate in 1973. In 1974, however,\r\n\r\nthe  deflationary policies already adopted by  the\r\n\r\nmajor   industrial  countries  to  curb  inflation\r\n\r\ncoupled with the adverse effects of the oil crisis\r\n\r\nand    the   consequent   uncertainties   of   the\r\n\r\ninternational situation are expected to slow  down\r\n\r\nthe  economic growth of these countries  in  1974.\r\n\r\nWorld trade is therefore unlikely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  show the boom conditions it exhibited in 1973,\r\n\r\nand  the economic slowdown of our trading partners\r\n\r\nwill  equally affect our trade with them.  On  the\r\n\r\nbrighter side, however, our neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nin  the  South-East Asian region especially  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries are relatively unhurt by the oil  crisis\r\n\r\nand  will continue to enjoy high prices for  their\r\n\r\nprimary exports. Their buoyant economies should be\r\n\r\na plus in our relations with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Middle East, it is not unlikely that\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for a settlement of the Arab/Israeli\r\n\r\nconflict  can progress sufficiently for  the  Suez\r\n\r\nCanal soon to reopen. In that event, international\r\n\r\ntrade  would  most likely recover  a  lot  of  its\r\n\r\nbuoyancy.  On balance, therefore, it would  appear\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be some slowdown in world  trade\r\n\r\nbut this should not be so serious as to generate a\r\n\r\nworld  depression,  and we can remain  hopeful  of\r\n\r\nsurmounting  without  undue hardship  the  adverse\r\n\r\neffects of such a slowdown in world trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Services Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must continue to improve its\r\n\r\ncapabilities  as  a  brain  services  centre.  Our\r\n\r\nincreasingly  sophisticated  financial,   banking,\r\n\r\ninsurance,     transport    and     communications\r\n\r\ninstitutions should take on a regional, and even a\r\n\r\nglobal  role. Among special developments  relevant\r\n\r\nto  the  Services  Sector  in  1974  will  be  the\r\n\r\nsituation  caused  by  the oil  crisis  which  has\r\n\r\nintensified  the  search for oil. Singapore,  with\r\n\r\nits  capacity for building oil drilling  rigs  and\r\n\r\nproduction  platforms  and  its  offshore   supply\r\n\r\nbases,  should  be  well  placed  to  service  any\r\n\r\nincrease in offshore prospecting activities in the\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asian  or even in  the  Pacific  Basin\r\n\r\narea. With higher prices for oil and other primary\r\n\r\ncommodities, the economies of ASEAN are likely  to\r\n\r\nremain   buoyant.  This  buoyancy  will  stimulate\r\n\r\ndemand   on   services,  especially  in   economic\r\n\r\nengineering supply and construction services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1974 therefore poses a number of new challenges\r\n\r\nfor Singapore. High oil prices will exert pressure\r\n\r\non the Balance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Payments of Singapore as it will do on those of\r\n\r\nother  oil importing countries. Inflation and  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties in the international monetary system\r\n\r\nwill  continue to plague world economies with  the\r\n\r\nresult   that  Singapore,  like  all   the   major\r\n\r\nindustrial countries, is likely to experience some\r\n\r\ndeceleration  in the pace of its economic  growth.\r\n\r\nTo  meet these new difficulties, concerted efforts\r\n\r\nby  employers and workers, producers, traders  and\r\n\r\nconsumers must match the Government's own  efforts\r\n\r\nto   achieve   continued  economic  growth,   with\r\n\r\ninflation kept down as low as possible. If we  all\r\n\r\npull  together, in the first half of this year  at\r\n\r\nleast,  we  may  still be able to achieve  a  real\r\n\r\ngrowth rate of some 10 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers and employees alike must move\r\n\r\nvigorously  also  towards productivity  increases.\r\n\r\nWastage  must be reduced both in the home  and  in\r\n\r\nour factories to counter the growing shortages  in\r\n\r\nindustrial  raw  materials  and  consumer   goods.\r\n\r\nConsumers,  both  industrial and domestic,  should\r\n\r\neconomise  on  their  consumption  of   fuel   and\r\n\r\nelectricity,  so  as  to make more  available  for\r\n\r\nindustries.   We   should  cut  down   unnecessary\r\n\r\nconsumption  especially on luxury goods.  Thus  we\r\n\r\nshould  correct  the unhealthy situation  of  last\r\n\r\nyear  when consumption expenditure registered very\r\n\r\nhigh  increases and surpassed the growth of  fixed\r\n\r\ncapital formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Budget</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the Estimates. But\r\n\r\nfirst,  I should like to explain some of the  more\r\n\r\nimportant  presentational changes which have  been\r\n\r\nmade  in  this  year's Estimates.  Last  year  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the  Main  Estimates  which   were\r\n\r\nentered  for \"Contributions\" to various  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and  non-profit making  organisations  not\r\n\r\ndirectly  responsible to the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwere deleted from the Ministry of Finance Head  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure   and  shown,  it  was  thought   more\r\n\r\nappropriately,   under   the   Ministries   having\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  the  functional  policy   and\r\n\r\nperformance  of  these  bodies.  This  year,   for\r\n\r\nsimilar reasons, the provisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentered  for  \"Loans\" to these bodies  which  were\r\n\r\nstill  shown  last  year  under  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  Head  have  also  been  devolved  to  the\r\n\r\nrespective  Ministries.  However,  the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of the loans will continue to be set as\r\n\r\nbefore  by the Ministry of Finance, which was  the\r\n\r\nreason  for  retaining  the provisions  previously\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry of Finance Head.  With  these\r\n\r\nchanges,  the  share  of total Budget  Expenditure\r\n\r\nproperly  allocable  to the  Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\nwould also now be more correctly shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years' Estimates, for comparison with\r\n\r\nthe  new  Budget requests, the provisions  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   Budget   were  reproduced   exactly   as\r\n\r\nParliament  had approved them. Our experience  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that there are invariably organisational\r\n\r\nchanges  during the year such as the establishment\r\n\r\nof  new  units, the merging of units, the transfer\r\n\r\nof   functions  from  one  unit  to  another,  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of units into statutory  boards,  etc.\r\n\r\nThe  figures  for  the current financial  year  as\r\n\r\napproved  by  Parliament,  therefore,  no   longer\r\n\r\nreflect the existing organisational structure, and\r\n\r\nto  that  extent, comparisons between the  figures\r\n\r\nfor  the  new  financial year and  those  for  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  financial year shown exactly as  approved\r\n\r\nby  Parliament will clearly not be valid. From  FY\r\n\r\n74,  therefore,  I propose to show more  correctly\r\n\r\nthe  current financial year's figures so that they\r\n\r\ncan  be  directly and therefore more  conveniently\r\n\r\ncompared with the new financial year's figures. In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  for  example, we have  some  means  of\r\n\r\nassessing  the changes in the proposed  provisions\r\n\r\nfor  FY  74 requested under the two new  Heads  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure,  namely,  \"Primary  Production\"   and\r\n\r\n\"Police\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned in my last Budget Address that my\r\n\r\nofficials were exploring the possibility of a  re-structuring  of subheads in the Main Estimates.  A\r\n\r\nset  of  proposals was subsequently developed  and\r\n\r\npresented  to  the  Estimates  Committee  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament,  and, I am pleased to say,  agreed  in\r\n\r\ntoto.  These  proposals  have  given  this  year's\r\n\r\nEstimates a new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook  and I hope, Members will also find it a more\r\n\r\nuseful and helpful budget document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, all subheads are now coded and grouped\r\n\r\ninto two major categories, namely, Expenditure  on\r\n\r\nManpower  (EOM)  and  Other Operating  Expenditure\r\n\r\n(OOE).  In  the  EOM category only  political  and\r\n\r\nsuperscale posts are shown in detail. Other  posts\r\n\r\nare  shown by Division of service so that the user\r\n\r\nof   the  Estimates  readily  gets  a  picture  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  cost and manpower mix rather than  feels\r\n\r\nlost  in  a myriad of details. Those who need  the\r\n\r\ndetails  may,  however, find them  in  a  separate\r\n\r\nEstablishment  List which has  been  tabled  as  a\r\n\r\nCommand Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The codification of subheads will facilitate\r\n\r\nstudies   of  like  Government  expenditure.   For\r\n\r\nexample,    present   circumstances    call    for\r\n\r\nsurveillance  over the consumption  of  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity by all departments and all the figures\r\n\r\nof expenditure by individual departments on public\r\n\r\nutilities  can  now be aggregated  easily  because\r\n\r\nthey come under the same code. If the increase  in\r\n\r\nsuch  expenditure is too rapid it is  possible  to\r\n\r\ntrace  more  easily than before, those departments\r\n\r\nwhich are principally responsible for causing  the\r\n\r\nincrease. Similarly, studies can be carried out in\r\n\r\nrespect  of inputs such as maintenance of vehicles\r\n\r\nand   vessels,   rations  and   diets,   printing,\r\n\r\ntransportation, etc. Within limits,  two  or  more\r\n\r\ndepartments or sub-divisions of a department doing\r\n\r\nsimilar  work  should  have similar  patterns  and\r\n\r\nscales of expenditure in relation to those inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst such an input-oriented view on expenditure\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to detect waste or inefficiency  in\r\n\r\norganisational units, it is equally useful to  see\r\n\r\nhow funds are allocated to the major functions  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  such  as  defence,  justice,   health,\r\n\r\ntransport and communications, etc. Such a function-oriented    approach    transcends    departmental\r\n\r\ndelineation and is possible again because  of  the\r\n\r\ncodification  of the subheads. The coverage  of  a\r\n\r\nparticular   function  can   be   specified   with\r\n\r\nreference to the sub-head\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncodes  which generally will not change  from\r\n\r\none year to another. In fact the various Divisions\r\n\r\nand   departments  which  have  to  prepare   past\r\n\r\nexpenditure  figures, study budget allocations  or\r\n\r\nestimate  future  expenditures have  agreed  to  a\r\n\r\ncommon  functional classification  of  expenditure\r\n\r\nand  this  has  been made possible  largely  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the codification of subheads. A  fuller\r\n\r\npresentation  of  expenditure is now  possible  as\r\n\r\nthis year's Memorandum on the Main and Development\r\n\r\nEstimates for FY 74 shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the new format of the Estimates has already\r\n\r\nbrought  benefits. My officials will  continue  to\r\n\r\nsearch for improvements to the Estimates format so\r\n\r\nthat  more  information may be made available  for\r\n\r\nmanagement purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Budget Cornerstones</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government budget for FY 74 is designed to\r\n\r\nrestrain  operating expenditure and  channel  more\r\n\r\nfunds into desirable development projects. Revenue\r\n\r\nis  expected to reach $2,035.4 million  in  FY  74\r\n\r\nowing  to  the  satisfactory growth  rate  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  in  1973. Total provision for expenditure\r\n\r\nin  FY  74  under the Main Estimates  is  $2,299.5\r\n\r\nmillion of which $480 million is a transfer to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Fund.  Such  a  large  transfer   is\r\n\r\nrequired   because   the   total   provision   for\r\n\r\nexpenditure under the Development Estimates in  FY\r\n\r\n74  is $1,561.6 million or 32.6 per cent more than\r\n\r\nthat in FY 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced as we are with inflation, all Ministries\r\n\r\nand departments are expected, indeed required,  to\r\n\r\nscrutinise their operating expenditure patterns to\r\n\r\ncut  out  waste or unnecessary operations.  Direct\r\n\r\noperating  expenditure excluding the Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nis  allowed to increase by slightly more  than  19\r\n\r\nper  cent  only. Allowing for the general increase\r\n\r\nin  prices and the additional manpower costs  such\r\n\r\nas wage supplements and other allowances, there is\r\n\r\nhardly any growth in real terms and in the context\r\n\r\nof  ever  increasing workloads,  this  means  that\r\n\r\nMinistries and departments have to exercise  great\r\n\r\ncare  over their expenditure in the next financial\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards manpower, the search for manpower\r\n\r\nsaving methods of work continues. Grass-cutting in\r\n\r\nschool  compounds will be progressively undertaken\r\n\r\nby  grass-cutting contractors and  the  number  of\r\n\r\nschool   servants  accordingly  reduced.  Security\r\n\r\nalarms will be installed in schools so that school\r\n\r\nwatchmen  can  be  phased  out  eventually.   More\r\n\r\nmechanised  road sweepers will be  introduced  and\r\n\r\nexisting   staff  will  be  redeployed   for   the\r\n\r\ncleansing  of new housing estates and roads.  Over\r\n\r\nand  above  the mechanisation effort, a  stringent\r\n\r\ncontrol  was imposed on the creation of additional\r\n\r\nposts  so  as  not to add fuel to the inflationary\r\n\r\nfire.  As  a  result  of these measures,  the  net\r\n\r\nincrease in the permanent establishment for FY  74\r\n\r\nincluding those created by Establishment  Warrants\r\n\r\nis kept down to 1,762 posts or 2.9 per cent of the\r\n\r\nestablishment level in FY 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, of course, does not mean that expenditure\r\n\r\non  manpower will also be held down to a  2.9  per\r\n\r\ncent  growth.  In fact, as I have stated  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  the  Government and statutory boards  will\r\n\r\nadopt National Wages Council's recommendations and\r\n\r\nwill  require  to make provision for  payments  in\r\n\r\naccordance with such recommendations. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  I should mention here that as the NWC  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  are already fairly substantial  and  as\r\n\r\nshown   by  their  interim  $25  wage  supplement,\r\n\r\nalready  would have regard to the rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving,  ad hoc revisions of salary for particular\r\n\r\nservices except where necessary to remove  obvious\r\n\r\nanomalies, will not generally be entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst some restraint is imposed on operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure,   there  will   be   no   let-up   on\r\n\r\nimplementing desirable development programmes  and\r\n\r\nprojects.  I  mentioned  earlier  that  the  total\r\n\r\noutlay under the Development Estimates for  FY  74\r\n\r\nhas  increased  by  32.6 per cent.  Of  the  total\r\n\r\nprovision,  about  28 per cent  is  allocated  for\r\n\r\ndirect  expenditure by Ministries and  departments\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the Armed Forces. The  remainder  is\r\n\r\nearmarked  for  loans  to  statutory  boards   and\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury Memorandum on the Estimates explains\r\n\r\nin  some  detail the expenditure provisions  under\r\n\r\neach Head of Expenditure and there is no need  for\r\n\r\nme  to  repeat what is already stated  therein.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to highlight, however,  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor  areas  of  Government  endeavour  and   the\r\n\r\nallocation of funds to these areas, viz.  Housing,\r\n\r\nEducation  and  Industrial  Training,  Health  and\r\n\r\nEnvironment, and Road Transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Housing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-cost housing continues to be the key area of\r\n\r\nbuilding  development. In fact, some  other  major\r\n\r\nprojects  have had to be rejected or postponed  in\r\n\r\norder  to ensure that there is sufficient building\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  supplies for the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  low-cost  housing programme. For  FY  74  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  loan  funds and  subsidies  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board is some 48 per  cent\r\n\r\nhigher than that for FY 73. The share of total net\r\n\r\nprovision allocated to Housing has increased  from\r\n\r\n12 per cent to 15 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the basic infrastructure facilities\r\n\r\ndirectly   related  to  housing  is,  of   course,\r\n\r\nsewerage. Provisions are made for low-cost housing\r\n\r\nestates  such as Bedok New Town and Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nNew  Town, the East Coast Reclamation Area and the\r\n\r\nNorth  and South Precincts under the Urban Renewal\r\n\r\nProgramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More schools will be built in new satellite towns\r\n\r\nand major housing estates. It is expected that  12\r\n\r\nschools  will be completed and provision of  funds\r\n\r\nfor  the  building  of another 20  schools  to  be\r\n\r\ncommenced in FY 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education and Industrial Training</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the construction of schools goes on, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education is pressing ahead with  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes   to   increase  the  second   language\r\n\r\nexposure  time in primary schools and to implement\r\n\r\ncurricular  changes  in secondary  schools.  After\r\n\r\ntaking into consideration the changes in enrolment\r\n\r\nin  primary and secondary schools, a net  increase\r\n\r\nof 233 posts is provided for FY 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the greater emphasis on quality, there will\r\n\r\nbe   a  corresponding  increase  in  the  cost  of\r\n\r\neducation. This will be reflected not only in  the\r\n\r\nsalary of teachers, but also in the higher cost of\r\n\r\nequipment,  chemicals and materials for laboratory\r\n\r\nwork  and workshop practice. It will therefore  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to increase the education fees from time\r\n\r\nto  time,  to  remind our people of  the  enormous\r\n\r\nState subsidies in education, and parents of their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in  paying  towards  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbringing up and educating every additional  member\r\n\r\nin his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an earnest of our interest in technical and\r\n\r\nindustrial  training,  grants  to  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board, Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann\r\n\r\nTechnical College have increased by $4 million  or\r\n\r\n19.4  per  cent.  Even  more  significant  is  the\r\n\r\nincrease  by $2.6 million or 270 per cent  in  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  overseas industrial  training\r\n\r\nscheme,  the  industrial  development  scholarship\r\n\r\nscheme   and   subsidies  for   local   industrial\r\n\r\ntraining. It is hoped that industry will,  on  its\r\n\r\npart, take an increasingly active participation in\r\n\r\nindustrial  training  through  apprenticeship  and\r\n\r\nother   programmes.  `The  production  of   enough\r\n\r\npersonnel  with the necessary industrial  training\r\n\r\nskills  must,  in the long run, be a joint  effort\r\n\r\nbetween industry and Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Health and Environment</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent energy and materials shortages have\r\n\r\nreminded  us  once again of our  lack  of  natural\r\n\r\nresources   and   therefore  the   importance   of\r\n\r\nupgrading  what  we do have - our human  resources\r\n\r\nand  our  environment. The allocations for  Health\r\n\r\nand  Environment add up to almost 20 per  cent  of\r\n\r\ntotal  net provision in the Estimates. Improvement\r\n\r\nof  medical facilities for the people will proceed\r\n\r\non  a  broad  front by the further development  of\r\n\r\nmedical specialities, the opening of new hospitals\r\n\r\nand the expansion of existing hospitals. Of these,\r\n\r\nthe largest single project is still the re-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the Outram Road General  Hospital.\r\n\r\nAll require investment in buildings, equipment and\r\n\r\nmanpower, that is, the training of nurses and  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  skills  of doctors.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthese  are  too  often taken for  granted.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary that hospital charges be increased  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  to help symbolically  towards  the\r\n\r\nincreasing cost of medicine and drugs, disposables\r\n\r\nand rations and diets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, increasing expenditure on health\r\n\r\nfacilities  will not lead to better  standards  of\r\n\r\ncare  if  the population growth is unchecked,  and\r\n\r\npollution of the environment goes unabated. If the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  patients increases hand in  hand  with\r\n\r\ntotal   expenditure  on  health   facilities,   no\r\n\r\nimprovement can be expected. For FY 74, the  grant\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore Family Planning and  Population\r\n\r\nBoard is increased by two-thirds and more Maternal\r\n\r\nand  Child Health Clinics will be opened  in  low-cost  housing  estates. In the area  of  pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol,  I  have mentioned the sewerage  projects\r\n\r\nwhich will be undertaken in FY 74. The development\r\n\r\nof   proper  markets  and  hawkers  centres   will\r\n\r\ncontinue and the Refuse Incineration project  will\r\n\r\nbe implemented a stage further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Road Transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should say a few words on the\r\n\r\nprovisions   for   the   improvement    of    road\r\n\r\ntransportation,  a  subject  which  has   recently\r\n\r\nattracted much attention both from the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Provisions for the  construction,\r\n\r\nwidening  and  realignment of  roads  and  bridges\r\n\r\ntotal  $28.1  million. Another $5 million  is  set\r\n\r\naside  for special projects recommended by a  high\r\n\r\nlevel  Road Transport Action Committee. This total\r\n\r\nallocation of $33.1 million is 8.4 per cent of the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  direct expenditure  by  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  on development projects and  reflects\r\n\r\nthe  high priority which Government gives  to  the\r\n\r\nsolving of problems in road transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now consider the question of financing\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  expenditure. It  is  expected  that\r\n\r\nexternal  loans,  domestic loans, loan  repayments\r\n\r\nand  interest  and dividends will  together  yield\r\n\r\n$1,057.5  million. This together with the expected\r\n\r\nGovernment  revenue of $2,323 million at  existing\r\n\r\ntax  rates  will  just about meet  the  net  total\r\n\r\nprovision for expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate of $2,323 million for FY 74\r\n\r\nrepresents  a  14.1  per cent  increase  over  the\r\n\r\nlatest estimate of revenue to be collected  in  FY\r\n\r\n73.  This  rate  of  increase in  revenue  is  not\r\n\r\nunreasonable  despite  the gloomier  international\r\n\r\nscene  this  year. One reason is that the  largest\r\n\r\nsingle  source is income tax and this is dependent\r\n\r\non  the previous year's earnings rather than those\r\n\r\nof  the present financial year. Another reason  i5\r\n\r\nthat  inflation tends to increase revenue  through\r\n\r\nindirect taxes which are based on prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 74, income tax is expected to reach $700\r\n\r\nmillion  or  20.7 per cent more than  the  revised\r\n\r\nestimate  for FY 73. It also represents around  30\r\n\r\nper cent of total revenue for FY 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property tax is the next largest single source of\r\n\r\nrevenue.  For  FY 74, this source is  expected  to\r\n\r\nyield $230 million or 12.2 per cent more than  the\r\n\r\nrevised  estimate for the current financial  year.\r\n\r\nOther  main  increases in revenue  in  FY  74  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  come  from  land  sales,  additional\r\n\r\nregistration  fees  on  motor  cars,  road  taxes,\r\n\r\ncustoms duties on liquors, petroleum products  and\r\n\r\ntobacco  as  well  as  regulatory  charges.  These\r\n\r\ntogether  account for 52 per cent of the  increase\r\n\r\nover the revised estimate of revenue for FY 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Taxation Policy and Changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we come to the question of new tax\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.

In\r\n\r\naddition,  since  March  1972,  any  estate   duty\r\n\r\npayable has been remitted for estates which do not\r\n\r\nexceed  $25,000  in value. The intention  of  this\r\n\r\nremission  was to ensure that families buying  the\r\n\r\nlow-cost  Housing  and Development  Board  housing\r\n\r\nunits under Government's scheme for encouraging  a\r\n\r\nproperty-owning democracy would be in no danger of\r\n\r\nlosing their homes because of inability to pay the\r\n\r\nestate  duty. It was not intended to  benefit  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the tax-payers owning estates  above\r\n\r\nthis  value which would, however, still enjoy  the\r\n\r\nexemption   on   the  first  $10,000   which   was\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have, however, been made about\r\n\r\nthe   inadequacy  of  the  present  exemption  and\r\n\r\nremission limits by the public through the  press,\r\n\r\nand  also  by hon. Members in this House. Property\r\n\r\nowners  hope the Government will extend  exemption\r\n\r\nor remission to the terrace or semi-detached house\r\n\r\nor  even the owner-occupied family detached house.\r\n\r\nSince  prices  of land and houses  have  increased\r\n\r\nsubstantially in the past few years, it is  argued\r\n\r\nthat  wage earners may find it difficult  to  bear\r\n\r\nthe full burden of estate duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have considerable sympathy for these\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  I  have  rejected  the  demand   for\r\n\r\ncomplete exemption from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestate  duty  in  respect  of  one  owner-occupied\r\n\r\nfamily house. Such an exemption would benefit  the\r\n\r\nwealthy   more   than   others   and   result   in\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against other forms of assets  like\r\n\r\nshares,  deposits  and  life  insurance  policies.\r\n\r\nHowever,  recognising the need to  ensure  against\r\n\r\nundue hardship and possible disruption of families\r\n\r\nas  a result of burdensome estate duty payments on\r\n\r\nthe death of a breadwinner, I now propose to raise\r\n\r\nthe exemption and remission limits of estate duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention is to give relief from estate duty\r\n\r\nby  a combination of exemption and remission.  The\r\n\r\nexemption  will  be for the first $50,000  of  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the estate which represents an increase\r\n\r\nof  $40,000 over the existing exemption  limit  of\r\n\r\n$10,000.  The remissions will be one declining  by\r\n\r\nsteps of 10 per cent of the duty payable. Thus  90\r\n\r\nper  cent  will  be remitted of  the  estate  duty\r\n\r\npayable  for  the  next $20,000 in  value  of  the\r\n\r\nestate, and 80 per cent, 70 per cent, 60 per cent,\r\n\r\netc, of the duty for every succeeding $20,000  in\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the estate up to $230,000.  This  would\r\n\r\nmean  that  if  an estate is worth up  to  $50,000\r\n\r\nonly,  no  duty will be payable. If the estate  is\r\n\r\nworth $150,000, the duty payable is $3,337 and  if\r\n\r\nthe estate is worth $230,000, the duty payable  is\r\n\r\n$14,037.   Estates  which  are  worth  more   than\r\n\r\n$230,000  will  be  subject to full  duty  on  the\r\n\r\namount exceeding $230,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised exemption and remission limits will\r\n\r\napply  to  estates passing on or after 1st  April,\r\n\r\n1974. The proposal will give full relief to people\r\n\r\nin  the lower income group living in all, even the\r\n\r\nlargest, HDB flats, who form about 40 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  population. The people in the  middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup  living  in  owner-occupied  terrace,  semi-detached  and even detached houses will  have  the\r\n\r\nburden of estate duty considerably reduced.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to reduce or avoid estate duty  further\r\n\r\ncan  transfer  the property as a gift  during  the\r\n\r\nlifetime of the owner or create joint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntenancies  or tenancies in common or  mortgage  or\r\n\r\ncharge  the property, thus reducing the  value  of\r\n\r\nthe estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i> (2)  Revision of Tax Relief for Dependent Parents and Grandparents from $300 to $750</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year when I announced the relief to\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  for supporting parents or grandparents,\r\n\r\nmany  hon. Members felt that the tax deduction  at\r\n\r\n$300  per  dependant was inadequate. I have  given\r\n\r\nthis  matter further consideration and I am  happy\r\n\r\nto inform hon. Members that the relief will now be\r\n\r\nincreased  from $300 to $750 per dependant.  There\r\n\r\nwill   be   no  change  in  the  other  conditions\r\n\r\nannounced  last year. The increase in  the  relief\r\n\r\nwill  also take effect from the year of assessment\r\n\r\n1975, that is, based on 1974 income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(3) Balancing Charge on Sale of  a  Singapore Registered Ship</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profits from the operation of Singapore\r\n\r\nregistered ships are exempted from income  tax  as\r\n\r\nan  incentive  for ship-owners to  register  their\r\n\r\nships  in  Singapore. However,  when  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nregistered  ship  is sold and the  sale  price  is\r\n\r\nhigher than the written down or depreciated value,\r\n\r\na balancing charge arises which under ordinary tax\r\n\r\nliability,  is  subject to  income  tax.  If  this\r\n\r\nliability  is  not  removed, it  could  discourage\r\n\r\nlocal   shipowners  from  upgrading  their  fleets\r\n\r\nthrough  disposal  of older vessels  and  possibly\r\n\r\nalso  act  as a disincentive to foreign shipowners\r\n\r\nfrom setting up shipping companies in Singapore to\r\n\r\noperate Singapore registered ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the registration of ships in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have already provided for income tax\r\n\r\nexemption for profits, low registration  fees  and\r\n\r\nannual tonnage fee, rebate of half the tonnage fee\r\n\r\nif 25 per cent of the crew are Singapore citizens,\r\n\r\na  simplified registration and mortgage system and\r\n\r\nincome   tax   exemption  for  crews  working   on\r\n\r\nSingapore  registered  ships.  After  giving  such\r\n\r\nincentives, it was not specifically intended  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  remain a liability to  tax  of  the\r\n\r\nbalancing  charge  on  the  sale  of  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nregistered  ship.  I  therefore  propose,  by  the\r\n\r\nremoval of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis liability, to add still another incentive for\r\n\r\nthe  registration of ships in Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\nassessment year 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(4) Income Tax on Annuity Instalments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim to develop Singapore as an important\r\n\r\ninsurance  centre is in line with our  efforts  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  Singapore as the \"brains\" service  centre\r\n\r\nof  South-east  Asia. Hon. Members  will  remember\r\n\r\nthat  I  have in previous Budgets announced fiscal\r\n\r\nincentives to foster the growth of the finance and\r\n\r\ninsurance industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further step to assist the insurance\r\n\r\nindustry,  I  propose to revise the basis  of  the\r\n\r\nincome  tax  on annuities. Annuities, at  present,\r\n\r\nform  a  very small part of the insurance business\r\n\r\nhere  because, among other factors, tax is imposed\r\n\r\non the whole of an annuity instalment received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An annuity purchased by payment of an insurance\r\n\r\npremium  or  premiums provides for the payment  of\r\n\r\nperiodic   sums   of  money  to   the   purchaser.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the payment represented by an annuity\r\n\r\ninstalment  consists  of  two  elements:  one   is\r\n\r\nrepayment of part of the capital, and the other is\r\n\r\nthe   payment   of  interest  on  the  outstanding\r\n\r\ncapital. At present, both elements comprising  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  an  annuity  instalment  received   are\r\n\r\nsubject  to  income  tax.  This  is  an  anomalous\r\n\r\nsituation because only the interest portion should\r\n\r\nproperly  be  considered  as  income  and   taxed,\r\n\r\nleaving the capital element free of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from the assessment year 1975,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I propose to change the basis of tax to\r\n\r\ncharge   only  the  interest  element  of  annuity\r\n\r\ninstalments. This measure will not only assist the\r\n\r\ninsurance industry but also popularise a different\r\n\r\nand attractive form of insurance cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above remarks conclude the account of tax\r\n\r\nconcessions I propose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there still appears to be some lack of\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  Government's  taxation  policy,\r\n\r\nparticularly   with  reference   to   recent   tax\r\n\r\nmeasures,  let  me  take the opportunity  here  to\r\n\r\nstate it once again. For the growth of revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  meet rising Government expenditure, it is  our\r\n\r\npolicy  to  rely mainly upon a rapid expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  and upon an efficient machinery  for\r\n\r\nenforcement and collection of the taxes which such\r\n\r\nan  economy  can  afford to pay. While  major  and\r\n\r\npainful  new taxes or increases in tax  rates  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose purely of raising additional  revenue\r\n\r\nwill generally be avoided, it may be necessary  in\r\n\r\norder to implement our social or economic policies\r\n\r\nthat  from  time  to  time,  we  impose  new   tax\r\n\r\ndisincentives, or give incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last really new taxes were introduced at the 1968 December Budget and were prompted by the need\r\n\r\nto  raise revenue for building up our own  defence\r\n\r\nforces  consequent upon the withdrawal of  the  UK\r\n\r\narmed   forces  from  the  Republic.  Since  then,\r\n\r\nrevisions  mainly  have  been  made  to  taxes  on\r\n\r\nprivate  motor  vehicles, cigarettes  and  tobacco\r\n\r\nproducts,  liquors and petroleum. These  revisions\r\n\r\nraised  additional revenue but were made quite  as\r\n\r\nmuch   to   alleviate   traffic   congestion   and\r\n\r\npollution;  to  bolster Government's  anti-smoking\r\n\r\ncampaign; and to discourage consumption of  luxury\r\n\r\nand  non-essential items. If such higher taxes and\r\n\r\nduties encourage the people to forgo or reduce the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  these items, the whole  community\r\n\r\nwill  benefit through the better flow of  traffic,\r\n\r\nreduced  pollution, better health  and  a  smaller\r\n\r\nnational expenditure on imported luxury items. Tax\r\n\r\nrevisions  have not affected food items  or  daily\r\n\r\nnecessities. On the contrary, during the financial\r\n\r\nyear 1973, Government lifted import duties on  149\r\n\r\nitems  of  a  wide range of foodstuffs,  household\r\n\r\nappliances  and construction materials,  resulting\r\n\r\nin  a  potential loss of revenue of $21.4  million\r\n\r\nper annum. And, of course, the tax concessions now\r\n\r\nannounced and costing some $8.8 million per  annum\r\n\r\ngive   some   recognition  to   changed   economic\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear, however, that it\r\n\r\nis  not part of Government policy to subsidise  or\r\n\r\nto  continue to subsidise activities which are not\r\n\r\nviable   in   the  long  run,  and  it   will   be\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to recover, so far as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   consistent  with  Government's  policies  for\r\n\r\nsocial  justice,  all costs for the  provision  of\r\n\r\nGovernment services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to re-state the principles which\r\n\r\ndetermine the philosophy on which our way of  life\r\n\r\nis  based.  Since  1965, one principle  which  has\r\n\r\nenabled  us  to survive and to thrive  is  not  to\r\n\r\nencourage  passengers. Nothing is more  likely  to\r\n\r\nensure  our  bankruptcy  and  disintegration  than\r\n\r\nfeather-bedding  and  subsidies  in   pursuit   of\r\n\r\nequality,  not of opportunities, but  of  rewards.\r\n\r\nOver  and  over  again,  in developing  countries,\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  have  won  office  by  putting\r\n\r\nattractive  proposals  of  subsidised  food,  free\r\n\r\neducation  and  health services to a semi-educated\r\n\r\nelectorate, unable and later unwilling to face the\r\n\r\nhard  facts  of  economic life.  Inevitably  these\r\n\r\ncountries   have  ended  in  economic  chaos   and\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  If  any political party  succeeds  in\r\n\r\nselling  this `something for nothing'  philosophy,\r\n\r\nit  will be particularly bad for Singapore. For we\r\n\r\nmake  our  living through organised servicing  and\r\n\r\nproduction, not with the help of the sun and  rain\r\n\r\nto  produce food and agricultural commodities.  So\r\n\r\nwhen  the  financial  rot sets  in  and  the  firm\r\n\r\nframework  which  rewards  effort  and  enterprise\r\n\r\ngives  way,  there  are no  soft  rice  fields  to\r\n\r\ncushion  the hard fall. And the fall will be  most\r\n\r\npainful for the poor and the unskilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the price of imported oil goes up, it is no\r\n\r\nless  than  madness to subsidise PUB  charges,  as\r\n\r\nsome letters to the press have urged, particularly\r\n\r\nwhen we want people to cut down on consumption  of\r\n\r\nelectricity and oil. On the contrary, in the  case\r\n\r\nof petrol, a tax was added in order to further cut\r\n\r\ndown non-essential travelling by motor cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet steep price increases in\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs,  and  the  effects  of  increased  oil\r\n\r\nprices,  the Government has accepted the  National\r\n\r\nWages  Council's  recommendation  to  give  a  $25\r\n\r\ninterim  allowance. There is  a  likelihood  of  a\r\n\r\nfurther increase in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the cost of running buses has gone up\r\n\r\n-  half because of wages, half due to higher  cost\r\n\r\nof  diesel  oil,  spare parts and  tyres.  So  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has had to allow the bus companies  to\r\n\r\nput up bus fares. There have been suggestions that\r\n\r\nthe  Government nationalise the bus companies  and\r\n\r\nsubsidise the commuter. But what happens when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  nationalises a company which  has  not\r\n\r\nyet    got   institutionalised   management,   and\r\n\r\ncorruption  on  a  scale  rampant  in  the  former\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Company inevitably results? Let\r\n\r\nus  first  get  management and  services  improved\r\n\r\nthrough  tighter supervision from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital ward charges for `C' class patients have\r\n\r\ngone up by a token $1 per day, since January 1974,\r\n\r\nwhen  the actual cost per patient per day went  up\r\n\r\n$8  from $37 in 1972 to $45 in 1973, the result of\r\n\r\nincrease  of wages of all hospital staff  and  the\r\n\r\ncost of equipment and medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying rationale is, whoever makes use of\r\n\r\nthese services must pay a token share towards  its\r\n\r\ncost,  to  check abuse in the unnecessary  use  of\r\n\r\nthese   services.  This  has  happened   in   even\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries like Britain. There, a  Labour\r\n\r\ngovernment   in  1968  was  forced  to   introduce\r\n\r\nprescription charges. Human nature being  what  it\r\n\r\nis,  the  charge,  however small compared  to  the\r\n\r\nactual cost, helps to cut down wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With miscellaneous school fees, a cognate\r\n\r\nprinciple applies. Every parent must bear a  token\r\n\r\nsum, to remind him that the bigger his family, the\r\n\r\nhigher the burdens on his family and on the State.\r\n\r\nWe  must  employ  every means to  impress  on  our\r\n\r\npeople  the need for family planning, or abortion,\r\n\r\nor serialisation. That there is a small surplus in\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous fees for the cost of ECA, means that\r\n\r\nmore activities can be catered for, and principals\r\n\r\nand  senior  teachers can be more  imaginative  in\r\n\r\nplanning  activities  such  as  educational  tours\r\n\r\nduring  holidays.  The  hefty  increased  cost  of\r\n\r\neducation, at about $324 per annum for  a  primary\r\n\r\nschool student,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand $582 per annum for a secondary school student,\r\n\r\nis  carried by the Government. This, as  with  all\r\n\r\nsubsidies,  comes  from  taxes  paid  for  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest single tax revenue is from income\r\n\r\ntax,  paid for on a graduated scale, those earning\r\n\r\nmore paying more, to subsidise those earning less.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly 30 per cent of total revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the more you can earn, the more\r\n\r\nyou  must pay for the poor, when carried  too  far\r\n\r\nhas  led,  in  many  countries  like  Britain,  to\r\n\r\nprofessionals   migrating   to   North    America,\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand. They see no reason  why\r\n\r\nthey  should  work  to pay for  the  indolent  and\r\n\r\nirresponsible.  We are in a poorer  position  than\r\n\r\nthe  British,  for  we  are  short  of  top  level\r\n\r\npersonnel. If our trained administrators, managers\r\n\r\nand professionals leave, those left behind, nearly\r\n\r\nall   of   whom   cannot  emigrate,  will   become\r\n\r\nunemployed and suffer grave privation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every society has its quota of idealists, and of\r\n\r\nhypocrites, especially amongst the intelligentsia.\r\n\r\nThe  idealists believe in equal rewards. But  many\r\n\r\nare  hypocrites, pretending to feel sorry for  the\r\n\r\npoor.  They  are the people who, whilst  lamenting\r\n\r\nthe  extra  dollar on miscellaneous  school  fees,\r\n\r\nquietly  send  their children abroad to  expensive\r\n\r\nschools in Australia, Britain and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who intend to stay, let us take a\r\n\r\nhard  look  at our circumstances. To  protect  our\r\n\r\nlong-term interests, everyone, even our poor, must\r\n\r\nface up to our responsibilities to each other, and\r\n\r\nto  the  country. To spread the belief in  heavier\r\n\r\nand  heavier  subsidies  to  cushion  the  adverse\r\n\r\neffects  of  world economic forces on  our  lives,\r\n\r\nmeans encouraging and making more people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  passengers.  People who can  help  push  the\r\n\r\neconomy  by  striving to earn and pay  a  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir  essential needs will just sit back, waiting\r\n\r\nto be carried for free. This is the road to ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's duty is to ensure the wellbeing\r\n\r\nof  all,  including the poor. We best do  this  by\r\n\r\nensuring that people get better and better paid as\r\n\r\nthey  improve  their training  and  attain  higher\r\n\r\nskills.   The   basic  formula   for   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontinued success, without raw materials, is  hard\r\n\r\nwork.  There  is  no magic strategy  for  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth which can feed us without work. This budget\r\n\r\nreflects a realistic appraisal of our position  in\r\n\r\na  world where only those who make the effort will\r\n\r\nmake the grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament\r\n\r\napproves  the  financial policy of the  Government\r\n\r\nfor  the  financial year 1st April, 1974  to  31st\r\n\r\nMarch, 1975.\" In accordance with paragraph (1)  of\r\n\r\nStanding  Order  No.  84, the  debate  now  stands\r\n\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hon, debate to be resumed on what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> On 15th March, 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Parliament do now adjourn to Thursday,14th\r\n\r\nMarch,1974.\"[Mr E.
