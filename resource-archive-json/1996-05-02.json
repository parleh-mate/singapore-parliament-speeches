Members that after the adjournment today, the Parliament Homepage will be officially launched on the Internet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have always been kept well-informed of Parliamentary proceedings. Our newspapers carry detailed reports of the debates in the House and television has conveyed visual images of the cut and thrust of our debates into the living rooms of our people. The media has served the people well by providing sufficient opportunities for everyone to keep abreast of the debates and decisions of the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with Internet, we stand at the threshold of another media revolution. In 1995, the Minister for Information and the Arts estimated that there were 26,000 Internet subscribers in Singapore. A year later, we have around 100,000 Internet subscribers, and the number is growing fast. Internet is rapidly evolving into not only a rich source of information but also an important tool for communication. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is right for Parliament now to reach out to Singaporeans through Internet. It is in line with Singapore's vision for IT 2000 and the Public Service's goals for PS21. It is consistent with our policy of promoting open, fair and transparent institutional systems. Through Internet, the world-at-large can gain insights into our Parliamentary system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> More importantly though, we hope to strengthen the bonds between the people and our law-makers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Homepage aims to do this by complementing the newspaper reports and televised proceedings. While these media can convey the logic behind an argument and the passions of a debate, it cannot be fully appreciated or understood unless one is aware of the processes of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, our Homepage will be divided into two chapters: firstly, the Archival chapter which will contain pictures, interesting snippets and facts on Parliament's history, organisational structures and functions; and secondly, the Current Topics chapter which will list the business of the House for the next sitting. Together with the newspaper reports and televised debates, we can provide a more holistic view of the Parliamentary process. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to explore new technology and apply it when appropriate, for example, the incorporation of sound and moving images in our Homepage and having our Hansard on-line through Government Intranet and Lawnet. We will also exploit other means of communication. To this end, I am happy to announce that Parliament will also be publishing a booklet version of our Homepage to be distributed to visitors on sitting days, and to schools and public libraries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my pleasure to extend an invitation to hon. Members and the press to join me later in the Government Parliamentary Party's Conference Room for the launch of the Parliament Homepage on the Internet. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FOREIGNERS BUYING PROPERTY IN SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Imposition of levy)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will consider introducing measures to curb property speculation such as that of imposing a levy on foreigners buying property in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PROPERTY SPECULATION AND FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF PRIVATE CONDOMINIUMS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether there is a need to introduce further measures to curb property speculation and to limit foreign ownership of private condominiums. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the MPs have raised two separate issues: (1) limiting foreign ownership of properties, and (2) curbing property speculation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy on foreign ownership of property in Singapore is set out under the Residential Properties Act, passed in 1976. Foreign investors are allowed to invest freely in commercial and industrial properties. For residential properties, foreigners can apply for a licence to develop, but can only purchase condominiums and apartments which are over six storeys. In other words, foreigners are currently excluded from 93% of the total housing stock in Singapore: HDB flats, landed properties, and apartments below six storeys. Foreigners have access to only 7% of the total housing stock. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic development strategy succeeded because we encouraged foreign investment in Singapore, including foreign investment in property development. Allowing foreigners to buy private residential properties has encouraged foreign talent to bring their assets and their families to Singapore, and contribute in many other ways to our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreigners own about 13,000 units, or less than 2% of the total housing stock in Singapore. If we look at the private property segment of about 140,000 units, foreigners own about 9%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether 2% of total housing stock, or 9% of private residential properties, is too high a percentage for foreigners to own in an open market \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> economy like Singapore. We need and have thrived on the free movement of capital, talent and expertise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign buyers are not the principal cause of the property price increases. Other basic factors are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The high growth of incomes and savings among Singaporeans; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The increase in resale values of HDB flats, following the liberalisation of HDB's financing rules for resale flats. This has increased the number of HDB owners who can afford to upgrade to or invest in private properties; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Low interest rates and readily available mortgage financing; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The prevailing mood of the market, and the confidence that Singapore will enjoy high economic growth and political stability for the foreseeable future. The recent spate of letters and reports in the press on foreign ownership of properties has blown the issue of foreign buyers out of proportion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides foreigners, \"speculators\" have also been blamed for rising property prices. \"Speculators\" are people who buy properties to resell at a profit after a short holding period, instead of for long term investment or living in. There always is some property speculation, in falling as well as rising markets. Within limits, these \"speculators\" play a useful intermediary role. They help the property market to function efficiently and bridge the gap between long term buyers and long term sellers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a rising market, property speculation can get out of hand. Excessive speculation can create a false mood of euphoria, and push prices up higher than long term fundamentals can justify. Eventually, this will result in a property market collapse, which can seriously damage the rest of the economy. In Japan, when the bubble burst, not only did many home buyers on mortgages suffer, but property companies went bankrupt and many \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> banks incurred huge losses on huge loans on properties and had to be bailed out by the government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is therefore carefully monitoring the situation. We are examining current market practices to see whether we need to adjust the rules on foreign ownership, or dampen excessive property speculation. However, any steps affecting the property market should only be taken after the most careful consideration. Acting hastily and unwisely will shake the faith of investors, local and foreign, in the Government, and undermine the confidence of the market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Sir, does the Minister think that the Residential Properties Act, 1976, need to be further amended at this point of time? Secondly, will he consider the following measures: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) imposing a minimum holding period on foreign buyers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) no resale of uncompleted units in all condominiums for three years; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) all developers should report to the Tax Department all resale transactions with details of the resale prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the Residential Properties Act, passed in 1976, has served us well all these 20 years. I think it will be very unwise to tinker with the Act without studying the situation very carefully. As I have said, the Government is monitoring the situation. The percentage of foreign ownership is not something that has changed over the years. The number has remained fairly constant. It is not something that has gone up dramatically in the last few years. So we would not want to amend the Residential Properties Act unless there are very good reasons for it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my answer, the Act has served us well. We have kept an open economy which encourages foreign investment in Singapore, both in other sectors as well as in the property sector, and the number of foreign purchases in the residential property market is not something that has turned out to be very large. So it will be wise not to tinker with the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> In the light of escalation of prices of private residential properties, is the Minister of the view that there is a possibility that Singaporeans have over-invested in private properties? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, buying private properties is an individual decision by the investors. As far as the financial market and the banking sector are concerned, there are sufficient rules to make sure that prudence is exercised in the borrowings to purchase properties. Right now, the rules on mortgage loans have made sure that the financial sector exercises due prudence in giving out such loans. Whether or not individuals are over-extended in buying properties, we will have to leave it to the individual. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister mentioned just now that one of the factors which has resulted in the increase in private residential property prices is that loans are readily available. Looking at the nation as a whole and that the financial sector is prepared and willing to give the loans, are we as a nation over-invested in property? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, macro-economists have some rules of thumb about investment in property as a fixed investment. If I remember the numbers correctly, as a percentage of our GDP, investment in fixed assets, primarily properties, is not unduly high in Singapore at this stage of our development. If I were to answer his question, we can look at it in different parameters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first parameter is, in a country's economic development, what proportion of its investment is in property and what investment is in other economic sectors. Based on the statistics that we have, our share of GDP in fixed property investment is not unduly high at our stage of development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second parameter that we can look at is: are we over-extended as a country in terms of mortgage loans on property? Again, the banking system is well regulated. There are sufficient rules in place to make sure that the credit-worthiness of borrowers is assessed correctly and limits \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are put on the amount that they can borrow. These are prudent rules. The bank association on their own have decided to reduce the ceiling of the loans in line with the rising property prices. It shows that the financial market is acting cautiously and there is no extension of the mortgage loan sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how about looking from the parameter of our CPF savings? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If you look at the individual, whether or not he has over-extended, as I say, that is up to the individual, ie, what proportion of his savings he wants to put in property and what proportion in other assets. If you look at the total country's investment, ie, the country's net savings translated into investments, as I said earlier, that percentage does not show that we are over-investing in properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a property developer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister agree with me that today, banks in Singapore are not allowed to lend Singapore dollars to foreigners wishing to buy property in Singapore? Would the Minister also agree with me that no country had really been successful in putting an imposition on foreign purchase of property in their own home markets, except by causing a blip in the market due to some initial loss of confidence whereas subsequently the fundamentals take over, and the market continues on, because of the fundamental reasons of that particular country? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am afraid I lost him somewhere along the line. But I can agree with what he said about the rules of foreigners borrowing in our markets. The question that Mr Low wants answered is this notion that, as a country, we are over-extending ourselves in property. I think this is a macro-economic question. You look at your country's fixed investments, and you ask yourself what percentage is put in different so-called productive assets and non-productive assets. I think what he is trying to get is that we are putting too much in property, which is non-productive assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gross investment in Singapore is very high. This translates from our very high rate of savings and that results in a very high rate of investment for macro-economic growth. Out of these domestic investments, you will notice that a high percentage of it goes into infrastructure. A lot of our Government's development expenditure goes into port, airport expansion and roads. These are probably what you will consider productive investments. So if you look at the stage of our development today, our investment in infrastructure and properties is not unduly high. And if you look at the investment in property, and a high percentage of this is in public housing, you can reach the conclusion that our actual investment in private property is also not very high. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, first, I would like to declare my pecuniary interest as a managing director of a public-listed company involved in property development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three questions for the Minister. Firstly, will he enlighten the House on the percentage of foreign ownership of private property, say, five years ago, compared to the 9% today? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will the URA publish these numbers on a regular basis, so that there will be no wrong perception in the public's mind as to the extent of foreign ownership of private property? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question, Sir, is this: will he like to paint a scenario of what will be the problem if we impose sudden curbs on foreign ownership of property? In other words, what impact will it have on the current property market and property owners? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Since the enactment of the Residential Properties Act in 1976, ownership of properties by foreigners has never been a big issue because 93% of our properties are protected and not made available to foreigners. So there has never been a need to monitor the percentages of foreign ownership of our properties in a regular way. We have not had these data five years ago. URA started monitoring \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the purchases of foreigners in the new launches since 1994, and the percentage of foreigners has remained consistently in the same range, between 17% and 28% of new properties, ie, of all condominiums. So when you restrict ownership of private property, and 93% of properties in Singapore are not available to foreigners, then, of course, foreigners can only buy the remaining 7%. And out of the 7% private condominiums, for new launches, foreigners take up between 17% and 28% of these properties. These numbers were released in 1994 and the numbers have remained consistent. It has gone up; it has gone down, depending on each quarter, but it has hovered around this percentage. So there has not been a major shift in the ownership of private properties by foreigners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what will be the impact on the property market if we were to restrict foreigners on the purchase of private property in Singapore, I would like to caution that there are several implications. The first implication is the level of confidence on the policies and the market that we operate in Singapore. Singapore has thrived because we have kept our economy open, even in those days when conventional wisdom in many countries kept their markets closed. We wisely kept our markets open, encouraged foreign investments in Singapore, and we had benefited from that policy. If we were to react unwisely now and close the market, this sends a wrong signal about the openness of our markets. So I would hasten to make any drastic changes to the Residential Properties Act when the factors and the situation in terms of foreign ownership of our properties do not warrant such a drastic change. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Two supplementary questions. First, Sir, I know that the Australian government has allowed foreigners to invest freely in the property market but has imposed certain restrictions on sale of property. They could only sell to Australians, not foreigners. Will the Government consider some measure to that effect in the future, if there is a need? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second supplementary question is: would the Minister reveal the number and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> percentage of foreign ownership of private residential condominiums in districts 9, 10 and 11? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If Members start comparing Singapore with other countries, they will draw the conclusion that Singapore's property market is, in fact, more highly protected than the Australian market, because 93% of our market are not open to foreigners. The HDB sector and the landed property sector are not open to foreigners. So, in fact, only 7% are open to foreigners. When other countries, for example, Malaysia, put a levy on property, they are protecting the lower-priced properties. But in Singapore we do not need to do that because the HDB segment is already protected. Foreigners cannot compete to buy HDB properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you restrict the sector which is open to foreigners, you are in fact making the situation worse. You are in fact making the sector even smaller and with the high level of foreign confidence in our Government, in our economy, foreigners going for properties in a smaller market will then accentuate the prices. Today, with foreigners being allowed to buy only private condominiums, I think that is the right approach because the lower segments and the landed properties are protected, so that foreigners cannot own land in Singapore. That is a sound policy. It has served us well since 1976 and there is no need to make any drastic changes unless foreigners are buying in very large numbers, and they are not. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, in view of the take-up rate of new properties by foreigners in the range of 17% and 28%, as disclosed by the Minister, will the Minister take this into account when the Planning Department or the URA releases the supply of land for tender? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I would urge Members to look at this issue in its entire perspective. The very reason why the property markets have moved is because there is strong confidence in the Singapore economy, in the Singapore Government. If that confidence is not there, property prices will collapse. When we look at the new releases of land for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> private condominiums, we take all these into consideration. First, the changing aspirations of Singaporeans and, therefore, we have moved from releasing 2,000 units to 6,000 units a year. Do not forget that not very long ago, less than seven or eight years ago, in the private property market, we were only talking about 4,000 units every year. And out of the 4,000 units, nobody quarrelled or discussed about foreign ownership in the 4,000 units. We have put in more land sales to raise the availability of such units to more than 10,000 now -- 6,000 by the Government and 4,000 from the land banks of private developers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have made private condominiums and private property more readily available to Singaporeans and, in so doing, Singaporeans now have better access to private property. As we track the purchases of Singaporeans and foreigners in the private property market, and we detect a strong demand for private property, Members can be assured that we will continue to adjust the supply to meet this demand. So the answer is, yes, we are monitoring this very closely and if indeed there is a greater demand for private property, the Government will adjust its land sales accordingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CUSTOMS ACT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Amendment of provisions on forfeiture of vehicles)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for Law whether the Government intends to introduce legislation to amend the provisions on forfeiture of vehicles in the Customs Act in view of the views expressed by the Chief Justice in the case of Public Prosecutor v M/s Serve You Motor Service that the legislature should consider making the necessary amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has carefully considered the views expressed by the Chief Justice in the case of Public Prosecutor v M/s Serve You Motor Service but has decided not to amend the Customs Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that case it concerned the effect of section 124(4) of the Customs Act which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provides that the District Judge shall order the goods to be forfeited on proof that an offence under this Act has been committed and that the goods were used in the commission of the offence. The District Judge decided that the court had the discretion not to order the forfeiture of a motor-lorry which was used in carrying 4,350 uncustomed cartons of cigarettes worth $137,246. The Public Prosecutor appealed as a matter of principle and the appeal was allowed by the Chief Justice who held that the forfeiture was mandatory under the clear words of the section. The Chief Justice expressed sympathy for the owners as they were not involved or implicated in the commission of the offence, nor did they know that the vehicle would be used for an unlawful purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have studied the comments of the Chief Justice in this case very carefully. Indeed, even before this case, Government had begun a review in March last year of the issue of forfeiture of vehicles used in the commission of certain offences. This was because the issue first arose in another case of Toh Teong Seng. And in that case the Chief Justice (in the context of the Environmental Public Health Act), recognising that forfeiture would act as a deterrent to illegal dumping, commented, however, that forfeiture of vehicle was a disproportionate \"substitute\" punishment when the offence itself carried a fine not exceeding $1,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice then had separately expressed his concerns to the Attorney-General and made some suggestions on how the Environmental Public Health Act could be improved to reflect its legislative goals. When the Attorney-General conveyed the Chief Justice's views to me as Minister for Law, I immediately wrote to the other Ministers in charge of similar legislation. The AG's Chambers agreed with my proposal for the Chambers to chair an Inter-Ministry Committee to review the different legislation containing forfeiture provisions. They are the Customs Act, Environmental Public Health Act, Immigration Act, Misuse of Drugs Act, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> National Parks Act and the Road Traffic Act. Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Environment had reviewed the Environmental Public Health Act and it decided that after enhancing the various penalties it did not need the forfeiture provisions which were then deleted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a comprehensive and in-depth review of these various Acts, all the Ministries concerned concluded that we should retain these forfeiture provisions because the public interest rationale for their original enactment remained valid. Cabinet deliberated on the matter and agreed with the Ministries' recommendations. Forfeiture acts as a strong deterrence. However, the Committee recommended that the existing guidelines for forfeiture be refined to ensure greater consistency and fairness in the exercise of the power to apply for forfeiture. This has been done by the relevant Ministries in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision to retain forfeiture provisions has not been done hastily, but with due deliberation. Forfeiture of vehicles is only invoked where the circumstances require it. I should add, Sir, that this form of penalty is not unique to Singapore. The United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries have had such laws for a long time and they have found them to be a strong deterrent. For example, in 1990, in England, the Court of Appeal held that an Air Canada commercial aircraft which landed at Heathrow Airport was liable to forfeiture under the Customs and Excise Management Act when it was found to have a cargo of cannabis resin on board on a scheduled flight from Bombay and the court so held, even though Air Canada did not know about the cannabis and was not reckless in failing to discover it. Eventually, the plane was released on payment of \u015350,000 to customs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smuggling of dutiable goods into Singapore, Sir, is a serious offence. In the case of Serve You Motor Service, the offence was doubly serious because the dutiable goods were cigarettes. Forfeiture of vehicles puts the onus on vehicle owners to exercise care and responsibility \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> when lending or hiring out their vehicles. It strongly encourages them to take precautions against their illegal use, which they are able to do so. We do not agree that owners should be entitled to have their vehicles released to them. Such a principle will surely make it easier for smuggling syndicates to obtain vehicles to carry out illegal activities, without the risk of confiscation. All they need to do is to hire or borrow the vehicles. Therefore, doing away with mandatory forfeiture provisions will only increase the pool of resources available to would-be criminals to commit illegal acts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sound public policy to hold owners responsible for ensuring that their vehicles are not used for illegal purposes. Some finance companies say that the law is unfair because they are completely unable to prevent vehicles financed by them from being used for illegal purposes. But the law is unfair if they have no means of protecting themselves from potential loss. But this is not so. For example, they can verify the backgrounds of their customers, especially individuals. Further, they can require customers to present or furnish guarantees, and look to the guarantors to recover their loss. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, some vehicle rental companies are already taking such precautions. For example, in The Straits Times of 27th March 1996 which reported on the comments of the Chief Justice in the Serve You Motor Service case it had another article on the same page which shows how prudent owners are protecting themselves from financial loss. That proprietor who was interviewed said that after his vehicle had been forfeited, he became more careful and he required guarantees to be furnished to safeguard against illegal use. Sir, this shows that car hire firms and finance companies can, and indeed should, adapt their business practices to meet such contingencies without incurring excessive costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied GRC):</b> Sir, since the Minister has decided not to amend the law, would he explain to the House why the legislature could not allow more discretion to the court in dealing with similar cases in future? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, the Government also considered very carefully the suggestion that the court should be given discretion to decide when a vehicle should be forfeited. But the Government has decided that the discretion should be with the Ministry which administers the relevant legislation in accordance with the new guidelines, but subject to review by the Attorney-General. And there are sound operational reasons why discretion should be made by enforcement agencies. For example, forfeiture is most appropriate in cases where no offender is caught. This happens, for example, when a vehicle containing illegal drugs or contraband is abandoned. Since no offender has been caught, it is not possible to prosecute anyone for the offence. In other cases, the mastermind, who is the most culpable person, remains behind the scene and is out of reach of the law enforcement agencies. Tracing his identity often depends on intelligence reports which cannot be disclosed in the courts without compromising sources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are two examples of circumstances where forfeiting the vehicle at the discretion of the Ministry is the best way to prevent the wrongdoers from escaping punishment. Let me give the assurance that forfeiture is not done randomly and routinely. There is a committee, and the Attorney-General's case is not just dependent on one public prosecutor, nor are all seized vehicles automatically forfeited. For example, in the five years from 1991 to 1995, 816 vehicles were seized by the law enforcement authorities and almost 380 vehicles were returned to the owners. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, why should the discretion lie with the Ministry when the identity cannot be disclosed publicly? Would it not be better for the court to decide and for the other party to show to the court that he is not involved at all and that his vehicle should not be forfeited? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thought I have given the answer, both in my main answer and in the answer to the supplementary question. I have already explained it. If discretion is given to the courts, the finance companies particularly will plead \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> innocence and, most likely, the courts will have to find that they are innocent. When that happens, how does it aid the public interest? Public interest must surely require effective enforcement of the basic laws in the areas which I have described: customs, immigration, drugs, and so on. And if they are found \"innocent\" and the vehicles are returned, it must encourage all those involved in the syndicates to take this route to have easy access to the vehicles concerned. So it does not aid the overall public interest which must be in allowing the agencies to tackle the problem effectively; because that means the offenders and syndicates can have easy access and there is no deterrent at all. The finance companies would be very happy to just provide the vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ACCIDENT AT MRT VIADUCT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Preventive measures)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Communications, in view of the accident caused by a five-tonne piling hammer which crashed onto a MRT viaduct near Paya Lebar MRT Station and damaged a moving train on 8th April 1996, what measures will be taken to prevent similar occurrence to ensure the safety of MRT passengers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Goh Chee Wee) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> The accident on 8th April 1996, where a piling vibrohammer fell on the MRT viaduct at Geylang East Avenue 2, happened in spite of the various measures taken to safeguard the safety of the MRT track.

As a result, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shackle of the vibrohammer was dislodged from the crane's hook during the piling of a sheet pile.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will also be taking action against the crane operator for damaging the MRT viaduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an immediate measure to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident, LTA has requested all developers and contractors whose construction worksites are near MRT viaducts to have a professional engineer to be on site to provide standing supervision for all construction activities.

These include the following: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Contractors must carry out hazard analysis of the works that may affect the Rapid Transit System's structure and track, and develop a set of safe working procedures to be approved by MOL's Department of Industrial Safety; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Contractors must engage a safety supervisor to supervise the works to ensure that the works are carried out in accordance with the approved safe working procedures; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To ensure compliance with the work procedures, these sites will be inspected regularly by officers from both the Department of Industrial Safety and LTA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications and the LTA take a serious view of the incident and will do all that is necessary to ensure the safety of commuters. Current regulations already restrict activities within the defined boundaries of 3m, 10m, 40m and 60m from the edge of the viaduct. LTA is reviewing the protection zones for restricted activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CARS FITTED WITH SAFETY DEVICES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Rebates on import duty)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether he will consider giving rebates on import duty on cars fitted with safety devices such as anti-lock braking system and airbags. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Sir, with rapid advancement in technology and rising expectations, cars have become increasingly sophisticated. Nowadays, a car comes with numerous fixtures, accessories and gadgets to make the journey safer, more comfortable and less harmful to the environment. For example, catalytic convertors and fuel injection mechanisms make the car less pollutive; a tougher shell and windscreen make the car safer; even bumpers, rear view mirrors and side mirrors help to prevent or lessen the impact of accidents, and so on. Most of these items have become standard features of the modern car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of ABS and airbags is part and parcel of the development of the automobile technology. If we give rebates on ABS and airbags, we should also do likewise for the fixtures, gadgets and accessories I mentioned earlier. While this is theoretically possible, in practice, the distinction between an essential safety device and a desirable but not essential gadget is grey. It is therefore more practical to base the import duty on the total value of the car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progressive nature of the import duty and the ARF, which are proportional to the OMV of the car, might cause some distortion in demand for safety features like ABS and airbags. But this is mitigated by the COE system, which does not depend on the price of the car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we should encourage the use of safety devices like ABS and airbags, we must not lose sight of our broader objective of managing congestion on our roads. Traffic which is free-flowing , roads which are well planned and good driving habits and effective enforcement all contribute towards road safety. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister of State agree that safety features like ABS and airbags are not actual parts of a car? Many car dealers refuse to bring them in because they will jack up the sale price of the car. Therefore, they are not encouraged to provide cars with these safety features. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> The ABS and airbags are additional features of a car introduced by the car manufacturers. The car distributors have been bringing in cars fitted with these features. Some of the best selling models are actually cars fitted with these safety devices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister of State agree that many car dealers choose not to install these safety devices such as airbags and ABS because they will jack up the price of the car as they are subject to import duty? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> I think it is the choice of the individual. These are additional features. The car distributors and car dealers will have to sell their cars and they have to explain to their buyers that it is a good car, a good product, and it is worth paying a bit more for a car which is safer. This is marketing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister of State not agree that if we were to give a rebate to encourage car dealers to bring in cars with such safety devices, Singaporean drivers will enjoy higher safety standards? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> As I have explained in my main answer, we have those features which we consider are essential safety devices, like the seat belt, for instance. The Government has legislated the installation of seat belts. But for other safety features which we consider desirable but are not essential, we will not legislate, but we will encourage their usage. And it does not mean that the Government must give a tax rebate or incentive to encourage the installation of these safety devices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister of State agree that the open market value of the car goes up if the car comes with added features like airbags, etc? That is why car importers \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> leave them out purposely so that the open market value is lower, so that the ARF and the taxes are less. Would the Minister of State therefore agree that by giving some tax concessions, this would be a positive way of encouraging the use of these safety features by the consumer? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> As I have explained earlier, the so-called disadvantage of incorporating these safety devices which make the car costlier is mitigated by the COE system, which does not depend on the price of the car. As I have also explained earlier to the question raised, the Government encourages the installation of these safety devices, but with the advancement in technology, there will be new features introduced into a car. And it does not mean that every time a new safety device is invented and fitted into a car, the Government must give rebates for the installation of these devices. I think we should not lose sight of our overall objective, ie, all these tax measures essentially are to restrain the rapid growth of the car population. I do not think we should lose sight of this objective. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SINGAPORE POWER</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Average total assets)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, in the definition of Return on Total Assets, (a) what portion of Singapore Power's Average Total Assets is land; (b) which are the major land parcels and where they are located; and (c) how these land prices are appraised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, land constitutes about 5.9% of Singapore Power's projected average total assets in FY 96/97.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, the criteria for the exercise of the power are set out in section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act. The Juvenile Court has the discretion to impose a fine on either or both parents depending on the circumstances of the case. In two recent cases, the Court exercised its discretion under section 39 of the Act. In one case, the Court found that both parents failed to exercise due care and imposed a fine on both of them. In the other case, the Court found that both parents failed to exercise due care, but exercised its discretion to impose a fine on the mother only, as the father has a serious medical condition. As such, the issue of who is head of the family does not arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that if the father has the privilege of getting medical benefits for the children as he is the head of the household, then he must also have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the responsibility of bearing the burden that due care has not been exercised and the child has been neglected? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think we should not mix the two issues. The father has the legal responsibility of maintaining and upkeeping the family, wife and children. But here we are talking about bringing up the children, looking after the children in terms of their behaviour. I think here both parents have a responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that privileges have to go with responsibilities? And if the man is the head of the household, then ultimately the man would have to bear responsibility even if the wife did not bring up the child well. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Under section 39, the court will look at the circumstances of the case. In fact, before the Juvenile Court makes a sentence, there is a pre-sentence report. The probation officer will interview the juvenile, the parents, members of the family, school teachers, peers and, if need be, a psychological assessment is taken. So all these facts are put before the court, which may sit with two assessors, which then decides, based on the criteria found in section 39, whether one parent or both parents have neglected to exercise due care over the child. If it is both parents, both will be fined. If it is one parent, the neglecting parent will be fined. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Government therefore give some direction to the court, in the sense that if both parents are found to be guilty, then the practice should be that the father should be fined and not the mother, as the father does have the privilege of being the head of the household? We may have to consider changing legislation, if necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I do not think it is the business of the Government to give direction to the court. In any case, the court is guided by the specific words of section 39 which, as I said, give it the power to look at the circumstances and determine which parent has been at fault. I think this fault principle is a good one. Otherwise, we may get a situation where \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the father is a model father but the child still goes wayward because the mother has neglected to exercise due care, then the father would be fined for what he has not done. In fact, he has been a good parent but he has been fined. Is that right? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, with the indulgence of the House, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that we do not take this into consideration when we designate the man as the head of the household?

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We should not mix the two issues. I think Dr Soin has got this binge about head of household which has been raised in this House many times, the last one being in March, when she had an exchange with the Deputy Prime Minister. We should leave that aside. In so far as the philosophy of the section is concerned, looking at the wording of the section, the question is one of defaulting parent. Because, as I said, both parents have a responsibility of bringing up the child. And that is separate from the legal responsibility of the husband or father to maintain the child financially. I think we should not mix up the two issues when considering how the court should exercise its discretion under section 39. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PAPER COMMAND 4 OF 1996</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Omission of Appendices C and D)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance why Appendix C (Political Appointments, Personnel Groups and Other Groups) and Appendix D (Key to Salary Codes) were omitted from Paper Command 4 of 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Appendix D has not been in the Budget book since FY 1994/95.

Furthermore, officers on the same grades but under different medical schemes are now on different salary scales. Appendix D would have had to be considerably enlarged to reflect all these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix C was retained in the FY94/95 Budget book because even without salary codes, it was a useful central reference for the personnel codes which the Ministry of Finance needed to issue establishment warrants. It was removed this year because with the implementation of the Budgeting for Results programme and the lifting of head-count controls, this central reference is no longer necessary. Instead of Appendices C and D, a salary manual with details of civil service appointments has been prepared for use by the Ministries. A copy is available in the Parliament Library.

Over the last decade, the number of money-changers and remitters licensed under the Act has grown significantly to 452 and 97 respectively. This has been accompanied by a rise in the number of complaints from members of the public, including tourists. These complaints range from poor service, uncompetitive exchange rates, delays in remittance of monies to beneficiaries, to more serious cases of unlicensed operators and fraud. In one instance, a foreign partner of a licensed remitter absconded with monies of 35 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> customers amounting to $24,000. There is also concern that money laundering could be perpetrated through money-changers and remitters. It is therefore timely that the Act be revised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now explain the major provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remittance business is presently not defined under the Act. Clause 2 of the Bill introduces such a definition. It also clarifies under section 2 that any reference in the Act to a document or a record would include that stored on film, disc, magnetic tape or on any other medium. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter illegal money-changing and remittance businesses, clause 3 of the Bill proposes to raise the maximum term of imprisonment for the conduct of such business without a licence from six months to two years, and the maximum fine from $5,000 to $50,000. For a continuing offence, a maximum fine of $1,000 per day is proposed. In considering this proposal for more stringent penalties, Members of the House may wish to note that the Court had commented in sentencing an unlicensed money-changer and remitter in July 1995 that the present maximum penalties of $5,000 and/or six months imprisonment were too light. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that licences are granted only to persons who are fit and proper, it is proposed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) be empowered to request for any information as considered necessary to assess applications for or renewal of licences. In the case of a renewal, a provision has been introduced in clause 4 of the Bill to clarify that a licensee may continue with his business pending the outcome of his application. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safeguard, remitters are presently required, as a condition of their licences, to lodge a banker's guarantee of $100,000 with MAS for the purpose of compensating customers for losses in the event of default by the remitter. Clause 5 of the Bill proposes to formalise this safeguard under the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A licensee who wishes to set up an additional place of business presently has to apply for a separate licence for each \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> additional location as the Act does not expressly provide for branching. To streamline procedures for branching, clause 5 of the Bill also introduces a provision to allow branches to be established by money-changers and remitters with approval from MAS, and to allow MAS to charge licence fee for each branch. A fine not exceeding $10,000 is proposed for contravention of this provision as well as a fine of $1,000 per day for a continuing offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although stipulated as a condition of licence, it is a common complaint by members of the public that some money-changers and remitters do not display their licences. The Bill introduces a provision to require licences to be displayed in a conspicuous place where such business is being conducted. Any non-compliance would be deemed an offence carrying a maximum fine of $5,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act currently does not expressly empower MAS to determine the period for which a licence may be renewed. Clause 6 of the Bill clarifies that MAS may determine the period of validity of licences, which would normally be for one year. It also empowers MAS to prescribe different licence fees in respect of different classes of licences and clarifies that licence fees would not be refundable should a licence be cancelled or revoked, or if a licensee were to cease business, before expiry of the licence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve as a deterrent, a new provision is proposed in clause 7 to make it a punishable offence for any person to furnish false or misleading statements to MAS when applying for or renewing a licence. The proposed penalty is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, licences would be withdrawn from any licensee who becomes bankrupt. Clause 8 proposes to formalise bankruptcy as a ground for withdrawal under the Act. It also proposes that the Act be amended to clarify that a revocation order for a licence would become effective 30 days after it has been served on a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> licensee. However, if a licensee has appealed to the Minister within the 30 days, the order would not become effective until the decision by the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision is proposed in clause 9 to require licensees to keep complete records of all their money-changing and remittance transactions and to retain such records for at least six years to facilitate investigations for drug money laundering and other illegal activities, and for inspections by MAS. Non-compliance would be an offence carrying a maximum fine of $10,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 also proposes that MAS be given the power to require licensees to submit returns and any other information required for its supervisory purposes. The proposed maximum penalty for non-compliance of this provision is a fine of $5,000 and a fine of $1,000 per day for a continuing offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is presently empowered under the Act to inspect the premises and the books and documents of a licensee or person suspected of conducting money-changing or remittance business without a valid licence. A person who fails to allow such inspection or to produce any book or document for this purpose is liable on conviction to a fine of not more than $2,000. As the maximum penalty for non-compliance with this provision is relatively light, the Bill proposes that the present penalty be increased to $5,000 as a more effective deterrence against any action to impede or obstruct MAS in its inspection. Further, a penalty of $1,000 per day for a continuing offence is also proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow MAS to take appropriate measures to protect the interests of the public, clause 11 proposes that MAS be empowered to issue directives to a licensee to rectify or restrict its operations where an inspection by MAS has revealed that such business had been conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of its customers. There are similar provisions in the Banking Act and the Finance Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent misuse of customer funds by remitters, clause 12 of the Bill introduces a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provision to require funds received by a remitter from customers for remittance to be segregated from its own funds and to deposit these customer funds in a trust account with a bank. A maximum fine of $50,000 or two years imprisonment or both, is proposed for any breach of this provision. Such segregation of customer funds from the own funds of a financial institution are also provided for in the Securities Industry Act and Futures Trading Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 also introduces a provision to require money-changers and remitters to appoint external auditors to conduct annual audits of their operations and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The provision also empowers MAS to remove auditors whose standards of audit are found unsatisfactory. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, banks conducting money-changing and remittance businesses are exempted from the Act. Clause 14 proposes that the exemption be extended to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) merchant banks approved by the MAS; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) finance companies approved by MAS to conduct money-changing and remittance businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the proposed amendments to the Act would serve to better protect the interest of the public and improve the standard of service provided by money-changers and remitters as they strengthen the effectiveness of the Act in deterring fraud and other misdemeanours. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we should view the proposed Money-changing and Remittance Businesses (Amendment) Bill 1996 in a wider perspective. The Bill is part of a series of amendments to the legislation on the supervision of the financial system by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Sir, you may recall that over the last few years, the Banking Act, the Finance Companies Act, and the Futures Trading Act have been \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amended to ensure that these Acts remain effective in the supervision of the growing and ever changing financial markets. I note that the Minister has just introduced another Bill to amend the Banking Act even before this current Bill is passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment Acts are critical in maintaining the soundness of our financial system and in protecting the interests of customers of the financial services. I therefore support the Money-changing and Remittance Businesses (Amendment) Bill. Further, in view of growing international concerns about money laundering activities, I agree with the Minister that the Act should also be tightened to prevent and deter money laundering activities from being carried out via these two financial businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister mentioned, the Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Act was introduced in 1979. It has been in force for nearly 17 years without amendment. We have reason to believe that the demand for money-changing service has increased rapidly over the last 17 years. Firstly, there has been a sharp increase in the number of tourists visiting Singapore. Secondly, more Singaporeans are travelling overseas on leisure or on business, and more frequently. During the last 17 years, demand for remittance service must have also increased significantly, with the increase in the number of foreign workers in Singapore. Remitters no longer just service older Singaporeans who remit money to their relatives in China, India and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, but remitters also cater for foreign workers who remit their earnings to their families overseas. The business of money-changing and remittance must have expanded correspondingly in response to the increase in demand. So may I find out first from the Minister the current number of both licensed money-changers and remitters as compared to that of 17 years ago. I note that the Minister mentioned that the number of licensed money-changers has increased to 452 in 1995. May I clarify with the Minister whether this figure applies only to the money-changers or to both money-changers and remitters? What is the estimated value of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the money-changing transactions and what is the amount of remittance handled per day? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the money-changing and remittance businesses deal mainly with the man-in-the-street, it is therefore important to ensure that the Act remains effective in protecting the interests of the small customers and that these businesses are operated in a prudent and proper manner. In this context, I note that the Minister mentioned that there has been a rise in the number of complaints against money-changers and remitters from members of the public and tourists in recent years. May I ask the Minister to provide some specific data on the rise in such complaints? The Minister also reported a case where customers suffered a loss. May I also ask the Minister to report to this House whether there have been other cases where customers have suffered such losses as a result of default by the licensed remitters and, if so, what is the total amount of such losses? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to a few specific provisions of the Bill. Clause 3 requires the licensing of persons who wish to engage in money-changing or remittance business. I support this requirement as it is necessary to ensure the integrity of these two businesses and to prevent the man-in-the-street from being cheated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 requires a person who is granted a remittance licence to furnish a sum of $100,000 as security deposit with MAS. With the increase in remittance business, may I ask the Minister, would it be adequate for the security deposit to be set at this level, namely, $100,000? Another question is: why is there no minimum capital fund requirement imposed on remitters, and for that matter, on money-changers, to ensure that they would have sufficient funds to protect the interest of their customers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 introduces new section 17A which requires remitters to segregate funds received from customers for remittance from their own funds, and to deposit these customers' funds in a trust account \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with a bank. The segregation of customers' funds from the remitter's own funds is a good business practice for customer protection, and in preventing dishonest remitters from using the customers' funds for other purposes. The proposed penalty for contravening or failing to comply with the provisions of this clause is a fine of up to $50,000 or a jail term of up to two years, or both. May I find out from the Minister whether the penalty is appropriate in relation to the amount of remittance handled? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 requires the licensees to keep proper records of their transactions; in addition, clause 11 also introduces a new section 17B which requires the licensees to appoint external auditors to audit their businesses annually. These requirements would help to ensure that such businesses are run in a proper manner, and that records are kept to provide an audit trail of transactions, in order to deter illicit transactions from being conducted via such businesses. However, these requirements impose additional costs on the licensees. May I ask the Minister whether a standard form for such required information will be provided, and standard auditing procedures will be stipulated so as to ensure consistency and perhaps lower the additional costs involved? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of the proposed amendments, I believe that the standard and quality of money-changing and remittance businesses will improve significantly, and the interest of the public who make use of such services would be better protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the queries and clarifications, I fully support the amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Ow has asked about the change in numbers of money-changers and remitters between December 1979 and end of last year. In 1979, there were 240 money-changers. As at the end of December last year, there were 452. As far as remitters are concerned, there were 54 in 1979 and today there are 99. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow also wants to know what is the estimated value of the money-changing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> transactions and the amounts of remittance handled per day. Unfortunately, complete information on the volumes of money-changing and remittance businesses is not available as many of these businesses are small sole-proprietorships and participants are also engaged in other businesses such as provision shop and stationery shop transactions and therefore do not keep proper records of their transactions. This is especially so for the large number of small money-changers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for remittance businesses, the volumes vary widely, depending on whether the licensees conduct remittance business as their main business or as a secondary activity. Based on MAS' inspection of some remittance licensees, MAS has found that some of them who conduct remittance business as a secondary business handled only about $50,000 worth of remittance business a month. Some medium-sized licensees handle $500,000 worth of remittances monthly while some licensees whose main business is remittance can handle up to $3 million each per month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the provisions of the Bill is to require licensees to keep proper records of their transactions, MAS may consider asking licensees to submit periodic returns on their business volumes in order to have more accurate information on the size of this business in the future. However, the benefits of collecting these returns will have to be weighed against the additional cost that the licensees would have to incur in complying with the requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow has also asked whether there was data available on the rise of complaints against money-changers and remitters. The number of complaints against money-changers and remitters has increased from 10 in 1990 to 22 in 1995. In the first quarter of 1996 alone, six complaints were received. A number of the complaints against money-changers were made by tourists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether there were cases where customers suffered losses as a result of default by the licensed remitters and, if so, what are the amounts \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> involved. There was one case in 1991. Fortunately, the total number of such defaults has been relatively small. There was one case in 1991 where a foreign partner of a licensed remittance agency absconded with customers' funds amounting to $20,000. Prior to 1992, the security deposit for a remittance licence was only $10,000, so that the claimants could not be refunded in full. They eventually got back half of their remittance from the security deposit. Total losses of $10,000 were suffered by 34 customers of the licensee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these incidents, security deposit for remittance licence was increased from $10,000 to $50,000 in December 1991. Despite the increase in the security deposit, the number of remitters continues to increase and their scale of operations also expanded rapidly because of the large increase in the number of foreign workers. From MAS' inspection of remittance in late 1994, it was noted that some of the remitters handled more than $150,000 per month. Consequently, the security deposit was again raised to $100,000 in mid-1995. So far, we have not encountered many more defaults. So, hopefully, this $100,000 is sufficient for the time being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow also wants to know why there is no minimum capital fund requirements imposed on remitters and money-changers. Money-changers do not keep customers' funds as money-changing transactions are on-the-spot transactions. Therefore, there is no need to require money-changers to keep minimum capital funds to protect their customers' interest. They conduct on-the-spot cash transactions. In the case of remitters, they are required to furnish a security deposit of $100,000 in the form of bank guarantee. This is for the time being considered sufficient protection for the depositor rather than a minimum capital amount. The reason is because the minimum capital sum held by the company may not be entirely available for meeting defaults because if the remitter goes bankrupt, such capital funds would have to meet all the other creditors' requirement and only \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a portion will be available to protect the remitter's interest. So security deposit is a better form of insurance for the remitter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow has also asked whether the penalty for contravening section 17A is sufficient for the severity of the offence. MAS, following an inspection of remitters in late 1994, discovered, as I mentioned earlier, that some of the remitters were handling remittance of more than $150,000 per month. In view of this, the penalties were increased with a fine of $50,000 or jail of up to two years. MAS considers that these penalties are sufficiently stringent to deter licensees from breaching this requirement for the time being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ow is also concerned whether the requirement under section 17B for licensees to appoint external auditors may not increase their cost unnecessarily. Under this section, money-changers and remitters are required to keep and maintain records of all transactions of $10,000 and above by customers. The format for the register, which includes date of transaction, particulars of customer, and amount transacted, is stipulated by the MAS in a standard format. The records and register should be made available for inspection by the MAS from time to time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has also the power to prescribe auditing procedures but it has been the MAS' policy to leave this issue to the auditors themselves to set their own standards. If an auditor appointed does not meet his obligations according to MAS, the licensee will be required to appoint new auditors. The purpose of the proposed annual audit of licensees by external auditors is to ensure that the licensee complies with the relevant laws and regulations and the customers' funds are properly segregated and accounted for. While this may increase the operating cost of licensees, it is considered an essential measure to protect the interest of the public and the remitters, particularly against a background of increasing volume of money-changing and remittance businesses due to increase in tourist traffic and foreign worker traffic. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered Dr Ow's questions \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -- [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Objective</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Bill is to amend the Housing and Development Act to allow gazetted corporate bodies to buy HDB resale flats. For a start, only Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will be gazetted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rationale</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pressing need for JTC to meet the increasing demand for affordable housing among foreign professionals working in Singapore. As our Singapore economy grows, we need more skilled workers and management staff. Our local workforce is insufficient. We need to supplement with skilled foreign workers and professionals. The majority are either staying in HDB flats or private properties on a rental basis or have their own private accommodation arrangements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, HDB allows flat lessees who are unable to occupy their flats for valid reasons to sublet their whole flats. Currently, about 80% of the approved cases are rented to foreign workers. HDB also allows flat lessees to sublet their rooms provided they occupy at least one room in the flat for their own use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also provides assistance for the housing of foreign workers under two different housing schemes. The first scheme is the Integrated Non-Citizen Housing Scheme where interim housing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> on a two-year term tenancy basis is provided to employment-pass holders and skilled work permit holders while they look for permanent housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second scheme is the Dormitory Housing Scheme where HDB lets out flats to companies in the manufacturing and engineering and construction industries to house their foreign unskilled and semi-skilled workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for housing skilled foreign workers and professionals is rising. HDB's primary mission is to provide housing for our citizen families. It cannot cater to all the housing needs of the foreign workers. With so many Singaporeans on the HDB queue, it would not be justified to divert HDB's resources to build housing for skilled foreign workers and professionals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, one solution is for JTC to buy HDB flats from the resale market so as to rent out these flats to foreign professionals in the industry. However, the Housing and Development Act only provides for eligible individuals to purchase HDB flats. The Bill thus seeks to amend the Act to enable corporate bodies, such as JTC, to purchase flats in the resale market by order published in the Gazette. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Controls</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now cover the controls which we will put in place to ensure that the Bill is not likely to cause a significant impact on HDB resale prices nor create a social impact in the HDB estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, JTC will be buying resale flats in the open market. It will not be competing with Singapore citizens for the subsidised direct-purchased new HDB flats. Those in the waiting list for new flats therefore need not worry about their waiting period being affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as JTC is only buying a limited number of 3- and 4-room resale flats, its purchase should not unduly drive up HDB resale flat prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the flats under this scheme will not be for foreign workers in the construction, ship-repair or similar industries. These workers will be housed in separate dormitory housing sites. This scheme is meant to cater to the housing needs of other foreign professionals in Singapore, ie, the employment-pass holders required by companies to support their major expansion projects and start-ups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in terms of social behaviour, we do not expect any difficulties when these foreign professionals move into these flats. In any case, there is already a check in place to ensure that owners of HDB flats regulate the behaviour of their tenants. JTC will also come under such regulation. The Housing and Development Act allows HDB to compulsorily acquire the flats if there is abuse by the occupants of the flats or breach of the conditions stipulated in the lease. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill because I understand the need to house our foreign workers who come here to work and contribute to our economy. Yet I am also concerned that their presence in our HDB environment can create problems because they come from diverse social, educational, linguistic and political backgrounds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share my constituency's experience of housing foreign workers. I remember when I first became a Member of Parliament in 1980, I was saddled with many problems, apart from the sunken aprons which I mentioned to the Minister before. There was this problem of many foreign workers being housed in the HDB flats in Teban Gardens. A few of these blocks were given to companies to house their workers. These workers were factory workers and not construction workers, and some of them were fairly educated. And I can tell Members that it made my life very miserable as a young MP, I would say unbearable, because I received so many complaints from my residents about their social behaviour. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me share with Members some of the problems encountered. When you group workers together in a block, the social behaviour of these workers can be very disturbing and embarrassing. Disturbing, because they drink, play loud music, yell and shout, and often fight. Embarrassing, because the women block allocated to them became the centre of activity of ill-repute which I think is not nice to mention in this House. The nocturnal activity in this block created embarrassment to my residents living nearby. While I understand the need to house foreign workers, I feel that it is only fair that these workers be spread evenly in all constituencies because it is quite natural for a corporate body like JTC to want to house their workers in the constituencies within Jurong. Therefore, Ayer Rajah, Boon Lay, Jurong and even Yuhua will be having more foreign workers than the other constituencies. I believe there should be a quota of foreign workers in each constituency. Misery must be shared equally by all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, they should not be housed in big numbers in individual blocks. The experience I have related to the Minister and to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a very real one. Therefore, we should not house them in big numbers in individual blocks but spread them out, similar to the way we spread our races living in each block. In other words, we follow the racial mix proportion. There should also be a proportion of foreign workers in each block. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call for these changes because I remember that in the Committee of Supply debate, the Minister for National Development said that it was unlikely that these workers would be housed in new estates, like Pasir Ris. This again, I feel, is not fair as some old estates have image problems already. So we should not let these estates be further disadvantaged by too many foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I welcome his statement about the kind of foreign workers that will be housed in HDB flats. I am sure it has changed from the type of workers that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were housed in Teban estate many, many years ago. But we always start off with very ideal conditions. It will slowly deteriorate when more and more demands are made by companies wanting to house their foreign workers. Therefore, we may start off with foreign professional and skilled workers, but later we might have to house factory workers again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, allowing corporate bodies to purchase resale HDB flats will affect the HDB resale market depending on the number of such flats sold and bought. I wonder whether corporate bodies, like JTC, could buy flats from the resale market and also sell them on the resale market, or should they sell the resale flats back to HDB. Will there be a limit on the number of resale flats that corporate bodies are allowed to buy? I hope the Minister can give me some answers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while most of my concerns have been raised by Dr Tan, I have one request for the Minister to consider. Since there is a demand to house foreign workers, and we recognise that foreign workers have been contributing to the economy of Singapore, and the Ministry will allow JTC to buy HDB flats from the open market and rent them out, would the Minister also consider allowing the existing HDB dwellers, especially aged parents who are living with their children, who may not need to occupy the whole flat, to let out the whole flat to foreign workers as well? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Tan Cheng Bock for his support of the amendments. I would like to explain the changes in the approach to housing foreign workers over the years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan that, in the beginning, we have tended to concentrate the foreign workers within certain blocks. But if the Member will remember, we have undertaken some changes. For example, we have now let out land to some of the bigger companies to build dormitory housing for their own foreign workers so that this will be kept on the fringe of the housing estates and not in the middle of the housing estates. So companies, such \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> as Keppel, Sembawang, and a few of these big companies, are now building purpose-built dormitory housing for their own foreign workers, particularly in the marine engineering, shipbuilding and construction industries. So I think that category of foreign workers would now be housed increasingly away from the HDB estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the HDB estates, we have about 4,600 units for the dormitory housing. These are meant for foreign workers employed in the factories. We also have 1,000 units under the Integrated Non-Citizen Housing Scheme. This is meant for the professionals and the skilled workers. By and large, such workers do not create social problems within the estates. But we must again see it in perspective. This totals less than 6,000 units, which is less than 1% of our HDB flats. I cannot imagine how we could set a meaningful quota which is only 1%. So we are spreading it as evenly as we can, granted that the companies want to house their workers close to the industrial estates which are also spread out throughout Singapore, although they are concentrated in the Jurong area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that, first, we are catering to the different needs separately so there will be less social problems. Second, the number is very small, less than 1%, and even with the 1% we are spreading it out evenly. Third, JTC will be given a limit of not more than 1,000 units for the immediate future. If you look at 1,000 units out of the HDB resale market of 30,000 units per year, I can assure Members that this will not cause undue impact on the HDB resale market. It is only 1,000 units out of 30,000 units. And JTC will not be involved in the business of buying and selling these units. Their purpose is to buy these units and rent out to their foreign professionals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether we can allow individual lessees to rent out their flats entirely to foreign workers. We do so under fairly strict conditions, ie, if they are on medical grounds, they are working overseas, or if they are given quarters by their companies, and so on. If there are valid grounds for the lessees to rent out their flats entirely, they can apply to the HDB for permission to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether the Minister would be kind enough to keep Members of Parliament informed of the number of units that JTC has bought, say, in my constituency and also in Jurong and Boon Lay, and those close by to the Jurong Industrial Estate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Would the Minister consider allowing aged parents who are living with their children to let out the whole unit? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If aged parents living with the children have no use of the flat, then they could easily sell the flat in the resale market. This would keep the family intact and also make sure that the primary objective of HDB flats being owner-occupied is kept. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked whether we will keep him informed. I will let JTC know that they should try and buy units which are evenly distributed in Singapore. I will assure Dr Tan that JTC is not just targeting the Jurong area, because many of these foreign professionals, are meant for expansion of the electronic industry, eg, the wafer fabrication plants which are not primarily in the Jurong area. They will be in the Woodlands, Tampines and Paya Lebar areas. For a start, I do not think JTC will buy the majority of the 1,000 units in the Jurong area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TRANSFER OF THE NANYANG UNIVERSITY ALUMNI REGISTER BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the transfer from the National University \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of Singapore (NUS) to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) of that part of the NUS Register of Graduates which relates to the graduates and subscribers of the former Nanyang University. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of Nanyang University, commonly known as Nantah, in 1956 was an important milestone in Singapore's history. Over a period of 24 years, many young men and women have received a valuable education from the University and gone on to contribute to our society. Nantah graduates have played and will continue to play a big role in the political, social, cultural and economic life of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8th August 1980, the Nanyang University was merged with the former University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore. The Nanyang University register of graduates has since been kept with the NUS. The campus of Nanyang University was upgraded and redeveloped to house the Nanyang Technological Institute as part of the NUS. Students of the Institute were awarded NUS degrees until 1991 when the Institute became a full-fledged University, the Nanyang Technological University. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nantah Alumni retained a strong sentimental attachment to Nanyang University and to its former campus in Jurong where NTU is situated. The old Nantah campus, with its lake and garden and some distinctive buildings which have been conserved, provides a historical and emotional link between Nanyang University and the Nanyang Technological University. Many Nantah graduates have welcomed the Government's efforts to revive the Nantah spirit. These efforts include adopting the Chinese abbreviation of Nantah for NTU, opening of the Chinese Heritage Centre on the NTU campus and the erection of Nantah's archway in the campus garden. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association of Nanyang University graduates has proposed, and the Government has agreed to transfer the Nanyang University register of graduates \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from NUS to NTU. The Prime Minister announced this at NTU on 3rd June 1995 at the 4th Nantah Global Reunion Dinner which attracted a large turnout of Nantah graduates. By adopting NTU as the successor of Nanyang University, Nantah graduates can contribute to the further development of NTU. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the key aspects of the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill will enable the transfer from NUS to NTU of the registers containing the names of all persons who immediately before 8th August 1980 were members of the Guild of Graduates of Nanyang University or its subscribers. The register of all students in the academic year 1979/80 who had met all the requirements for graduation and received degrees of Nanyang University will also be transferred to NTU. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill empowers the Minister to make rules generally for the purpose of removing any difficulty which may arise from the transfer of the registers and other documents referred to in clause 3 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill consists of consequential amendments to the Nanyang Technological University Act and the National University of Singapore Act which are required to effect the transfer. It also provides for a representative from the former Nanyang University to sit on the NTU Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, from the time of its inception in 1956 to its merger to form the National University of Singapore in 1980, the Nanyang University had produced more than 10,000 graduates. These graduates are spread all over Singapore and Malaysia in the fields of industry and commerce, culture and education, and politics. In Singapore, many of these Nantah graduates have become middle-ranking and senior civil servants, teachers and managers. Their contributions in the social and economic development of Singapore are significant and cannot be ignored. No doubt, some \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> graduates have not been doing well in their career paths. Even then, they continue to work hard despite what others say about their ability. Over the past 40 years, Nantah graduates have become a strength to be reckoned with in the Singapore society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one thing that Nantah graduates cannot help brooding upon, that is, their alma mater is no longer in existence. Nantah was a university founded entirely by the community. It went through many bad patches in its initial period of founding. After it started, it received no recognition nor support from the Governemnt at that time, thereby giving rise to a lot of problems. Subsequently, owing to the gradual decline of student enrolment, Nantah had to merge with the then University of Singapore to form part of the National University of Singapore in 1980. Since then, graduates of the former Nantah have lost their sense of attachment, and every time the name of Nantah is mentioned, they just cannot help feeling a sense of regret. In 1982, the Government established the Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) on the former site of Nantah. In 1991, it was upgraded to become the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Despite this, many Nantah graduates still cannot accept the fact that Nantah has been thoroughly remoulded and transformed into the NTU. The love of Nantah graduates for their alma mater is completely justifiable and understandable. Like a mother who came from a humble origin without any qualifications, she is nevertheless their respected and beloved mother. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must be forward-looking. Nantah must have a new life to carry on its development to become an important institution in the tertiary education of our nation. As such, I urge all Nantah graduates to seriously consider the possibility that if the then Nantah was allowed to carry on without disruption and restructuring, it would have aimed to develop into a university with the same substance and magnitude of the present NTU. We must look at the present NTU as a continuation of the former Nantah. Otherwise, the glorious records of our forefathers toiling to found Nantah will gradually fall \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> into oblivion. The former Nantah and the present Nantah must be linked together so that Nantah can retain its place in the history of Singapore. The Government is now encouraging the use of the Chinese acronym Nantah (Nanyang University) instead of Li Da (Technological University) , and is allowing the Nanyang University Alumni Register to be transferred back to Nantah, thereby showing, once again, that the Government treasures the past contributions of Nantah, and understands the feelings of the Nantah graduates. As graduates of Nantah, we should support this decision for the proposed transfer of the Alumni Register. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Transfer of the Nanyang University Alumni Register Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare my interest both as a member of the NTU Council and as the President of the NTU Alumni. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was amongst the first pioneer batch of undergraduates at the then NTI. Although many of us in that batch had the choice of opting to pursue a second year engineering course at the NUS, we opted to pursue a course at NTI which occupied the campus of the former Nanyang University. We were attracted to NTI because of the promise of a practice-oriented curriculum and because of the charm and tranquil of the former Nanyang campus. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are well aware of the exemplary Nantah spirit and the sweat and toil of the relentless efforts of the Chinese community in setting up the Nanyang University. As the Minister has just pointed out, in 1980, the Government had to make a very difficult decision to close Nanyang University and merge it with the University of Singapore to become what is known as the National University of Singapore. Nevertheless, the Chinese community organizations donated the sprawling campus at Jurong to the Government. The then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, later agreed to retain the name Nanyang when NTI was set up in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 1981 at the same campus. Although NTI, and now NTU, is characteristically a different university from Nanyang University and although the graduates from these two institutions are a generation apart, the name \"Nanyang\" and the campus provide the nexus for the two institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am told that there is a Chinese saying and I think it reads like this: ying shui si yuan ( ) which means that you must remember the source of the water you drink. So the graduates of NTI and NTU recognise the history of our campus and are happy to support the Government's move to transfer the alumni rolls of former Nanyang University graduates to that of the NTU Register of Graduates. Although earlier some of the pioneer graduates had some reservations about this transfer, the NTU Alumni Committee has since met the NTU administration and the Association of Nantah Graduates to discuss the issue and now the NTU graduates understand the need for this and are supportive of this move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill is passed in Parliament, the NTU Alumni (Association) will make the necessary amendments to its constitution to allow Nanyang graduates to join the alumni association as ordinary members. The NTU Alumni plans to set up an umbrella organisation called the NTU Alumni Council within the next year, which would comprise a network of affiliated Alumni organisations from NTI or NTU, such as faculty alumni clubs, hostel alumni clubs, and other society or special interest alumni clubs. The Association of Nantah Graduates will in due course be invited to be an affiliate of the NTU Alumni Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the Nantah graduates will join the present Alumni to lend support to the development of NTU and especially to the University Endowment Fund. The Nantah graduates should rejuvenate their Nantah spirit and together with the present alumni help NTU to grow from strength to strength to become a world class university. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I am honoured to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on matters relating to the Nanyang University (Nantah), I have complex feelings about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nantah was established with the support of people from all walks of life and under extremely difficult circumstances. It has nurtured many of us in Singapore. Unfortunately, at the time when she was at her last gasp and on the verge of death, we would only look on helplessly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to express my condolence on Nantah's demise with the following words: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty years ago, when we had yet to own this piece of land, our sagacious forefathers stood up to make a clarion call for the establishment of Nanyang University for the future of the children of the Chinese Community. At that time, the sense of righteousness soared to the skies. Under the suppression of the colonial government, no matter how high the mountain was or how deep the water may be, Nantah stood up proudly high on the hill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we became master of our own land, some people said Nantah -- nan da -- would be difficult to grow up. With firm support of the people, it witnessed the changes in stormy and unstable political situations for more than 20 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the rule of power politics, the wind and the clouds changed colour, and Nantah was relegated to that of a third-class university. The final curtain fell, and it became history. Heaven was silent and people were dumbfounded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the long-lost souls of Nantah, which were forced into oblivion by circumstances, received the call of Yunnan Campus to revive the spirit of Nantah so as to become a witness for history. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passing of the seasons, changes have taken place with the tides of vicissitudes. Those people who had put a rest to the history of Nantah, are now thinking of re-compiling the history. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nantah , feel no qualms, owes no apology to anybody. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest in peace! Nantah. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although what is past is past, history can never be wiped away. Let history pass the final judgement on the course of Nanyang University. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the transfer of register, which is the subject matter of this debate, it is something that has to happen and one which offers no alternative. If it has to be done, it just has to be done! I support the transfer of register of Nantah graduates to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). At least, that was the origin of Nanyang University. Let the fallen leaves return to the roots! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I support the Bill. However, I would like to make a request to the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that when the two Universities were merged, more than the Register of Students were transferred to the Singapore University. One of those properties transferred included the collection of art pieces, paintings and museum pieces. If I am not wrong, they are now still the property of Singapore University, now known as NUS. I hope that the Minister would take recognition of this and make certain provision to return these collections to the NTU because these art pieces were donated by well-wishers and supporters of Nanyang University who had the intention that these pieces be housed in the old building. Now that their home is in NUS, I hope the Minister will take my request into consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, history is an on-going evolution. In the process of all these changes, there are always some things which are inevitable. So I believe that our pioneers who founded Nantah would understand this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the motto of our alma mater was \"constantly striving to become stronger\". This is the basic spirit of Nantah. This maxim that originated from the Yiqing (Book of Changes) encourages us that notwithstanding the changes in history and circumstances, if we can \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> constantly strive to become stronger, we will be able to continuously manifest this spirit of Nantah, in the new circumstances, and to manifest the great tradition of the Chinese civilization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the upgrading of Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) to Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and its subsequent decision to use the acronym of Nantah, I think the proposed transfer of the Alumni Register is logical and rational. It is also in conformity with the wishes of the majority of the graduates of the former Nanyang University (Nantah). Although Nantah was closed down in 1980, I believe that more than 10,000 Nantah graduates still have their hearts and feelings attached to the Yunnan Garden Campus. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the closing down of the former Nantah, the Alumni Register was transferred to NUS. But I believe that most Nantah graduates find that they have difficulty identifying themselves with NUS. Although their name is with the Register of NUS, it actually exists in name only. The feeling is not there at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the transfer of the Alumni Register back to Nantah, I think it would, at least, be useful in reviving the sense of belonging of these Nantah graduates. Personally, I hope that we would be able to start all over again to cultivate and restore the Nantah spirit. This is the biggest challenge ahead of us. If we can have the support of these 10,000-odd former graduates of Nantah, I think the chances of success in reviving the Nantah spirit are very great. If we can have the support of all these Nantah graduates, the chances of the present Nantah being developed into something comparable to the MIT or Harvard University of the USA will be better. For this reason, I support this transfer of the Register. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon South)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, originally I did not intend to speak today, but having heard the speeches of Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Goh Choon Kang, I feel that I have to say a few words. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low, I believe, was among the last batch of Nantah graduates. Mr Goh was in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one of the intermediate batches, and I was from the first batch of Nantah graduates. Just now, Mr Low read, in Parliament, an elegiac address on the demise of Nantah. I think this is 15 years overdue. It is out of time and not relevant now. Mr Goh mentioned that Nantah was closed down. I think they are both wrong. At that time, Nantah was not closed down. Nantah was then merged with the University of Singapore to become the National University of Singapore (NUS). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned just now that it was the training in Nantah that enabled him to become a successful MP in this House. I think that was the success of Nantah. The merger between Nantah and the University of Singapore was a decision taken after a long time of deliberation. With the merger, the National University of Singapore (NUS) was formed. Consequently, the registers of Nantah graduates and University of Singapore Alumni were transferred to the NUS. It is a natural course of event. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Ker mentioned just now, all these years, the graduates of Nantah are still very attached to the old campus and the old university, and this sense of attachment has not faded away with the passage of time. On the contrary, with the establishment of the Nanyang Technological Institute, and its subsequent upgrading to Nanyang Technological University, these sentiments have become stronger and stronger. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Association of Nanyang University Graduates suggested to the Prime Minister to consider transferring the names of the Guild of Graduates of the former Nanyang University from the Register of Graduates of the NUS to the Register of Graduates of the NTU. One of the reasons was, as mentioned by Mr Goh Choon Kang just now, that graduates of Nantah still have their sentiments attached to the former Nantah campus in Jurong, and could not identify themselves with NUS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, at the re-union dinner attended by Nantah graduates from all over the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> world, the Prime Minister announced that he had agreed to the suggestion. That is the reason why we have this Bill before the House for the Second and Third Readings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Nantah to NUS and back to Nantah again, I think we can use two idioms in Chinese to describe this process. They are the idioms mentioned by Mr Sinnakaruppan and Mr Low Thia Khiang. The first idiom: yin shui si yuan [ ] when you drink water, think of the source). That describes the feelings of Nantah graduates and how they cherish the memory of the former Nantah. The proposed transfer of register can be said to be luo ye gui gen [ ] (return of the fallen leaves to the roots). So, from yin shui si yuan to luo ye gui gen, this is indeed a story with a happy ending! I do not know why Mr Low Thia Khiang is still so querulous. I believe that the majority of Nantah graduates will support the transfer of Register, and I believe that, in future, Nantah graduates will make greater contributions to the future development of the present Nantah. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I wish to thank all Members for speaking in support of the Bill. I sense that there is overwhelming support of this Bill, which is regarded as a natural development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example. Last year when this reunion dinner was held in the Nantah grounds, a total of 5,700 Nantah graduates attended the function, including 1,400 from overseas. This is out of a total of about 11,000 Nantah graduates. So it goes to show that the Nantah spirit is still very strong and alive. After our Prime Minister had given his speech announcing this transfer of the rolls to NTU, there was in fact a standing ovation for him when he left the grounds. I think on the whole there is tremendous support and I look forward to the support by the Nantah graduates to develop NTU into a world class university. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Koh Lip Lin has clarified, it is actually not true to say that Nantah has closed and merged with SU to form NUS. In fact, both universities closed and merged, if you like. That is why in the NUS Bill we had to rescind both Acts and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> re-enact the NUS Act to form the merged University. As a result, you have NTI which remained on the NTU Campus and gradually developed into NTU, the successor university to Nantah, and the present NUS is in fact the successor to SU. So we should all look forward and not look back to the past, not to the reasons, the pains, sorrows and unhappiness of that time. I think many of the things that happened were the result of the economic situation and parental choice, that is, parents wanted their children to study English. They could see that in the context of Singapore people need to have a good command of English to get on in life and for our links with the world. Now that China is becoming stronger, in fact, the study of Chinese is becoming very important and the present Nantah is also emphasising the study of Chinese through its Chinese Language Centre, and so on. I think all this is very good for the future development of NTU. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of going back to recount what was given to NUS and what was taken out, which I think is pointless, we should all look forward to the future of NTU and not discuss whether certain pieces were transferred to NUS and should now be returned. It is very difficult to separate what has gone there, and what has been given. For example, now NTU has acquired the National Institute of Education (NIE) and there is further development to house the NIE, and the Government is pumping in so much money into the new NTU. So if there is a need to develop NTU further, let us develop it further; let us not look back and say this is ours, this is yours, separate them, and get the accounts straight. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the museum, in fact, the NUS has further built on that museum and has acquired a lot of new art pieces. So it is very difficult now to say whether it is an original museum or a new museum. The main thing is we are going to provide an exhibition area. NUS is going to provide a new exhibition area where this art collection could be displayed and could serve to be a place where students can go and learn about culture and arts and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> round off their education. This will be displayed in an area which is easily accessible to students as well as the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank Mr Sinnakaruppan for supporting the Bill. I think it is important for the NTU graduates to realise that it is good for the University to have this support from the Nantah graduates. The linkage is beneficial on both sides. For the Nantah graduates, they can feel that now there is a rebirth of their old university on a new campus and that eventually it will grow into a world-class university. On the part of the NTU graduates, they can look forward to the support from the old Nantah graduates and also to the long history and tradition, and the Nantah spirit that supports the old university. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -- [Mr Lee Yock Suan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Over the years, the Charter has been amended to address emerging social issues and changing expectations of the public. The last amendments were made in 1980. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry undertook the review of the Women's Charter following feedback from the courts in 1993 about inherent limitations of some of its provisions. A \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> wide spread of views, including those from other Ministries, the Committee on the Family, the courts, some women's organisations and professionals, were sought during the review. The Bill before the House today is the outcome of this comprehensive review. Though extensive, the amendments do not affect the spirit of the legislation. Indeed, in our view, they strengthen the intent of the Charter. The proposed amendments touch on nine areas. Let me deal with each of them briefly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 1: Marriage within prohibited degrees</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to amend section 10(2) to give clarity to the discretionary powers of the Minister to allow marriages between related parties. The amendment clarifies that notwithstanding the kindred or affinity of the parties, the Minister can allow marriage between the two parties if such a marriage would have been permitted by the law, religion, custom or usage applicable to the parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 2: Marriage for persons who have undergone reassignment procedure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill proposes a new section 11A to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) clarify that a marriage solemnised in Singapore or elsewhere between two persons of the same sex shall be void; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) recognise the new sex of a person who has undergone sex reassignment procedure and accept the reassigned sex as stated in a person's identity card as conclusive evidence of his or her sex; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) allow persons who have undergone sex reassignment procedure to marry and to declare past and future marriages of such persons to be valid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that this amendment has raised some concerns among some members of the public. The issue is indeed a complex one and touches on moral, cultural and religious values. Sir, permit me to explain the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> proposed amendments which were made after much discussion and deliberation with several parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex reassignment procedure has been allowed in Singapore since 1971. A person who has successfully completed a sex reassignment procedure has to change his or her identity card to reflect the new sex and identity. A small group of individuals in Singapore have indeed undergone the procedure and have had their identity cards changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1991, things changed for this group of trans-sexuals who had married when the High Court ruled in the case of Lim vs Hiok that the Women's Charter did not permit marriage between two persons of the same biological sex. Until the ruling, the Registry of Marriages had all along accepted the identity card as documentary proof of the identity and sex of a person. Those who had undergone sex reassignment procedure were able to marry using their identity cards which reflected their new sex. Following the 1991 court ruling, the Registry of Marriages stopped allowing the use of identity cards and began to require applicants to bring their birth certificates as evidence of their sex instead. For those who got married before the ruling, the court's decision meant that their marriages are now void. And if they have adopted children, the status of these children is now uncertain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must emphasise that the proposed amendments are not meant to institute a new practice. Rather they are to reinstate what was the position before 1991. The Government's stand is very clear: it is not a move to encourage or promote lesbianism, homosexuality, transvestism or sex reassignment among our people. We do not believe the amendments will result in our people reassigning their sex in droves. The Bill basically seeks a practical and humane approach to address the problems faced by this group of people and the families they have set up. It is to allow these individuals to lead a life according to their new status, as recorded in their identity cards, as we have all along used the NRIC to verify identity. It is practical. It is sensible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex reassignment is a costly, painful and long process. A person has to undergo extensive psychological and physical assessment by psychologists and doctors to assess his or her need for sex reassignment to function better and more comfortably. Only when it is deemed necessary by the professionals is a person allowed to proceed with the sex reassignment procedure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate that the amendment will apply only to civil marriages and not to Muslim marriages which are governed by a different set of laws, ie, the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). Islam prohibits sex reassignment and does not recognise marriages between people who have undergone sex reassignment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 3: Protection of family</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of amendments deals with protection against family violence. There are existing provisions in the Women's Charter for the protection of spouses and children under sections 68 to 70 of the Charter. Clause 10 proposes the insertion of a new Part VIA entitled \"Protection of the Family\" comprising new sections 60A to 60D. Clause 13 seeks to repeal the existing sections 68 to 70 as these are incorporated in the new Part VIA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government takes a very serious view of family violence. While the amendments are intended to give a strong signal that family violence and bullying will not be tolerated, they also provide opportunities for families, victims and perpetrators to heal family relationships which have been hurt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Part VIA extends protection to other family members as well, such as parents, parents-in-law, siblings and any other relative which the court considers to be a family member. It also provides for a wider coverage of the term \"family violence\" and consequently the categories of behaviour in respect of which protection can be sought. However, the term does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or to correct the behaviour of a child below 21 years of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 60B allows for a protection order to be made based on the \"balance of probabilities\" that violence has been or is likely to be committed instead of the criminal burden of proof \"beyond reasonable doubt\". This will make it easier for a victim to obtain a protection order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also empower the court to include other conditions in a protection order such as requiring the perpetrator to go for counselling. Sir, counselling can often help the perpetrators to change his or her behaviour and help families to reconcile. Penalties for breach of a protection order are explicitly spelt out in the proposed amendments. Contravention of a counselling order is punishable as contempt of court, while contravention of the other orders is deemed to be a seizable offence, thus attracting fines or imprisonment or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also allow an application for protection order to be made by another person on behalf of a child below 21 years of age or an incapacitated person. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 60C provides for the issue of an expedited order if the court is satisfied that there is imminent danger of family violence being committed against the applicant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 60D deals with supplementary provisions and the making of Rules of Court and empowers the court to vary, suspend or revoke an order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family violence should not be treated as any other offence. It involves members who are bound by blood or marital ties and who still need to interact with or depend on one another. The amendments allow for a softer approach through counselling. However, where a perpetrator is not likely to be compliant, the new provisions allow for tougher penalties to be imposed on the perpetrator. If necessary and where even tougher measures are deemed necessary, a perpetrator can then be charged under the Criminal Procedure Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides legislation, a multi-pronged approach is needed to address family \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> violence. Steps are being taken to put in place a network of support for victims and families. The police have worked out new procedures to guide police officers in handling family violence cases. Training is also being conducted to enhance the skills of the police and social workers in the management of such cases. Indeed, Sir, it so happens that a course on the training of social workers starts today which is being funded by my Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 4: Maintenance of wife and children and Enforcement of maintenance orders</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 11, 14 to 17 and 21 and 22 seek to enhance the provisions for the maintenance of wife and children and the enforcement of attachment orders to reduce the hardship of spouses and children who are dependent on the maintenance payments. The amendments also extend the definition of \"earnings\" to include payments received from self-employment. They also expand existing provisions to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) allow a child of any age to receive maintenance from the parent if he is unable to maintain himself, for example, if he is incapacitated; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) include additional circumstances which the court should take into consideration when ordering maintenance, ie, age of each party, duration of marriage and contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) empower the court to refer parties for mediation or counselling and to award costs as it deems fit for an application of an attachment of earnings order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 seeks to double the penalty from $1,000 to $2,000 for failure by an employer or defendant to notify changes in employment and earnings after an attachment order has been made. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 5: Matrimonial assets</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to repeal section 106 and to re-enact a new section 106 to provide for a more equitable and just \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> division of matrimonial assets upon the breakdown of a marriage. Under the existing provisions, there is a dichotomy between \"sole\" and \"joint\" efforts in the acquisition of matrimonial assets. If a homemaker has made a small financial contribution to the acquisition of the assets, his or her share would be considered under the \"joint efforts\" head and is constrained by the size of the contribution made by him or her. The homemaking efforts are ignored. However, if the homemaker did not make any contribution to the acquisition of the assets, the homemaking efforts are taken into consideration as his or her claim would be brought under the \"sole effort\" head. In this instance, the homemaker is better off not making any financial contribution to the acquisition of the assets. The amendments aim to remove this anomaly as a strict interpretation of the provisions could lead to very absurd results. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the new section provides for the definition of matrimonial assets and enables the court to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case in the division of matrimonial assets. These include the contributions made by the parties to the welfare and care of the family and the needs of their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also empower the court to make other orders and to give directions which are necessary or expedient to give effect to any order. It also empowers the court to extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order or conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 6: Order for custody of children</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 seeks to amend section 119 to empower the court to refer parties in a custody dispute for mediation and counselling. This is to allow parties involved to reach a more amicable decision in the interest of the children who, more often than not, are adversely affected by such disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment 7: Offences against women and girls</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 and 25 deal with certain offences against women and girls. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Carnal connection offence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current section 140(4), a first offender of an offence of carnal connection can be let off if he is not more than 24 years old and if he can show that he has reasonable cause to believe that the girl was 16 years of age or older. Clause 24 seeks to lower the age allowable for such a defence to 21 years and below for a first offender. In other words, the offender cannot now use that defence if he is more than 21 years old. There is no rationale to set the age at 24 when the age of majority is 21 years old. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Proceedings to be heard in camera</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 seeks to empower the court to order trials for offences of aggravated outraging of modesty and incest to be heard in camera as is the case now for trials involving rapes and offences against girls below 16 years of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Board of Visitors and Discharge Committee</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 26 and 27 seek to amend sections 178 and 179 to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) give flexibility to the Minister to determine the size and composition of the Board of Visitors and the Discharge Committee and to direct the Board to visit any welfare institution which is not established as a place of safety under section 177 of the Women's Charter; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) confer certain powers on the Board; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) make it an offence any refusal to admit a member of the Board, the Director of Social Welfare and other authorised officers or any hindrance to the performance of their duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, up to 12 members can be appointed by the Minister for the Board and seven for the Discharge Committee. A number of new homes have been established for the reception of children and women and girls. The ability of the Board to extend its functions to these homes will be constrained by the number on its Board. The amendments will allow the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Minister to increase the size of these two bodies should there be a need to extend the functions of the two bodies to more homes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Consequential Amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments proposed are either consequential amendments arising from the proposed amendments or technical developments which make reference to these provisions obsolete. For example: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the deletion of the words \"Po Leung Kuk Fund\" and \"register of marriages\" in various sections of the Women's Charter as they are obsolete; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) removal of the requirement to place a copy of the rules made under the Women's Charter to be transmitted to the President; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) change the means through which notices of marriage are brought to the attention of the public, from posting on the notice board to a computerised multi-media terminal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, the proposed amendments would affect individuals and the well-being of children and families. In proposing the amendments, my Ministry hopes to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) provide greater protection for those who are vulnerable; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) help families in crisis work out their difficulties in an amicable way; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) ensure that errant husbands take greater responsibility for the care of their dependent children and estranged wives; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) provide a fairer, more equitable and objective treatment of maintenance and matrimonial assets in the event of a family break-up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have informed this House during the debate on the Family Violence Bill that I would be prepared to refer this Bill to a Select Committee for deliberation. This position still holds. My Ministry has received mainly positive reactions to the Bill following its First reading. I appreciate that the amendments will have an impact \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> on many people and are therefore of concern to the public. Referring this Bill to a Select Committee will provide an opportunity for those who want to give their views to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under discussion and the remaining item on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WOMEN'S CHARTER (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Women's Charter was passed in 1961. This is a very progressive piece of legislation to protect the interests of women. This Amendment Bill is in keeping with the changes of our time and our society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard what the Minister has said, I feel that the important aspect of this Amendment Bill that deserves our full support is its spirit. This is to say that we not only look after the individual's interest but that this Amendment Bill also extends the protection to cover members of the immediate family. It protects not only the women but also the children, the spouses, as well as the parents and sisters, etc. Personally, I feel that this is a good way to manifest our family values. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to support is that this Bill further extends protection to the family and defines the equal status and obligations of husband and wife, protects the rights of the weak, and gives the court greater power to deal with incidents of family violence. More significantly, a new chapter is added to the Women's Charter, ie, Protection of Family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to make some comments on the three major points of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this Amendment Bill, that is, maintenance, distribution of matrimonial assets and protection to victims of family violence. The salient point on maintenance is that the court is now empowered to grant maintenance to children above the age of 21 years who are incapable of looking after themselves. This is very good because, whether parents are divorced or not, as parents, they have the responsibility to maintain their children and see to it that they are given the opportunity to be educated. This amendment will ensure that the children who are still in school will not lose their educational opportunity as a result of separation or divorce of their parents. At the same time, the amendment provides that intellectually handicapped children will continue to receive maintenance from their parents even when they are above 21 years of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also strengthens the enforcement of maintenance orders issued by the court, and it re-defines \"earnings\" so as to include payments received from self-employment. That is to say, apart from the employees, the income of those self-employed people will also be included within the definition of \"earnings\". A defendant and his employer who fail to notify changes of employment and earnings shall be guilty of an offence and the fine is increased from $1,000 to $2,000. This amendment will reduce the risk of divorced women having to play \"hide-and-seek\" with their ex-husbands to chase for maintenance. It will also help them to reduce the cost of having to keep on instructing lawyers to apply for enforcement orders from the court.. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I feel is even more important is that maintenance includes not only for the wife and children, but also for the parents and members of the immediate family. After the amendment, the parties will have to subject themselves to counselling or mediation, so that the couple who are contemplating divorce proceedings may have another opportunity to attempt reconciliation. The court will have the power to compel the couple to go for mediation and counselling with the hope of an amicable settlement to their differences. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of maintenance, I have a minor clarification to seek from the Minister. My question is: When the husband defaults in payment of maintenance and is sent to prison for contempt of court, the wife, particularly if she is a plain housewife, may face financial difficulties. In the circumstances, what kind of assistance can be given to such a family? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is when the parents are not prepared to appeal for maintenance for their children, the Amendment Bill makes no mention as to whether children who are above 21 years can apply direct to the court for their own maintenance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with concerns the distribution of matrimonial assets. The amended section 106(1) provides a more equitable basis for the division of matrimonial assets upon the breakdown of a marriage by empowering the court to divide between the parties to the marriage the matrimonial assets in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable, taking into consideration not only the financial contributions by the parties but also the contributions towards the welfare of the family, particularly contributions in looking after members of the family, the aged or incapable parents and/or siblings of either the husband or the wife. I think this amendment is a great protection to housewives and women who have no source of income. But some women leaders and women organizations have raised one point with me and that is under the old law, it was clearly provided that when making the order to divide the matrimonial assets, the court shall make the division in equal terms to the parties. The amended section empowers the court to exercise its discretion with due consideration to the respective contributions of the parties towards the welfare of the family. That is correct. However, they are worried that with the removal of words to that effect, there may be discrepancies in the division of matrimonial assets by the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on the amendment relating to the protection of family. I fully support this new Part VIA of the Women's Charter. The protection given here is not confined to spouses and children, but the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> scope is expanded to include other members of the family, that is, including parents, siblings and even some intellectually handicapped members of the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section also enables the victims to obtain a protection order much faster and this will encourage people, who in the past did not dare to lodge a complaint against the aggressor, to seek the help of the court. At the same time, the voluntary counsellors will be able to give them proper counselling and guidance. I think this is good. However, my concern is that although the Women's Charter is to protect the victims and at the same time it does not want to involve police intervention unnecessarily, we should not overlook the role that can be played by the police in the protection of victims of family violence. Now with the extension of the scope of protection to family members, there may be more people seeking the help of the police in future. The Government, in particular the Ministry of Community Development, will have to meet an increasing demand for help for the victims of family violence. There is no mention in the Amendment Bill about what the Government will do in this respect, eg, improvement to the quality of counselling, the organizational structure and other operational measures to cope with the additional tasks. I would therefore like to ask the Minister how the Ministry of Community Development, the police and the counsellors would coordinate with one another to effectively carry out their duties in mediation and counselling. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with is that there are now provisions for members of the family or relatives of the children or handicapped persons, or the personnel designated by the Minister to apply to the court for protection order on behalf of the victims. However, sometimes these children or handicapped persons may not have any relative or other members of the family to make this application on their behalf. Sometimes, the aggressor may be the guardian himself. In such circumstances, the victims may have problem getting people to help them in getting the protection order. I would like to ask the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Minister whether he will consider appointing community leaders, voluntary organizations in the community or responsible persons of the family service centres as the people authorized to apply for protection order on behalf of the victims. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the Amendment Bill has placed great emphasis on mediation and counselling. I would like to ask the Minister what sort of plan we have in the future for the training of counsellors, and what sort of protection and safeguards will be given to the counsellors when they deal with such family disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the Minister has agreed to refer the Bill to a Select Committee for further deliberation. I fully support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, I share the viewpoints raised by the GPC Chairman of Community Development, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon. I also welcome the recommendation by the Minister to refer the amendments to the Women's Charter to a Select Committee. This is very important because it gives an opportunity for various organisations and individuals to provide inputs to further fine-tune the amendments which have been proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to the Women's Charter are indeed timely, as it will provide relief to many mothers who are affected by problems of marriage. What is most important is that the amendments proposed will deal with the various contemporary issues related to marriage problems, particularly failures of marriage leading to domestic violence, neglect, protection for women and also failure to maintain the spouses. In this case, Sir, many of the spouses are in fact women and children who are helpless. This is an important move and the amendments address these problems. In the course of my work with many families, the issue is how to deal with wife abuse and neglect in terms of maintenance by the male spouse himself. The amendments do take care of the problems arising out of these areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that even with the best legislation and the best of intention, it will not be able to solve all the problems of marriage. So the best panacea is for the problems to be solved and mediated by the spouses themselves. If the spouses can resolve the problems, then there is no necessity for the problems to be taken through the legal process because it is going to be time-consuming and resource depletion. It is going to be a very painful process. The best thing is to find mediation for this whole process. I am glad that the Ministry is making attempts to try and get the problems mediated through counselling and dialogues between spouses before solving the problems at the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two areas that I am basically concerned about. These are related to the amendments proposed. The first is the provision on the recognition of marriages for those who have undergone sex reassignment. There has been some controversy by various groups about this issue. The basic concern is the erosion to the institution of marriage. Are we indeed giving a signal that we support this direction?. If we are not, it is very important for the Ministry to debunk this notion that we are endorsing and allowing the institution of marriage to be eroded. I do sympathise with people who have undergone sex reassignment. It is a human problem and therefore we should be sympathetic. But what is most important is for us to set up, at least a board, to review the impact of these changes, and whether more people would be seeking sex reassignment is a question which we all do not know. It would be important for us to monitor the impact of these changes. I want to know from the Minister whether his Ministry would be establishing a board to review the impact of these changes that are to come. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area of concern is that we may have very good legislation to deal with domestic problems, maintenance of spouses and problems related to abuse, but there is always a time lag between taking legal recourse and the intervening action to deal with the problems. So what I am asking is, despite the good legal provisions, whether the Ministry has the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> adequate machinery available to intervene immediately in the problems faced particularly by mothers who are not maintained and who are affected by domestic violence. It is important to intervene immediately in this problem area because they are most affected and aggrieved. We must be able to respond quickly to deal with the problems and relieve them of the distress. I think that is the crucial issue at hand. So I am asking the Minister whether his Ministry would be working very closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs and other social service agencies to ensure early intervention to tackle these problems as quickly as possible. Otherwise, we may have very good amendments but the problems are not resolved immediately. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin :</b> Sir, the Women's Charter is the major statute governing marriage and family relationships of non-Muslim Singaporeans. Therefore, the move to make major amendments to the Women's Charter is a very momentous event as it will affect and shape the fabric of our society. This legislation deserves the attention of all of us -- both inside and outside the House. Therefore, I would like to thank the Minister for agreeing to send this Bill to a Select Committee for further consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest right at the outset that the Women's Charter is not an appropriate name for this legislation as it does not reflect the spirit of the legislation. The Women's Charter actually deals with family law. This becomes even more obvious when we look at some of the proposed amendments -- those dealing with family violence and the marriage of transsexuals. Do these concern only women? Of course, not. They concern the family. Therefore, what we should be doing is to incorporate the present Women's Charter and all other legislation dealing with the family, for example, the Maintenance of Parents Act, and make one big legislative effort and call it the Family Charter. However, in incorporating the Women's Charter into the Family Charter, we will first have to remove Part X from the Women's Charter because this section deals mainly with offences relating to prostitution and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> therefore Part X has no place in either the Women's Charter or the Family Charter. Part X of the present Women's Charter rightfully belongs to the Penal Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Family Charter that I am proposing should be meaningful to all of us. Therefore, the drafting of this Family Charter should include the expression of the five core family values as ideals that have been accepted by all of us in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Family Charter will not only be the law to regulate family relationships and behaviour but it will also promote values and beliefs that our society holds dear. We would thus have a living and organic document that is of relevance to all of us. Of course, to enable this to happen, we must draft the legislation in ordinary understandable and readable English and translate it into all the official languages. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step would be to have this document -- the Family Charter -- studied in schools, colleges and other educational institutes and also studied during national service. Every child, man and woman should become familiar with the ethos and principles of this legislation and try to live by its creed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to turn to some of the provisions in the present Women's Charter and the proposed amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage, for some people, is not only a union of the bodies but also a union of the souls. However, in the present local context, this cosmic view of marriage is not what many young people believe in. Instead, most pragmatic young people think of marriage as a matrimonial partnership, both in the emotional and economic sense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Women's Charter first came into existence in 1961, only one in five women was in the workforce, but now women constitute 40% of the labour force. Half of the married women are working. But if you look at the younger women, Sir, the married female labour force participation rate is much higher, at 65%. Not only do we have more and more dual income families, but the husband and wife are both better educated. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, 70% of both brides and grooms (non-Muslim) had at least secondary education. Also, in 1994, 28% of brides with secondary qualifications married grooms with below secondary qualifications. Similarly, 37% of brides with upper secondary and 28% with tertiary qualifications married downwards in 1994. In the same year, 98% of grooms and 82% of brides were working. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present day reality is that most wives work and some of them earn more than their husbands. We have to keep this picture in our mind as the context in which we should be amending our matrimonial legislation. If we do not do this, then our amendments will be outmoded and irrelevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, for the modern young couple, a marriage is an emotional union and an economic partnership. Fortunately, some parts of the present Women's Charter are very progressive and reflect this aspiration of marriage as a partnership. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 45 enunciates a vision of the equal partnership of the spouses, and I quote: \"The husband and wife shall have equal rights in the running of the matrimonial households.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 46 does away with the outmoded belief that the wife's domicile by virtue of marriage is determined by the husband's domicile. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under section 61, not only a father but also a mother can be ordered by the court to maintain a legitimate or an illegitimate child financially. All these three sections affirm that marriage is a partnership inclining towards equality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Sir, we have to keep three facts in mind: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The general sense of equality expressed in the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The idea of marriage as a partnership which is espoused as an ideal by the younger generation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That most younger wives are in the workforce and a sizable number earn as much, if not more, than their husbands. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is these realities that must be reflected in the Women's Charter and the amendments if the legislation is to make sense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not satisfactory if there is a gulf between people's expectation of family life and the provision in family law legislation. Prof. Leong Wai Kum, who is from the National University of Singapore and a legal expert in marriage and family law, put this sentiment very succinctly when she said, and I quote, 'We respect a family law more when it mirrors our lives and hopes.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I would like to point out some inconsistencies in the Women's Charter. On the one hand, the Charter treats the woman as a non-economic unit. Section 61 and section 107 empower the Court to order the husband to maintain his wife or ex-wife but not the other way round. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the other hand, when it comes to the maintenance of children, the wife is treated as an economic unit. This is spelt out in section 122(3) and section 61(2). The Court can order the women to maintain her legitimate or illegitimate child. Thus, either or both parents have a duty to maintain a child. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time for us, Sir, to have consistency in the law. Furthermore, we must also reflect the reality of the wife as an economic unit as earlier figures that I quoted show very clearly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have to amend the Women's Charter to allow husbands to claim maintenance from their wives, in appropriate circumstances. Presently, only a husband owes a legal obligation to maintain a wife. And here I quote Prof. Leong again, \"A wife does not owe a similar obligation and can ignore the subsistence needs of her husband even if she were fully capable of meeting them. This cannot be right. So while this obligation is not likely to be enforced often, it should be a part of the law.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think it is only fair and equitable to give the Courts the power to order maintenance of the husband by the wife if such a necessity arises. This change will also allay any perceptions that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Women's Charter discriminates against men. In this era, maintenance should be on the basis of need and not on gender. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two practical instances that come to mind are where a husband cannot find work due to illness or has care and custody of the children and can only do part-time work as he has to look after the children. In such situations, wives should be asked to maintain their husbands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister therefore please consider amending section 61 (subsection 1), section 107 and section 108 (subsection 1) so that either spouse can apply for maintenance and appropriate assessment can be made of the amount of maintenance? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to discuss the amendment that deals with the division of matrimonial assets, namely, section 106. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present section 106, matrimonial assets are categorised into two main types: those acquired by the joint effort of both parties; and those acquired by the sole effort of one party. In the case of matrimonial assets acquired jointly, there is a direction for the Court to incline towards equality of division. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Courts have taken a very enlightened approach towards the interpretation of section 106. From looking at the body of case law since 1990, it is obvious that the Courts have reduced the differentiation of joint and sole efforts to insignificance by observing that they may award \"up to 49%\" of the matrimonial assets acquired by the sole effort of the other. This was enunciated by Justice Chan Sek Keong as he was then. In other words, there is power to divide 50-50 for jointly acquired assets and 49-51 for solely acquired assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a substantial body of case law since 1990 which has interpreted section 106 on the principle of inclining towards equality. This interpretation reflects the present day reality of a partnership in marriage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, what is the need to repeal and re-enact section 106? Have there been any principles enunciated by the Courts that have been unsatisfactory \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> or where justice appears not to have been done? What have been the shortcomings in interpreting this section so far? Should we not follow conventional wisdom -- if it is not broken, do not fix it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section (clause 19) proposed by the Minister abolishes the differentiation between assets acquired jointly or by sole effort. It might appear on the surface that this new section (clause 19) is made especially to take into consideration the contributions of the home maker but before we assume this, let us look at the likely consequences if the amendment becomes law: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The weight given to the other factors, including the home-making and welfare of the family, will depend upon each judge hearing the case. There is a subjective element here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As legislators, it is our duty to clarify and fine-tune the legislation to help the courts in their decision. We cannot leave it entirely to the Courts to decide what is just and equitable -- we have to clearly lay down the principles on which the division of matrimonial assets should be based. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Also with the repeal of section 106, the old body of case law built up since 1990 may no longer be applicable and used as a precedent. It seems a pity not to build upon the existing body of case law which appears to be just and equitable and in practice has inclined towards the principle of equality of division of matrimonial assets, whether acquired by sole or joint effort and thus recognising the home-making and family welfare component. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore two suggestions for the Minister: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Not to repeal and re-enact section 106 on the division of matrimonial assets as the present practice of the Courts has been just and equitable and reflects the reality of married life in Singapore today; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the Minister wishes to repeal and re-enact section 106, then there should be a direction to incline towards equality of division. This House should assert the principle that \"both spouses are equally \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> valued whether he or she concentrates on the economic or home-making role as both roles must be performed equally well if the partnership is to flourish.\" -- also a quotation from Prof. Leong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not assert this principle of inclination towards equality of division, then we are undermining the complementarity of roles in a marriage partnership. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the definition of matrimonial assets, I would like the Minister to confirm that the definition includes club memberships and CPF monies. The Court of Appeal has decided that CPF monies should be part of the matrimonial assets. This was the case of an appeal in the Appeal Court and Justice Goh Joon Seng speaking for the Appeal Court said, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In our view the fact that the fund in a member's CPF account is subjected to restrictions as to its use and disposal until he reaches the age of 55 and is inviolable except to the extent set out in the CPF Act does not make it any less of an asset. If the fund is accumulated during the marriage then it constitutes an asset acquired during the marriage.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this ruling should apply to the CPF sums of both the husband and the wife and here again no distinction should be made if the spouse is male or female. I suggest that the CPF monies of both spouses be pooled together and considered as part of matrimonial assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter that are concerned with violence in the family. I have said quite a lot on this matter in this House when the Family Violence Bill was being discussed. I will not repeat what I have said on this subject but there is one observation that I wish to make. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members of this House were against the Family Violence Bill because they felt that the intervention and involvement of outsiders would have a detrimental effect on maintaining family relationships. Yet some of these same Members did not have these reservations in supporting the Maintenance of Parents Bill. I find this stand incongruous and inconsistent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Maintenance of Parents Bill, the problem of the number of parents needing maintenance from their children appears small and yet the House passed the Maintenance of Parents Bill which intrudes into the family home and into family relationships. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of the Family Violence Bill, the problem is much larger (as acknowledged by the police) and yet Members of this House expressed reluctance at the intrusion into the family home and family relationship. I believe a consistent stand would send the right signal to the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my one concern is that the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter to do with family violence will not be effective in curbing and reducing the incidence of family violence and so in six or seven years' time, there may be a younger Member of Parliament standing exactly here and quoting the statistics to show that. At that time, some of us may not be here to be held accountable for not doing what was needed in the first place. I hope I will be proven wrong in this prediction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before I end, Sir, I would like your permission to distribute to the Members the results of a survey on family violence carried out by The Body Shop and AWARE during the period November 1995 to January 1996. Do I have your permission, Sir? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> The number of forms that were filled was 1,680, and the highlights of the survey were: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79% of the respondents think family violence is a social problem and not a private one; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77% of the respondents think family violence is never justifiable; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90% of the respondents would like to see tougher laws on family violence. This survey and a previous one done by Dr Alfred Choi and Dr Jeffery Elderson should make some of us rethink our stand on the issue of family violence and the role of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments. With our rapid changing lifestyles and increased complexities in our social environment, it is timely that we introduce these amendments to update the present provisions in the Women's Charter. Committing this Bill to a Select Committee reflects the importance attached to these amendments and I fully support this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two major amendments which I feel will make the most impact on the Bill. The first is the introduction of Part VIA - Protection of Family. In our present day highly pressurised urban environment, individuals as well as families are under great pressure in coping with everyday problems. Relationships between family members become more complex and fragile due to the pressure of work and also exposure to different cultures and media influence. It would be naive to believe that all marriages, no matter how blissful they seem in the beginning, will be able to endure the long passage of time without at some point of time friction arising between husband and wife, or between in-laws, and even between parents and children. This friction can sometimes lead to family squabbles which can get out of hand and sometimes physical confrontation, such as couple fighting each other occasionally, is not uncommon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is only right that we legislate provisions to prevent such incidents from getting out of hand and deteriorating into one party abusing the other. However, not all these squabbles lead to irreversible reconciliation and definitely not all these squabbles necessarily mean one party intentionally abusing the other viciously and constantly. Therefore, a more comprehensive and clearer definition provided in this section will enable the affected family members to apply for protection orders in order to have greater protection against possible abuse, but at the same time, more importantly, make it possible for efforts to be made to sort out their problems and hopefully keep the family and marriage intact. It is more positive than to treat every such case as a criminal case and bring in the police to institute criminal proceedings in which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> case, the chances of reconciliation would greatly diminish and we will have more and more broken marriages. Only when all avenues have been exhausted, including what has been provided in section 119(3) where the court may refer the parties for mediation or attend counselling fails, the accused party will be dealt with under the Penal Code. This is in line with our emphasis to promote family values, sparing no effort to maintain family cohesion and harmony. But in order to deal with this increasing number of such family conflicts, the MCD should have immediate plans to recruit more trained and more qualified counsellors and set up more Family Centres to cater for people who need these facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment which I consider to have great significance is in determining the division of matrimonial assets between the divorced parties. The following consideration is being included under clause 19 [new section 106(2)(d)], and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;\" Sometimes, there is a preconceived notion that unless a wife pursues a successful career, her contribution to the family will not be considered as equal to the husband and, worse still, she is perceived as being subservient to the husband. I strongly disagree with such perception. To me, the contribution of a good mother and a good homemaker is equal, if not greater than the breadwinner. There is nothing more noble than the contribution made by a mother who has brought up her children with love and proper guidance and there is no job which is more important than to keep a peaceful and harmonious home for the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that these amendments have recognised their contribution and put these misconceptions to rest. I have no problem in leaving it to the judge to determine the quantum of this contribution, as it differs from case to case and also different circumstances require different consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to conclude by suggesting that since the provisions in the Bill are much more family-oriented than just covering women matters, the Minister can consider amending the name from Women's Charter to Family Charter. \n  <br>4.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the House that I did not check my speech with my brother before I speak. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the general provisions of the proposed Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill. The amendments address the issue relating to family violence and provide some of the solutions to some rather difficult problems faced by all our families in Singapore. I would just like to reiterate some of the points I made in this House when the Family Violence Bill was debated. Dr Soin accused some of the MPs for not keeping their word. I have to assure her that I did not speak on the Maintenance of Parents Bill. So I am not one of the guilty parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, first, family problems cover a wide range of causes and different parties. They involve abstract concepts of love and trust between spouses, parents and children. Second, these problems are best resolved by the affected parties rather than having the Government step in to force them to come to terms with one another. Third, measures to reduce family violence, such as inculcating family values and promoting filial piety, should start early in the schools, if possible, instead of waiting for the problems to become too serious to handle. The proposed Amendment Bill covers most of these grounds, in particular, the definition of \"family violence\" is now much tighter as it spells out clearly what is meant by violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make the following suggestions. The new section 60B provides for the making of protection orders in respect of family violence and confers on the court wide powers. The normal courts of law give the impression of austerity, more often implying that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> parties have reached the point of no return. As I mentioned earlier, we need to ensure that all possible avenues of reconcilation are explored before calling it a day. It would, therefore, be more appropriate to refer such matters to the Family Court and the terms of reference of this Court should take into account the soft approach required to resolve these disputes. The exception would be when physical violence is committed, then the full weight of the law should be brought to bear on the culprit. This reconcilatory approach would enable the parties to come to some compromise and give them sufficient time to have effect, some give and take, and resolve the issues amicably outside the court, if necessary, so that all avenues are explored before the final decision is made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 60B also provides for counselling for offenders. In our previous discussion in this House, many Members have expressed reservations on counselling done by the Police, for example, and other people who are not trained. It is vital that this counselling must be done by trained counsellors. I am not too sure about the body the Minister has in mind of appointing in this section: would it be a Government body or a voluntary organisation staffed by professional people, bearing in mind the increasing number of cases to be resolved? We would need to ensure that there is an adequate supply of counsellors, whether they are made available to the Ministries or private organisations, to make sure that the problems are tackled expeditiously, especially in cases where time is of the essence and immediate counselling is required to prevent further violence being perpetuated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say here that at least I agree with the NMP in one score that the present Women's Charter is not quite appropriate for the amendments that we are going to introduce because of the inclusion of other parties such as parents and children in the Amendment Bill. But instead of having an all-encompassing family charter incorporating 10 or 15 legislation, I think it would be simpler just to change the name of Women's Charter to Family Charter and we would then have a legislation that we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can change from time to time taking into account circumstances which may change in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the main part of this Amendment Bill is to incorporate into the Women's Charter, clauses dealing with the protection of family members, so that when faced with violence, they can have recourse to the court to apply for a protection order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bill does not specify which Government department should immediately render assistance to the victims upon being informed of the occurrence of such family violence, for example, helping them to apply to the court for a protection order, and to prevent them from being assaulted again the moment they have returned home after obtaining the court order. When family violence occurs, the victim may not know what to do. She may not know how to apply to the court for a protection order, and what evidence she has to produce to the court. Further, it takes time for such orders to be granted from the time of application. Meanwhile, how does the victim protect herself from further abuse and injuries? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that if the Bill only provides for the victim to apply for a court order, and the police could intervene only when the victims are subjected to further abuse, then the victims are not really getting the necessary protection. The Government should legislate to set up a Family Crisis Centre. As soon as the victim lodges a complaint, officials from the Centre should immediately visit the family, understand the situation and provide the necessary counselling service. Furthermore, the official should go one step further to help the victim apply for a protetction order from the court, or to render any other form of assistance, if necessary. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.25 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members for their contributions and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> comments. I am heartened by the comments given. It shows that, generally, without exception, they support the Bill in most respects, except for some refinements. These refinements would certainly be dealt with when I commit the Bill to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try and address some of the views expressed. Mrs Yu-Foo, among other things, asked about protection for voluntary counsellors, ie, how safe is their work as voluntary counsellors and whether some kind of protection could be given to them. I can assure the Member that counsellors are not voluntary actually, but they are professional social workers. In other words, they are social workers attached to Family Service Centres, for example, or some other VWOs. So they are not volunteers in the first place. And, secondly, if a professional social worker sees that he may be subjected to or fear some kind of problems when handling with the perpetrators, I think the police would be more than happy to provide him with protection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked whether children above 21 years could apply for maintenance on their own. This is something which we can consider. Perhaps, we can elaborate on it further during the hearing of the Select Committee. However, I would like to sound a note of caution here. We have to study the implications carefully. We should not, by doing so, encourage a more litigious society whereby family members sue other family members for everything. But certainly we can look into this suggestion further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the issue on the division of matrimonial assets tending towards equality, which has been touched upon by NMP Kanwaljit Soin. Sir, the concern is over the removal of the words \"incline towards equality\" in the existing provision of section 106 and its re-enactment into a new section 106. The concern is that the new provision is not as just and it will not provide for an equitable distribution to women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing section 106(2) states that for assets acquired jointly, the court shall incline towards equality of division. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> In such instances, the court would take into consideration (1) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards the acquisition of the assets; (2) any debts owing by either party which are contracted for their joint benefit; (3) the needs of the minor children (if any). The inclination towards equality stated in the existing provision does not necessarily mean a 50-50 division of matrimonial assets acquired by both parties. The equality is in relation to the proportion each party has contributed to the acquisition of the assets. This means that the share of each party is determined by how much that party has contributed. If a party has contributed a small proportion, his or her share will likewise be small. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation where an asset is acquired jointly, the court does not take into consideration the home-making efforts of any party, as I mentioned earlier. Therefore, a housewife would lose out if her contribution was small. However, if a party has not contributed to the acquisition of the asset, as I mentioned earlier also, section 106 allows the court to divide the assets or proceeds in such proportion as the court thinks it is reasonable. But in such instances, the home-making efforts of a party are taken into consideration by the courts. It is therefore more advantageous for the home-maker not to have made any contribution at all. This is the anomaly in the current provision which the court has asked to be addressed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new provisions will in fact benefit rather than put women at a disadvantage. The proposed provisions will not put a woman, who is a full-time home-maker or a working and contributing party, in a worse off position. It will not. In fact, a working and contributing woman will be better off under the proposed amendments, as the courts can now also take into consideration her home-making efforts, regardless of the extent of her contribution to the assets. This would provide for a fairer distribution of assets than the current provisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yuhua also asked about the police's role in the protection of victims of family violence and also in improving the quality of counselling so that they could provide effective service. Sir, I can assure the Member that the police's role is much greater than previously. During the debate on the Family Violence Bill, I did indicate to the House that there was a pilot project in Ang Mo Kio whereby the police, the VWOs and the FSCs network together to handle family violence cases. I am happy to report that this networking the working between the police and the VWOs will be replicated in other parts of the island. And indeed the police, especially the front-line policemen, are being trained on how to handle family violence cases. Indeed, new recruits at the Police Academy are being trained in such skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On improving the quality of counselling by social workers, as I also mentioned earlier in my speech, in fact, starting today, the Ministry of Community Development has started a course for social workers, specifically on how to handle family violence cases. Because issues and problems of the family are rather complex and very complicated, therefore, they would need different skills from trying to handle juveniles or the aged. This will continue and certainly MCD will also continue to liaise with NUS on the kind of training that could be provided for social workers with a view to improving their quality of service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether people could be appointed to apply for a PPO. Indeed, there is provision in the amendment that the Minister could appoint people to apply for PPOs and certainly I would consider VWOs and non-Government organisations or even grassroots leaders to play that role. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the training of counsellors, as I mentioned earlier, we would continue to train and improve the quality of our social workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked whether there would be an erosion of the institution of marriage with the amendment to allow transsexuals to marry. We do not think so. We also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have other programmes which will try to strengthen the institution of marriage and the institution of the family. Nevertheless, we will, as suggested by the Member, continue to assess the impact of the change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what would happen during the time lag between legal recourse and the implementation of any solution to the problem. In other words, what he called the \"intervening action\" with regard to maintenance and with regard to domestic violence. I would like, especially for domestic violence, to try to give an idea of what we have worked out with the police on the procedures of how to handle these cases. In fact, this would also answer Mr Low Thia Khiang's question on what help can be given to victims of family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence cases can come to the police's notice by: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a report lodged by the victim himself or herself at the NPP or the police station.; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a \"999\" call; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a report by a medical officer; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) a referral by a VWO. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, when the police senior investigation officer (SIO) gets the report, he will document the report. In other words, he takes down the particulars of the report and classifies the case as seizable or non-seizable. For outright seizable cases, the police could arrest the perpetrator and charge him in court, if necessary, on the spot. For non-seizable cases, the police could warn the perpetrator or take summons action against the perpetrator, if necessary. And in all instances of reports, the police will explain to the victim the options available to the victim. In other words, what the victim can do to alleviate the problem and, if necessary, either refer the victim to a VWO for further counselling or if the victim insists that he wants a more heavier hand, then the police can intervene. In other words, the options would be explained as and when the report is received. The police will also explain to the victim how to apply for a personal protection order (PPO). If necessary, the police could also ask for the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> help of a VWO to accompany the victim to court to get the PPO. These are the procedures that have been drawn up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not stop there, Sir. After all this, the duty officer in the NPP and the VWO keep in touch with the victim. The VWO who is in charge of the case will also keep in touch with the victim after the report. The VWO will monitor the case and will assess whether the case is high risk, moderate risk or low risk and follow up accordingly. The VWO will keep in constant touch with the police on the condition of the victim, in case the victim comes again to report and see what follow-up action could be taken. There is always constant discussion between the VWO and the police on the case, even after the case has been handled and the victim goes home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to serious cases, what happens is that we try to make sure that the victim does not get hurt. The court can give an expedited order or a domestic exclusion order. A domestic exclusion order simply means that the court would disallow the husband to step into the house, even though the house belongs to him, so that they do not get into contact and therefore the abuse does not continue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin suggests changing the name from Women's Charter to Family Charter. This was also suggested by Mr Kenneth Chen and Mr Bernard Chen. I do not know whether it is a family affair, but they have also suggested calling it Family Charter. Sir, it is not a question of merely changing the name from Women's Charter to Family Charter, especially as implied by Dr Soin that it also implicates other legislation. It has got to be looked into very carefully. It has got to be studied deeper, because it has got to do with complementarity and whether it contradicts with other legisation. This could be a long-term development of the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned maintenance for husbands. I wish to clarify that under the existing provisions of the Women's Charter, the court can also order a woman to contribute towards the maintenance of a child, as the Member has mentioned, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> where the court is satisfied that she has the means to do so. As for allowing maintenance for husbands, I am of the view that the existing provisions of allowing only women to claim maintenance from men should be maintained, at least for the present. Call me old fashioned if you will; call me a male chauvinist if you must, but my upbringing and my background tell me that it is the duty of the husband to maintain the wife. And I think I speak for most, if not all, the husbands in this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF and club membership as matrimonial assets, the Bill is silent on CPF. In fact, the court has ruled in several cases that CPF, as mentioned by the Member, is part of matrimonial assets. The court has interpreted that CPF monies form part of matrimonial assets and available for division in a divorce and the spouse has the proprietary right to the member's CPF monies. However, CPF savings thus divided may only be withdrawn when the member reaches the age of 55. It does not therefore serve the purpose of meeting the immediate financial needs of the ex-spouse in most cases. However, the court has ruled, as I said, that CPF is part of matrimonial assets and we should continue to let the court decide. The reason why we do not specify what constitute matrimonial assets is that if we were to list each and every item -- club memberships, CPF, COEs -- it is a bit of a long list. Therefore, we would let the court decide which will fall under matrimonial assets and which will not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards violence in the family, we note her observations. I do not want to repeat the arguments which I had put forward when we debated the Family Violence Bill. But I am not really sure whether she could compare it with the Maintenance of Parents Bill which was a new Bill in the sense that it was legislated to look into a problem that had not been looked into previously. Whereas in the case of the Family Violence Bill, you already have provisions in the Women's Charter and therefore you can just enhance the Women's Charter. Be that as it may, if the Member still feels that there \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are arguments for the Family Violence Bill or indeed to strengthen further the amendments to the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill, she could do so during the Select Committee representation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is family violence a social problem? Yes, it is a social problem. I do not think anybody would argue that family violence is not a social problem. The very fact that we are here debating the problem and the fact that we have put forward amendments to the Women's Charter to address this problem show that it is not a problem which is suffered by the victim himself or herself, but is a problem which the whole community should put its mind to. The Member can be assured that the Government is very concerned about family violence and indeed we are also looking into how to make people more aware of family violence and how to make family violence a more repugnant act in our society. This indeed we will be looking into in our public education programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have replied to most of the questions. In any case, this is not the end of the debate. As I said, I will commit the Bill to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to say that there is general agreement on the spirit and intent of the Women's Charter. It is a unique legislation and it has contributed a lot to the welfare and well-being of our women, children, the institutions of marriage and the family. The amendments which we have proposed will hopefully further deepen this contribution and I seek Members' support in passing it through its Second Reading. As I have indicated earlier, I will commit this Bill to a Select Committee for it to be further refined and if Members feel that they have further contributions to make, and indeed if any organisations outside feel that they have further contributions to make, they can do so when the Committee sits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, can I seek a point of clarification, please? I respect the Minister's view. He wants to be old-fashioned or male chauvinist. But I would like to clarify that when we are making a public policy stand we will have to leave aside our personal feelings and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> look at what the social context is. So I would like the Minister to clarify this point about maintenance in view of the statistics that I quoted that many women are marrying downwards now and earning as much as, if not more. In that type of a social milieu, Sir, would the Minister reconsider that husbands can be entitled to maintenance under appropriate circumstances because in the end it is the welfare of the family that may be compromised if in appropriate circumstance we do not award maintenance to the husband? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I appreciate the Member's concern. Notwithstanding what I have said, I think we can still discuss this further in the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to whether it is my personal view, whether I am old-fashioned or male chauvinist, I do realise that, Sir. In fact, Members must have known that my own stand on marriage between transsexuals, for example, is quite different from what I have said here. In other words, amendments could be made to allow this. So there is a difference between how I feel and how I feel the law should be applied to the community. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I want to clarify that I never suggested incorporating all the other Acts into the Women's Charter and call it a Family Charter. I was just saying that this particular Bill, as it is, should be considered a Family Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> I stand corrected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and such number of Members as the Committee of Selection may nominate.\" - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read. \n  <br>4.53 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Health (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on the Advance Medical Directive (AMD) Bill received 14 written submissions. The Committee heard oral representation from 12 persons in respect of six of the written submissions. The Committee's Report has been circulated to Members of the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the points raised in the submissions are already catered for in the Bill presented earlier to Parliament. These include safeguards against euthanasia, the proper certification of terminal illness and the rights of patients who have not made directives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate three important points concerning the AMD. First, the purpose of the AMD is to allow the patient to make a choice in advance and not have the dying process prolonged by extraordinary life-sustaining treatment if he becomes terminally ill and mentally incompetent. While this is the patient's own decision, we will encourage the involvement of family members in the decision-making process and will emphasise this point in our public education programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the AMD is only applicable when the patient is \"terminally ill\". It applies only to those who are already in the process of dying and no longer able to decide for themselves. No one can force a patient to accept medical treatment against his wishes. All the AMD does is to enable him to express his wishes in advance while he is still mentally competent. Therefore, the concern that the directive may be used by some individuals to commit suicide is unwarranted. Notwithstanding this, the Bill clearly states that it does not condone nor authorise abetment of suicide, mercy killing or euthanasia. Sufficient safeguards have been incorporated into the Bill to prevent such abuses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the directive does not affect the right of a patient who is mentally competent to make decisions concerning his own medical treatment. As long as the patient is able to express his wishes, doctors will act according to them whether or not he has made an AMD. For those who do not wish to make a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> directive, the current practice will continue when they become terminally ill and mentally incompetent. Doctors will then make decisions in consultation with family members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the substantive amendments recommended by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Witnessing the making of a Directive</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor asked whether the two witnesses required for the making of the directive should be present at the same time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee felt that this had to be so logically, but to put it beyond doubt, the Bill has been amended to make this requirement clear. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Revocation of a Directive</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor commented that the requirement to have two witnesses for the revocation might not be necessary. This could result in a delay if one witness failed to report the revocation to the Registrar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee agreed with the representor that the revocation of the directive should be made easy so that, if there is any doubt, we err on the side of prolonging life. The Bill has thus been amended to allow revocation with one witness, provided that the witness informs the Registrar in writing. Of course, the patient should also notify the Registrar if he is able to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a counter-balance to the above amendment which makes revocation easier, a related amendment is made to give greater certainty to the medical practitioner who has to decide whether to act on a directive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Medical Practitioners' involvement in the Directive</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shared the concern raised by some representors that the Bill did not explicitly exclude medical practitioners who might benefit from the death of the patient. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has thus been amended to state that doctors who may benefit from the death of the patient will be excluded from being involved in the certification of terminal illness and in the execution of the directive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Offence in causing another to make a Directive</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor pointed out that irresponsible family members might be able to pressure an elderly patient to make a directive without actually committing any offence under clause 14(1). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shared the representor's concern and decided to amend the Bill to widen the scope of clause 14(1) to make it an offence to obtain a directive by \"unconscionable conduct\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Information concerning the patient's making of a Directive</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it was pointed out by one representor that clause 15(3), requiring doctors to keep all information relating to the patient's making of a directive confidential, might hinder the doctor from counselling family members when the patient has already been determined to be terminally ill under clause 9. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee agreed that counselling family members is important when the directive is being executed. The Bill has been amended accordingly to allow doctors to divulge information about the patient's AMD to family members once the patient has been determined to be terminally ill under clause 9. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health will conduct a public education programme on various aspects of the AMD. We will involve civic organisations and community leaders. Doctors and relevant health care workers, in particular, will be trained on what their responsibilities are, and what advice they should give to their patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, I wish to commend the Minister for Health and his Ministry officials for the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> painstaking effort in bringing this Advance Medical Directive Bill through the various stages of consultation. For a subject as important as this, the process of consultation and feedback has been worthwhile. The National Medical Ethics Committee did very good work. The views and comments of the various professional bodies and religious organisations were considered and incorporated into the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By committing the AMD Bill to a Select Committee, it allowed for further opportunity to the members of the public to submit their views. The AMD Bill was further amended. It shows that the Government listens to good and constructive suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that we have done all we could in giving legal effect for advance directive to medical practitioners against artificial prolongation of the dying process. The terminally ill patients are allowed to die peacefully and with dignity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the Minister's view that the AMD will in fact make euthanasia less likely as it removes the ambiguity in the medical care of the terminally-ill patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, two federal appeal courts recently lifted bans on physician-assisted suicide. This has led to the tormenting question in the minds of the Americans as to whether the right to die has become a duty to die. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are clear that we are not heading this treacherous route. We will not be subjecting our citizens with this tormenting question. Singaporeans, especially the elderly sick, need not feel that they better choose a quick death because they impose financial and emotional burden on their families and society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the assertion of patient autonomy has been moderated. We are discerning enough to appreciate the importance of the involvement of family members prior to making the decision to sign the AMD. We recognise that any serious sickness of a family member affects everyone in the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two areas which I hope the Ministry will be vigilant and will monitor the situation closely. For the country's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> psychological defence, our people must be inculcated with a strong will to face any crisis and be prepared to fight to save dear lives for the sake of family and country. There should not be any let-up in maintaining the high threshold of pain of our people to compete and in achieving better quality of life for our citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt to coerce the elderly patient to sign the AMD which is illegal should be acted upon quickly to nip the problem in the bud. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that with this AMD, a step forward is taken to forge the doctor-patient relationship and the concept of the family doctor will be an established practice in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like most other medical practitioners, I have tussled with questions of life and death many times in my work. When the AMD legislation became an issue in Singapore, the question of life and death became more urgent and vexing for many of us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vexing because the field of medical science is inexact and rapidly changing with few fixed sign posts. This applies especially to the condition pertaining to the end of life. I therefore would like to outline some problems of putting a grey area of medicine into black and white legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different ways of meeting death with dignity. If we choose the AMD way, then we must be cognizant of the medical, legal and philosophical mines and pitfalls of this route. If we respect the human determination to live and the principle of fighting death to the last gasp, then we must be aware of the implications of this legislation and the message it sends to society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from my knowledge of the private health sector, the need for the Advance Medical Directive Bill to be pushed is not pressing as the artificial prolongation of the process of dying is not a big problem. There is good communication and trust between doctors and patient's relatives. If a doctor thinks that the case for a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> particular patient is hopeless, the relatives usually take the doctor's advice and discontinue heroic medical measures or do not even have these measures instituted in the first place. For those few relatives who want extraordinary life-sustaining treatment to continue, then nearly always, after a week or so, they ask the doctor for a re-evaluation of the patient's condition. If the prognosis remains grim, then the relatives will take the doctor's advice of discontinuing the treatment. During this week or two, the futility of the process helps relatives to accept the impending death of the loved one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we are going to have an increasingly aged population but we are not Australia or the USA where medico-legal problems abound and where doctors and hospitals have to protect themselves from being sued. We are Singapore and problems in this area have not arisen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor to consider is that the concept of an informed consent is integral to the signing of a living will or an advance medical directive. In Singapore, this issue of informed consent has not been developed sufficiently. In the local context, patients often leave many medical and surgical decisions to their doctors who take this responsibility and make decisions for patients as best as they can. Are we going to allow this to happen also in the case of the signing of an advance medical directive, and leaving it more to the doctors' discretion? Because, in my opinion, Sir, the issue of informed consent is crucial in the signing of an advance medical directive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that in Singapore we have to develop this concept and culture of an informed consent much more before we push advance medical directives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to address some provisions in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Definition of \"terminal illness\" -- according to the Bill, there are two limbs to the definition. One limb defines it thus, \"death would within reasonable medical \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> judgment be imminent regardless of the application of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take this definition, then there is little point in having a statute permitting withdrawal of such procedures if death is imminent even with the full application of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other limb of the definition says, and I quote, \"the application of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment would only serve to postpone the moment of death of the patient\" -- this contradicts the first limb which says that death is imminent even with the application of life-sustaining treatment. How can we reconcile limb (a) and limb (b) when they both have to be necessary conditions for defining terminal illness? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the definition in the second limb, that is, it only postpones the moment of death, makes the provision too broad, if taken literally -- most medical interventions serve only to postpone the moment of death, even in an otherwise healthy patient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definitions in the Bill of \"extraordinary life-sustaining treatment\" and \"terminal illness\" are problematic in that they are tautological -- \"terminal illness\" is defined with respect to \"extraordinary life-sustaining treatment\" and vice versa. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we can see that there are problems in drafting legislation of this sort in general terms. It requires interpretation to determine whether the patient's condition warrants its implementation. The interpretation has to be made by the doctors. Therefore, although in general terms, legislation for advance medical directives may seem appropriate, we must not forget that the devil is in the details. The legislation when enacted will have to be fleshed out in its many details and innumerable problems will arise. Therefore, I would like to request the Minister not to push this legislation too quickly and too far, but let us take our time, see what are the problems that arise in other countries, and then implement it slowly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, life \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is a very remarkable phenomenon, a masterpiece by mother nature. So we must treasure our lives and try our very best to extend the existence of life. However, the Advance Medical Directive Bill contradicts this philosophy. But, in order to lighten the mental stress and financial burden of members of the patient's family, there are some merits in this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although careful consideration has been given to the various aspects covered by the provisions under this Bill, there is always a possibility of human error and the question of integrity of the decision-making specialists that may result in the patient concerned losing the chance of extending his life. Therefore, the Government should pay special attention to this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I hope that the Government will make a study on whether the passage of this Bill will provide the opportunity and make it more convenient for unscrupulous people and unethical medical officers to engage in illegal trafficking or sale of human organs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard, from time to time, of incidents of dead people coming back to life again. With rapid advancement of medical sciences today, if life can be extended, there is always a possibility that there may be some kind of cure for the patient later on. Moreover, whether the patient has a chance of recovery or not is a decision that no one can be absolutely sure about. In the long run, the Advance Medical Directive Bill may give rise to some undesirable consequences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because the various provisions in the Bill have been considered very carefully, I do not object to the Bill being passed in this House to become law. But I would like to give my personal views on the recommendations of the Select Committee on this Bill. I think a number of recommendations made by the Select Committee are all very good. However, there is one point where the original provision required two witnesses to be present for a person to revoke his Advance Medical Directive, but the Select Committee recommended that it be amended to only one witness being \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> required. I think this amendment is not necessary because if a dispute arises as a result of the revocation of the Advance Medical Directive, the presence of two witnesses will make it easier and fairer to settle the dispute. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Advance Medical Directive Bill is timely -- it seeks to lay down the ground rules on the artificial prolongation of the dying process in a terminally-ill patient. With the advances in science, many in the lay public believe that doctors can do wonders and expect all sorts of extraordinary measures to be taken, even though there is no hope at all. The end result is the same -- the patient will eventually die. However, the bill will be enormous. Doctors have always erred on the side of safety and if there is any doubt that life can be prolonged, they will always continue with measures which they think will prolong life. And I think no member of the public need worry that doctors will err on the other side and shorten life unnecessarily. The Bill has also been very carefully scrutinised by Singaporeans from various walks of life and the Select Committee has also gone through it with a fine tooth-comb. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the success of a piece of legislation depends not only on how well it has been crafted but also in its implementation. The legislation has focused mainly on the rights and protection of the patient which it should rightly do so. However, ultimately, the success of the Bill will require support of the medical professionals who are intimately involved in the implementation of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the Bill, the process of administering the Bill should not be burdensome and create more difficulties for medical practitioners whose main aim is to practise good rational medicine. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involvement of more doctors in the process of determining what situation constitutes a terminally-ill condition will mean that doctors who were not involved in the medical care of the patient will also be involved in the decision-making process. This can sometimes be rather \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> difficult. Furthermore, if the opinions differ, the patient is referred to a committee of three specialists who will then make the decision. Good medical decisions cannot be made solely by sitting on a table and examining the case-notes alone. Will the Ministry ensure that the appointed specialists from the panel be present together to review every patient at the bedside when the situation arises? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major concerns of this legislation is that it has opened the medical profession to the possibility of a fine and/or conviction, as stated in clause 15. Prior to this, a decision on the care of terminally-ill patients would have been purely a medical one made in consultation with the family and the patient with no legal sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the law must distinguish between divulging this information for dishonest intentions and not punish medical practitioners who may divulge this information unwittingly with no ill intent. Although there are some safeguards in subsection 2, nevertheless, we have placed upon them this potential threat. Any court action can result in dire consequences for any medical professional. In the administration of this Bill, I would urge the Ministry to exercise due care and concern so that medical practitioners do not get excessively burdened. If this act becomes too burdensome, many medical practitioners will register themselves as objectors and the advance medical directive may become an act which may not be acted upon. This will defeat the purpose of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the Bill but I urge the Ministry to give due consideration to the points highlighted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr John De Payva (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am against mercy killing. Doctors have no right to hasten the death of any individual whatever the circumstances. But the Bill before us does not sanction mercy killing. It merely provides for a person to give advance notice to doctors not to prolong his life by artificial means. This I can support. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last week, I heard over the BBC a sad episode. It concerned a woman in coma for four years. Finally, a court in Scotland allowed the doctors to take her life. Of course, the woman's husband was sad. But, at the same time, he was relieved that her agony was over. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made tremendous progress in medical science but we cannot put off death. When the time comes, it is better to let a person to die naturally rather than keep him alive through artificial means. The question is at what point the doctor sees life-supporting operations. The Bill is quite explicit on this matter. The decision whether to let the patient die is taken off the hands of the doctor responsible for the treatment. Two other doctors must agree that the patient is terminally ill. If the doctor in charge is not a specialist, then the other two doctors must themselves be specialists. If the doctor in charge is a specialist, one of the other two doctors must be a specialist. If there is no unanimity, the issue has to be referred to a committee of three specialists and, here again, the principle of unanimity is preserved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that every precaution will be taken before the extraordinary life-supporting processes are switched off. Medical treatment is costly. Keeping a person alive through extraordinary means is even more costly. It is also agonising to close relatives of the patient as well as to doctors and nurses. But decisions on whether to let a person go cannot be based on cost. They must be based on medical and moral grounds. I have stated earlier that doctors have no right to hasten the death of a patient. Let me add that doctors have no right either to prolong the life of a patient needlessly. What do I mean when I say \"needlessly\"? This would involve the use of high-tech machines to keep a patient alive for a prolonged period when it would be much more humane to let him die naturally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical issue is whether there is a chance of recovery. If there is, then doctors must do everything possible to save the patient. But if there is no chance of recovery, the decent thing is to let nature take its course. Once the Bill is passed, it is up to each of us to make that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> critical decision whether to make an advance medical directive. All those 21 years and above are entitled to make such directives provided they are of sound mind. There is also provision for a person to revoke such directives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a person makes an advance medical directive, who else should be told of this decision? According to the Bill, the directive would be kept confidential and made known only to such person as he may authorise in writing. The directive will be made known to the doctor responsible for treatment only if such a certificate has been forwarded to the Registrar of the Advance Medical Directives. I do not know why it is necessary for the advance medical directive to remain confidential. Decisions of this sort are taken only after familial consultations. I would urge that such decisions be taken when people are in the pink of health, not when they are about to go for major surgeries. If family members are aware of the directive, they can better understand decisions taken by doctors on whether or not to switch off the extraordinary life-supporting processes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should family doctors be informed of the advance medical directive? I would say, yes. But chances are that it is not family doctors who will make the life-and-death decision. Chances are it will be the doctors in hospitals. As such, it would help if the family doctor is involved, at some point in time, in the decision-making process. Perhaps, the Bill could be further amended to bring the family doctor into the picture, assuming that the doctor treating the patient in hospital is a specialist. Then he should refer his decision on the nature of terminal illness to another specialist and to the family doctor. If, on the other hand, the hospital doctor is not a specialist, then his decision should be referred to two specialists plus the family doctor. So at the point when a person signs his advance medical directive, he should also state who his family doctor is. There must also be provision for a person to change his family doctor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Advance Medical Directive Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> like to highlight an anomaly between the AMD Bill and the Human Organs Transplant Act (HOTA). To ensure proper protection of the patient, the AMD Bill stipulates that three doctors are required to certify a patient to be terminally ill before his extraordinary life-sustaining treatment can be stopped. HOTA, on the other hand, requires only two doctors to certify a patient to have suffered irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain before his organs can be removed. This difference in certification level between the two Acts is incongruous in certain circumstances where the Acts overlap. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may say that the AMD Bill deals with terminally ill patients who are still alive, whilst HOTA deals with those who are brain dead. So there is no comparison. This is generally true. However, a terminally ill patient is not necessarily always still alive. The patient could be brain dead. If I may quote Dr Tan Kee Guan, a Medical Director at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital, who, in his written representation to the Select Committee on the AMD Bill, said, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Terminal illness -- a rather straight forward explanation for those with advanced cancer and brain dead.\" Terminal illness can also be the result of a serious accident where the patient suffers severe brain injuries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may remember when Dr Tan Cheng Bock vividly presented three scenarios of typical AMD cases at the Second Reading of the AMD Bill last December. Incidentally, two of his three scenarios also depicted the terminally ill patients as being brain dead which support Dr Tan Kee Guan's description of terminal illness. But I would like to specifically refer to his third scenario in which he portrayed an accident victim, a young man of 20 years old, being rushed into the hospital following a traffic accident. He had sustained serious head injuries and stayed in the Intensive Care Unit. His condition deteriorated and he became brain dead. This is a situation in which the AMD Act and HOTA clearly overlap. For such a patient, three doctors in one case, or two in the other, would need to certify him brain dead before the life support \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> equipment, or his organs, could be removed under the respective Acts. It is inconceivable in such a case for the AMD Act and HOTA to have different standards for certifying a common condition. Moreover, if the patient is covered under both the AMD Act and HOTA, the hospital will be left in a quandary as to which Act takes precedence and, consequently, which procedure to follow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also anomalous that the patient is given lesser protection under HOTA where, unlike the AMD Act, the removal of organs follows the pronouncement by the doctor and therefore ought to have a protection level no less stringent than that of the AMD Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no qualms with the AMD Bill in principle. But the passing of the Bill today will create the anomalous situation which I have just described. This is not desirable. The Minister for Health had previously said that there was no urgency in legislating this Bill. I would, therefore, ask the Minister to defer the passage of this Bill until the differences with HOTA have been resolved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister for the rationale for having a two-tier system of six doctors to certify terminal cases. Some statements in the Minutes of Evidence of the Select Committee Report appeared to suggest that having the second panel of doctors would increase safeguards for patients against possible error of judgment by doctors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health had also expressed a similar view during the Second Reading of the Bill. He has said of the two-tier certification process, \"Where there is any doubt, this procedure will ensure that we err on the side of life.\" But does having another level of judgment really increase safeguards? Does it err on the side of life? I think not. It actually does the opposite. This is because the second panel of three specialists is only convened when there is no unanimity among the first group. When the first three doctors disagree, this decision \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> would allow the patient to live except that it could be reversed by a higher committee of three other doctors. Thus, the more levels you have, the greater the possibility of the patient being condemned. I wish to ask the Minister whether it would be better to have just one panel of three specialists which includes the patient's doctor if he qualifies to make the judgment. If the doctors agree unanimously, the AMD will be carried out. If any one of the doctors disagrees, the patient continues to receive life-sustaining treatment. This will ensure the quality of judgment that we seek to provide and yet err on the side of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Members who have just spoken for their comments, for their thoughtful suggestions, for their concerns and for some moving, inspiring words about the nature of life and the problem of crossing this twilight zone between life and death. I thank Mr Loh Meng See for his kind words concerning the process with which we brought this Bill into its Third reading. We have deliberately taken our time, spent almost two years now on it from the beginning, making sure that all sectors of our society were consulted. Many views were tossed up, considered and incorporated, where possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin asked whether we could not make the definitions clearer. If the definitions could be made clearer, there would not have been the need for this Bill. Does the Bill create grey areas where there were none? It does not, because the grey areas exist as a condition of life. Every day it is being faced by doctors in hospitals. Every day family members, doctors and specialists have to make decisions. Very often, imperfect decisions. Very often, without consensus. Very often, resulting in recriminations years after the patient had passed away. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are trying to do here is to allow those who feel strongly about their own wishes to state them in advance so that doctors and family members will know when the time comes. And this, in fact, removes the heavy burden from those \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> who would otherwise have to make the decision anyway in this grey area. It is not something which can be solved by words. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin said that definitions are tautological. They are not tautological. They are subjective. They are subjective precisely because this is an area in which we cannot escape from human beings having to apply their minds and their hearts and exercising human judgment and human wisdom. There is no way by which the words can be so cunningly redrafted that all of us can then say, \"All right, let the words decide for us.\" That is not possible. And yet we know that decisions have to be made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, a patient in the final stage of cancer suddenly having a heart attack. The doctors have to decide. Do you try to resuscitate the patient? All right, you resuscitate. The heart pumps again and the patient lives on for a few more days, maybe for a few more weeks. Is this what the patient would have wanted? Is this what family members want? Is this what doctors would have prescribed? Or a patient has an infection, dying from pneumonia. And today, with medical technology, with antibiotics, you can treat the pneumonia and keep the patient living for a few more days. As medical technology advances, there are all kinds of new methods that you can introduce to stretch out the dying process. Is it natural? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, between doctors and family members, usually they can come to a decision, to a consensus. But as our population becomes more educated, I think they will become more litigious. And once a few doctors are sued in court for not doing enough, very quickly all doctors will keep on treating till the family members say no. And are we sure that family members can agree among themselves? Brothers, sisters, in-laws involved in a decision, very often it is very complicated. The result is tremendous stress for everyone. So if the person himself says, \"Look, let me give my input so that you don't have to worry.\", I think that is a great help. But, of course, if you as a patient decide, \"No, I will leave it to my wife. I will leave it to my son. I will leave it to my doctor.\", so be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no intention whatsoever to conduct a campaign to promote the AMD. That is not the intention. The intention is to have it available for those who feel that they want it. And we will have a programme to educate all our doctors, health care practitioners and members of the public to know what it is about, so that they can make a choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin asked whether most people understand the concept of informed consent. They may not. And if they do not, they should not do the AMD. But if they understand what informed consent is and they decide to have it, I do not think it is for us to deny them this facility, which is why I am not in favor of further postponing this legislation. But we are not pushing it and I respect the comments made by many Members here that we should not rush into the implementation without due regard for the details. And as Dr Soin said, the devil may well be in the details, and I think she is right there. I am particularly appreciative of the views expressed by Dr Michael Lim and Dr Kanwaljit Soin who are themselves medical practitioners, advising me to watch the implementation and not to make it burdensome. In implementing it, we should not create new problems for ourselves which defeats the original purpose of the legislation. So we will try to create something which is the least burdensome to doctors and health care practitioners, something which can be widely understood by all, but something which in the end relies on common sense and human wisdom. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cheo Chai Chen supported the legislation. But he mentioned that we should not reduce the number of witnesses from two to one in respect of the revocation of the AMD. I think Mr Cheo misunderstood what was intended. We are not reducing the number of witnesses required before we pull the plug. We are saying that if a patient decides to revoke his AMD, there need only be one witness. Because it may be a few minutes or a few hours of consciousness in between critical periods when a patient has changed his mind, and only one person may be there. That one person should be good enough. This matter was discussed at the Select \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Committee and we decided, \"Look, that is right. If the patient has indicated any change of mind, accept it.\" I think that is fairer to him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim suggested that the panel of specialists, in the event that this matter could not be decided by the lower committee, if it goes up to the panel of three specialists, should not just make a decision on the basis of case sheets and case notes but go down to the bedside to look at the patient themselves. I will take up his point. I think here what we seek is not a rigid administrative procedure but good medical practice. In other words, if doctors in the committee cannot decide, there must be good reasons why they cannot decide. If the panel feels that they have got to go down to assess the situation for themselves, then they should go down. But I do not think that we should prescribe it in law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether doctors who unthinkingly and without malice divulging information being hauled to the Medical Council or to court for infringement, I think here we will apply common sense. The purpose here is not to make life difficult for doctors but to help them help the patients they are looking after. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John De Payva asked why is there a need for confidentiality. I think it is important to have some safeguards on confidentiality because the fact of an AMD itself may change the way doctors treat their patients. There is that possibility. The Medical Ethics Committee, which first looked at this matter, discussed it fully this was discussed by the Health Ministry also and we decided that, like the making of a will by a human being, the contents of the will, if it is to be divulged, should be divulged by the patient himself and not by those who are custodians of that will. Because we do not know whether he wants others to know. And in the case of doctors who are treating him, it may affect their decisions. But if the patient himself decides to inform his wife, his relatives, his friends, his doctors, it is perfectly in order, because that is the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> patient's own judgment. But the law should protect him in the event that he wishes to have confidentiality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of spouses and immediate family members, indeed, we are going to recommend that in all cases, the AMD be made in consultation with family members. But however you consult, in the end, it is your own decision. The family doctor ought to be one of the witnesses, but we cannot be sure that the family doctor is the best doctor in every case. Because depending on the person, he may or may not have a family doctor. He may have a family doctor in name, but he may not be the family doctor he goes to all the time. Sometimes he goes to see his company doctors, sometimes he goes to a polyclinic. Sometimes for different conditions, he sees different specialists in hospitals. So it is very difficult for us to put in the Bill a special place for the family doctor. But in all cases where a GP is recommended, it is the family doctor who should be there, because he would know the patient and his family the most. And that point would be taken into account when we implement this Bill and conduct our education programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Imram raised what he felt to be an inconsistency between the number of two doctors required to certify brain death under the Human Organs Transplant Act (HOTA) and the three doctors necessary to certify terminal illness. In the case of HOTA, brain death is defined as death. It is only for HOTA. It is not for all the other statutes. As I mentioned earlier in this House, at some point in time, we will have to resolve what is the position of brain death in our law. In fact, brain death is the most conclusive definition of death, much more than the heart stopping. To certify brain death, the issue arises when you keep the heart pumping artificially, but in fact the brain is dead. Then you got to certify that the patient is in fact brain dead before you can then switch off the heart/lung machine to stop the heart from pumping. The procedures are quite complicated. It involves checking the cornea, pouring cold water into the ear canal, a series of seven tests which are very technical in nature. These are not subjective. These are objective criteria to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> determine brain death, internationally accepted, which is why there is no need to have more than two doctors to do it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of AMD, we are not certifying death. We are certifying terminal illness and that inherently is a more subjective view, which is why three doctors are required. It may well be that the patient is already brain dead and has made an AMD, and the three doctors decide that he is already brain dead. Therefore, he is already terminally ill and therefore they can switch off the heart/lung machine. But for most cases of terminal illness, it is not so straightforward and therefore three doctors are required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Imram also asked what happens if someone comes under both HOTA and has made an AMD. So we have, for example, a case of someone involved in a traffic accident and therefore coming under the ambit of HOTA, assuming he has not opted out, and let us say he has also made an AMD. If he is already brain dead, then he is defined as dead under HOTA and the issue of AMD does not then arise. In other words, in the case of someone being covered by both, then HOTA comes first because he is by definition already dead, and therefore the AMD does not arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Imram also asked whether it is necessary to have this two-tier system, that the more tiers you have the more you condemn a person to death. I think that is turning things the wrong way round. We must not forget that a person who has made an AMD has made a serious decision that he does not want the dying \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> process to be prolonged when he is terminally ill. So we should respect that wish. If a lower committee of doctors cannot decide, we are submitting it to a higher committee in order to be doubly sure that we are acceding to his wish, and that we are not at all condemning him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered the main issues raised by Members. As I said earlier, we have taken a long time to discuss all aspects of the Bill, turn it around, look at it front side, back side. The problem is now implementation and I fully respect the concerns of Members that good implementation is very important and I assure Members that we will not take this lightly and that in our education programme and in the development of administrative procedures, we will try to anticipate all problems, gain some experiences as we go along, make a review after a year, make adjustments if necessary, come back to this House if necessary, so that what we have is something which is a facility some of us can resort to with a certain peace of mind if we feel that it is good for us and for our family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Eleven Minutes\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to Six o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SUPERSCALE GOVERNMENT OFFICERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Prime Minister how many government officers are on Superscale Grade E and above as at 31 December 1995 and how many of these officers are overseas scholars. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31 December 1995, there were a total of 156 officers in the Civil Service at Superscale Grade E and higher.

Also, we have only 27 missions abroad while eligible voters are all over the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PROTECTION ORDERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Law, in respect of 1995, what is the number of (i) protection orders, expedited orders and domestic exclusion orders issued by the courts; (ii) repeat protection orders issued; and (iii) cases of, and persons charged with, breach of protection orders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.
