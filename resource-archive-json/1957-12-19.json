Sir, it is very surprising that\r\n\r\nthere  are no experts within the Ministry to draft\r\n\r\nrules  or  regulations  and to  prepare  textbooks\r\n\r\nregarding  the  Land  Titles  Ordinance.  In   the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  I do find that we have one Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Lands,  one Deputy Commissioner of Lands,  one\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Titles and one Examiner of Titles. We\r\n\r\nhave  four senior officers who are well conversant\r\n\r\nwith  land titles and so forth, and yet  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  in  a  position  to  prepare  a  Land  Titles\r\n\r\nOrdinance  or  to draft rules and  regulations.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see why, Sir. What are they for? We employ\r\n\r\nsenior  officers for the purpose of  running  that\r\n\r\nMinistry. All of them have qualifications on  land\r\n\r\ntitles and so forth, yet they cannot prepare these\r\n\r\ndraft rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory serves me right, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nsometime  last  year  or so we  sent  our  former\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Lands, who is now, I  understand,\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretary, to Australia  to  study\r\n\r\nthis question of land titles. He is back with us.\r\n\r\nWhat  has  he done and why cannot he prepare  the\r\n\r\ndraft rules or regulations? Is it necessary  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  now  appoint  a  special  adviser  to\r\n\r\nprepare  them  at  a cost to Government  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  of $36,240? Will this not be a  waste  of\r\n\r\nfunds?  If  the senior officers in  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ncannot  prepare them, they are not fit to  remain\r\n\r\nin   office.  I  am  rather  surprised  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister is not aware whether officers in it  can\r\n\r\nor  cannot prepare such rules and regulations  in\r\n\r\nrespect of land titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is not the Minister who  is  not\r\n\r\naware  of something happening in his Ministry,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is the hon.

I  do  not  know how he  will  face  his\r\n\r\nelectorate  when he goes back to the country  next\r\n\r\nyear.  I would like to see how he tells them  when\r\n\r\nhe goes back.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, is on the question of a\r\n\r\nhousing  authority. This subject has been  brought\r\n\r\nup  in this Assembly time and time again but do we\r\n\r\nhave a housing authority yet? There is none. May I\r\n\r\nrefresh  the Minister, Sir, that when  he  assumed\r\n\r\noffice  he  said that he would set  up  a  housing\r\n\r\nauthority.  Has he forgotten that?  He  said  that\r\n\r\nwithin a very short time he would certainly set up\r\n\r\none. May I refresh his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmemory  by  reading from Volume 1, No. 1,  of  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Report for 22nd April, 1955, column  40?\r\n\r\nWhen he assumed office, he said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In addition, it is proposed to tackle the\r\n\r\nhousing problem more vigorously and efficiently by\r\n\r\nsetting  up a statutory Housing Authority,  solely\r\n\r\nresponsible to Government, to replace the  present\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust. It is hoped that such\r\n\r\na   Housing   Authority  would  be   able   in   a\r\n\r\ncomparatively short time to bridge the  increasing\r\n\r\ngap  between  public  housing programmes  and  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he says \"a comparatively short time\". May I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister,  Sir, how short  is  a  \"short\r\n\r\ntime\",  or it may be how long? I do not know  what\r\n\r\nhe  means by it. It may mean the time from the day\r\n\r\nhe  assumed office until the day he is no more  in\r\n\r\nit.  That would be from three-and-a-half  to  four\r\n\r\nyears;  would that be a \"short time\"? May  I  also\r\n\r\nremind the Minister, Sir, that life is also short.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to refer to my question on\r\n\r\n16th  October,  1957,  on  the  progress  of   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of this housing authority.  I  will\r\n\r\nrefresh his memory by reading what he said (column\r\n\r\n2656):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am not quite sure whether the hon.

A\r\n\r\nstatement  can  be in one sentence  or  in  twenty\r\n\r\nsentences.  I  have  made  my  statement  in   one\r\n\r\nsentence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made his statement very, very short in - one\r\n\r\nsentence - and I think that is what he  meant  by  a\r\n\r\n\"short time\". In his reply, I may say - if I may  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  continue  on  this  subject - he  said,\r\n\r\n\"there  is  no  delay  in the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nHousing Authority.\" I will read again, from column\r\n\r\n2656:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Is the Minister aware of the\r\n\r\nconcern of the public in the long delay in setting\r\n\r\nup this Housing Authority?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> There is no delay, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he has been two-and-a-half years in\r\n\r\noffice  and  he  has promised this House  that  he\r\n\r\nwill,  \"in a comparatively short time\", set  up  a\r\n\r\nhousing  authority. Two-and-a-half  years  is  not\r\n\r\nenough for the Government to set it up! Every time\r\n\r\nthis question is brought up in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse,  the  reply  is that  it  is  still  under\r\n\r\nconsideration and that 'we will submit  a  report\r\n\r\nvery  soon,  or  \"in due course,\"  which  is  the\r\n\r\nnormal  term  of the Government'. How  long  more\r\n\r\nwill  this delay be?

The  Minister   himself\r\n\r\nrealises  that  the  housing  authority  is  most\r\n\r\nessential  to  take over from the S.I.T.,  as  he\r\n\r\nstated  on  22nd April, 1955, column  40  of  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Report. Yet, after two-and-a-half  years\r\n\r\nwe  do not have a housing authority to take over.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the result? - there are still thousands\r\n\r\nand  thousands  of  outstanding applications  for\r\n\r\nS.I.T. accommodation. They are still waiting  and\r\n\r\nwaiting. Is it the function of the S.I.T. to keep\r\n\r\npeople  in  suspense,  waiting  and  waiting  for\r\n\r\naccommodation? How long will it take? May  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  it is a real shame for the Minister to say,\r\n\r\nin  reply  to  a  question of mine sometime  this\r\n\r\nyear, that so far in 1957 not a single house  has\r\n\r\nbeen  allotted to the public. What a  shame!  And\r\n\r\nwhat  a  government  which states  that  it  will\r\n\r\nprovide  houses and so forth and yet has not  one\r\n\r\nsingle  house or one single flat allotted to  the\r\n\r\npublic this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Government or the Labour Front,\r\n\r\nSir, that on its posters during Election time, it\r\n\r\nwas   stated  in  Chinese,  \"Clothing,  food  and\r\n\r\nhousing:  If elected, if we come into  power, we\r\n\r\nwill   provide  the  public  with   these   three\r\n\r\nessentials.  Number  one  is  clothing;  we  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the public with clothing. Next, we  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the public with food; and next, we  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the  public with housing.\" This  is  the\r\n\r\nposter put up by the Labour Front at that time. I\r\n\r\nwas  lucky that I did not use these Labour  Front\r\n\r\nposters  for my election purposes - I  had  my  own\r\n\r\nposters - and I am therefore not responsible  or  a\r\n\r\nparty  to that statement. Housing is of the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  platforms of the Government or  Labour\r\n\r\nFront, yet after all these years it cannot find a\r\n\r\nhouse for the public!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this, Sir? Is this what the Government\r\n\r\nis  trying  to do, to neglect its duty and  delay\r\n\r\nand delay? When are we going to have houses? When\r\n\r\ndo  we  expect to have the slum areas cleared?  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister: when can he  make\r\n\r\na  final decision on this housing authority? I am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  his reply again will be,  'Within  a\r\n\r\nvery short time'. But I would like a definite and\r\n\r\na specific 'short time' - is it to be a matter of a\r\n\r\nday,  a week, a month or in another l\u00bd years when\r\n\r\nhe may be no more in office!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I would like to refer to is\r\n\r\nthe  decision  made by the S.I.T. on  citizenship\r\n\r\nand  eligibility for houses, which is  now  being\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the Government. The  Board  of  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. has decided that only Singapore  Citizens\r\n\r\ncan  apply for accommodation and that no one else\r\n\r\ncan. Prior to this decision, aliens who have been\r\n\r\nhere  10 years and more could apply. What is  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. going to do with the applications now  in\r\n\r\nits  hands  from aliens? The reply  may  be  that\r\n\r\nsince they are aliens, they are not considered to\r\n\r\nbe  local  people, and will not be provided  with\r\n\r\nS.I.T. accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the House that I asked a question:\r\n\r\nwhat  would  be the fate of those who  wanted  to\r\n\r\nbecome  citizens  but could  not  get  themselves\r\n\r\nregistered  by 31st January, 1958?  I believe  my\r\n\r\nquestion was ruled out as being hypothetical  and\r\n\r\nI  could not press the matter further. Now is  it\r\n\r\nthe fault of these aliens? Is it that they do not\r\n\r\nwant  to become citizens? It is not their  fault.\r\n\r\nThey  are anxious to become citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  just because of the rush, the crowds and the\r\n\r\nlong  queues  lined  up at all  the  registration\r\n\r\ncentres  they  cannot  have  a  chance   to   get\r\n\r\nthemselves  registered in  time.  Is  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\ngoing to deprive them of a house? Is it going  to\r\n\r\nscrap   all   applications  from  these   aliens,\r\n\r\napplications submitted long ago? Some might  have\r\n\r\nsubmitted their applications five years  ago,  or\r\n\r\neven  10  years  ago. Yet today  the  S.I.T. has\r\n\r\ndecided, and the Government may decide, that they\r\n\r\nwill  be  removed  from the register  or  waiting\r\n\r\nlist. Is it fair, Sir, that after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwaiting  in  suspense for five to ten years,  and\r\n\r\nwith  no fault of not wanting to become Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens, they will have to be chucked out of the\r\n\r\nregister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will take note of all\r\n\r\nthese  points and I would like to hear  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister has to say in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  endorse  the  remarks of the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  particularly  those  concerning  the\r\n\r\nhousing authority. The delay in the establishment\r\n\r\nof  this  housing authority, up  to  the  closing\r\n\r\nstages of the life of the present Government, has\r\n\r\nthrown  the whole housing programme, particularly\r\n\r\nthose  of  private  builders, completely  out  of\r\n\r\ngear.  With  no central authority  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nplans,  and with plans having to be submitted  in\r\n\r\nseven  copies  to different bodies - the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust, the City Council or the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard,  the Health Department and others - and  the\r\n\r\ninsistence that everything must be cleared before\r\n\r\nbeing passed from one body to another, plans have\r\n\r\ntaken over a year to be approved. Sometimes  even\r\n\r\nafter  a  year,  plans  are  sent  back  and  the\r\n\r\narchitects who sent them in are asked  to  submit\r\n\r\nnew  ones, because new ideas have come  up  about\r\n\r\nthe siting of roads and their standards. This has\r\n\r\ncaused  such delay that, instead of building  the\r\n\r\n3,000 houses which I anticipated two companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore   could  have  done,  they  have   only\r\n\r\ncompleted about 1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately this delay has now caused the\r\n\r\ncollapse  of all private development  because  of\r\n\r\nthe   money  tightness  and  the  disinflationery\r\n\r\nsqueeze.  No loans can now be obtained  from  the\r\n\r\nbuilding societies. Therefore, you are not  going\r\n\r\nto  get  any  more  houses built  by  the  public\r\n\r\ninvesting people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have always advocated that housing should\r\n\r\nbe  the  work not only of Government, but private\r\n\r\ndevelopers as well, private developers  to  cater\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  earn more than $400  or  $500  a\r\n\r\nmonth - particularly senior Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants  who are about to retire,  who  can  buy\r\n\r\ntheir own houses and when the time for retirement\r\n\r\ncomes have a house of their own - and the S.I.T. to\r\n\r\nhouse  people with smaller incomes who are unable\r\n\r\nto buy the houses, and of course some unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople  who  always have to be helped by  subsidy\r\n\r\nfrom  Government. But all this now, Sir, has been\r\n\r\nthrown  completely  out of gear  and  I  do  urge\r\n\r\nGovernment  to bring this housing authority  into\r\n\r\nbeing as soon as possible, so that we can get  on\r\n\r\nwith the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important aspect of this housing\r\n\r\nauthority  is in the provision of factory  sites,\r\n\r\nas  we  are now striving for secondary  or  light\r\n\r\nindustries.   If   we  are   to   encourage   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of industries, we must  not  insist\r\n\r\non standards of building which make it impossible\r\n\r\nfor a small man with a capital of, say $10,000 to\r\n\r\n$20,000,  to  start a factory.  You  have  to  be\r\n\r\nrealistic. You have to provide sites quickly  and\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  put up their  own  buildings  as\r\n\r\ncheaply  as  possible consistent with  safety.  I\r\n\r\nhave   seen  plans  being  refused  because   the\r\n\r\nstandards of building are not high enough.  Well,\r\n\r\nin the past, nearly 100 years in Singapore, not a\r\n\r\nsingle factory has collapsed on the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we must get plans for\r\n\r\nfactories  for  light industries approved  within\r\n\r\nthree months at the latest; not when you sent  it\r\n\r\nin,  it is sent back again and the reason  it  is\r\n\r\nasked  to  be  withdrawn is because it  does  not\r\n\r\nconform  to the requirements of the Master  Plan.\r\n\r\nThey  put  it  very nicely of course;  they  say,\r\n\r\n'Will  you do this and that?' But all that  takes\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure if Government wants to help, it can be\r\n\r\ndone.  And it must be done, otherwise we will  be\r\n\r\nburdened with more and more unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   strongly  endorse  the  remarks  made  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the hon.

The Planning Section\r\n\r\nwas  formerly  run  by four officers  but  now  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that one of the officers is on  leave,\r\n\r\none   has   been  boarded  out  and   the   third\r\n\r\ntransferred to be Acting Chairman of  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\n(because  the  Chairman of the  S.I.T. has  been transferred  to  be adviser to the  Minister  for Local  Government, Lands and Housing). Why cannot\r\n\r\nmore  officials be put in the Department in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  fact  that those development  plans  are\r\n\r\nessential for this country?

I  understand   that\r\n\r\n500,000 application forms have been given out  by\r\n\r\nthe  Department concerned. I read  in  the  Press\r\n\r\nthis   morning  that  166,000  people  have  been\r\n\r\nregistered  by now. I think it is high  time  the\r\n\r\nDepartment    looks   into   the   matter    very\r\n\r\ncarefully - how  many persons it  expects  will  be\r\n\r\nregistered, how many have registered and what  is\r\n\r\nthe  balance  of expected registrations,  and  to\r\n\r\nappoint    more   registration   teams.    Surely\r\n\r\nGovernment can appoint more teams because  people\r\n\r\nare  finding  difficulty. When  they  ask  for  a\r\n\r\nregistration  team, they are given dates  further\r\n\r\nand  further off and the people are not sure that\r\n\r\nthey can be registered within the period. I agree\r\n\r\nthat  the  registration period  should  never  be\r\n\r\nextended  but the opportunity should be taken  of\r\n\r\nhaving more teams so that people who want to  get\r\n\r\nregistered can be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, it is really gratifying to note\r\n\r\nthat  all  Members of the Opposition support  and\r\n\r\nendorse the housing authority which is one of the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of the Labour Front and  not  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.

I  hope to have it introduced  for  its\r\n\r\nFirst Reading at its very first sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allegation that the S.I.T. has been\r\n\r\nsleeping and has not been building any house,  may\r\n\r\nI  remind  Members that, at the time I replied  to\r\n\r\nquestions in this Assembly to the effect  that  no\r\n\r\nhousing  units  had  been completed  or  allocated\r\n\r\nbetween August 1956 and April 1957, there were  no\r\n\r\nless than 4,000 houses under construction? By  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1958, most of these houses will have  been\r\n\r\ncompleted - and probably allocated as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other allegation, about delay in\r\n\r\npassing  plans. Here again, Sir, I have  explained\r\n\r\nto  the  House  that the S.I.T. is  not  the  only\r\n\r\nauthority  responsible  for  passing  plans.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, you have also the City Council,  and  I ,\r\n\r\nas  Minister, cannot in any way interfere with the\r\n\r\nworkings of the City Council. Similarly, you  have\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Board, probably the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nand other departments, whose \"chops\" you must have\r\n\r\non  the  plans  before you can  proceed  with  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Do something about it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> But if I may say this, if\r\n\r\nthere are any members of the public who feel  that\r\n\r\nthey have been let down very badly by the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment of the S.I.T., I shall be only too glad\r\n\r\nto  be of any assistance to them, particularly,  I\r\n\r\nthink, to the Member for Paya Lebar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nthink  this  House will agree that  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing\r\n\r\nhas  failed to answer the allegation raised by the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Tiong Bahru about  shortage  of\r\n\r\nstaff  in the Planning Department of the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. Of course we accept that it  is\r\n\r\nquite  a  complicated matter for a  plan  to  pass\r\n\r\nthrough the Rural Board, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity  Council and other bodies, but I think it  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  known that the S.I.T. is the main  body\r\n\r\ncausing all the delay in passing plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that this House has yet to be\r\n\r\ninformed  by the Minister when he can  promise  it\r\n\r\nthat  the housing authority can be set up to  take\r\n\r\nover the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add my last point for the Government\r\n\r\nto   consider.   Since  under  the  Master   Plan,\r\n\r\nsatellite towns are going to be set up,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  Government insists on building multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nhouses to house what I should say are middle class\r\n\r\npeople able to pay at least $30 per flat. But  how\r\n\r\nabout those who live in cubicles and pay from  $10\r\n\r\nto $20 for a single room? Does the Government ever\r\n\r\nconsider  building more low-cost housing to  house\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  really poor? These people  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay  the lowest rent  charged  by  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.,  i.e. $30. I suggest that there  are  many\r\n\r\nvacant  pieces  of  land in  the  rural  areas  or\r\n\r\noutskirts of the city on which we can build  cheap\r\n\r\nhouses  (especially as we have an expert on houses\r\n\r\nwith us - I mean the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Koon Teck, who can build low-cost houses) and\r\n\r\ncharge a very low rent. This will enable the  poor\r\n\r\nto enjoy the fresh air and sunshine as others do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the S.I.T. in its planning has\r\n\r\nstudied  the  surveys made by the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment of the average income of the people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  considered how  many  people  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay the rent it charges.  Many  people\r\n\r\ncannot  pay the rent by themselves and are  forced\r\n\r\nto  invite  relatives or friends  to  share  their\r\n\r\nflats, which is against the regulations, and  they\r\n\r\nare  asked to quit. But does the S.I.T. not  know\r\n\r\nthat  these  people would like to have  the  whole\r\n\r\nflat  to  themselves as much as do those  who  can\r\n\r\nafford  to pay? As they cannot afford to  pay  the\r\n\r\nrent  themselves, they therefore  have  to  invite\r\n\r\nrelatives,  friends  or even  strangers  to  share\r\n\r\ntheir  flats.  Yet the S.I.T. rules that  this  is\r\n\r\nagainst regulations. In order, therefore, to  save\r\n\r\nall  the trouble to be to visit the Courts, I wish\r\n\r\nand  strongly suggest that Government will  follow\r\n\r\nthe summoned in and summoned out, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciple of setting up satellite towns and build\r\n\r\nmany,  many more low-cost houses in them for  the\r\n\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not the\r\n\r\nduty   of   the  Hon. the  Minister  for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment, Lands and Housing to pay a  visit  to\r\n\r\nthe Planning Section of the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust? He will find there the cause of the  delay\r\n\r\nin the approval of the development plans. In that\r\n\r\nsmall office, all around, even in the corners, he\r\n\r\nwill  find piles and piles of plans, plans  which\r\n\r\nhave lain idle for months and months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want prosperity in Singapore. If you have\r\n\r\nthose  plans passed, we will create it. They  are\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans; they are essential. They  will\r\n\r\ncreate employment for our people. They will  lead\r\n\r\nto  the building of more factories. Why then  are\r\n\r\nthere delays?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister responsible, it is his duty to\r\n\r\npay a visit to this office. I understand that the\r\n\r\ndepartment is understaffed. Before, its work  was\r\n\r\ndone  by four officers, as I said earlier  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech,  but  it  is now being run  by  only  one\r\n\r\nofficer.  Why should there be delay?

I think he\r\n\r\nsaid  that he has 70 areas comprising about 2,600\r\n\r\nfarm  plots for clearance and resettlement. I  am\r\n\r\nnot clear whether he has already cleared these 70\r\n\r\nareas,  or that there are 70 areas in all in  the\r\n\r\nColony  to  be cleared. If it is 70 areas  to  be\r\n\r\ncleared, I would like the Minister to tell us how\r\n\r\nmany has he cleared so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that he said he made no promise\r\n\r\nduring  his  election campaign to provide  better\r\n\r\nconditions  of living for attap dwellers.  May  I\r\n\r\ncall it a tradition, Sir, for promises always  to\r\n\r\nbe  made by candidates during election time,  but\r\n\r\nwhen  they  get  into  power,  they  forget   the\r\n\r\npromises?  So I will not blame him for not  being\r\n\r\naware  now  or not being able to remember  having\r\n\r\nmade  such  a promise. As a member of the  public\r\n\r\nwho  was at his election rallies, I think  I  can\r\n\r\nremember better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on the housing authority. He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  at  the  first opportunity  he  would\r\n\r\nreport  to this Assembly on its establishment.  I\r\n\r\ndo hope sincerely, Sir, that the next time we sit\r\n\r\nhere,  he  will place legislation for  a  housing\r\n\r\nauthority  before this House, and that after  the\r\n\r\nnext  sitting  we  will in fact  have  a  housing\r\n\r\nauthority to take over the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is that he said I accused him or\r\n\r\nthe Government of not having built any houses. My\r\n\r\naccusation was that the Government had so far not\r\n\r\nprovided   a  flat  to  the  many  thousands   of\r\n\r\napplicants   on  the  waiting  list  for   S.I.T.\r\n\r\naccommodation. He had clearly stated in his reply\r\n\r\nto  me some time earlier that so far this year no\r\n\r\nhouses  had  been  allotted  to  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic. Is it not a shame for the Government that\r\n\r\nnot even one single house has been allotted while\r\n\r\nthe  main posters of the Labour Front - may I quote\r\n\r\nagain - promise  three main items  \"clothing,  food\r\n\r\nand -\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

Is the Government going to wait  until\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1958 to allocate houses? He has  not\r\n\r\nsaid in his reply that he will commence forthwith\r\n\r\nto  allot houses to those on the waiting list. He\r\n\r\nonly said that he was quite confident that by the\r\n\r\nend  of  1958  there would be quite a  number  of\r\n\r\nhouses completed.

Opposition Members  have\r\n\r\nsaid  the  Government is causing delay in building\r\n\r\nhomes.  Sir,  nearly 18 months ago, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  planned the  redevelopment  of\r\n\r\nCovent  Gardens.  In Covent Gardens  there  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of tenants facing eviction. Government  has\r\n\r\noffered them alternative accommodation. The S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhas  taken  care to offer all of them  alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation.  There have been some  difficulties\r\n\r\non  the part of the tenants which were brought  to\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Minister, and  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  done  all  he can to relieve them.

This is a test  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. Let us see whether they will share the\r\n\r\njob   of   providing  homes  for  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  whether they are true and  sincere  in\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that anyone in Singapore can\r\n\r\naccuse this Government of trying to delay building\r\n\r\nhomes for the people.

On what grounds? I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  he was here when I mentioned  that\r\n\r\nonly  3,000 houses had been built within the last\r\n\r\ntwo   and   a  half  years - the  life   of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment -  out of a total target of  well  over\r\n\r\n10,000.

There  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of building 4,000 or 5,000 houses  each\r\n\r\nyear. The capacity for building and various other\r\n\r\nincidental factors make it difficult  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncertain  quota  per year. The  cost  of  building\r\n\r\nmaterials,   the   cost  of   labour,   and   the\r\n\r\navailability   of   both   these    items,    are\r\n\r\ncontributory factors in building, and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  for a moment that I need remind  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Paya Lebar of all these difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhat we would like to hear from the Opposition is\r\n\r\nan appreciation of the housing problem in general\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  and  the  part  played   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in solving that problem.  If  anybody\r\n\r\ncan  challenge  us  and say  that  there  are  no\r\n\r\ndifficulties in building houses in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has not taken any steps  to\r\n\r\nbuild  them,  then  we  will  bow  down  to   the\r\n\r\nOpposition and we will say we have failed.

My point in taking part  in\r\n\r\nthis  debate  is to urge the Government  to  build\r\n\r\nmore  cheap houses in the rural areas, because  it\r\n\r\nis  there that we can get cheaper land. One  thing\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  not happy about is that in the  rural\r\n\r\ndistricts, when people want to build a house, they\r\n\r\nhave  to submit plans to the Rural Board and these\r\n\r\nplans are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  passed on to the S.I.T. for final approval,\r\n\r\nand  then  the people have to build according  to\r\n\r\nthe  building regulations laid down for the  City\r\n\r\narea.

We  gave  them\r\n\r\nthe  plans.  They  then turned  round  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, this matter has to go to the S.I.T.\" So  I\r\n\r\napproached  the S.I.T.

I am not blaming all\r\n\r\nthe  government departments, but I  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister look into such matters,  especially\r\n\r\nwhere they affect the poor. The overseer will not\r\n\r\ngo  to the rich people and worry them because  he\r\n\r\nknows  such  people could get legal advice.  They\r\n\r\nhave  plenty of money.

So he said, \"Mr Goh, it is  now  one\r\n\r\nyear  since the roof was repaired?\" I  said,  \"You\r\n\r\nmean to say that an attap roof lasts for only one\r\n\r\nyear - should it not last at least seven years?

Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang. He suggested that the Government  should\r\n\r\nbuy  up land and then cut it up into small  plots\r\n\r\nand hand them out to people to build on them.  If\r\n\r\nI  remember his words rightly, they are:  \"houses\r\n\r\naccording to their means.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I was asked to go to the house of a\r\n\r\nwidow.  Her husband, a hawker, had suddenly  died\r\n\r\nand  she was left with an aged mother-in-law  and\r\n\r\nsix  young children, the youngest being only five\r\n\r\ndays  old. She was under notice to quit from  the\r\n\r\nhouse  she was occupying. I am happy to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  company, which had acquired the  land  where\r\n\r\nher house was and which proposed to evict her, is\r\n\r\ntaking  a  most generous view of her lot  and  is\r\n\r\nprepared to give her a site for a new house free,\r\n\r\nand she would also be getting some money from the\r\n\r\ncompany towards the cost of a new building. But I\r\n\r\nwas  advised by a representative of that  company\r\n\r\nthat  the minimum amount she would need to  build\r\n\r\nthe  lowest quality of house for herself and  her\r\n\r\nfamily would be at least $3,000, after getting  a\r\n\r\nfree  site.  Of  course, she had not  a  hope  of\r\n\r\ngetting  that money from her own resources.  Even\r\n\r\nif  her husband had been alive, and living  as  a\r\n\r\nhawker, I cannot imagine how he, with very  heavy\r\n\r\ntransport cost from his residence to his place of\r\n\r\nwork  in  the centre of the city where he  had  a\r\n\r\nstall,  could  by  his own efforts  have  secured\r\n\r\n$3,000  to  put up a house even if  he  had  been\r\n\r\ngiven a free site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I am afraid that the hon.

Such  control\r\n\r\nincluded   the  taking  of  a  complete   census,\r\n\r\nmaintaining rigid control against new occupation,\r\n\r\nand effecting eventual clearance, including court\r\n\r\naction  and  execution  of  warrants.  From   1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1955,  it was decided  that  the  Trust\r\n\r\nshould retain management of only certain reverted\r\n\r\nhouses  in  areas  scheduled  for  clearance  and\r\n\r\nredevelopment  and  properties  declared  by  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. as  being  in a dangerous  condition  for\r\n\r\nwhich   new   housing  would  be  required.

Such classes\r\n\r\nas  have  been organised seem to us to be totally\r\n\r\ninadequate   and   are  not  of  lasting   enough\r\n\r\nduration - they  last  only  an  hour  or  so  each\r\n\r\nevening - and  therefore  we  consider  that   this\r\n\r\nincrease  of only $20,000 under this  subhead  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient.

Sufficient publicity has\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to these evening classes  which  are\r\n\r\nhoused  in  strategic centres. For  instance,  we\r\n\r\nhave them at Outram Road, Siglap and Beatty Road.\r\n\r\nThey  are  all scattered about in order to  cater\r\n\r\nfor people coming from the rural areas. Frankly I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know the reason why they have  not  been\r\n\r\ntaken  up, but we will do our best to tell  these\r\n\r\npeople  that the education provided  for  in  the\r\n\r\nevening   classes  will  make   them   at   least\r\n\r\nemployable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, it is indeed a\r\n\r\nsurprise  to hear the Minister for Education  say\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  shortage of  facilities  for\r\n\r\nsecondary  education,  but  to  me  the   biggest\r\n\r\nsurprise   is  the  news  that  there  are   many\r\n\r\nvacancies in the evening classes. Sir,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nif  everyone who follows local news closely knows\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Yap Pheng Geck, a well-known community\r\n\r\nleader, has concerned himself very much with this\r\n\r\nproblem  of  secondary education, especially  the\r\n\r\nover-age   students.   I   wonder   whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have ever tried to inform the  public\r\n\r\nthat  they are providing adequate facilities  for\r\n\r\nthese  over-age  students. I also wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthese evening classes provide the same curriculum\r\n\r\nas  in the daily schools and what is the position\r\n\r\nregarding    the    fees   and   the    teachers'\r\n\r\nqualifications. I wish the Government would  make\r\n\r\nit  clear  to the public that there are  adequate\r\n\r\nfacilities for secondary education. I  also  wish\r\n\r\nthe  Government to make a statement regarding Mr\r\n\r\nYap  Pheng  Geck's proposal to form a  subsidiary\r\n\r\neducational body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on\r\n\r\nFriday  last I said in this House that I welcomed\r\n\r\nthe  efforts made by community leaders  like  Mr\r\n\r\nYap  Pheng Geck and others who are trying to help\r\n\r\nsolve   the   education  problem   and   I   have\r\n\r\ninstructed the officers in my Ministry  to  give\r\n\r\nall assistance they can to such voluntary bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to stress to the hon.

These evening  classes\r\n\r\nare for those who have been found unfit to profit\r\n\r\nfrom   a   secondary  education.  Therefore   the\r\n\r\nsubjects given in these evening classes  will  be\r\n\r\nof  a  commercial nature to make them employable.\r\n\r\nNo  country can provide a secondary education for\r\n\r\nevery  child who wants it. If this were  done  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it would cost more than $100  million\r\n\r\nto   provide   every  child  with   a   secondary\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to inform the Member for Changi that\r\n\r\nthe   teachers   in  the  evening   classes   are\r\n\r\nqualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in view of the\r\n\r\nexplanation given by the Minister, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 45 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 33 therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make this quite brief as I have a\r\n\r\nfurther  amendment  to move shortly.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nenquire  the  reason for the reduction  of  about\r\n\r\n$300,000 in this vote to provide for the teaching\r\n\r\nof  English to Malay school pupils.

Malay  students\r\n\r\nin  increasing numbers are, I think,  anxious  to\r\n\r\ngain  entry  to secondary schools and  to  higher\r\n\r\neducation.

One\r\n\r\nof  the  most exciting things in modern  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas   been  the  spontaneous  growth  of  cultural\r\n\r\nsocieties - the   Arts  Society,  the   Photographic\r\n\r\nSociety (to mention but two) which are post-war in\r\n\r\norigin, and perhaps I might mention in all modesty\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Musical Society, which is 55  years\r\n\r\nold  and with which I have been actively connected\r\n\r\nfor  many years, particularly now that it is being\r\n\r\nmalayanised,  so  to  speak, by  the  return  from\r\n\r\noverseas  of many talented and well-trained  young\r\n\r\npeople.  The  other societies are, of course,  the\r\n\r\nChina  Society,  the Indian Fine Arts  Association\r\n\r\nand so on. At the same time, a group of about nine\r\n\r\nof the leading cultural societies, including those\r\n\r\nI  have  mentioned,  have  now  banded  themselves\r\n\r\ntogether as members of the Singapore Arts  Council\r\n\r\nwhich  is planning, among other things, a Festival\r\n\r\nof the Arts to take place very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question arises: What are going to be\r\n\r\nthe  duties and functions of this Grade G Cultural\r\n\r\nAffairs  Officer, and how is the grant of $100,000\r\n\r\nfor the promotion of cultural matters going to  be\r\n\r\nspent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmust  apologise  for not having  publicised  fully\r\n\r\nenough this new department in my Ministry when  it\r\n\r\nwas  decided to set it up. I am glad that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin brought it up so that  I  can\r\n\r\nmake use of this opportunity to do so,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Singapore Cultural Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  is to co-ordinate and assist the  various\r\n\r\ncultures  represented in this colony  and  develop\r\n\r\nthese cultures along the right lines. In the past,\r\n\r\nit  has  been  known that a number  of  worthwhile\r\n\r\nprojects  in the arts had to be abandoned  because\r\n\r\nvoluntary  bodies  which wanted to  sponsor  these\r\n\r\nprojects  had  to give up because of nothing  else\r\n\r\nbut lack of funds. Government have therefore given\r\n\r\nthe  task of co-ordinating cultural activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to the Ministry of Education. In  future\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Cultural Advisory  Council  will,\r\n\r\nfirstly, consider and make recommendations to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  on  cultural  matters  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nproviding  a  stimulus to the development  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious   cultures   represented   in   Singapore;\r\n\r\nsecondly, to  co-ordinate and  encourage  private\r\n\r\nefforts in any field of the arts; and thirdly,  to\r\n\r\neducate the ordinary citizen towards a more active\r\n\r\nappreciation of the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Cultural Advisory Council\r\n\r\nwill be the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  as  ex-officio Chairman.  I  intend  to\r\n\r\nappoint  a Vice-Chairman and he will of course  be\r\n\r\nelected  from  among the members of  the  Council.\r\n\r\nThey will be the Director of Information Services,\r\n\r\nthe  Director of Raffles Museum, the  Director  of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting,  the  Director of  Raffles  National\r\n\r\nLibrary,  four  nominees from the  Singapore  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil, one representative from the University of\r\n\r\nMalaya,   one  representative  from  the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  and  the Chairman  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil  for Adult Education. The Cultural Affairs\r\n\r\nOfficer will, of course, be the Secretary to  this\r\n\r\nCultural Advisory Council. I intend to make  these\r\n\r\nmembers  hold office for two years, or any  lesser\r\n\r\nperiod as the Minister may direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the duties of this Cultural Affairs Officer.\r\n\r\nHe  will  be  the Chief Executive Officer  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  dealing  with  fine  arts  and  cultural\r\n\r\nrelations. As I have mentioned earlier, he will  be\r\n\r\nthe Secretary of the Cultural Advisory Council and\r\n\r\nwill  also  deal with all cultural matters  on  an\r\n\r\ninternational level. Because of the scope  of  his\r\n\r\nduties, this officer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  have a sufficient status. That is why  we\r\n\r\nintend  to appoint a superscale G officer because\r\n\r\nwe  expect him to deal with international  bodies\r\n\r\nand  to  be  able to co-ordinate all the  private\r\n\r\nefforts that are floating about in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of a block grant of $100,000 is\r\n\r\nsubject  to the sanction of the Treasury.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to estimate now exactly how much  will\r\n\r\nbe  spent  on matters relating to fine  arts  and\r\n\r\ncultural  relations, because this is an  entirely\r\n\r\nnew  field. We have no precedents to guide us  in\r\n\r\nthis  matter. However, the system of working will\r\n\r\nbe that the Cultural Advisory Council will advise\r\n\r\nthe  Minister from time to time on how this money\r\n\r\nshould  be  spent.  If there is any  organisation\r\n\r\nthat  has a worth-while project relating to  fine\r\n\r\narts  or  culture, but which has not been carried\r\n\r\nout  for  lack  of funds, it can  apply  to  this\r\n\r\nCultural Advisory Council for consideration of  a\r\n\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also hoped that expenses for meeting the\r\n\r\nreception  of cultural missions from abroad  will\r\n\r\ncome from this block grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only an experiment, as I say, and it is\r\n\r\nto be undertaken after very careful consideration\r\n\r\nof  how  to  co-ordinate and channel  the  various\r\n\r\ncultural  activities in Singapore in  the  proper\r\n\r\ndirection. For this reason, the Cultural Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  to  consist  of  as  many  interests\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  various  cultural  bodies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I only rise, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  correct one very small point  from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin's remarks. He said  that  the\r\n\r\nArts  Society was post-war in origin. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat the Arts Society itself came into being post-war, but it was developed from a seed which  was\r\n\r\nsown back in 1936 and nourished through the years\r\n\r\nthereafter - the Inter-School Art Exhibitions.  The\r\n\r\npresent  Chairman  of the Arts  Society  was,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  originally a school-boy who won prizes  in\r\n\r\nthese Exhibitions. He went on to organising  them\r\n\r\nand  is  now an admirable Chairman for  the  Arts\r\n\r\nSociety; just as the former Secretary of the Arts\r\n\r\nSociety   was   also  a  schoolboy   who   became\r\n\r\ninterested in arts and continued his interest for\r\n\r\nmany years and helped to lay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  foundation. I only want to  give  credit  to\r\n\r\nthose  who did the work before the war from which\r\n\r\nthe Arts Society finally emerged post-war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I thank the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nand Works for correcting me. I would not want  to\r\n\r\nbe  wrong on a point like that. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay  how  much  we welcome the statement  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education, and I do hope that  there\r\n\r\nwill be no voices raised that $155,300 should not\r\n\r\nbe  spent  next year. There might be  people  who\r\n\r\nsay, \"Who wants difficult plays or ballets or art\r\n\r\nexhibitions  or  expensive  additions  to  museum\r\n\r\ncollections?\" The answers to objections  of  this\r\n\r\nsort,  I  feel,  never vary. The  lives  of  most\r\n\r\npeople are badly in need of illumination. One  of\r\n\r\nthe  ways  in  which this can be achieved  is  by\r\n\r\nshowing  as  fully as possible what can  be  done\r\n\r\nwhen  the imagination of our multiracial  country\r\n\r\nis  stirred. The scientist benefits from this  as\r\n\r\nmuch as the artist, and the shopkeeper as much as\r\n\r\nthe aesthete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling of quality is indispensable in a\r\n\r\ncompetitive world, and quality in one field  soon\r\n\r\ngives a taste for quality in another. Money spent\r\n\r\non   promoting  this  taste  is  well  spent  and\r\n\r\nencouragement of this kind should come  from  the\r\n\r\nstate. I would plead, however, that there must be\r\n\r\ncontinuity  in  a  project of  this  kind.  Money\r\n\r\ngranted  one year and withdrawn the next will  be\r\n\r\nmoney wasted. If a cultural project or a cultural\r\n\r\nsociety  is to thrive and produce results,  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  the  confidence that  finance  will  be\r\n\r\nforthcoming  for  more than a year,  or  it  will\r\n\r\nwither  and  die  and the grant  will  have  been\r\n\r\nthrown   away.  Nevertheless,  this  Government's\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  the importance of  the  arts  is\r\n\r\ngreatly  to  be welcomed, as I have said.  All  I\r\n\r\nwould  plead  is  that there should  be  as  much\r\n\r\nimagination  put into the administration  of  the\r\n\r\n$100,000  grant as has been put into the creation\r\n\r\nof  it.  The words \"Subject to Treasury sanction\"\r\n\r\nin  the  margin  have an ominous ring,  as  if  a\r\n\r\npainting   might  be  equated  in  value   to   a\r\n\r\ntypewriter or a symphony to \"filing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncabinets,  two.\"  I  make this  point  because  a\r\n\r\nprevious  imaginative project was ruined  by  the\r\n\r\nineptitude of the Department of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four professional musicians, each an expert in\r\n\r\ntheir   instruments,  were  engaged   on   3-year\r\n\r\ncontracts  a  few  years ago  to  play  in  Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya's Orchestra and to teach their instruments\r\n\r\nto pupils in the schools. They arrived and played\r\n\r\nin  the Orchestra, but were unfortunately ignored\r\n\r\nby  the  Education Department for a  considerable\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time,  because  nobody  got  down  to\r\n\r\narranging  the teaching periods, and  when  these\r\n\r\nwere  finally  arranged,  it  was  realised  that\r\n\r\ninstruments such as bassoons and oboes, horns and\r\n\r\nso  on  cost  money and there was no  grant  from\r\n\r\nwhich to buy such instruments on which the pupils\r\n\r\ncould  play and practise. So after two years  the\r\n\r\nmusicians  had  their  contracts  terminated  and\r\n\r\nhardly  a  single student had learnt  to  blow  a\r\n\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12 Noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only mention this because I do feel that one\r\n\r\nhas to be very careful, through this new Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil, to see that this amount is imaginatively\r\n\r\nadministered.  With  that  there  must   be   the\r\n\r\nrealisation  that results cannot appear  at  once\r\n\r\nbut   will   only  come  through   patience   and\r\n\r\npersistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am sure the House\r\n\r\nwill  join me in extending hearty congratulations\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Education, but I would  also\r\n\r\nlike to remind the House that he is very lucky to\r\n\r\nhave  a  most cultural-minded Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\nwho  will  be  taking  a great  interest  in  the\r\n\r\ncreation of this new department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has heard the speech delivered by the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for Tanglin, but I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out that this department is not only going\r\n\r\nsimply  to  promote culture. Culture  in  certain\r\n\r\npeople's  minds  or in some other  place  may  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  a  luxurious hobby.  But  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday is much in need of this department, because\r\n\r\nwe are faced with the possibility of racial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconflicts, which is especially very obvious  when\r\n\r\nwe  merge with the Federation of Malaya. Who  can\r\n\r\nsolve this problem? Who can meet this danger? And\r\n\r\nby  what method? I am sure this Cultural Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  should  take  full  responsibility   for\r\n\r\nsolving   this   problem.  Unless   we   have   a\r\n\r\nunification  of all the cultural streams  of  our\r\n\r\nown people, we cannot escape the danger that will\r\n\r\narise - cultural conflict and racial conflict. So I\r\n\r\nsincerely wish this new department will carry  on\r\n\r\nwith   the  job  of  bringing  together   Chinese\r\n\r\nculture,  Indian culture, European  culture,  and\r\n\r\nMalay  culture,  help  them  to  understand   and\r\n\r\nappreciate one another to their mutual interests,\r\n\r\nand unify these four cultures into a true Malayan\r\n\r\nculture  with loyalty towards a Malayan  culture.\r\n\r\nThe   responsibility  of  the  Cultural  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  very great. The unification  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious cultures into a true Malayan culture  can\r\n\r\nbe  termed  as  a  political  necessity  of  this\r\n\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I just want to make one or\r\n\r\ntwo  further points. I can assure the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin that the phrase, \"Subject to Treasury\r\n\r\nsanction\" does not have an ominous ring at all. I\r\n\r\nthink  I  can  speak for the Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary when I say that it is only designed  as\r\n\r\na  check to see that money will not go down  the\r\n\r\ndrain and produce no results. We want every grant\r\n\r\nthat  is made to be scrutinised and it will  only\r\n\r\ngo   to  the  Treasury  for  sanction  after  the\r\n\r\nCultural  Advisory Council has fully  considered\r\n\r\nthe  matter  and  after I have satisfied  myself\r\n\r\nthat it is proper to give it. In this connection,\r\n\r\nan  application for assistance has actually  been\r\n\r\nreceived  from the Singapore Arts Council,  which\r\n\r\nis  planning a Festival of the Arts, in order  to\r\n\r\nenable  it  to carry out its plan. The Government\r\n\r\nhave  considered  that such a Festival  of  Arts,\r\n\r\ndepicting  the arts and cultures of  the  various\r\n\r\nraces  in Singapore, is one which should  receive\r\n\r\nsupport. It is thought that $20,000 might  be  an\r\n\r\nadequate  sum for the Singapore Arts Council  and\r\n\r\nit  might  well  come from this  block  grant  of\r\n\r\n$100,000.

That  is\r\n\r\nan entirely separate head from the $100,000 under\r\n\r\ndiscussion at the moment. However, I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  labour that point.

I   would   not   mind    a\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous item of $500 or $1,000, but a block\r\n\r\nvote  of $4,000 may be subject to misuse.  It  so\r\n\r\nhappens  that this item is \"Subject  to  Treasury\r\n\r\nsanction\".  The Minister has, however,  explained\r\n\r\nthat  every  detail will have to  be  scrutinised\r\n\r\nbefore  money is granted. Whatever it may  be,  a\r\n\r\nblock  vote  has  been given and  it  is  at  the\r\n\r\npleasure  of  the  Ministry to spend  at  random,\r\n\r\nthough  the  details may be scrutinised.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to have a breakdown of this block vote\r\n\r\nof  $4,000 because, as I have said, it covers too\r\n\r\nwide a scope.

Member,  nothing is  shown  in  the  column\r\n\r\n\"Approved  Estimates 1957\" because the department\r\n\r\nwas  not in existence in 1957. The sum of  $4,000\r\n\r\nshown  in the column \"Estimated 1958\" is a  block\r\n\r\nvote   to   cover  such  matters  as  stationery,\r\n\r\npurchase    of   publications,   transport    and\r\n\r\ntravelling,    and    maintenance    of    office\r\n\r\nequipment - in  fact, all the items which  normally\r\n\r\nappear under the head \"Administration Charges\" of\r\n\r\na  department. We have entered the block vote  in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates this year because it is impossible\r\n\r\nat the moment, in advance of the operation of the\r\n\r\ndepartment, to say what precisely it  will  spend\r\n\r\nunder   these  various  items  of  administration\r\n\r\nexpenses.  For  that reason, we  have  entered  a\r\n\r\nblock  vote  of  $4,000  which  should  give  the\r\n\r\ndepartment,  and the Treasury which controls  the\r\n\r\nvote, sufficient latitude to enable it to operate\r\n\r\nefficiently next year. In 1959, Sir, we  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse  have  had some experience of  expenditure\r\n\r\nand in the Estimates for that year we will detail\r\n\r\nthe  administration expenses, as is customary  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  other departments at  the  present\r\n\r\ntime.

I\r\n\r\nthink we must come down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  hard facts. There is about two or  three\r\n\r\nminutes left and I think I will have to put  over\r\n\r\nour grievances in the form of short questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we find that children living in one area\r\n\r\nare  unable to go to the school nearest to  their\r\n\r\nhomes.  In  many cases, they have to travel  long\r\n\r\ndistances. In many cases, too, you will find that\r\n\r\none brother may be in one school, another brother\r\n\r\nin a different school, and a sister may go to yet\r\n\r\nanother different school. It all boils down to  a\r\n\r\ngreat  loss  of time, much inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  concerned, congestion of traffic,  and  a\r\n\r\nwaste of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, there is a dearth of\r\n\r\ntechnical training for secondary schools. Many of\r\n\r\nour   youths  are  able  to  benefit  from   such\r\n\r\nteaching,  but  because  of  limited  space   and\r\n\r\nlimited  facilities for training,  many  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  to forgo technical training. Some fortunate\r\n\r\nyouths with rich parents may find that they  will\r\n\r\nbe able to get such training overseas, but by and\r\n\r\nlarge  it  leaves us with a lot of good  material\r\n\r\nthat   is   not  being  made  use  of.  In   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  would  the  Government  think  of\r\n\r\nincreasing the teaching of technical subjects  in\r\n\r\nall schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir. The University of Malaya\r\n\r\ncame into being after the war. Before the war, it\r\n\r\nwas  a college, a much smaller one. We find  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a limited take-in by the University  of\r\n\r\nstudents  who  want to join it.  There  are  many\r\n\r\ncapable people, hard-working people, people  with\r\n\r\ninitiative,  who would like to have a  university\r\n\r\neducation. The Singapore Polytechnic is no  doubt\r\n\r\ncoming   up.   But   would  Government   consider\r\n\r\nassisting the University of Malaya in order  that\r\n\r\nit  might give evening classes based on the lines\r\n\r\nof  the London University so that it could  grant\r\n\r\ndegrees in that way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we have vernacular education each\r\n\r\nheading  its  own  way.

As hon.  Members\r\n\r\nknow,  if  this time we go again and  we  do  not\r\n\r\nsucceed  in our mission.

Sir,  if  the  Minister  can  give  me   an\r\n\r\nassurance  that this post will be filled,  then  I\r\n\r\nwill allow that $30,000 vote to go through because\r\n\r\nit  serves no purpose to have a vote of $30,000 in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  and nothing coming out  of  it.  That\r\n\r\nmoney is shown as a sum carried over from the  old\r\n\r\nBudget  and I believe that is the reason why  this\r\n\r\nsum  again appears in this year's Estimates. I  am\r\n\r\nagainst this, Sir, but I am not trying to take the\r\n\r\nwhole vote away. The purpose of my amendment is to\r\n\r\nallow  a  token vote so that in case the  Minister\r\n\r\nfeels that the Assistant Minister is really fit to\r\n\r\nbe  promoted, then he may come back here  and  ask\r\n\r\nfor  a  vote  of  $29,990 to make up  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$30,000 as salary to the Assistant Minister.

There has also been an\r\n\r\nimprovement  as  regards the strike  situation.  I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  the number of strikes this  year  is\r\n\r\nvery  much less than that of last year. The strike\r\n\r\nsituation has improved quite a lot but one thing I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure,  Sir, is that the Government  was\r\n\r\nonly prepared to deal with labour strikes and I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  the Government ever  anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  there would be hunger strikes. So Government\r\n\r\ntherefore   was   not   prepared   for   such   an\r\n\r\neventuality.  I  quote, Sir, this  instance  of  a\r\n\r\nhunger strike.

I\r\n\r\nwas  there  at  about 10.00 p.m. and  I  remained\r\n\r\nthere  until  11.45 p.m. I understand  that  this\r\n\r\nhunger strike started on Monday, 16th December at\r\n\r\n8  p.m. and  when I arrived at the Association's\r\n\r\npremises at 10.00 p.m. last night I was told that\r\n\r\nabout  nine of the hunger-strikers had  collapsed\r\n\r\nand  had  been sent to hospital. From 10.00  p.m.\r\n\r\n(the  time of my arrival) until about 11.45  p.m.\r\n\r\nwhen  I left there were another three to four  of\r\n\r\nthe   hunger-strikers  who   collapsed   and   I\r\n\r\naccompanied them to hospital.

May I, Sir, with your permission  quote\r\n\r\nparagraph 9 (5) from that report which appears in\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. S 7 of 1957:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There may be a number of former employees of\r\n\r\nthe  Board still awaiting re-engagement.

We\r\n\r\nfeel  that  these men should not be too  severely\r\n\r\ntreated  for  following  an  industrial  practice\r\n\r\nrecognised  where trade unionism is in operation.\r\n\r\nThe  go  slow was a general movement and the  men\r\n\r\nfollowed  the instructions of their  Union.  They\r\n\r\nhave  already  suffered  a  loss  of  wages   and\r\n\r\novertime benefits. However, the Port is again  in\r\n\r\nfull operation and for the promotion of improved\r\n\r\nindustrial relations, we are of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nit  is  desirable  that any such  men  should  be\r\n\r\nspeedily  re-employed  as  the  Board  will  find\r\n\r\npossible. We do not think that it would  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult - at least\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot as difficult as it was submitted to us during\r\n\r\nthe  proceedings - to  convince  serangs  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  take back their former gang members,  and\r\n\r\nto re-engage the remaining M.E. personnel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Court of Inquiry recommended that they\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken back as \"speedily\" as possible,\r\n\r\nas  quoted in its report. This report,  Sir,  was\r\n\r\ntabled  before  this Assembly on  6th  September,\r\n\r\n1957.  Three  and a half months have  passed  and\r\n\r\nGovernment has not stepped in to find whether the\r\n\r\nBoard has actually reinstated these employees  or\r\n\r\nnot.  If  the Government had done so, I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure that these employees would not have gone  on\r\n\r\na  hunger  strike. Since the Government  did  not\r\n\r\ntake  the  trouble to do so, and since the  Board\r\n\r\nrefused  to reinstate them as was recommended  in\r\n\r\nthe  report,  there was no other alternative  for\r\n\r\nthese men but to go on a hunger strike. There  is\r\n\r\nno more question of a strike because they are not\r\n\r\nemployed now. So to show their protest, they  had\r\n\r\nto  go  on  a hunger strike. This is one  of  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  weapons of trade unionists.  So  they\r\n\r\nhave  resorted to the legitimate weapon of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  and  they are now on a  hunger  strike.\r\n\r\nSir,  if  they  have no work now, what  else  can\r\n\r\nthese  men  do? Can they support their  families?\r\n\r\nTheir  families have to go hungry  because  there\r\n\r\nare  no wages and there is nothing at all  to  be\r\n\r\nbrought  home to feed their families. The  report\r\n\r\nsays  that  they  have  already  lost  wages  and\r\n\r\novertime  benefits. Sir, is the Government  fully\r\n\r\naware  of  all  this? Why has the Government  not\r\n\r\nstepped in again? Is the Government going to wait\r\n\r\nuntil some death occurs before it will step in? I\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, that there was also a strike  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Harbour Board in 1955 and at  that\r\n\r\ntime the then Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall)\r\n\r\nput  heavy pressure on the Harbour Board and  all\r\n\r\nthe strikers were reinstated. This, I understand,\r\n\r\nis  quite  reliable and at that time I think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar,  the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., was also interested and assisted in  some\r\n\r\nway  or  other to get them reinstated. I  believe\r\n\r\nthat the present Chief Minister could also do the\r\n\r\nsame thing and if he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  to do so he would be fully justified because\r\n\r\nhe  is  only accepting the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of Inquiry. He would be fully justified  to\r\n\r\nput  heavy  pressure on the Harbour Board  to  see\r\n\r\nthat all these men are reinstated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, quite a number of the strikers\r\n\r\nhave  collapsed and I do not know whether  any  of\r\n\r\nthem  will die through hunger. If any one dies,  I\r\n\r\nwill put the responsibility on the Government  and\r\n\r\non the Singapore Harbour Board. I suggest that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should step in rightaway to  see  that\r\n\r\nthey  are reinstated and the hunger strike  called\r\n\r\noff. Both employers and employees were prepared to\r\n\r\nsubmit their case to a Court of Inquiry and  since\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  have  been  published,  both\r\n\r\nparties should honour those recommendations rather\r\n\r\nthan have the position where one party is prepared\r\n\r\nto  honour them and another party is not  prepared\r\n\r\nto do so. In order that lives may be saved, may  I\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  ask the Government to take  immediate\r\n\r\naction  and step in to intervene in this  case  so\r\n\r\nthat we will have an end to the hunger strike  and\r\n\r\nthe men reinstated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now\r\n\r\non   Head  49 - Ministry  for  Labour  and  Welfare.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  on the subject of welfare activities,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to congratulate the Government on  the\r\n\r\nimprovements we have witnessed since last year but\r\n\r\nthere  are  still many suggestions and  criticisms\r\n\r\nput  forward  by hon. Members of this House  which\r\n\r\nhave  not been carried out or met. One of them  is\r\n\r\nthe   decentralisation  of   social   centres   in\r\n\r\nconnection with public relief distribution. Sir, I\r\n\r\nmentioned last year the case of a poor man  living\r\n\r\nin the island of Pulau Tekong who asked for public\r\n\r\nassistance. The sum was about $5 or $10 and he was\r\n\r\nasked  to  travel a distance of over ten miles  to\r\n\r\nthe  Social  Welfare Department  to  receive  this\r\n\r\nallowance.  Sir, I think that is quite  ridiculous\r\n\r\nbecause the whole of the allowance would be  spent\r\n\r\non  transport. Therefore I wish the Government  to\r\n\r\ntake note of this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, on the labour situation, all of\r\n\r\nus  have  been very pleased to witness a stability\r\n\r\nin  the labour affairs of this colony with no more\r\n\r\nlabour  unrest and riots but I am still  not  very\r\n\r\nhappy  about  the  so-called stability  of  labour\r\n\r\nrelations  between  employer  and  employee.   The\r\n\r\nposition  is still not very firm. One thing  which\r\n\r\nwe  witness is that many trade unions seem to rely\r\n\r\nupon  the  advice of politicians or men  from  the\r\n\r\nlegal   profession   in  connection   with   their\r\n\r\nactivities. Sir, I think that is a great  mistake.\r\n\r\nI think that trade unions should invite economists\r\n\r\nto  advise  them in their activities  rather  than\r\n\r\npoliticians. May I put forward to the Government a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  whether they would consider sponsoring\r\n\r\na  training  class  for union leaders?  There  are\r\n\r\neconomists  now  available in  the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  in  the Nanyang University  who  know\r\n\r\nexactly the economic position in Singapore. It  is\r\n\r\ntime  that  all  workers and their  union  leaders\r\n\r\nshould   realise  that  a  one-sided  demand   for\r\n\r\nincreased   wages  would  not  be  beneficial   if\r\n\r\nindustrial output is not increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to endorse the statement made by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown about the hunger strike\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore Harbour Board. Sir, it happened\r\n\r\nthat I was there at about 9.00 p.m. last night and\r\n\r\nI  spent  until  1  o'clock this  morning  in  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital.  The latest report  I  received\r\n\r\nfrom  a clerk in the hospital (Mr Chew) was  that\r\n\r\nthe   eleven  workers  sent  by  the   union   for\r\n\r\nobservation  and  treatment  were  discharged   as\r\n\r\noutdoor  patients. Sir, I learned from  the  Union\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Mr Jamit Singh, who also  accompanied\r\n\r\nme  to the hospital to look into the plight of the\r\n\r\nworkers  who collapsed, that the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  is totally ignoring the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Inquiry which was appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I wonder how it is possible  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can allow a semi-government  body  like\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Harbour  Board  to  ignore   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   of   the   Court   of   Inquiry.\r\n\r\nRepercussions will result, Sir. In future  if  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a Court of Inquiry is suggested, the\r\n\r\nunion will say, \"Six months after the recommendations  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Court of Inquiry  into  the  trade\r\n\r\ndispute  at the Singapore Harbour Board have  been\r\n\r\npublished,  yet  they have not been  implemented.\"\r\n\r\nSir, the attitude of this semi-government body  is\r\n\r\nmost  regrettable and the Government's neglect  of\r\n\r\nduty is also most regrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to support the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nand  would  ask  the Government to take  immediate\r\n\r\nsteps to call off the hunger strike. I would  like\r\n\r\nan  official  statement from  Government  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse on this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall\r\n\r\nreply  to  the various points raised  by  the  two\r\n\r\nprevious speakers but the most important one  they\r\n\r\nraised was in regard to the hunger strike - as  they\r\n\r\ncall  it - that  is  taking place in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board Staff Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my sympathies go out to these hunger-strikers. My sympathies as a trade unionist too go\r\n\r\nout  to these people and as a trade unionist I  am\r\n\r\nindeed  sorry  that they should have been  foolish\r\n\r\nenough to follow evil advice from people who claim\r\n\r\nto be trade union leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Condemn them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am here speaking, Sir, as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Labour  and  Welfare  and,  as\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare, I have personally\r\n\r\ninterested   myself  in  trying  to  bring   about\r\n\r\nindustrial peace, in the settlement of strikes and\r\n\r\nin  the prevention of strikes and every time being\r\n\r\na conciliator, I have avoided taking sides. Today,\r\n\r\nI  am  indeed  in  a very unhappy position  to  be\r\n\r\nforced  in  this  Assembly to say something  which\r\n\r\nwill be against, shall I say, my line of action in\r\n\r\nthat  I  should not try to defend one side against\r\n\r\nthe  other  side or to decry the misdeeds  of  one\r\n\r\nside  so that the other side can take courage  and\r\n\r\ngo ahead and do some further damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Court of Inquiry was set up. A report was\r\n\r\nsubmitted, and in regard to this particular  group\r\n\r\nof  workers, the Member for Queenstown has read to\r\n\r\nus the relevant paragraph. What has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommended, Sir, by the Court of Inquiry is this,\r\n\r\nand these are the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are of the opinion that it is desirable that\r\n\r\nany such men should be speedily reemployed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what my Ministry knows and what I\r\n\r\npersonally  know,  the  Singapore  Harbour   Board\r\n\r\nattempted  to  implement this recommendation.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board wrote  to  all  employees\r\n\r\nconcerned  asking  them to report  to  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOffice;  the  Singapore Harbour Board  would  then\r\n\r\nconsider reemploying them. Some went - I do not know\r\n\r\nhow  many  because  I  do  not  have  the  figures\r\n\r\navailable  to  me  here - and  when  they  went,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they were asked by the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  labour officer certain questions. The trade\r\n\r\nunionists,  I understand, took umbrage  that  such\r\n\r\nquestions  should have been asked.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board, when questioned by me, told me that\r\n\r\nsurely they had a right to ask an employee or even\r\n\r\nan  ex-employee who had been going on a \"go  slow\"\r\n\r\nfor so long and causing so much economic damage to\r\n\r\nthe   country  whether  he  would  work  and  work\r\n\r\nproperly for the Singapore Harbour Board. It would\r\n\r\nappear  that the workers resented that; that  they\r\n\r\nshould not be told that they should work and  work\r\n\r\nproperly  for their wages. They took umbrage.  The\r\n\r\nUnion   or,  I  should  rather  say,  the  General\r\n\r\nSecretary  of the Union advised these workers  not\r\n\r\nto report - \"not to report\" - and surely can one blame\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Harbour Board for not considering re-employing  people who did not make  an  appearance\r\n\r\nand declare that they wanted re-employment? Can we\r\n\r\nblame  the  Singapore Harbour Board? I  am  indeed\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy  to  have to take sides  as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier.  The workers did not report.  They  said,\r\n\r\n\"We must go in as a body.\" Did they say that? I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  they  said that. It  was  the  General\r\n\r\nSecretary of the union saying that, in order  that\r\n\r\nhe was not going to suffer any loss in prestige or\r\n\r\nthe respect of the workers who were led by him for\r\n\r\nwhatever damage he had done. They stuck firm and I\r\n\r\ngot  in touch with the Board again and again.  The\r\n\r\nanswer  given to me was, \"If they do not  make  an\r\n\r\nappearance and if they do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeclare  that  they desire to be re-employed,  how\r\n\r\ncan  we re-employ them?\" So I said, \"All right,  I\r\n\r\nwill  advise  the workers to go back and  register\r\n\r\nand  then  I  will ask you to give  immediate  and\r\n\r\nsympathetic  consideration to take them  back.\"  I\r\n\r\nadvised  the union accordingly but this particular\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary - this man who has led them  for\r\n\r\nhis  own good, I am sorry to say - tried to cash  in\r\n\r\non the situation and led all the workers as a mass\r\n\r\ninto the Singapore Harbour Board and said, \"We now\r\n\r\ndemand  re-employment.\" I told them, \"That is  not\r\n\r\nthe  way  to  go about it. There is no longer  any\r\n\r\nfight.  You  want re-employment, go  and  register\r\n\r\nquietly. Do not seek publicity. There is no reason\r\n\r\nwhy you must feel that this man who has led you or\r\n\r\nmisled  you should have his own position protected\r\n\r\nand should be given the opportunity to be able  to\r\n\r\ntell  other workers and thereby mislead them,  'It\r\n\r\nwas  I  who  brought them back  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board.' \" Surely, as an employer and  even\r\n\r\nas  a  worker,  no organisation  can  give  in  to\r\n\r\nintimidation  and  it  should  not  give   in   to\r\n\r\nintimidation.  Even  if  the  employers  were   to\r\n\r\nintimidate  any  trade  union  organisation,  that\r\n\r\norganisation must resist to the bitter end in  the\r\n\r\nsame  way  as the Singapore Harbour Board resisted\r\n\r\nby  saying, \"If you want to get publicity and play\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  a stunt with us, sorry,  boys,  we\r\n\r\ncannot register you.\" Then they got in touch  with\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. The T.U.C. got in touch with me. Later\r\n\r\nthey  came  to see me and I told them that  things\r\n\r\ncould have been solved and would be solved if they\r\n\r\nwould just forget all about their prestige and all\r\n\r\nabout  the  desire, particularly  of  the  General\r\n\r\nSecretary, to pull himself out of the fire.  Since\r\n\r\nthey got in touch with the T.U.C. and then myself,\r\n\r\nI  went to the extent of saying, \"I will undertake\r\n\r\nto  have  it done.\" Many reports appeared  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  papers  condemning my inaction.  There  was\r\n\r\neven  a  march  to my office when I was  away  and\r\n\r\nthere  was this Jamit Singh carrying a baby trying\r\n\r\nto  get  publicity  and trying to  intimidate  the\r\n\r\nMinister himself into trying to help him out of  a\r\n\r\ndifficulty  which he himself had  created.  I  too\r\n\r\nwill  not  tolerate intimidation and  I  too  will\r\n\r\nnever give in to intimidation. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT.U.C., the  Chairman of the  Harbour  Board  and\r\n\r\nmyself  had  a  discussion and  we  came  to  some\r\n\r\narrangement.  I felt that the sooner this  General\r\n\r\nSecretary  was  kept totally away from  all  these\r\n\r\nthings the easier would it be for all things to be\r\n\r\nsolved but no, in spite of the discussion and  the\r\n\r\nhope  of  a  solution,  the next  morning  it  was\r\n\r\nreported in the same paper that they had  taken  a\r\n\r\nvote to go on a hunger strike. Is that not another\r\n\r\nmethod  of  intimidation?  We  have  assured  this\r\n\r\nunion,  \"Please, I feel just as much as  you  feel\r\n\r\nfor  these  workers. What we want is to see  these\r\n\r\nworkers  get  back  to work.\"  You  can  call  the\r\n\r\nMinister  a  rotten man; I will take it.  You  can\r\n\r\ncall  me  any names; I will take it but I find  it\r\n\r\nvery difficult to have to tell the press all these\r\n\r\nthings  that  have  been done by  this  so-called\r\n\r\nleader  of  the workers. I did not wish to  expose\r\n\r\nhim  because  I  felt  in exposing  him  it  would\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the hand of the Harbour Board  and  it\r\n\r\nwould  make  things more difficult. We know  that,\r\n\r\nalthough  it has not been officially said,  it  is\r\n\r\nfelt  that the clash between this and that is just\r\n\r\na  clash of personalities. That is unfortunate and\r\n\r\nI do not like it. But then as a Minister, it is my\r\n\r\nduty   to   try  and  make  personalities   forget\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  sink  their  differences  in  the\r\n\r\nbigger  things. Every time we tried  to  pull  off\r\n\r\nsomething, something else was being done  by  this\r\n\r\npaper  to  damage what we had been doing  and,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  all that we have done, we now have  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown ask, \"What has  Government\r\n\r\ndone? Is Government going to allow these people to\r\n\r\ndie  from hunger?\" Government, particularly myself\r\n\r\nas  the  Minister for Labour, wants to  do  a  job\r\n\r\nquietly without hurting anyone because it does not\r\n\r\npay to hurt workers or employers in the scheme  of\r\n\r\nthings.   We  must  try  to  bring  about   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding and in trying to bring about  better\r\n\r\nindustrial relations one must try not to run  down\r\n\r\none  organisation or the other. That should  never\r\n\r\nhappen,   and  now  it  is  suggested   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should call off the hunger  strike.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  understand that and I say this again,  \"If\r\n\r\nthis  so-called  trade union  leader  and  if  the\r\n\r\nresponsible leaders in the Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nStaff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation  will  just  keep  away  from  seeking\r\n\r\npublicity and will just forget everything in order\r\n\r\nthat   these   people  can  be  re-employed,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will see that they are re-employed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I  read the morning press with some interest\r\n\r\nwhen  I  discovered that three leading politicians\r\n\r\nhad  suddenly  taken  an interest  in  the  hunger\r\n\r\nstrike at the Singapore Harbour Board and they all\r\n\r\nhappened by some strange coincidence to follow one\r\n\r\nanother into the union's premises: The Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  (Mr  Lee Choon Eng,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi  (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) and the former Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  (Mr  D.

That was some five years  back - and  I\r\n\r\nhave been in close association with it ever since.\r\n\r\nSir, in 1954, I introduced Mr Jamit Singh as  the\r\n\r\npermanent   General  Secretary  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board's Staff Association. He was a member\r\n\r\nof  the  University  of Malaya Socialist  Club.  I\r\n\r\nintroduced him and was responsible for  him  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of that. I believe at that time  that  his\r\n\r\nenergy and enthusiasm would be to the advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. Sir, I have to weigh my  words  very\r\n\r\ncarefully     because    there    are    long-term\r\n\r\nrepercussions on whatever we say and do  in  these\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I must ask the Member for Changi\r\n\r\nto  forbear from making unseemly interruptions. We\r\n\r\nare  in Committee and the Member will perhaps have\r\n\r\na chance of replying, if he chooses to, later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The next part of the story\r\n\r\nstarts with the strike of the clerical and monthly-rated  sections of the Singapore Harbour Board  in\r\n\r\n1955.  The strike went on for 60 odd days and  was\r\n\r\nfinally concluded to the advantage of the workers.\r\n\r\nThen  in  late 1955, it was decided to expand  the\r\n\r\nmembership  of that union and take in  the  daily-rated  workers. There were 2,000 odd monthly-rated\r\n\r\nworkers  and there were 7,000 to 8,000 daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers. Amendments were subsequently made to  the\r\n\r\nconstitution and the workers were to be registered\r\n\r\nas  members  of the Singapore Harbour Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation. Mr Jamit Singh felt however that  it\r\n\r\nmight be better to have some other name and formed\r\n\r\na   union  called  the  Singapore  Harbour   Board\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union. He started registering workers for\r\n\r\nthat  union. This is the crux of the matter: there\r\n\r\nis  a fight in the Singapore Harbour Board. In the\r\n\r\ncourse of a fight, one makes use of every possible\r\n\r\nsource  of  support.  All expendable  material  is\r\n\r\nused,  be it David Saul Marshall, whom the General\r\n\r\nSecretary of the union denounced three nights  ago\r\n\r\non a P.A.P. platform in Jalan Besar. If David Saul\r\n\r\nMarshall  thinks he wants to cash in  on  it,  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary quite rightly says, \"Good,  you\r\n\r\nwant to play me for a sucker, I will play you  for\r\n\r\na  sucker.\" This is a tough game and those who are\r\n\r\nnot  tough, had better not try to play this  game.\r\n\r\nThere  was a real fight, and the fight was between\r\n\r\nMr  Chrimes, as Chairman of the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,  and Mr Jamit Singh. Mr Chrimes believed - and I am sure he still does to this day - and I have\r\n\r\nheard  it  said in an aside during  the  Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  which  sat for days on  end,  \"Mr  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh  is  a  saboteur  determined  to  wreck  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour  Board,  to  bring  it   to   a\r\n\r\nstandstill and to ruin the economy of the country,\r\n\r\nand  is  a person who should be put behind  bars.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  Mr Chrimes' honest to God opinion.  Mr\r\n\r\nJamit  Singh,  on the other hand, thinks  of  Mr\r\n\r\nChrimes  as  a  so and so who should  be  properly\r\n\r\ndealt  with before he is allowed to go  away  with\r\n\r\nhis pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if you want to break a man, you try to\r\n\r\ntake his support away from him. If you can get the\r\n\r\nmass  to  yield  to you, then you break  him.  The\r\n\r\nfirst thing Mr Chrimes did was to refuse to allow\r\n\r\nthe  premises in Cantonment Road to be used by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Workers' Union. Of course,\r\n\r\nthere were a lot of technicalities. It was said in\r\n\r\nthe  Court  of Inquiry that the General  Secretary\r\n\r\nnever, in fact, made a formal application, and  so\r\n\r\non.  Thousands of formal applications  could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  and the answer would have  been  'No'.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a  fight already on in  1956.  So  the\r\n\r\nmerger which was intended of the Staff Association\r\n\r\ninto the Workers' Union was stalled because merger\r\n\r\nmeant losing the union premises and in any massive\r\n\r\norganisation,  premises are  important.  You  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  place where the workers can come together\r\n\r\nand  when  workers  come together  then  there  is\r\n\r\neffervescency. Therefore, things stalemated for  a\r\n\r\nfew  months. Both sides were sparring, looking for\r\n\r\na soft spot where one could knock the other fellow\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this year, the Tanjong Pagar by-elections\r\n\r\nstarted. I think that Members will remember  that,\r\n\r\nat  that  same  time, there was a go-slow  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Union of Railway Workers. Mr Jamit Singh\r\n\r\ndecided  that  there should be a  boycott  of  all\r\n\r\ngoods  which were intended for Port Swettenham  in\r\n\r\nsympathy   with  them - a  legitimate  trade   union\r\n\r\npractice.  Now,  Sir, I was  the  adviser  to  the\r\n\r\nAssociation;  I  am  still  the  adviser  to   the\r\n\r\nAssociation. I knew of that decision only after  I\r\n\r\nread  it in the papers. However, that was  a  fair\r\n\r\nand  legitimate trade union practice and then  the\r\n\r\nfight  started. The Board retaliated  immediately,\r\n\r\nlooking for an opportunity to bring the matter  to\r\n\r\na  head  and  detain Mr Jamit Singh's  pass.  The\r\n\r\nfight was on. Mr Jamit Singh squatted for one day\r\n\r\nin  a police station as a gesture of protest,  not\r\n\r\ncomparable  to  what Mahatma  Gandhi  did,  but  a\r\n\r\nlaudable  local effort. Next day, a mass, meeting\r\n\r\nwas  called;  I  was  present. The  situation  was\r\n\r\nweighed and a go slow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  called,  that  is, a slow  up  of  the  whole\r\n\r\noperation  as  a  weapon of  pressure.  The  Board\r\n\r\nretaliated by suspending more workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just like when Hitler wanted to attack\r\n\r\nPoland.  He  found all kinds of things  that  went\r\n\r\nwrong between Poland and Germany. Of course,  when\r\n\r\nyou  find  lots  of things going wrong  you  apply\r\n\r\npressure  and  say,  \"That  is  wrong.\"   and   if\r\n\r\nsomething else happens you say. \"Oh that is  wrong\r\n\r\ntoo.\" and you do this and the other. Eventually  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of  war must be made.  The  suspended\r\n\r\nworkers led to greater pressure on the union side,\r\n\r\ngreater  pressure on the union side  led  to  more\r\n\r\nsuspensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that situation, the House will remember, I\r\n\r\ntabled  a motion that the matter should  go  to  a\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Inquiry and the whole matter be  sorted\r\n\r\nout.  Before  my motion came up, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour yielded and called a Court of Inquiry.  You\r\n\r\nwill,  I  think, remember that he said to me  then\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was first considering it, \"We must  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  both sides will abide by it before  we\r\n\r\nset  up  a  Court  of  Inquiry  otherwise  it   is\r\n\r\nuseless.\"  And by the time he called  a  Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry,  both sides had agreed to  abide  by  its\r\n\r\nfindings  and we went before the Court of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nand put the facts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report was put before the House and the real\r\n\r\nissue  was,  as  far as the Court  was  concerned,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  could prove the fight for recognition\r\n\r\nof   either  the  Workers'  Union  or  the   Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation as representing all the workers. Now,\r\n\r\nfor  reasons of the legal formalities, and so  on,\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  the Workers' Union membership  was\r\n\r\nbrought   over   into   the   Staff   Association.\r\n\r\nBackdating and other complications do not  concern\r\n\r\nthe  main point we are discussing. Sir, there  was\r\n\r\nno  doubt that we had the majority of the  workers\r\n\r\nin the Staff Association. And if a ballot is held,\r\n\r\nas the Court report recommended, it will be proved\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  got the majority of  the  workers.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the Court of Inquiry,  Mr\r\n\r\nChrimes had to show his hand. Every time the Court\r\n\r\nmade a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinding,  he  blocked and stalled it  because  his\r\n\r\npurpose was not to settle the dispute. His purpose\r\n\r\nwas  to  show the workers: Follow Mr Jamit Singh,\r\n\r\nyou  are  in  for difficulties and  you  will  get\r\n\r\nnowhere;  so  discard  him. That  is  Mr  Chrimes\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not always seen eye to eye with the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary of the Singapore Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association, particularly on the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  certain  administrative  arrangements  were\r\n\r\ndone,  but  I say this: Mr Chrimes is  about  the\r\n\r\nmost vicious employer-type that one can ever meet.\r\n\r\nHe told me once, \"I like a man who has got fire in\r\n\r\nhis  belly.\" and Mr Chrimes obviously  is  a  man\r\n\r\nwith  fire  in  his  belly because  he  must  like\r\n\r\nhimself.   He   is   determined,   whatever    the\r\n\r\nconsequences, to break Mr Jamit Singh even if  it\r\n\r\nmeans breaking the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not interested in Mr Chrimes breaking\r\n\r\nMr  Jamit Singh. But I am very interested to  see\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Chrimes does not break the union because\r\n\r\nyears  of work has gone into building it up.  This\r\n\r\nis  another  aspect which the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\ndid  not bring up. We are fighting to build up one\r\n\r\nunion in the waterfront and so is the T.U.C.  They\r\n\r\nhad   the   Waterfront  Workers'   Federation   or\r\n\r\nConfederation.  There  are about  seven  or  eight\r\n\r\nlittle   piddling  unions  inside  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board, like the Stevedore something or the\r\n\r\nother,  and others. We proved it in the  Court  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  that they were all hollow and  that  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  have  numbers.  Every  one  of  them  is\r\n\r\nrecognised by the Board as representing one sector\r\n\r\nor  the  other of the daily-rated workers  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board. So the real fight is  the\r\n\r\nfight  between the Singapore Harbour  Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation  on  the  one side  claiming  that  it\r\n\r\nrepresents all the workers and Mr Chrimes of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board on the other side  saying,\r\n\r\n\"No,  you don't. I will break you. If you say that\r\n\r\nyou  are  representatives of my  workers,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  you are in for a lot of trouble.\" With  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. also saying, \"That would be completely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwiped off if recognition were given to us\". Now, I\r\n\r\nhave to oppose this and this is the basic issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister is right; he can\r\n\r\nsolve   this   matter.  In  fact,  he   gave   the\r\n\r\nundertaking  in  the  presence  of  the   General\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  the  union and of  myself  when  he\r\n\r\ndictated  a  statement saying that he  would  take\r\n\r\nfull  responsibility to see that they were backed,\r\n\r\nbut that Mr Jamit Singh was not to interfere. How\r\n\r\ncould you expect Mr Jamit Singh not to interfere?\r\n\r\nThis  is a fight for survival. If he does not cash\r\n\r\nin,  the workers will honestly believe that he  is\r\n\r\nuseless.  So he has got to be in the battle.  This\r\n\r\nis  the technique of fighting for mass support. It\r\n\r\ngoes  on all over the world and those who  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  this  should  go  and  read  about  it\r\n\r\nbecause  these  things  have  happened  in   other\r\n\r\nplaces. Now, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister  was\r\n\r\nprepared to solve this on his terms and his  terms\r\n\r\nwere:  No credit to you, credit to the T.U.C.:  no\r\n\r\ncredit to Mr Jamit Singh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, no.

They can go on a hunger\r\n\r\nstrike.  They can bear out all the sores and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Ah,  look  at my guts, they are coming out,\"  The\r\n\r\nreal fight is Mr Chrimes out to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreak  Mr Jamit Singh and the union if necessary,\r\n\r\nthe  union  determined to preserve its membership,\r\n\r\nthe  General Secretary determined to maintain  his\r\n\r\nleadership  in the union, and the T.U.C. standing\r\n\r\nby asking, \"Where do I come in?\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I think the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\ndeserves  or  the T.U.C. deserves full  credit  to\r\n\r\ntake the men back. We do not want credit for this.\r\n\r\nTake  them  back.  But there is still  the  bigger\r\n\r\nissue to be settled and the bigger issue is,  that\r\n\r\nthis  union  represents all the workers.  At  some\r\n\r\ntime  or other, the Hon. the Chief Minister  knows\r\n\r\nthat  there  is going to be a big debate  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter  and that there will be a final settlement.\r\n\r\nEither the ballot will have to be taken, or  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  crisis,  or  there  is  a  compromise\r\n\r\nsolution.  I am suggesting a compromise  solution.\r\n\r\nMy  compromise solution is well known to the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister and to his T.U.C. colleagues,\r\n\r\nthat  is, we get all these piddling little  unions\r\n\r\nto come together with the big union, the Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  Staff  Association,  and  form   a\r\n\r\nfederation. The federation as such will  represent\r\n\r\nall  the  workers in the Singapore Harbour  Board,\r\n\r\nbut  membership of the individual  worker  to  any\r\n\r\ncomponent part of that federation should  be  free\r\n\r\nand  voluntary. In other words, there will be free\r\n\r\nand  open competition between the component  parts\r\n\r\nof that federation to hold the loyalty of the men.\r\n\r\nWorkers  all over the world are not loyal to  just\r\n\r\n\"isms\"  and  principles.

Sir,  this amount appears to be a very,  very\r\n\r\nsmall  amount. But what I say is that there  was  no\r\n\r\nsuch vote provided for in last year's Estimates. Now\r\n\r\ngoing through the footnote, it reads: \"Required  for\r\n\r\ndespatches  and  collections of mails  to  and  from\r\n\r\nother  Government departments.\" Sir, may  I  enquire\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government  how was  mail  delivered  and\r\n\r\ncollected during all the months from January up till\r\n\r\nnow?  Now, if for the whole of this year,  mail  has\r\n\r\nbeen  delivered  and  collected satisfactorily,  why\r\n\r\nthen  is  it  necessary that  a  vote  for  $650  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  purchase  a motor-cycle?  Can  we  not\r\n\r\nmaintain  and  continue  the  present  procedure  of\r\n\r\ndelivering  and collecting mails?

Whilst in  1956,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  maintained  four  motor  vehicles,   the\r\n\r\nnumber  has been reduced to only three in  1957.  Of\r\n\r\nthe  three vehicles, one of them, an Austin  station\r\n\r\nwagon, which has already performed more than 140,000\r\n\r\nmiles has been certified by the Mechanical Engineer,\r\n\r\nP.W.D. as  beyond economic repair. It is  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary to replace one vehicle and the replacement\r\n\r\nis  by  a  lightweight  motor-cycle  which  is  more\r\n\r\neconomical to use. It is also easier for a messenger\r\n\r\nto  ride  on a motor-cycle to deliver mails  thereby\r\n\r\nfreeing the two station wagons for the transport  of\r\n\r\nimmigration officers in their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nexplanation  from  the Minister,  may  I  have  your\r\n\r\npermission to withdraw my amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $1,101,270 for Head 50 stand part\r\n\r\nof the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned in this House a day  or  so  ago\r\n\r\nthat the question of passports for Singapore has not\r\n\r\nyet  been  finalised, and there is also the question\r\n\r\nof  re-entry permits for Singapore citizens which  I\r\n\r\nthink is in the same state.

I\r\n\r\nthink,  if it is a question of shortage of  staff,\r\n\r\nGovernment must then provide the additional  staff\r\n\r\nso   that   the  public  should  not   be   unduly\r\n\r\ninconvenienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the delay in considering\r\n\r\napplications for entry permits, particularly  from\r\n\r\nimmigrants  from  China, is not mainly  due  to  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of staff. It is due, in most  cases,  to\r\n\r\nthe   inability   of   the  sponsor   to   produce\r\n\r\nsatisfactory evidence.

On  the  question  of   labour\r\n\r\nstability, I did put forward a suggestion  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare that we should now\r\n\r\nsponsor   a  training  course  for  union  leaders\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  workers themselves can select  their\r\n\r\nown  leaders instead of politicians. As  we  know,\r\n\r\nsome  politicians fully utilise the union movement\r\n\r\nand  they can even put one of their own men  as  a\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary. In this instance, I wonder  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar can  answer  these\r\n\r\nquestions.  He  said  that  Mr  Jamit  Singh  was\r\n\r\nselected  as  the General Secretary  to  lead  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Workers' Union because  he\r\n\r\nwas a very enthusiastic socialist. Did he become a\r\n\r\nmember  of the P.A.P.? Is it in the best  interest\r\n\r\nof  the  workers to establish a new union  knowing\r\n\r\nvery  well  that there is already  a  trade  union\r\n\r\nexisting? Did the legal adviser to the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board Workers' Union advise them  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  join  the T.U.C.? If we allow politicians  to\r\n\r\nappoint  their Party stalwarts into a  union  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  want  to grab power and make political  capital\r\n\r\nout  of  labour, I think the stability of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement can never be achieved.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nstrongly  suggest to the Government to  consider  the\r\n\r\nsponsoring  of  training  courses  for  trade   union\r\n\r\nleaders.  There are economists and lecturers  in  our\r\n\r\nUniversities  who can give them the right  and  sound\r\n\r\nadvice instead of being misled by politicians who are\r\n\r\nopportunists  and  so-called  trade  union   leaders,\r\n\r\nseeking only political interest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Changi regarding the setting up of  a\r\n\r\ntraining  course for union leaders, I  would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  it  should  be more a course  for  the  members\r\n\r\nrather than the leaders themselves. As far as I know,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  course for leaders of trade unions  who\r\n\r\nundergo training in the management and administration\r\n\r\nof trade union but I would suggest and emphasise more\r\n\r\nstrongly that a course or lectures should be given to\r\n\r\nthe members of trade unions and not to the leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proved now, Sir, that most leaders are\r\n\r\nnothing  else but politicians who really make capital\r\n\r\nout  of  trade  unions and who give wrong  advice  to\r\n\r\ntrade unions, just as in the case that was debated  a\r\n\r\nfew  minutes  ago.  Now, it is only  the  members  of\r\n\r\npolitical parties who penetrate into and make capital\r\n\r\nout  of  trade unions and not Independents who belong\r\n\r\nto  no  party  at all. The Member for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"It is the fight for survival,\" - the  fight  of\r\n\r\nsurvival of his own political Party. Independents are\r\n\r\nnot  interested  at all. The Independents  are  only\r\n\r\ninterested  in the humanitarian side of trade  unions\r\n\r\nand not in the survival of any political party. So  I\r\n\r\nwould strongly advocate that Government start a  sort\r\n\r\nof  a course or get lecturers to advise or lecture to\r\n\r\ntrade  unions so that they will not accept the advice\r\n\r\nof politicians who come into trade unions as supposed\r\n\r\ntrade union\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders.

I have been  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist myself as founder of the Army Civil  Service\r\n\r\nUnion - the biggest union in Singapore today - and I know\r\n\r\nwhat   trade   unionism  is.  On  the   question   of\r\n\r\npoliticians  making capital out of  trade  unions,  I\r\n\r\nthink it reflects on members of political parties and\r\n\r\nnot on Independent politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I just want to make one\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the  general remarks of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nabout trade unions. To be a good organiser of a trade\r\n\r\nunion requires knowledge of organisation, ability and\r\n\r\nexperience and this, I think, is in short  supply  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Not  only  are the  technical  skills  or\r\n\r\ntechnological aids short, but also absent is the long\r\n\r\ntradition of how to do things, how to negotiate,  how\r\n\r\nto  strike a bargain, how to understand the  workings\r\n\r\nof  an industry, and so on. The result is that unions\r\n\r\nvery often do not get the finest quality of people as\r\n\r\norganisers, because such people have already gone for\r\n\r\nmore  remunerative  or  more  attractive  occupations\r\n\r\nsomewhere  else. They do sometimes get a man  with  a\r\n\r\nchip  on  his  shoulder, a man  with  an  inferiority\r\n\r\ncomplex - suffering  from a complex of  aggressive  and\r\n\r\ndefensive mechanisms which do not operate in a  fully\r\n\r\nsane way. He may be inspiring on some occasions,  but\r\n\r\non  others he may be rather a menace. Such a man  may\r\n\r\nget  things in a muddle. I think the idea to  improve\r\n\r\nconditions by trade union courses and so on  is  very\r\n\r\ndesirable,  but the basic requirement  is  a  general\r\n\r\nwidening of organisational experience which can  only\r\n\r\ncome by a process of time and learning the hard way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, before I speak on what I\r\n\r\nthink is the more important aspect on this particular\r\n\r\nhead,  that  is, the  efficient enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinances   we   have  passed - the  Shop   Assistants\r\n\r\nEmployment   Ordinance  and  the  Clerks   Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinance - I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  say  this.

Mr Thomas said organisational experience,  and\r\n\r\nso on. The first quality is drive and idealism. Trade\r\n\r\nunionism  does not mean the occasional meeting  where\r\n\r\none harangues the member. It means sweating day after\r\n\r\nday  in  your little office, running around attending\r\n\r\nto  multitudes of little problems, and  the  drudgery\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  done by those who have got  sufficient\r\n\r\nidealism and drive. That is the first quality and the\r\n\r\nfirst  difficulty is to find a man with that idealism\r\n\r\nand  that drive. Sir, if we could find more and  more\r\n\r\nof  such people, there will be no danger. Then we can\r\n\r\nmake  such people work the democratic trade unionism.\r\n\r\nThen  there  is  every  reason to  believe  that  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system in Malaya will flourish.  The  task\r\n\r\nis  one  of  finding the men, and not one  of  giving\r\n\r\nleadership grants to train people to be leaders. They\r\n\r\nsend  these people all over the world, but they start\r\n\r\nwith material that would never make leaders. I do not\r\n\r\nyet know of a man who became a leader as a result  of\r\n\r\nhaving undergone a leadership course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But coming to the main topic, it is an open\r\n\r\nsecret - one  which  must be very  well  known  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Labour  and  Welfare - that  employers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  coffee-shop owners, are  not  observing\r\n\r\nthe  Shop  Assistants Employment Ordinance. I  myself\r\n\r\nhave referred several cases where there has been non-observance  by coffee-shop owners, to his department.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it is only a few months since the Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas passed, it is time that he got down to getting an\r\n\r\ninspectorate  to  see  that the  provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance are observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a union is strong, and the overall labour\r\n\r\nsituation is one favourable to the worker as  against\r\n\r\nthe  employer,  the  services of an  inspectorate  to\r\n\r\nenforce the provisions of the Ordinance do not become\r\n\r\nso  important. But where the union is  still  in  the\r\n\r\nformative  stage  and  gathering  strength,  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers  are able to gang-up and either  punish  or\r\n\r\notherwise   make  it  uncomfortable  for   individual\r\n\r\nemployees or union officials who try to get  them  to\r\n\r\nobserve   the   provisions  of  the  law,   then   an\r\n\r\ninspectorate  which lends itself to the unions  where\r\n\r\nemployers are in breach is a very desirable thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other difficulties also for which we\r\n\r\ndid  not  make  provision when we passed  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

I  want  to\r\n\r\nknow  from  him whether he is making a study  of  all\r\n\r\nthese  deficiencies,  and  when  we  can  expect   an\r\n\r\nOrdinance or an amending Ordinance to fill up all the\r\n\r\nloopholes  which  by lack of experience  or  lack  of\r\n\r\nanticipation were allowed to pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Member\r\n\r\nthat complaints whenever received from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthe  workers concerned or their representatives  will\r\n\r\nbe  looked  into expeditiously and if it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the labour inspectorate, this will  be\r\n\r\ndone. I agree with the Member for Tanjong Pagar  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain loopholes in the Labour Ordinance\r\n\r\nand  arising out of the Labour Ordinance in the Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants   Employment  Ordinance  and  the   Clerks\r\n\r\nEmployment Ordinance but a study is being made  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of experience gained and as soon as the  study\r\n\r\nis completed, an amending Bill will be put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 52 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to make it difficult for the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour and Welfare, who is a good friend  and  a\r\n\r\nvery  old colleague of mine, but I would like to make\r\n\r\nsome enquiries regarding this department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, during the post-war period, this\r\n\r\ndepartment is very necessary and is useful. There  is\r\n\r\nno doubt about that. I would like him to give me some\r\n\r\nstatistics now or tomorrow morning of the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople receiving help and the amount given yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, complaints have been made that if a person has\r\n\r\ngot to receive a very few dollars from the department\r\n\r\nhe may have to travel and spend bus money to and from\r\n\r\nthe  department. What arrangements have been made  so\r\n\r\nthat  these  people who receive a very  meagre  sum - a\r\n\r\nfamily  may  receive more - should not  have  to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney  to travel to the department and wait for  long\r\n\r\nhours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I do not know whether I am in order, but\r\n\r\nI would also like to have statistics as to the number\r\n\r\nof   those   labourers,   skilled   labourers,   shop\r\n\r\nassistants,   and   so   on,  receiving   help   from\r\n\r\nGovernment. What is being done for such people by the\r\n\r\nSocial   Welfare  Department  to  make   them   self-supporting? I believe that the duty of the Government\r\n\r\nis to reduce the number of people dependent on public\r\n\r\ndole  and  that  they should be made self-supporting.\r\n\r\nThey  must be given jobs; they must be taught certain\r\n\r\ntrades in small-scale industries, and so on, so  that\r\n\r\nthey can earn their own living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the statistics\r\n\r\nasked  for by the hon.
