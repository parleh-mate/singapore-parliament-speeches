At the\r\nNDC, various procedures are subsidised \u2013 from basic dental services\r\nto more complex dental procedures like crowning, root canal treatment\r\nand dentures. The subsidy rates can vary from 20% to 76%, depending\r\non the type of treatment or procedure. Please allow me to list some\r\nof the procedures where subsidies are available. The basic dental\r\nprocedures will be scaling, polishing, fillings and extractions.\r\nThe more complex ones would be crowning, root canal treatment, dental\r\ntreatment related to traumatised teeth and non-vital teeth, dental\r\ntreatment for patients who are under rehabilitation following cancer\r\nsurgery and so on.

They will be treated immediately,\r\nsay, the day itself, or within the week, depending on the level\r\nof urgency. Another example would be the elderly who need urgent\r\ndenture replacements. These cases would be prioritised and they\r\nwould be treated.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1e325416-f60c-4ea1-8c17-52cb291a8df5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-1d8ac922-4423-4968-8a82-a2d444828e35__id-1e325416-f60c-4ea1-8c17-52cb291a8df5\"><!--a--></a>For those on the waiting\r\nlist, generally, they would have been assessed by the dentists as\r\nstable or pain-free cases. We would then put them on the waiting\r\nlist. The waiting time would depend on the level of complexity of\r\nthe procedures. In fact, for the NDC, the median waiting time for\r\nfirst appointment, where the dentists will make the assessment, for non-emergency,\r\nnon-urgent cases, is 18 days. And depending on the type of treatment\r\nthat they need, if it is urgent, they will be sent almost immediately.\r\nAs I said, if they call up and it is an urgent case, they will also\r\nbe treated on an urgent basis.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 920</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3ea962a9-aa64-46aa-8d64-b9b88c1c1b0c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-1d8ac922-4423-4968-8a82-a2d444828e35__id-3ea962a9-aa64-46aa-8d64-b9b88c1c1b0c\"><!--a--></a>On 15 January, we implemented\r\nthe expanded PCPS, which is now called the Community Health Assist\r\nScheme (CHAS).

First, contract employees\r\nprovide greater flexibility for companies to manage their costs\r\nin an environment of increased global competition and shorter and\r\nless predictable business cycles. This is true globally \u2013 outsourcing\r\nand non-traditional employment arrangements, including term contracts, have\r\nbecome more common. Second, there are also occasions where companies\r\nneed to turn to contract employees with specific skill sets not\r\navailable within the company for fixed-term projects or assignments.\r\nSome companies may also place an employee on a term contract for\r\na specific period while they assess the employee's competency and\r\nsuitability for long-term employment. Further, some employers may\r\npay a premium to their employees to compensate for the short-term\r\nnature of certain contracts in certain professions where skills\r\nand expertise are in demand.

In 2008, we extended the length of normal bus lanes island-wide\r\nfrom 120 km to 155 km, and more than trebled the length of full-day\r\nbus lanes from 7 km to 23 km. This has helped improve bus journey\r\nspeeds along these heavily-used bus corridors by an average of 7%,\r\nand even up to 20% along some stretches. To help reduce the time\r\ntaken for buses to pull out of bus bays, we also introduced the\r\nMandatory Give-Way to Bus Scheme in 2008, and this has now been implemented\r\nat 202 bus stops across the island. The scheme has helped reduce\r\nthe time taken by buses to exit bus bays by up to 73%. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ca1d4116-a192-493c-acee-1c46162be42a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-86758451-fff6-453d-bf14-99a01df1e8d2__id-ca1d4116-a192-493c-acee-1c46162be42a\"><!--a--></a>However, despite these targeted\r\nimprovements to bus speeds along specific routes, overall average\r\nbus speeds have decreased slightly from 19.1 km/h in 2007 to 17.8\r\nkm/h in 2011. We believe that one major factor that has likely contributed\r\nto the decrease in speeds is the increase in bus ridership, which\r\nhas grown by 16% from 2.9 million per day in 2007 to 3.45 million\r\nper day in 2011.

One of the things\r\nthat we think will help improve the bus speeds is to reduce the\r\ndwell times at the bus bays. If we consider the fact that when we\r\nintroduce more buses into the system, apart from road congestion\r\nand making it easier for the buses to get through on the roads,\r\nwe also have to consider the fact that people boarding and alighting\r\ncontributes to the dwell time. And so for people who are already\r\non the buses, it adds to their journey time. And that is one of\r\nthe bottlenecks that we have to overcome. The identification of\r\nthe 35 bus hubs, with expanded bus bays to allow more buses to stop\r\nat the same time, is a major effort that is ongoing. We have already\r\nstarted work since October 2011, and we are making good progress.\r\nIt is an important part of our initiatives to try and improve bus\r\nspeeds. So that is a priority project and we will focus on it to\r\nensure that for those very busy bus stops, it will help reduce the\r\ndwell times. For those passengers who regularly use those bus stops,\r\nor whose bus services pass those bus stops, they will not be unduly\r\nheld up. So that is important. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c0beaccf-d350-4121-bffe-9c35bfaea10b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-86758451-fff6-453d-bf14-99a01df1e8d2__id-c0beaccf-d350-4121-bffe-9c35bfaea10b\"><!--a--></a>As to the Member's second\r\nquestion, if I understand correctly, he is talking about creating\r\nstorage lanes?

As we expand the bus fleet,\r\nwe do have to hire more bus captains. It is not an easy thing to\r\ndo because the work conditions of a bus captain are quite demanding.\r\nSo quite apart from finding people with the correct driving skills,\r\nwe also need people who have the right service aptitudes. And of\r\ncourse, the ability to be familiar with the bus routes, adds additional layer\r\nof complexity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b94a7efe-fe18-4a31-8828-506ceb0d311a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-86758451-fff6-453d-bf14-99a01df1e8d2__id-b94a7efe-fe18-4a31-8828-506ceb0d311a\"><!--a--></a>Part of the problem has\r\nbeen contributed by the fact that we sometimes need to deploy drivers\r\nto the bus routes that they are not used to driving. That is because\r\nthere are occasions where there are services that need to be improved\r\nvery quickly, and we need to pump in the buses, and so the drivers\r\nhave to be re-deployed. One of the measures with which we can deal\r\nwith this, is to allow more of the bus captains to be cross-trained\r\non different routes so that each driver perhaps being just familiar\r\nwith his own route that he drives on a regular basis, is also familiar\r\nwith several other routes.

Taxi companies have also delayed the commencement\r\nof the evening peak surcharge period from 5.00 pm to 6.00 pm given that\r\na significant number of commuters now leave work later with the\r\nimplementation of a five-day work week in Singapore. On the other\r\nhand, as the demand for taxis in the evenings after 8.00 pm continue\r\nto be high resulting in feedback on the difficulty of getting a\r\ntaxi after 8.00 pm, taxi companies have extended the evening peak\r\nsurcharge to midnight, instead of ending it at 8.00 pm to better\r\nmatch the demand and supply for taxi service. Concurrent with the\r\nextension of evening peak hours, taxi companies have chosen to soften\r\nthe impact of this extension by reducing the peak surcharge from\r\n35% of metered fare to 25%. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1726dcc9-f6a8-4363-a714-2bfdc8e3d4fb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3bff4d39-7300-4520-8b9d-80d1c389d44f__id-1726dcc9-f6a8-4363-a714-2bfdc8e3d4fb\"><!--a--></a>Besides using fare changes\r\nto better match the demand and supply of taxis at different times\r\nof the day, taxi companies have also expanded their fleet size to\r\nmeet the general increase in taxi demand.

I think\r\nthe genesis of the extension of the peak period in the evening beyond 8.00\r\npm arose because there was a lot of feedback of the difficulty of\r\ngetting taxis after 8.00 pm and prior to midnight. Normally, our\r\ntaxis are actually under the two-shift system, although a good number\r\nof them are driven by only one driver. Therefore, the rational behaviour\r\nwould be such that the driver would pick the best time to drive\r\nhis taxi. And for him, the best time is the revenue that he would\r\nderive as a result. And hence,\r\nwith the peak period in the past stopping at 8.00 pm, there was\r\na lot of feedback on the difficulty of getting a taxi, including\r\nthrough call bookings. Hence, that was one of the main reasons why\r\nthe taxi companies starting with ComfortDelgro decided on the need\r\nto extend the peak surcharge period.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-85b4e468-a210-4863-bad3-60f62bf4f462\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-3bff4d39-7300-4520-8b9d-80d1c389d44f__id-85b4e468-a210-4863-bad3-60f62bf4f462\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 929</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cb2bbb99-ee4a-4bbc-9204-a8ee9dd128ae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3bff4d39-7300-4520-8b9d-80d1c389d44f__id-cb2bbb99-ee4a-4bbc-9204-a8ee9dd128ae\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency\r\nMember)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker, the fact remains that each time\r\nComfortDelgro raises their fares, all the other companies follow suit.\r\nDoes the Minister agree that this is a clear indicator that there\r\nis insufficient competition in the taxi market?

It is a good question.\r\nBut it is also behaviour that extends beyond the taxi industry.\r\nFor example, for those of us who drive, we find it somewhat coincidental\r\nthat petrol prices, when they go up, they go up across the different\r\ncompanies \u2013 Shell, Esso, Caltex, and so on.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-42dac767-cce0-40c3-897b-783cd1bf4685\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3bff4d39-7300-4520-8b9d-80d1c389d44f__id-42dac767-cce0-40c3-897b-783cd1bf4685\"><!--a--></a>And I think the Competition\r\nCommission had actually investigated and explained this in the past.\r\nThere are good economic explanations for such behaviours.

We now have more players in the industry.\r\nBut I think they also, in a sense, draw reference from the behaviour\r\nof the market leader. So there is a certain harmonisation in that\r\nsense of the fares over time, in terms of, for example, flag-down rate\r\nincreases after every 400 metres, but there are also differences.\r\nFor example, in the booking fees \u2013 in the advanced booking fees\r\nand the current booking fees \u2013 there are variations across taxi\r\ncompanies.

I ought to get back to the Member on\r\nthis. We hear the same feedback with regard to taxi service in Hong\r\nKong that you have taxis waiting for commuters and that it is so\r\neasy to get a taxi. And there are no peak surcharges. From the commuters'\r\npoint of view, it is not a bad situation. The flipside of it, as\r\nwe also hear from the drivers, is that they find it a lot more difficult\r\nin terms of making a living. The indications are that they seem\r\nto be working much longer hours compared to the taxi drivers in\r\nSingapore. There are two sides to the equation. In the case of Hong\r\nKong, it may be easier for the commuters to get a taxi but, on the\r\nother hand, quite a lot more difficult for the taxi drivers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a778daa4-580c-42d7-bdcd-e73a8fe2fc1f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-3bff4d39-7300-4520-8b9d-80d1c389d44f__id-a778daa4-580c-42d7-bdcd-e73a8fe2fc1f\"><!--a--></a>If I were to just give a\r\nquick comparison in terms of fares, for instance, this is after\r\nthe increase that has taken place in December of last year, for\r\na 10-km trip in Singapore, off-peak period, it is about S$10 and\r\nwith the 25% peak surcharge which has gone down from 35%, it would\r\nbe about S$12.30, during the peak period. In Hong Kong, they do\r\nnot have the surcharge but for a 10-km trip, I think it is about\r\n$14.50. So the fares are higher.

This is an interesting question,\r\nwhich is why in my earlier reply I said that it is still early days because it has only\r\nbeen a month since the introduction of the fares. The last time\r\nthis happened was in 2007. We also had the same initial feedback\r\nfrom the drivers that the increase affected their livelihoods, the\r\ntakings went down. Indeed, when we looked at the data that we collected,\r\nit was so for the first two months after the last fare increase in\r\n2007.

I think there is a case\r\nfor studying some of these practices \u2013 which have been told to me\r\nmany times \u2013 that have been in place for so long. I just ask for\r\na work team to do that. Some of the practices that may need to be\r\nre-considered are, for example, the valuation of the current flat\r\n\u2013 </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-e543ff7b-d511-4033-8531-6d704b65a9bf\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-37f10b3e-5f38-467b-9beb-d1f4aa1fba55__id-e543ff7b-d511-4033-8531-6d704b65a9bf\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 934</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3a0da934-c5e6-4061-8301-88e1a620647e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-37f10b3e-5f38-467b-9beb-d1f4aa1fba55__id-3a0da934-c5e6-4061-8301-88e1a620647e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Ms Phua, can\r\nyou ask the question?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-f2fa2ee3-6d3a-4246-81ad-c539b7a4ce27\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-37f10b3e-5f38-467b-9beb-d1f4aa1fba55__id-f2fa2ee3-6d3a-4246-81ad-c539b7a4ce27\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1d6edc2-5ae8-4c28-9dc7-afbb8a00c80f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-37f10b3e-5f38-467b-9beb-d1f4aa1fba55__id-a1d6edc2-5ae8-4c28-9dc7-afbb8a00c80f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nWould the Minister consider the appointment of, for example, more\r\nthan one valuer to value these flats?

We did, in fact, have financing\r\nlimits on car loans by banks from 1995 to sometime in 2003.

In fact, their share of car loans\r\ntoday is somewhat lower than it was10 years ago. Individuals can\r\nborrow from other entities such as car dealers and non-bank credit\r\nor leasing companies to get around the rules that are in place for\r\nbanks.

Let me share a little bit\r\nof how procurement practices are supervised. One of the important\r\nthings that is issued and Ministries adhered to, is really the Finance\r\nCircular. So when we issue an advisory and supplement it by a Finance Circular,\r\nthe instruction and the signalling given to the Ministries is that\r\nthis is something to be taken very seriously and we want them to\r\nincorporate it into their procurement procedures.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-677e2743-63bc-4be3-935f-7681acc86c94\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-09d757ff-7ec5-453d-91d9-7c3f42aae3a0__id-677e2743-63bc-4be3-935f-7681acc86c94\"><!--a--></a>And so, when the Member\r\ntalked about the SOP, although it is not strictly a set of procedures\r\nthat is prescribed, nonetheless, the emphasis is given through the\r\ncircular. We have adopted this approach of the advisory because\r\npractices have to be suitable to the circumstances in which the\r\nagencies operate. We also want the agencies to take ownership of\r\nit and not just follow these advisories for the sake of it. We want\r\nthem to go beyond it. So the earlier examples that we cited, SIRD\r\nand NParks, are very good examples of how even in the presence of\r\nour advisories, agencies can go beyond what is expected of them.\r\nI want to assure the Member that this is something that we want\r\nto take very seriously.

If landlords increase rental\r\nrates, the costs will also increase and these will be passed on\r\nto consumers.

And the\r\nprevious peak was in the 1998. There was 10 years of lull period,\r\nwhere retail rental was relatively low. The Government's role is\r\nreally to ensure that in the median term, there would be an adequate\r\nsupply of retail space and, in fact, based on known projects, the\r\nretail space supply would be between 90,000 and 108,000, compared\r\nto the five-year past average of just 85,000.

In fact,\r\nby integrating sales information, I think the mall operators and\r\nthe tenants can better share information about their customers,\r\nabout what is selling, what is not, about the best-performing stalls\r\nand the least-performing stalls in the mall and from there, they\r\ncan decide how to promote the malls to the targeted customer segment.

I wish to express my concern that this Government is still\r\npushing the notion that Singapore needs to pay the highest political salaries\r\nin the developed world to ensure an honest government and attract\r\ntalented individuals to serve the people. Are we sending the right\r\nmessage to the next generation that our top leadership may not function\r\nat a desired level if the Ministerial pay is not benchmarked against\r\nthe highest income earners in Singapore? Do we really believe our top\r\nleaders will be less capable, less honest, and less committed if\r\ntheir political pay is not benchmarked against these top 1,000 private\r\nsector earners? Therefore, that the consequence of not paying top\r\ndollars to secure the service of future leaders is an incompetent\r\nand corrupt government? Does this House seriously believe we can\r\nhave an honest government and prevent corruption simply by paying\r\nmillions of dollars to our\r\nMinisters? If a Minister has a character flaw lurking inside him,\r\ncan a million-dollar salary be the cure? How many Members in this\r\nHouse would have a second thought about serving the people if your\r\nsalary is not benchmarked against top earners in Singapore?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 943</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-90f07d79-39a6-421b-b20d-12f888c94473\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-90f07d79-39a6-421b-b20d-12f888c94473\"><!--a--></a>The Deputy Prime Minister\r\nsaid yesterday that there is no right answer to this complex issue\r\nof determining public office salaries.

They then put forward their own rather precise\r\nproposal of pegging MPs' salaries to the MX9 pay grade in the civil\r\nservice using a five-time multiple for the Minister's salary.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4da7196f-4e48-4b8c-ba0f-ec332f278f7f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-4da7196f-4e48-4b8c-ba0f-ec332f278f7f\"><!--a--></a>When I asked the Workers'\r\nParty if they had made this proposal known to Mr Ee's Committee,\r\nit was only out of fairness because I myself have not heard that\r\nbefore. The first time I heard it was yesterday. And if they are\r\ngoing to level such strong criticisms at Mr Ee's Committee, the\r\nleast they could have done was put their ideas forward before the\r\nCommittee came out with its proposals, rather than slamming them\r\nafterwards by saying, \"Why did you not think of this before?\" The\r\npublic consultation was open for many months, and I think many Singaporeans\r\nhad written in. I understand they received about 500 emails and\r\nmessages. And that will probably mean there were 500 different opinions\r\non what should be done. So in that sense, I think the Committee\r\nhad a very difficult job.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d6db39c7-5b9e-4243-a43d-386293e4a8dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d6db39c7-5b9e-4243-a43d-386293e4a8dc\"><!--a--></a>However, in examining the\r\nexact principles used by the Workers' Party in its calculation,\r\nI actually think there is not that much difference between what\r\nthe Workers' Party is proposing and what the Committee, in fact,\r\nput forward, except there is a small discount at each level. The\r\nWorkers' Party has also come a long way from their previously-held\r\npublic positions and pretty much abandoned most of them. So, in\r\nthat sense, I think that the gap between Members in this House has,\r\nin fact, become extremely narrow. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 947</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-239a9006-9a41-41c7-a0b5-a65e00188dab\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-239a9006-9a41-41c7-a0b5-a65e00188dab\"><!--a--></a>The Workers' Party said at the starting\r\npoint, that calculation of MPs' allowances should be pegged at MX9\r\ncivil service pay grade. I am not a civil servant myself, so I just checked.\r\nFrom what I understand, this is, in fact, not a wage that is at\r\npar with the average working level as the Workers' Party has tried\r\nto represent. In fact, this is the wage, I understand, that of a\r\nSuperscale in the civil service. I think less than 2% of people in\r\nthe civil service get this. So, the Workers' Party's starting point\r\nis certainly not the average wage level as they have represented.\r\nIt is, in fact, much higher than that. I also disagree that an MP's\r\nallowance should be compared with a civil servant's pay because, for\r\none thing, I do not know about the Workers' Party, but I know certainly\r\nmost PAP MPs do not pocket the entire allowance. It is, in fact,\r\na large part of the expenses we incurred in running our constituencies\r\nas well. I mean, in other countries, MPs get expense accounts. We\r\ndo not get that. The allowance is, in fact, the sum total of the\r\nexpense account and if there is anything left then that could be\r\nconsidered a \"salary\", but I would hardly consider it that. So,\r\nin that sense, thinking of the MP's allowance as a salary is, perhaps,\r\nthe wrong starting point because I do not think that is what it\r\nis. It is, in fact, an all-in package that encompasses an amount\r\nyou have to give back to the community as well. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-71b4fcae-b4f0-474a-b4d9-22ceafef9216\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-71b4fcae-b4f0-474a-b4d9-22ceafef9216\"><!--a--></a>But having said that, while\r\nI may disagree with them using that as a starting point, the number\r\nthey come up with is not too far away from what we have right now.\r\nSo, again, we may disagree on how we want to crack the egg but,\r\nat the end of the day, I think the number we arrive at is not too\r\nfar apart. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-450487b4-0b35-4d1e-a0f5-48c9197f2400\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-450487b4-0b35-4d1e-a0f5-48c9197f2400\"><!--a--></a>The next point: the Workers'\r\nParty says that the Minister's salary should be pegged at five times\r\nthe MP's allowance. This basically means the MP's allowance is about\r\n20% of the Minister's pay. In fact, the Committee recommended 17.5%.\r\nAgain, not very far off \u2013 a 2.5% difference. And the Workers' Party\r\ndoes not explain why it came up with the multiple of five times\r\nrather than four or six times. It could be any number in the air,\r\nbut they decided on five, which miraculously, brings them very close\r\nto what the Committee came up with.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bfe49ea5-d699-4dc3-ae77-5c2fcca06a5f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bfe49ea5-d699-4dc3-ae77-5c2fcca06a5f\"><!--a--></a>Another point that is interesting\r\nis the Workers' Party suggested that the benchmark we use for an\r\nentry-level Minister be $55,000. What is interesting is this: the\r\nCommittee recommended $55,000 monthly salary as a benchmark, but\r\nthe entry level was actually lower than that. In fact, it was precisely\r\n$46,750. So, in fact, the Workers' Party is proposing a higher starting\r\nsalary for Ministers. And this is interesting because the difference\r\nin salary for one month is about $8,250. If you multiply that over\r\nthe course of a year, the Workers' Party's proposed starting salary\r\nfor Ministers amounts to about $99,000 more than what the Committee\r\nrecommended. $99,000, incidentally, is about a two-month bonus based\r\non the base salary of $46,750. The Workers' Party has raised a big\r\nruckus about the quantum of the bonus. The starting salary they\r\nhave proposed incorporates a two-month bonus based on the current\r\nstarting salary. So, they have, in fact, proposed a higher starting\r\nsalary for Ministers than even the one the Committee recommended.\r\nWhile the Workers' Party kicks up a big fuss about the bonus right\r\nnow, it is important to keep this in mind because any bonus they\r\ncalculate, for an entry-level Minister, would also be based on this\r\nhigher starting salary.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-41dec0c6-2166-4db1-ba5e-c64b48ca8590\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-41dec0c6-2166-4db1-ba5e-c64b48ca8590\"><!--a--></a>Now, on the other point:\r\nthis is where we deal with the bonus itself. Mr Giam says that the\r\naverage bonus should be pegged at three months rather than the six\r\nmonths that the Committee recommends. Now, one of the interesting\r\npoints is this: my initial reaction\r\nto the bonus component also was that it was extremely high. And,\r\nto be fair, that is a larger sum of money most ordinary people would\r\never get. But when I looked at the targets that were set for the\r\nNational Bonus, I would also say that those targets are extremely\r\nhard to achieve. And I believe that the Deputy Prime Minister also\r\nclarified that the individual bonus component would be determined\r\nnot only by the Minister's contribution to his own Ministry but\r\nalso by how much he contributed towards achieving the national bonus\r\nmatrix. In that sense, the national bonus matrix has become the\r\ntarget that our Government has set out to achieve. This target is\r\na target I do not think leaders of any other countries have set\r\nout to achieve. And if you look at recent history, I do not think\r\nleaders of any other country have achieved.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 948</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-90e01b42-4b6c-4cb1-9a47-1ea7236c0b81\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-90e01b42-4b6c-4cb1-9a47-1ea7236c0b81\"><!--a--></a>We will just look at some\r\nof the targets. In order to achieve, say, the six-month bonus \u2013\r\nthe so called average bonus \u2013 this sounds like a big number. If\r\nyou look at the targets, the GDP has to grow, and in real terms,\r\nby 3% to 5%. The income of the lowest 20% has to grow by 2% to 3%\r\nin real terms, and the median income has to grow by 2% to 3% in real\r\nterms. The word \"real\" basically means that this has to take into\r\naccount inflation. Inflation, as at November, I believe, was about\r\n5.7%. And inflation is pretty much a worldwide phenomenon. Central\r\nbanks all over the world are printing money, commodity prices are\r\nshooting through the roof. Controlling inflation, in itself, is\r\na challenge.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-eea922bd-2b63-42c8-9eb8-168289378bf4\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-eea922bd-2b63-42c8-9eb8-168289378bf4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-48851793-c094-430a-bb6d-056f87572656\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-48851793-c094-430a-bb6d-056f87572656\"><!--a--></a>The targets the Government\r\nhas undertaken actually involve not only making sure that incomes\r\nrise in line with inflation, but exceeding it. What that basically\r\nmeans is that GDP growth, in actual terms, may have to be \u2013 well,\r\nif it is 3% to 5% in real terms, that would be 8.7% to 10.7%. Incomes,\r\nlikewise, will have to grow between 7% and 8%. If inflation comes\r\ndown, those targets would come down. But the real point is that\r\ninflation is incorporated into all of these targets. And I do not\r\nknow of any developed country, anywhere in the world where the government\r\nhas been able to achieve these targets. So, indeed, even the target\r\nto get the so called \"average\" bonuses is a very difficult one. And\r\nif our office holders achieved that, I think the benefits to Singaporeans\r\nwould be tremendous, especially to the average Singaporeans and\r\nalso to those in the lower income groups. So, in that sense, I would\r\nnot begrudge them that.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-be9b0e74-3833-42ee-940e-3014f8b3df53\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-be9b0e74-3833-42ee-940e-3014f8b3df53\"><!--a--></a>While the Workers' Party\r\nalso makes a big issue about the so called \"13-month\" maximum bonus,\r\nneedless to say the targets to achieve that would be astronomical, especially\r\nwhen inflation stays at the current levels. If our Government is\r\nable to achieve that, then I think the people of Singapore would\r\nbe so much better off and that a couple of months' difference in\r\npay is probably not that big a deal to divide this House over. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1171cb25-5291-47f6-b485-23fa19139d53\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-1171cb25-5291-47f6-b485-23fa19139d53\"><!--a--></a>I was also a little surprised\r\nwhen Mr Giam ended his speech by saying he opposes the motion. Because\r\ngiven how much common ground there is between the parties, it is\r\nstunning that he would actually want to oppose a motion that, in\r\nmy view, is extremely progressive, and brings us much closer to\r\nthe Workers' Party's ideas than anyone that has ever proposed before.\r\nBecause by opposing the motion, what he is actually saying is that\r\nhe would rather keep the existing pay scales, than to move forward\r\nwith the proposal the Committee has put up. And I do not think anyone\r\nhere would agree to that. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e9816f96-b8ff-455d-846c-162f09f25841\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e9816f96-b8ff-455d-846c-162f09f25841\"><!--a--></a>Now, let me also deal a\r\nlittle bit with some of the previous positions taken by the Workers'\r\nParty because I actually think this proposal touched on a lot of\r\nthe principles that were brought up back then as well. In 2006,\r\nfor example, in an interview, Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the Ministers'\r\nsalaries should be set at about a hundred times that of a worker\r\nin the lowest 20th percentile. At that time, he believed that this\r\nfigure was $800.\r\nSo back in 2006, Mr Low was actually comfortable with a salary of\r\n$80,000 a month for a Minister. He also took out the implication\r\nof this. What he said then was that it also meant that if the income\r\nof the person in the lowest 20% group rose by $1,000, the Ministers\r\nwould get $100,000 more, not just a year but a month. So, he was\r\nactually quite comfortable with having the Ministers earn more,\r\nif the lowest-income workers earned more back in 2006.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 949</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aaeeddac-8b2a-4898-8042-755a8635054b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-aaeeddac-8b2a-4898-8042-755a8635054b\"><!--a--></a>In many ways, the Committee's\r\nproposal actually takes this principle into account. It, in fact,\r\npretty much says that the income of the lowest 20% has to rise.\r\nIt is, in fact, even less generous than Mr Low in two respects.\r\nOne, the base pay is lower; and, two, the actual bonus is capped\r\n\u2013 it is not unlimited, whereas in Mr Low's example, the upside would\r\nhave been unlimited. So, in fact, the salaries are less generous\r\nthan what the Workers' Party proposed in 2006 in many ways. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a65ea57a-cae6-4851-a1c2-8b0195f86af0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a65ea57a-cae6-4851-a1c2-8b0195f86af0\"><!--a--></a>Now, in the Workers' Party's\r\nmanifesto, the position was slightly different. They actually said,\r\nboth in 2006 and 2011, that the Ministerial salaries should actually\r\nbe pegged to the salaries of foreign leaders with all their expenses\r\nand so on taken into account. But the reality is this: this is a\r\nnotoriously difficult exercise and I notice that the Workers' Party,\r\ndespite having said this for the last five years, has not come up\r\nwith a single proposal on what the numbers would actually be if\r\nthis formula was applied. And they have had five years to come up\r\nwith this.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-58b841f6-f6a1-4a98-ae04-fe8a9c089d83\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-58b841f6-f6a1-4a98-ae04-fe8a9c089d83\"><!--a--></a>I myself tried to do this\r\nexercise and it was very, very difficult because a lot of the actual\r\nbonuses and perks are actually very obscure. I took a stab at Australia\r\njust now because it was the first country on the list. Over there,\r\nI think, the Prime Minister receives an annual salary of $495,000\r\na year, which obviously looks more, compared to what our Ministers\r\nearn. But the Prime Minister has two official residences while she\r\nis in office. In previous sessions, the Members of Parliament of\r\nthe Opposition had said, \"We are quite happy to have our Ministers\r\nlive in bungalows.\" The rental of a bungalow in Singapore, according\r\nto <em class=\"ph i\">Property Guru</em>, checked as of this morning, was between $25,000\r\nand $42,000 a month. So, if we include that as part of the pay package,\r\nas one of the perks, just monetising that perk alone would probably\r\namount to $300,000 to $400,000 more a year. And this excludes other\r\nperks such as free first-class travel for herself and her spouse\r\nfor the rest of their lives, a fully-paid-for office for the rest\r\nof their lives and, of course, all the expenses involved in keeping\r\nup the house, and so on, would also be paid for by the state. And\r\nthese are just some of the perks. There are, of course, lots of\r\nother perks \u2013 I have not had the ability to find out the values\r\nfor all of them because they are found in so many different pieces\r\nof legislation and are so difficult to put together. So in that\r\nsense, our clean wage system \u2013 what you see is what you get \u2013 is,\r\nin fact, one of the most transparent you would find. And because\r\nof that, our Ministers come under flak. But I think that is fair\r\ngame because people should know exactly what the cost of public\r\noffice is, nothing hidden.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8ac61c2c-04a3-476b-80ff-daf2972ef57e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8ac61c2c-04a3-476b-80ff-daf2972ef57e\"><!--a--></a>Ministerial pay is a highly\r\nemotive issue.

The Prime Minister is our leader\r\nand he must be responsible for the well-being of 3.5 million Singaporeans.\r\nTherefore, his salary can be based on our population, say, one person\r\n$1 per year, so that is $3.5 million per year. With that, perhaps\r\nall Singaporeans are able to feel the balance at a more comfortable\r\nlevel. Regardless of our ethnic, religious , language and cultural\r\nbackground, we are all Singaporeans. Poor or rich, we are all Singaporeans.\r\nAs long as you are Singaporeans, the Prime Minister looks after\r\nyour well-being. Notwithstanding, some may say $1 per year is not\r\nmuch, some may say it is not little. The Prime Minister takes a\r\npay cut of, say, 37%, so as to remind himself there is a need to\r\nwork even harder to improve the livelihood of the 40% lower middle-income\r\nSingaporeans. With that, the figure was adjusted downwards to $2.2 million,\r\nwhich is not much different from that recommended by the Committee. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-28917893-fa67-44da-bebc-1c8337102fd9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-28917893-fa67-44da-bebc-1c8337102fd9\"><!--a--></a>If we set the entry-level\r\nministerial salary as half of the Prime Minister's because his responsibility\r\nis half, that will work out to be $1.1 million.

Scouting for the best talent is not\r\nsomething that only the Government will do. Even in our daily life,\r\nwe often try to get them. For example, many of us hope to find a\r\ncapable, hardworking domestic worker to do the household chores,\r\ntake care of the young and old; those running a business will hope\r\nto find a good helper to bring in profits for the company, expand\r\nthe business and create more jobs; at hawker centres, we look for\r\nthe best food, the most value for money and the most economical;\r\nwhen we see a doctor, we will look for the best to cure our illness;\r\nwhen we look for a wife or husband, we also hope to find a good\r\npartner. Hence, to want the best is understandable. Many even pray to\r\nthe gods and hope to be granted their wish.

A miller and his son were on their\r\nway to town to sell their donkey. They had not gone far when they\r\npassed a group of girls who suggested that one of them rode it.\r\nThe father then put his son on the animal. After travelling some\r\ndistance, they went past some old men who criticised the boy for making\r\nhis elderly father walk. So the boy dismounted and the miller got\r\non the donkey instead. Soon after, a group of women berated the\r\nmiller for making his young son walk while he rode on the donkey.\r\nSo the miller put his son up onto the saddle and they rode on happily\r\nuntil they met another group of travellers who scolded them for\r\nover-burdening the poor animal. \"You should carry the poor animal\r\ninstead,\" they suggested. The miller and his son got off the donkey,\r\ntied its legs together, turned it over on its back and carried it.\r\nSoon, a crowd gathered to watch the strange sight. As they were\r\ncrossing a bridge, the poor animal became frightened at the chatter\r\nand noise made by the crowd. It panicked, broke loose, fell into\r\nthe river and drowned. The classic story is a cautionary.

I understand their concerns.\r\nAlthough the eight-man Committee has proposed that the salaries\r\nbe reduced by about one-third, it is still difficult for the ordinary\r\npeople to fathom the amount of pay obtained by the political office\r\nholders. The public also wanted to see a strong link between this\r\ngroup's pay and the Government's performance, in terms of how it\r\ncontributes to improving the lives of the people, especially the\r\nlow-income group. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4788e65a-7d1a-45e5-a0f2-85b03da5745a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-4788e65a-7d1a-45e5-a0f2-85b03da5745a\"><!--a--></a>In this regard, the Government\r\nhas played an important role in providing social services for its\r\npeople. Besides the major investments made in education, health\r\nand housing, social assistance schemes such as Workfare, ComCare\r\nand Medifund and study bursaries have also ensured that opportunities\r\nfor advancement are available to everyone.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 954</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e7b5266c-b1d5-4e0c-a34c-c3f291c58658\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e7b5266c-b1d5-4e0c-a34c-c3f291c58658\"><!--a--></a> A study by the Ministry of Finance recently\r\nshowed that social mobility, which is the ability of an individual\r\nto climb up or move down the social ladder compared to his own parents,\r\nwas found to be satisfactory. It showed that Singaporean children\r\nfrom low-income families have good opportunities to secure better\r\nachievements. As education is the key to social mobility, the strong\r\nsupport from the Government towards early childhood development\r\nand providing education at all levels has brought results. Strenuous\r\nefforts have also been made to improve and upgrade the skills of\r\nlower skilled workers so that this group of people will be able\r\nto do jobs that require higher and more productive skills, and subsequently\r\nhelp them to generate a much higher income. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c7833eff-4711-468c-8a8e-7c13dd6dc32e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-c7833eff-4711-468c-8a8e-7c13dd6dc32e\"><!--a--></a>I hope, Mr Speaker, that\r\nwhen we discuss this issue, we will look at it in the proper context.\r\nWe need to link this salary system to the Government's performance,\r\nespecially in the effort to assist those who are less well-off.\r\nIn fact, the Government has also enhanced support to the middle\r\nclasses. As the proverb goes: the political leadership that fights\r\nfor the people is like a big piece of wood in the middle of the\r\nfield that provides protection from the sun and shelter from the\r\nrain. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7ac3640c-bfd0-40c0-a65a-66f1fc6da0ad\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-7ac3640c-bfd0-40c0-a65a-66f1fc6da0ad\"><!--a--></a>Finally, Mr Speaker, there\r\nis no difference, I feel, between the proposals of the Workers'\r\nParty and our views in that leaders should possess humility, put\r\nthe people's interests first and have a strong desire to serve.\r\nThe weakness in the Workers' Party's opinion and the difference\r\ncompared to our view is that the Workers' Party feels that by paying\r\ncompetitive salaries, the attitudes of the political office holders\r\nwill change whereby they would immediately no longer possess humility,\r\nresponsibility and will also work solely for the pay. I feel this\r\nis a wrong and unfounded view, and is not in line with the reality\r\ntoday or in the past.

My fear is that if we turn this debate\r\ninto a mechanical discussion about dollars and cents, it will become\r\nmuch harder for us to attract good people as office bearers. Let\r\nme just take the example of Mr Tharman, our Finance Minister and\r\nDeputy Prime Minister.

In\r\njust one generation, this Government had completely transformed\r\nSingapore. I used to frequently share with my residents about my\r\n\"toilet\" story. Do not worry. There is nothing, you know, inappropriate.\r\nIt is all entirely appropriate. When I was young, for a number of\r\nyears, I lived in a government quarters. There were about 15 families\r\nliving together but there was only one communal toilet. There was\r\nno piped water in every home and we had a central kitchen for all\r\nthe families to cook in. As we had only one toilet, there was a\r\npecking order for the use of the toilet, especially early in the\r\nmorning. First, the men would use the toilet because they had to\r\ngo to work, followed by the children because they had to go to school\r\nand, finally, the women would do the washing and cleaning. I am\r\nreally not sure what happened if anyone had weak bladders and jumped\r\nthe queue, but I suppose that sometimes the back lanes did come\r\nin handy. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-275bab1d-ae8e-4a28-b01a-1a47d1a103a8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-275bab1d-ae8e-4a28-b01a-1a47d1a103a8\"><!--a--></a>Today, our HDB homes have\r\nnot one, but two toilets, and we are constantly improving our homes\r\nthrough the various upgrading programmes.

Other than heavy investments\r\nin education, healthcare and housing, we also have subsidies in\r\nthe form of Workfare, ComCare, Medifund and educational bursaries, to\r\nname a few. I was also very happy to read about the Ministry of\r\nFinance's recent study which shows that social mobility, a subject\r\nclose to my heart, is still very alive in Singapore. The study shows\r\nthat children from poor Singaporean families stand a good chance\r\nof moving up in life. The son of a father in the bottom 20% of the\r\nincome earners has at least two-thirds chance of breaking out of\r\nhis low-income group.

And I welcome the recent announcements by the Minister\r\nfor Education that it is looking at ways to help students study\r\nin private educational institutions pay for their education, as\r\nI know that parents of children who cannot get into the public universities\r\nreally struggle to support their children. Again, such efforts require\r\nleaders in public service with vision and foresight as education\r\nis a long-term investment and we need to attract more of such people\r\ninto public office. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 956</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aa890068-c924-448e-8bf9-fdfb6a162b4a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-aa890068-c924-448e-8bf9-fdfb6a162b4a\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, the opposite\r\nof the proverb which I had cited, which is that good leaders and\r\na good government is like the big piece of wood in the middle of\r\nthe field that shelters its people from the sun and the rain, is\r\nanother Malay proverb which cautions us to avoid at all costs leaders\r\nthat, and I quote, \"<em class=\"ph i\">Harapkan baga, baga dan makan padi</em>\".\r\nIn English, this means that we placed our trust in the fence around\r\nthe field to protect the padi but as it turned out, it was the fence\r\nthat ended up eating the padi.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6938be36-5805-4a43-9804-bd516034ab0a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-6938be36-5805-4a43-9804-bd516034ab0a\"><!--a--></a>Many countries have gained\r\nindependence at the same time as us but not all have seen much progress\r\nin the lives of their people.

We had to brave many changes together but people were behind\r\nthe Government because they had seen their lives improved. In the\r\n2008 recession, the Singapore Government was the fastest compared to\r\nother countries in coming out with SPUR and Jobs Credit to help\r\nworkers keep their jobs.

Instead of investing\r\nelsewhere, they were able to persuade their headquarters to invest\r\nin Singapore.

Mr Low Thia Khiang was not\r\nyet in Parliament, but it was Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr Chiam. Minister\r\nMentor, or then Prime Minister, came with a stack of papers and did\r\nbattle.

Young officers were leaving, paying up their bonds\r\nor leaving soon after their bonds, not waiting to be underpaid in their\r\n40s, but calculating ahead that by the time I am 40, I am going\r\nto be behind.

Because if every\r\ntime I pay faster, I promote slower, you will end up going nowhere,\r\nand that was the problem because of the system then, without personnel\r\nboards. I was convinced we needed a major revision. And so in 1993,\r\nwe made major revisions to the pay for Ministers, for the civil\r\nservice, especially at the Administrative Service and the Legal\r\nService. At the same time, we came up with this idea that you are\r\ngoing to have this problem repeatedly over the years, the arguments\r\nremain the same, we should settle the argument, try and make a benchmark and\r\nthen we just follow the benchmark. If it goes up, we go up. If it\r\ngoes down, we go down. And the logic remains the same.

Later on, we modified it\r\nand made it two-thirds of the average or the median of the top 48\r\npeople in the same professions. And over the years, we made successive\r\nrevisions to improve the scheme to adapt as circumstances change,\r\nand each time we explained fully in Parliament and to the people\r\nof Singapore what\r\nwe were doing. It is really above board, completely open, fully\r\nargued.

Every level, what could you earn in the private sector,\r\nwhat can you earn in the public sector, we will try and match that,\r\nbut always lagging a little bit because we do not want to set the\r\npace. We want to be lagging. But we made sure it is competitive,\r\nand this led to major salary adjustments. For the teachers, one\r\nyear, we made a 30% increase, and then we followed that with successive\r\nadjustments over the years. Had we not done that, we would not have\r\nthe civil service we have today. We would not have teachers who\r\nare good graduates, we would not have principals who are in their\r\nlate 30s, early 40s, vigorous.

Many technical\r\narguments can be rehearsed. Some people just feel that the salaries\r\nare just too high. Whatever it is, that is too much and less is\r\nbetter. Others may be unhappy that the Ministers have to take the\r\nresponsibility to decide their own salaries rather than have somebody\r\nelse impartially deciding it for them.

It is exciting because these\r\nare young people who think that they are going to change the world.\r\nAnd when we say, \"Come back, change Singapore, that is as important\r\nand challenging\", they will say, \"Well, I'll think about it\".</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-abe6c31f-07a5-4e6f-927d-b83278cfb1e6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-abe6c31f-07a5-4e6f-927d-b83278cfb1e6\"><!--a--></a>So in that situation, I\r\nthink it is going to take a lot of persuading to get young people to\r\ngive up these opportunities and enter politics, whatever Ministers\r\nare going to get paid. And if the pay is not competitive, then there\r\nis just another obstacle to people who have got something valuable\r\nto add to Singapore. Grace Fu was completely right in this point\r\nwhen she posted on her blog to say that this salary revision is\r\nokay but if you go too far, I think there is going to be a problem\r\nfor many Singaporeans. She got flamed online, but she was right\r\nand she was honest to point this out. Singapore has to maintain a\r\nhigh quality of government otherwise we are going to go back down\r\nand we are going to be a mediocre country. I have said this many\r\ntimes, I think, perhaps, it has not been completely understood but\r\ncertainly it is not completely believed, but it is absolutely true.\r\nWe are different and because we are different and exceptional, therefore Singaporeans\r\nhave reaped a Singapore dividend \u2013 not something which the Minister\r\nfor Finance distributes during Budget but a Singapore dividend by\r\nvirtue of your carrying a pink IC and therefore your value in the\r\nworld has gone up. You are in demand. People want to hire you, opportunities\r\nare opened. When you go places, your standing is there. Doors open\r\nand people know of Singapore and people have high regard for Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 970</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cde4a8bf-7b04-44b9-9630-ac529af27417\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-cde4a8bf-7b04-44b9-9630-ac529af27417\"><!--a--></a>I was at the APEC meeting in Honolulu last\r\nyear in November and I met some young people from the National Youth\r\nCouncil.

And one girl said to me that\r\nshe was astonished at how high Singapore's standing was, how much\r\nrespect people had for Singapore. She never realised that. I said,\r\n\"Please go home and tell your friends\", because in fact, this is\r\nan important fact and this is something which is precious and which\r\nwe must not compromise and lose. Because if people stop having that\r\nopinion of Singapore, I think we are in trouble. So I cannot send all\r\nour bright young students to Honolulu but I think we need to know\r\nthat while we have reasons to be dissatisfied and to want to do\r\nbetter, in fact, we have not done badly, and we should be careful\r\nnot to lose what we have already gained. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-61f62dd4-1ef1-4f05-be5c-d40ee2175e31\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-61f62dd4-1ef1-4f05-be5c-d40ee2175e31\"><!--a--></a>One important argument that\r\npeople have raised is accountability. Since Ministers are paid well,\r\nso they have to be held accountable to perform. I would say \"Yes, Ministers\r\nhave to be held accountable\".

You are the Minister, you are serving the people,\r\nyou have to perform to the best of your ability. We are elected\r\nby Singaporeans. It is our duty to uphold the trust which they have\r\nreposed in us and to serve them the best that we can. And if we\r\nare unable to perform to their expectations, then we have to give\r\nway to a better person, or to a better team. And as Prime Minister, my\r\nresponsibility is to ensure that individually, each Minister performs\r\nup to expectation and collectively the Cabinet delivers the best\r\nGovernment for Singapore. So my duty is to set objectives for Ministers,\r\nassess them, hold them to account and to do this carefully and comprehensively;\r\nto take into account, not just what the Minister does in his main portfolio,\r\nbut also his broader contributions to our overall team and to Singapore.\r\nAnd it is not always possible to reduce this to a simplistic formula\r\nor to a finite set of KPIs which you can just measure the numbers\r\nand then calculate the bonus. Because Ministers have responsibilities\r\nin many dimensions, often intangible ones, for example, building\r\nthe SAF and Home Team is the work of more than a generation. So\r\nis keeping Singapore safe from terrorism.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-60711197-2eca-4a05-850d-9d6cb86f7be9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-60711197-2eca-4a05-850d-9d6cb86f7be9\"><!--a--></a>When a new Minister comes\r\nin and takes over and the performance is good, it is maybe his good\r\nwork, it is maybe his predecessor's good work.

My priority in Parliament remains to be on sustainable\r\neconomic growth and healthcare costs. My remarks in Parliament,\r\nincluding this statement, are ultimately geared towards speaking\r\nup for Singaporeans in these areas. My first point relates to the\r\nformula of pegging the Ministers' base pay to 60% of the median\r\nincome of the top 1,000 Singaporean income earners. Mathematically,\r\nit is not clear how the salaries will go from here. Yes, this is\r\na huge cut from now but there is a possibility that the new formula\r\nmay even result in a higher base pay than what the old formula could provide\r\non a long-term basis. There are many ways that the median pay for\r\nthe top 1,000 earners can rise substantially in the next five years.\r\nWealthy foreign business people could be given Singaporean citizenship <em class=\"ph i\">en\r\nmasse</em>. It could even be that the median pay for this group will\r\nrise much faster than the median of the top 48 earners. But for\r\nme to form a more accurate opinion, I would need to see how the\r\nold and the new formulas will apply to the period from the year\r\n2000 to 2010 on a back-dated basis. To do so, the Government would\r\nhave to provide us with these figures. More importantly, are the figures\r\nfor the Ministers' bonuses as paid out each year according to the\r\nold and new formulas. If the Government and the Review Committee\r\nare truly serious about promoting a clean wage approach for Singapore\r\nMinisters, without additional perks and allowances, then they must\r\nfollow through with a spirit of that approach. All this data on salaries\r\nand the specific amount of bonuses paid out each year must be published\r\nand made transparent for public scrutiny. To-date I believe such\r\ndata is never released. In the UK, the Freedom of Information Act\r\nallowed for the release of details of MPs' expenses claimed for\r\nthe British public in the year 2009. If we in Singapore want to\r\ntalk about clean wages, let us all go the way: Publish the bonuses\r\npaid out every year. Mr Speaker, if the Government does not wish\r\nto follow the practices of Ministerial pay in other countries, may\r\nI remind that hon. Members of this House at least show some respect\r\nfor our friends and neighbours and how they decided to remunerate\r\ntheir leaders in their own countries. Let us show some humility.\r\nWe should not be telling them how to run their countries. There\r\nis no need to jeopardise our relationship with them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1fe8d44d-21a7-4bed-adbb-abc52c8b1ad8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-1fe8d44d-21a7-4bed-adbb-abc52c8b1ad8\"><!--a--></a>My second point, in my opinion,\r\nis even more important for the good of Singapore. Ministerial pay\r\nshould be primarily driven according to KPIs that are specific to\r\ntheir Ministerial portfolio. Each Ministry should create a set of\r\nKPIs for the Minister and the Minister's pay is to be objectively\r\ndecided by a formula that is Ministry-specific. As a guide, the\r\nKPIs for the Permanent Secretary of the relevant Ministry as the\r\nmost senior civil servant should be taken into account. Yes, I know\r\nthat there is a performance bonus component which is rewarded based\r\non the individual performance of Ministers. But it is not clear\r\nwhat the criteria are in attaining this performance bonus. The Review Committee's report\r\nsays that the performance bonus' quantum will be reduced substantially.\r\nI am not sure whether the bonus formulas are well structured to\r\ndrive Ministers towards fulfilling their portfolio's KPIs and for\r\nthe purpose of accountability. The Committee recommended formula\r\nfor the national bonus may be an improvement on the old GDP bonus\r\nformula. But it is still too broad. Some cynics have even speculated\r\nthat the recommendation for the old formula to be changed has come\r\nat a time when Singapore's GDP growth will be slowing down. For\r\nexample, the Minister for Trade and Industry's KPI for all his bonuses\r\ncould be Singapore's wage growth. The Minister for Transport's KPI\r\ncould be tied with the Minister for National Development's KPI to\r\ncontrol population growth and thereby vehicle numbers.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-dc3b2df6-1c6e-4f0a-b035-62c32f5b4651\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-dc3b2df6-1c6e-4f0a-b035-62c32f5b4651\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 974</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fa37063c-1107-4d9e-a460-dbaac58fefd4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-fa37063c-1107-4d9e-a460-dbaac58fefd4\"><!--a--></a>Otherwise, the bonus structure\r\nwill give me discomfort.

He calculated that the figure would be\r\n$50,000 per month, taking into account the mortgage and cost of\r\na bungalow, or whatever residence, the hiring of servants, two cars,\r\nannual holidays and the children's education. This proposal was\r\nalso supported by the then NMP Prof Walter Woon. At today's levels,\r\nthe figure would be about $60,000 per month or $720,000 per year.\r\nThat amount including bonuses would be a good benchmark to prove\r\ntheir worth for a young Minister with a young family.

Pegging the bonus of\r\npolitical office holders to the GDP has its inadequacies as the\r\nimpact of national economic growth may not be equally shared across\r\nthe board. The National Bonus is a more inclusive measure of how\r\neconomic growth impacts Singaporeans, especially low- and middle-income\r\nSingaporeans.

Under the Westminster system, the judiciary,\r\nlegislative and administrative bodies, that is, the government,\r\nare independent of each other. The legislative powers of the Parliament\r\nis the country's highest authority. In other words, motions and\r\npolicies drawn up by Ministers under the administrative body, have\r\nto be discussed and passed by the legislative body \u2013 the Parliament\r\n\u2013 before a decision is made.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b46c665f-622a-4d6b-ab2c-d8bb6362b1c7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b46c665f-622a-4d6b-ab2c-d8bb6362b1c7\"><!--a--></a>We also understand that\r\nMembers of Parliament are representatives voted in by voters of\r\nvarious constituencies. Once given the mandate, we have to be accountable\r\nto the people. The structure of the legislative body of Singapore\r\nis different from that of many countries, we do not have an upper\r\nhouse to act as an additional check and balance. All members of\r\nthe administrative body come from the legislative body. The Ministers\r\nand the Prime Minister becomes a Member of Parliament first, before\r\nbeing made a Minister. Therefore, I believe that our legislative\r\nbody should act as a check and balance against the Government administration.\r\nIn his speech during the 12th Session of Parliament debate on the\r\nPresident's Address, the Prime Minister said that \"the Government\r\nis accountable to the Parliament, we welcome Members of Parliament\r\nto raise any sharp questions, and debate them in Parliament\".</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-30dbb47a-5271-4978-ae48-80da9263b6e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-30dbb47a-5271-4978-ae48-80da9263b6e2\"><!--a--></a>In addition, I feel that\r\nthe transparency of the Government is also important.

This is especially so given\r\nthat the taxpayer pays for the salaries of our political leaders.\r\nTherefore, how much they are paid and the process of how their pay\r\nis determined has to be open, transparent, and accessible to the\r\ngeneral public. Members throughout the course of this debate also\r\nbrought up these principles. Indeed the Committee's report also mentioned\r\non many occasions that transparency and accountability to the public\r\nwas key in their determination of political compensation. This was\r\nalso the guiding principle under which the Committee recommended\r\na clean wage.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-74e13a03-a3ca-4f65-93b9-8e87c6f75434\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-74e13a03-a3ca-4f65-93b9-8e87c6f75434\"><!--a--></a>These principles are in\r\nline with practices common to the dozen countries and territories\r\nin our survey that my colleagues have already mentioned. Only with transparency and meaningful\r\ninformation available can Singaporeans be, and remain, convinced\r\nthat changes to the pay of our political leaders are not undertaken\r\nsolely to advance their material interests, and any changes must\r\nfirst be and always should remain respectful of the costs borne\r\nby taxpayers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 979</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c51a9382-01a1-4bcd-9f3a-203ba096691c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-c51a9382-01a1-4bcd-9f3a-203ba096691c\"><!--a--></a>Therefore, we have three\r\nproposals to ensure that the twin towers of accountability and transparency\r\nare enhanced in the political compensation process. First, we call\r\nfor an independent commission to be appointed each time the Prime\r\nMinister seeks to change the terms by which compensation is determined.\r\nSecond, that the findings of the independent commission be always\r\nmade subject to debate and also approval by the Legislature. Third,\r\na complete list of political salaries should be published on an\r\nannual basis.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ab87fe2d-b195-4813-950c-ad93d231c7db\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-ab87fe2d-b195-4813-950c-ad93d231c7db\"><!--a--></a>Taking each point in turn,\r\nwe note that the Committee has recommended that an independent committee\r\nshould be formed every five years to review the salary framework.\r\nThe Prime Minister would determine the members of the committee.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-52e6593c-aa57-4a9a-a1c7-d4d4711f7e38\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-52e6593c-aa57-4a9a-a1c7-d4d4711f7e38\"><!--a--></a>We would like to see this\r\ntaken one step further.

To respond\r\nto Mr Vikram Nair's point on Workers' Party's contributions to this\r\ndebate, I would like to reiterate that \"all roads lead to Parliament\",\r\nand this is most true here. The principle of Parliament sovereignty\r\nis of utmost importance: the report should be published to Parliament\r\nand thus to the public \u2013 not first for the Prime Minister's eyes only,\r\nand certainly not first to a ruling-party caucus.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8092536f-dfd2-49f3-a9ef-8be92625dce0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8092536f-dfd2-49f3-a9ef-8be92625dce0\"><!--a--></a>The findings of the independent\r\ncommission must each time be subject to debate, modification and\r\napproval by Parliament. As the Committee mentioned a Westminster system,\r\nwe should take a look at some of the systems that evolved from a\r\nWestminster system of Parliament.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd4d7fb8-11fc-46fa-83e1-1bc76a2eb60b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bd4d7fb8-11fc-46fa-83e1-1bc76a2eb60b\"><!--a--></a>In Australia, there is an\r\nindependent Remuneration Tribunal which has three members appointed\r\nby the Governor-General. Its determinations are subject to Parliamentary\r\noversight. In Canada, a commission to review the salaries of Parliamentarians\r\nis formed within two months after each general election. The report\r\nof the Commission must be published within six months of its formation,\r\nand the report must be tabled in Parliament for debate and approval.\r\nFinally, in the UK itself, in response to our Prime Minister, while\r\nit is true that a widespread abuse of expenses by MPs was uncovered\r\nin 2009, like all good leaders, politicians in the UK learnt lessons\r\nand sought to improve. The Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 was\r\npassed by the Westminster Parliament to reform the way MP expenses\r\nwere dealt with, and to increase the transparency and accountability\r\nof the process in order to ensure that such an issue would not recur\r\nin the future. There is also a Senior Salary Review Board, which\r\nis an independent body that advises on the pay and benefits due\r\nto politicians. Because all of this is regulated by statute, Parliament\r\nultimately retains oversight.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 980</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-db18bf31-e23c-407f-bb8a-b8113c2724a5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-db18bf31-e23c-407f-bb8a-b8113c2724a5\"><!--a--></a>We propose that all reports from the committee\r\nshould always be open to public scrutiny via the legislative process.\r\nCitizens can give their thoughts and feedback on it to their MPs,\r\nwho are their elected representatives.

It would also reinforce the\r\nposition of the Legislature as the one of the gatekeepers for the\r\nnation's finances. I would also like to emphasise that seeking public\r\nfeedback before the report is published is not the same as subjecting\r\nthe report to public scrutiny via the legislative process before\r\nit is debated, amended if necessary, and finally approved by Parliament.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c13d19bc-fd19-4390-b755-7b71c8e8c4f4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-c13d19bc-fd19-4390-b755-7b71c8e8c4f4\"><!--a--></a>Finally, I would like to\r\nbring us back to the Committee's proposal that we maintain a \"clean\r\nwage\" for political salaries in Singapore, particularly to ensure\r\ntransparency and accountability to the public.

So, am I right to say that your main quarrel\r\nnow is that over the next five years, the benchmark for the salaries\r\nused by the Committee will rise by 50%, whereas your benchmark will\r\nrise by 41%?

A rise of 50% on the sum of $46,750\r\nwill arrive at $70,125.

I wish to highlight the part that I have the most\r\nconcern with. It is the way Ministers' pay is pegged to the top\r\n1,000 Singapore earners. The Salary Review Committee was given the\r\nterms of reference by the Prime Minister to \"take into account salaries\r\nof comparable jobs in the private sector and also other reference\r\npoints such as the general wage levels in Singapore\".</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f11d6139-903b-44d1-8dea-a233e2c00d56\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f11d6139-903b-44d1-8dea-a233e2c00d56\"><!--a--></a>The assumption this Government\r\nbegan with is that political talent is synonymous with career success;\r\nthat office holders must have comparable pay with top private sector\r\nearners. So the Committee arrived at the median income of the top\r\n1,000 earners, less a 40% discount to \"signify the ethos and sacrifice\r\nthat comes with political service\". It implies that our political\r\noffice holders must come from this pool, or that their ability and\r\njob scope is equivalent to the top 0.06% of the working Singapore\r\npopulation. This sentiment has indeed been expressed by the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and by various Members over the past two days.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a68eac72-1436-4953-8319-81967adb1ee8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-a68eac72-1436-4953-8319-81967adb1ee8\"><!--a--></a>We have constantly used\r\nthis mindset since 1994, when Ministers' pay was first revamped\r\nto tie it to the top earners' in the private sector.

During the debate on the President's\r\nAddress, I had called for political education in schools.

The\r\nreport also recommended a new benchmark with various cuts to the\r\nsalaries of the President, Prime Minister, Ministers, Speaker, Deputy\r\nSpeakers, political appointment holders plus cuts to the MPs' allowances.\r\nThe salary of an entry level Minister was benchmarked to the median\r\nincome of the top 1,000 earners who are Singapore citizens. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b44b15d9-6333-4ffd-944a-65217c3ad631\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b44b15d9-6333-4ffd-944a-65217c3ad631\"><!--a--></a>The first question before\r\nthis House is whether the three principles for determining Ministerial\r\nsalaries are a suitable basis for determining the salaries of our\r\npolitical leaders.

In the debate on civil servants' salary\r\nback in April 2007, I took the position that Singapore should pay\r\nour Ministers and senior civil servants competitively, otherwise\r\nwe risk the situation where you have a poor quality and incompetent\r\ngovernment and possibly corruption.

In other words, we need to strike a fair\r\nbalance such that the Government does not pay million-dollar salaries\r\nto the Ministers, which is politically difficult to accept for any\r\ncitizen.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-76e2aa1d-008c-4a52-9c0b-71207e3c2c63\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-76e2aa1d-008c-4a52-9c0b-71207e3c2c63\"><!--a--></a>Like several other speakers\r\nbefore me, I believe that politics is a calling. It is a calling to\r\nserve the country without the usual motivation of high financial\r\nreturns. It is a calling that requires a person to put the country\r\nabove self. Sir, I agree with the hon. Member for Aljunied GRC,\r\nMr Chen Show Mao, that it is indeed a privilege to be called upon\r\nto serve country. In fact, this point was also raised in the report\r\nof the Committee. I am certain that all Members in this House are\r\nalso serving because they feel the call to serve, the call and the\r\nneed to make positive difference in the lives of fellow Singaporeans\r\nand not that there is a high salary or allowance to be paid to them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-63c33d2e-8ca0-4aa3-bc99-afed20376263\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-63c33d2e-8ca0-4aa3-bc99-afed20376263\"><!--a--></a>I submit that one of the\r\npolitical objectives of any government would be to promote unity\r\nand common bonding amongst its citizens. By paying our political\r\nleaders too high, the Government may inadvertently have caused unhappiness\r\nand division amongst its citizens. So I believe it will be a right\r\nstep for us to consider revision of the salaries so as not to cause\r\ndivision amongst our citizens. For that reason, in 2007, I had expressed\r\nmy reservations about the salary tag of $2.2 million for an entry\r\nlevel, MR4 Ministerial grade. However, even though most of the politicians\r\nin this House have served out of a sense of calling, there is a\r\nneed to balance the need of political office bearer, to provide\r\nfairly and reasonably for his or her family. Like every other Singaporean,\r\nour Ministers, too, owe a responsibility to provide as well as they\r\ncan for their spouse and their children. Thus, we should be mindful\r\nthat we should not ask our Ministers to sacrifice more than what\r\nthe country can afford in terms of Singapore's political objectives. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b4e84b3b-e52b-4dad-bd74-aa578875565b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-b4e84b3b-e52b-4dad-bd74-aa578875565b\"><!--a--></a>This then begs the question\r\n\u2013 what is a fair salary to pay for the political leaders? And like\r\nMs Denise Phua, I think that everyone, everyone of us has an opinion\r\nas to what is a fair salary to be paid to our political leaders.\r\nFrom the many discussions with fellow Singaporeans, I conclude that\r\nmost Singaporeans do not expect our Ministers to be paid too lowly.\r\nFor the heavy responsibilities that Ministers undertake, they do\r\ndeserve a fair and\r\ncompetitive amount of compensation. I feel that it is not in the\r\ninterest of Singapore for our Ministers or office bearers to have\r\nto constantly worry about their family income or the welfare of\r\ntheir family. They should have the freedom to concentrate on their\r\njobs of managing their Ministry and planning for the future of Singapore\r\nwith full assurance that they can provide for their families in\r\nthe same manner as the majority of their contemporaries. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 987</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f72cb2a9-d6a1-49ab-ac20-06ea351fa633\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-f72cb2a9-d6a1-49ab-ac20-06ea351fa633\"><!--a--></a>I think it will be wrong\r\nif our salary formula only allowed those persons who have attained\r\na high degree of success in their career to enter politics.

There are\r\nmany examples in other countries where this has happened.

I believe that if the Workers'\r\nParty look at the calibre of this Cabinet, they will acknowledge\r\nthat this Government does not over-commercialised the running of\r\nthis country.

Whilst\r\neach one of us have our own individual views of the right pay package,\r\nI think that it is wisdom in leaving this issue of compensation\r\npackage of political leaders to the human resource experts in the\r\nfield. We set the basic principles that we believe in and then we\r\nleave it to an independent panel to make the recommendations on\r\nthe correct level to peg the salaries.

I am appreciative that there has been a review.\r\nFor the Government to ignore unhappiness of the voters against the\r\nsalaries of ministers would be insensitive. The fact that this review\r\ntook place is a very strong message that the Government does take\r\ninto account the views of the people. The fact that the Government\r\nis also accepting the recommendation of the independent Committee\r\nis also a right step. There have been substantial cuts to the salaries\r\nof the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers. At the end\r\nof the day, based on the salary of about $55,000 per month for a\r\nMR4 Minister, as a judgement call, I feel this is a reasonable sum\r\nfor the level of responsibilities that a Minister holds. However,\r\nI would urge the Government to find ways to formulate policies that\r\nwill help all Singaporeans improve their lives. I am of the view\r\nthat if every Singaporean is able to say that their life has improved\r\nafter five years, they will not begrudge the salaries payable to\r\nour political leaders.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-03b002ca-c4af-4cd4-b428-0fa90db1f3bb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-03b002ca-c4af-4cd4-b428-0fa90db1f3bb\"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, I ask the question:\r\nshould we peg the salary of an entry grade Minister MR4 to the median\r\nsalary of the top 1,000 earners who are Singaporeans? Or should\r\nwe peg the salary to the median income of the lowest 20% group of\r\nSingaporeans as has been suggested by some parties? I have never\r\nbeen comfortable with a peg to the top earners \u2013 whether it is to\r\nthe top 1,000 earners or bottom group of earners. If you peg the\r\nsalary to the top earners, when these top 1,000 earners earn more,\r\nthen the salary of the political leaders will invariably increase.\r\nThis will again create some degree of unhappiness. As for the peg\r\nto the bottom, the question is how to apply the multiple. The multiple\r\nis really arbitrary and regardless how you see it, it is not realistic.\r\nI would prefer to have a fixed salary without a peg and then make\r\nadjustments for inflation every few years. If there is a mechanism\r\nfor the salary to be reviewed every five years, then perhaps the\r\nGovernment can consider forming an independent committee comprising human\r\nresource experts to review the salaries of political appointment\r\nholders every five years. The salary for the Government would then\r\nbe fixed for that five-year period. Whatever the formula is, I would\r\nsubmit that we should find a formula that will assist Singapore\r\nto find capable and committed leadership over the long term. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6898ce0d-2177-4ba8-9768-7b65418d96ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-6898ce0d-2177-4ba8-9768-7b65418d96ec\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I am in agreement with\r\nthe recommendation to scrap pensions for Ministers. In fact, I would\r\ngo further to ask that we scrap pensions for the civil service as\r\nwell. There is no reason why any member of the civil service should\r\nhave such differential treatment. After this review is passed by\r\nParliament, we may have an absurd situation where our Permanent\r\nSecretaries and other key civil servants are earning more than their\r\nMinisters, will be having their pensions and to add to that, they\r\ntake no political risk. Would we in the future be able to persuade\r\ncapable civil servants to give up their careers to join in the political\r\nservice? Hence, I join Ms Denise Phua to ask the Government to consider\r\nforming an independent committee to assess whether we are pegging\r\nthe salaries of the Administrative Service to the right level. Their\r\nhigh salaries have caused some degree of unhappiness amongst other\r\ncivil servants who are not Administrative Service officers. For\r\nthe sake of the entire civil service, we should review their salary package\r\nas well.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 989</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-db493e12-3128-49a6-b6f9-4199ca0b804e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-db493e12-3128-49a6-b6f9-4199ca0b804e\"><!--a--></a>Sir, it has been said many\r\ntimes that Singapore is an aberration.

It would be risky for any government to\r\nwait for 10, 20 capable and passionate people with integrity to\r\nstep up every five years and say that they would give up their careers,\r\nthey would take major financial sacrifices to serve the people of\r\nSingapore. Sir, having heard the Prime Minister, I understand his\r\nconcerns and the need to find capable, competent men and women of\r\nintegrity for the future of Singapore.

To summarise\r\nwhat happened, in August 2011, the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA)\r\nDNA Profiling Laboratory (DNAPL) discovered that a reagent of higher\r\nthan usual concentration (\"the Reagent\") had been used as part of\r\nthe DNA testing process from October 2010 to August 2011. The key\r\nscientific impact of the Reagent was a marginal reduction in the\r\nsensitivity of the DNA tests when low levels of DNA were being analysed.\r\nThis did not cause any false positive results leading to wrongful\r\nidentification of any person. Re-testing of DNA samples was initiated\r\nas a precautionary measure. For the concluded cases, the Attorney-General's\r\nChambers (AGC)'s assessment is that there were no wrongful convictions\r\ndue to the use of the Reagent. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4a500963-7324-4b61-b38a-c94f7ad8025b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4a500963-7324-4b61-b38a-c94f7ad8025b\"><!--a--></a>Following the discovery\r\nof the incident in August 2011, an inter-Government agency group\r\ncomprising the AGC, the Singapore Police Force (SPF), the Central\r\nNarcotics Bureau (CNB) and HSA was established to assess the impact\r\nof the Reagent on the DNA tests affected. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-94cb3990-f80a-4ca6-89d1-e6935e227d61\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-94cb3990-f80a-4ca6-89d1-e6935e227d61\"><!--a--></a>The scientific impact of\r\nthe incident has been established to be minimal.

The inter-Government agency\r\ngroup studied each and every case which may have been affected by\r\nthe incident and identified cases for re-testing as a precautionary measure.\r\nThe re-tests are expected to be completed in March 2012. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-64e7de14-903a-42e1-a7c7-9ebb37b87813\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-64e7de14-903a-42e1-a7c7-9ebb37b87813\"><!--a--></a>HSA has been open and transparent\r\nand has dealt with the incident in a professional, objective, and\r\ntimely manner.

The Laboratory now no longer prepares the\r\nparticular reagent in house but instead uses a commercially-prepared\r\nreagent which only became available after the affected batch had\r\nbeen prepared. The same approach is also adopted for other steps\r\nin the Laboratory's testing processes where such commercially-prepared\r\nreagents are available. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-618772eb-0edb-4567-963d-fa05663e007b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-618772eb-0edb-4567-963d-fa05663e007b\"><!--a--></a>In addition, reagents are\r\nnow also sent to HSA's Chemical Metrology Laboratory for chemical\r\ncomposition analysis to verify their contents and concentration\r\nprior to use.
