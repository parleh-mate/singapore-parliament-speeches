Members, who know the Promissory Oaths Ordinance, that is Cap. 58 of the Revised\r\n\r\nEdition,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  have seen in that Ordinance the form of  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  oath.  The  Minister's  oath  in   that\r\n\r\nOrdinance is subscribed before the Governor or  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Governor  or the Officer Administering  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Colony of Singapore, and no doubt\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will agree that the form of that oath\r\n\r\nneeds   to  be  corrected  in  the  light  of   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional changes that have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new form of oaths is set out in the Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)  Order  in  Council  in  the   First\r\n\r\nSchedule  to  that  Order in  Council.  It  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  Bill  now  before  the  House  to\r\n\r\nsubstitute this new form of oaths, which  is  shown\r\n\r\nin    the   First   Schedule   of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council, for that  form  of\r\n\r\noaths   which  is  prescribed  under  the  existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance; the Bill sets out to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the promissory oaths\r\n\r\nshall be taken by Parliamentary Secretaries. Now if\r\n\r\nyou will look at the form of oaths that is shown in\r\n\r\nthe  First Schedule to the (Constitution) Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil, you will see quite clearly that oaths  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  taken  by  a  Minister  or  an  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister. In view of that fact, we have also had to\r\n\r\nprovide  in  the Bill before the House  that  these\r\n\r\noaths  in  their present form can also be taken  by\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer Members to the text of the Bill\r\n\r\nitself, particularly to clause 3 of the Bill, where\r\n\r\nit  is  stated that \"The Prime Minister  and  every\r\n\r\nother  Minister  and every Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nshall  before entering on the duties of his  office\r\n\r\ntake  the  Oath  of Allegiance and the  appropriate\r\n\r\noath  for the due execution of his office: \".  Then\r\n\r\nfollows the proviso that \"a Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nwho  has  been  appointed and has  entered  on  the\r\n\r\nduties  of his office before the 15th day of  July,\r\n\r\n1959,  shall  take the Oath of Allegiance  and  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  oath  for  the due  execution  of  his\r\n\r\noffice  as soon as may be after that date.\" It  was\r\n\r\nquite  impossible for the Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nto  take the oath that is shown in the Schedule  to\r\n\r\nthe Order in Council\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\nuntil  the Bill has been introduced to provide  for\r\n\r\nthat,   and   the   Bill  so  provides   for   that\r\n\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to introduce a Bill\r\n\r\nintituled   \"An  Ordinance  to  amend   the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance, 1957 (No. 24 of 1957)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> After the conclusion of the\r\n\r\nproceedings  on  the  Control of  Rent  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I lay upon the\r\n\r\nTable  a Certificate of Urgency signed by the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan   Negara  in  respect   of   the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment (Amendment No. 2) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order.

Regarding  the  criticism   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, I feel that it was not criticism  which\r\n\r\nwas  constructive but quite the reverse. As we  see\r\n\r\nit.  Mr  Speaker,  the  object  of  Government  in\r\n\r\ntransferring the functions of the City Council  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development is mainly  to\r\n\r\nease   the  administration  and  to  enable  better\r\n\r\nservices to be provided for the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yesterday, we heard the Opposition wasting\r\n\r\nour  time  on the talk of whether it was democratic\r\n\r\nor  not of Government to take over the functions of\r\n\r\nthe City Council. I feel that our criticism of this\r\n\r\nmatter   should  be  logical  and  realistic.   The\r\n\r\nOpposition  should understand the whole purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe Government exercise, which is to put it simply,\r\n\r\nto make it easier for the proper implementation and\r\n\r\nalso for the benefit of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, on this side, have explained what\r\n\r\ndifficulties a member of the public has to face  if\r\n\r\nhe  wants to, say, build a house. The complications\r\n\r\ninvolved  are  known  to many. The  Government,  by\r\n\r\ntaking  over  the  functions of the  City  Council,\r\n\r\nhopes  to  remove these difficulties and  hopes  to\r\n\r\nhave  matters affecting the public dealt with  most\r\n\r\nspeedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assured the employees of the City Council\r\n\r\nand the Rural Board that they will not be dismissed\r\n\r\nfrom  service as a result of this take-over.

Mr Speaker, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Farrer   Park  was  also  in  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust and we are now doing the cleaning\r\n\r\nup.  We  have  chosen the S.I.T. building  as  the\r\n\r\nheadquarters   for   the   Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, because we believe that at present  it\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe most filthy and the most corrupt institution in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and we are going there to clean it up as\r\n\r\nexpeditiously as possible. Mr Speaker, the process\r\n\r\nof  cleaning up has started. The S.I.T. building in\r\n\r\nthe  past has been famous or has been notorious for\r\n\r\ntwo  reasons.  One  is that there  have  been  many\r\n\r\nsuicides,  romantic affairs and financial problems.\r\n\r\nThere  have been many suicides from that  building,\r\n\r\nbut  to  the people of Singapore, the famous S.I.T.\r\n\r\nbuilding in Upper Pickering Street is noted not for\r\n\r\nits  suicides but for the filth and the  corruption\r\n\r\nwhich  the small nine-storey building can  contain.\r\n\r\nThe  process of cleaning up the small building  has\r\n\r\nstarted. Immediately I was appointed the Manager of\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T., I called for the file of  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  important persons in the S.I.T. - Mr Firshman.\r\n\r\nHe was-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The  Minister,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   will   have   other   opportunities    of\r\n\r\ncriticising the S.I.T.

As I have  said,\r\n\r\none  person scooted the day his file was asked for.\r\n\r\nHe  knew that the P.A.P. means business and we  are\r\n\r\nconfident,  Mr  Speaker, that the S.I.T. building\r\n\r\nwill not be the last of the P.A.P., or the last  of\r\n\r\nour  Ministry,  as the Member for Farrer  Park  has\r\n\r\nenvisaged, but it will only be one step which  will\r\n\r\nbring   us   further  to  our  goal  of  a   social\r\n\r\nrevolution,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the policy of rationalisation and streamlining of the machinery of government in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been laid down in our policy  speech\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  approved by the electorate on 30th May,  1959.\r\n\r\nMay   I  repeat  here  certain  extracts  from  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s policy statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"One of the important decisions we will take for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the people of Singapore, should the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. be  returned  as  the  government,  is  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  re-organisation of the present unwieldy,\r\n\r\ninefficient,  expensive  and  wasteful  system   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   advantages  of  the  re-organisation  of  the\r\n\r\nadministration of the State of Singapore by  having\r\n\r\nonly  one  Central authority for this Island  State\r\n\r\nare briefly as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Politically, the absorption in the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment of parallel administrations in the\r\n\r\nforms  of  the  City Council  and  the  Rural\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils  designate  covering   the\r\n\r\nwhole  island  makes  for  an  efficient  and\r\n\r\neffective Central Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Administratively, the centralisation of\r\n\r\nState  functions in an island like  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill reduce much red-tape for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  public, and also facilitate the work  of\r\n\r\nnational construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Financially, it will mean the saving of\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars a year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, administratively and financially,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore have  much  to  gain  by\r\n\r\nrationalisation of the organs of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today in this Assembly we are facing similar situations faced by other countries in\r\n\r\nother  parts of Asia, countries which have achieved\r\n\r\nindependence.  In  this country,  Mr  Speaker,  we\r\n\r\nalways  find  that the compradore class  which  the\r\n\r\ncolonial rulers left behind are often more colonial-minded than their colonial masters. They try to ape\r\n\r\ntheir  colonial masters in all their forms  without\r\n\r\nunderstanding  their contents and  their  meanings.\r\n\r\nThey are capable of copying every iota of the forms\r\n\r\npractised   in  British  parliamentary   democratic\r\n\r\ninstitutions  without  understanding  what  is  the\r\n\r\nessence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes wonder, Mr Speaker, whether hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition,  some  of  whom  were\r\n\r\nMembers of the previous Government, understand what\r\n\r\nis meant by democracy. Even an Englishman, a person\r\n\r\nin  the  category  of Mr John Ede  (ex-Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin) and one of the former close colleagues  of\r\n\r\nthe present Member for Farrer Park,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned in this Assembly on 12th December,  1958,\r\n\r\nVol. 3, columns 1227-8 of the Hansard:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We come to the conclusion, as we must, that the\r\n\r\ncost of administration on this small island of  220\r\n\r\nsquare  miles  is  out  of all  proportion  to  the\r\n\r\nreturns  we  get  and  to what  we  can  reasonably\r\n\r\nafford.

Most  of\r\n\r\nus  have  been  brought up to  accept  the  British\r\n\r\npattern    of   central   government   and    local\r\n\r\ngovernment - I have certainly been very close  to  it\r\n\r\nmyself - but it is becoming clear that we must recast\r\n\r\nour  thinking and reshape our ideas, and  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage   to  admit  that  it  is  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nsatisfactory on a small island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He quoted examples -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The boundary between the City and District\r\n\r\nCouncils  for  many miles runs down the  middle  of\r\n\r\nroads, Braddell Road for example.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Ede  was trying to explain to Members  of  the House how much red-tape meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The City Council may want to resurface and widen\r\n\r\ntheir  half  of  the  road, even  to  make  a  dual\r\n\r\ncarriage-way, but the District Council, which  will\r\n\r\nbe responsible for the other half of the road,\" -\r\n\r\n<br><br>the other half of the road-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"may have other ideas.

There  are   two\r\n\r\nassessment offices and two policies.

Members of this House\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  to scrap the City  Council  or  to\r\n\r\nabsorb the City Council into the central Government\r\n\r\nwould  mean  less  chance  of  a  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  because  the  Federation   has   local\r\n\r\ngovernment.   To  a  mind  like  mine,   I   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand what logic it has - that merger is related\r\n\r\nto  the  existence of local government authorities.\r\n\r\nBut  since  certain hon. Members are interested  in\r\n\r\nmentioning  the Federation, let us show  them  what\r\n\r\nMr Ede mentioned in his debate on the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween rationalisation of the Government machinery\r\n\r\nin Singapore and merger with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If we show to the Federation and to our\r\n\r\nneighbours  and to the world that we  are  bent  on\r\n\r\nputting our administrative house in order, reducing\r\n\r\nour  overheads  and  lowering our  expenditure,  we\r\n\r\nshould attract both the Federation and the world to\r\n\r\nour  doorstep.  Indeed, eventual  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation will be easier if we have one  clear-cut\r\n\r\nadministrative body from which certain subjects can\r\n\r\ngo  under  central  control  with  the  minimum  of\r\n\r\nreorganisation.  We  shall  appeal  more   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation if we are a financial asset, and  not  a\r\n\r\nliability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is to show that often we find in countries which have attained independence that\r\n\r\nthe  compradore  class which the  colonial  masters\r\n\r\nleft   behind  have  only  learned  the  forms   of\r\n\r\ndemocratic   parliamentary   institutions   without\r\n\r\nunderstanding their contents and their meanings. We\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  cannot afford the luxuries  of  this\r\n\r\nlavish   copying  of  the  outward  forms  of   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system. To our people at large  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  large masses, democracy means how fast we  can\r\n\r\ndeliver  the  goods,  and how  much  goods  we  can\r\n\r\ndeliver. It does not mean, as the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark   said,  how  many  political  groups   should\r\n\r\nadminister  the state of affairs at the same  time.\r\n\r\nThat  was  the  situation during his ten  years  of\r\n\r\noffice  in  the City Council. We had  the  colonial\r\n\r\ngroup  represented  by the President.  We  had  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party group, we had the Labour  Front;\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad a group of Independents. That is the system  of\r\n\r\nadministration  which has produced  scandals,  like\r\n\r\nthe leaks in the Murnane Reservoir which at present\r\n\r\ncannot  be used; the Odeon-Katong cinema;  and  the\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars  spent on  the  Tebrau  River\r\n\r\nscheme where six sets of machinery were bought  but\r\n\r\none  only was used during the past five years,  the\r\n\r\nother live sets being thrown into the dust to rust.\r\n\r\nAnd  scandals  over the Victoria Memorial  Theatre,\r\n\r\nand   many   other  scandals  which  we   have   no\r\n\r\nopportunity to reveal, because on the positive side\r\n\r\nwe  are  spending our time in doing  work  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, that is the system of\r\n\r\nGovernment which the Member for Farrer Park and his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  would  like to  see  continue  in  this\r\n\r\nisland - a system of Government where there are  very\r\n\r\nmany  different  competing political  groups  whose\r\n\r\nbasic  fundamentals are the same but whose personal\r\n\r\ninterests  are conflicting - where many shady  things\r\n\r\nhappen  and where we cannot pin down responsibility\r\n\r\non any person or whoever he may be, a Councillor, a\r\n\r\nmember  of the staff, or of a political party.  The\r\n\r\nprevious  Government did not want to  fight  vested\r\n\r\ninterests  because  they  were  afraid  of   vested\r\n\r\ninterests,  or  because they were  linked  up  with\r\n\r\nvested  interests, I will just quote an example  of\r\n\r\nhow,  under  the  old regime, a  person  could  get\r\n\r\nthings  done  or could not get things done.  For  a\r\n\r\nvillage  in the rural area to get a standpipe,  the\r\n\r\nheadman  must first write to the Rural  Development\r\n\r\nCommission,  which is under the direct jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof  the  Chief  Minister, the  present  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  The Chief Minister will  write  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  of  the Local Government, perhaps,  who  in\r\n\r\nturn writes to the Rural Board, and which might  in\r\n\r\nturn  write to the District Council, which in  turn\r\n\r\nwrite  to  the City Council, perhaps,  through  the\r\n\r\nauspices  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government.\r\n\r\nHundreds  of  memos  would have  been  sent  around\r\n\r\nasking  for  a  standpipe  to  be  erected  in  the\r\n\r\nvillage. The people in the kampong cannot wait  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers and their Permanent Secretaries and\r\n\r\nthe  Heads  of  Departments  wasting  time  on  the\r\n\r\nmemoranda for their needy water supply. Now, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  is  that the way whereby the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer   Park   wishes   democracy   practised   in\r\n\r\nSingapore - checks and counter-checks? You check  and\r\n\r\ncounter-check  to  make  sure  that  the  money  is\r\n\r\nproperly  spent, and let the poor farmers wait  for\r\n\r\nmany years before they get their water supply.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  if it is with honest intentions that  the\r\n\r\nmoney  should be properly spent - well and good!  But\r\n\r\nfrom  my  experience  in these  few  weeks  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development, I have seen, from\r\n\r\nrecords.   Ministers  and  Heads   of   Departments\r\n\r\nspending  thousands of dollars in salaries  dealing\r\n\r\nwith matters of difference which were not more than\r\n\r\n$5 or $10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has also asked me a\r\n\r\nquestion - Is  the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\ngoing  to  issue  hawkers'  licences  himself?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Minister for National Development  has\r\n\r\nno  personal  ambition to distribute  or  to  issue\r\n\r\nhawkers'   licences  himself,  nor  taxi   drivers'\r\n\r\nlicences,  nor  trishaw riders' licences,  nor  any\r\n\r\nform  of  licences. We believe in organisation,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  in building up an honest, efficient  civil\r\n\r\nservice whereby the Minister himself does not  have\r\n\r\nto  issue  licences.  The Member  for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nperhaps  wishes to see us carry on with the  method\r\n\r\nof  issuing licences which he himself had practised\r\n\r\nin  the City Council. Before we went into the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  in  December  1957,  it  was  the  general\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  hawkers  that,  in  order   to   get\r\n\r\nlicences,  the  applicant must  get  the  requisite\r\n\r\nnumber  of  bottles of \"TST\" brandy, the  requisite\r\n\r\nnumber  of katties of oranges and tins of biscuits,\r\n\r\nand  send them to the person concerned in order  to\r\n\r\nget a licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, we do not believe in\r\n\r\nCouncillors   and   Ministers  themselves   issuing\r\n\r\nlicences.  We  believe in evolving and  training  a\r\n\r\ncompetent, honest and efficient civil  service  to\r\n\r\nissue the licences, and the Ministers will just  do\r\n\r\nthe  check  and counter-check.

There are hundreds of families  of  farmers\r\n\r\nwho  have  paid their rents sometimes  for  two  or\r\n\r\nthree generations. These building societies, or  in\r\n\r\nsome  eases unscrupulous persons, buy over the land\r\n\r\nat an average of a few hundred dollars an acre, and\r\n\r\nget  the  S.I.T. and the City Council  to  approve\r\n\r\ntheir  building plans. So long as the plans are  in\r\n\r\norder, the S.I.T. and the City Council will have to\r\n\r\npass them. These unscrupulous contractors will take\r\n\r\nsuch  building  plans, engage lawyers,  go  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt and seek the eviction of the farmers who,  in\r\n\r\ncertain cases, to my personal knowledge, have  been\r\n\r\nstaying  on  the  land as legal tenants  for  three\r\n\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of eviction, no compensation is\r\n\r\never   given.   Neither  is   there   the   humane\r\n\r\nconsideration  to provide alternative  sites.  When\r\n\r\nthe Government evicts people from the land in order\r\n\r\nto  develop the land for the benefit of the  nation\r\n\r\nand  the  public at large, compensation is normally\r\n\r\ngiven,  and  more often suitable alternative  sites\r\n\r\nare  offered. But this is not the case with  these\r\n\r\nunscrupulous societies and other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, it is the intention of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  introduce  at  an  early  date  new\r\n\r\nlegislation to assist farmers and householders, but\r\n\r\ndefinitely not illegal squatters of land. The  idea\r\n\r\nof the new legislation is to assist legal farmers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nand  legal householders to obtain compensation,  or\r\n\r\nthe  offer  of  a suitable alternative  site,  when\r\n\r\nevicted    from   land   required   for   so-called\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes. Pending the introduction  of\r\n\r\nsuch  legislation  which will  take  some  time  to\r\n\r\ndraft, it is considered necessary and desirable  to\r\n\r\nmake  temporary provisions to suspend for a  period\r\n\r\nof six months paragraphs (i) and (k) of section 15,\r\n\r\nsubsection (1) of the Control of Rent Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill is a short and simple one. Sub-clause (2) of clause 1 provides for the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to remain in force for a period  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths only. Clause 3 provides for the deletion  of\r\n\r\nparagraphs  (i)  and (k) of section 15,  subsection\r\n\r\n(1) . In other words, these two paragraphs will have\r\n\r\nno  effect  for  six  months.

Most of these unauthorised houses are being\r\n\r\nbuilt  by  unscrupulous building  contractors,  who\r\n\r\nbuild  them at a cost of $1,000 to $1,500 each  and\r\n\r\nsell  them at a price of about $4,000 each. In some\r\n\r\nof  these  cases,  permission  from  the  landlord,\r\n\r\nwhether it is private land or State land, has never\r\n\r\nbeen   obtained   and   the   purchaser   of   such\r\n\r\nunauthorised  structure finds  himself  or  herself\r\n\r\novernight  that  he or she is in possession  of  an\r\n\r\nillegal hut, squatting on land to which he  or  she\r\n\r\nhas  no title. Eventually, the hut will have to  be\r\n\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present procedure dealing with unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures requires the City Council or  the  local\r\n\r\nauthority  first  to serve a notice  on  the  owner\r\n\r\nrequiring him to demolish an unauthorised building,\r\n\r\nand if he does not do so, a summons has to be taken\r\n\r\nout  in  the  Court.  Eventually,  by  the  time  a\r\n\r\nmandatory order for eviction is obtained  from  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court,  several  months  would   have\r\n\r\nlapsed, by which time the building would have  been\r\n\r\noccupied  and  action  to  demolish  would   result\r\n\r\nnormally in great hardships to the occupiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These unauthorised structures do not conform to\r\n\r\nany  standards of hygiene, health requirements  and\r\n\r\nfire  hazard  requirements. They are  built  mostly\r\n\r\nfrom flimsy materials, from timber and planks which\r\n\r\nthe  timber mills are not able to sell in the  open\r\n\r\nmarket, and which are sold to them on credit  at  a\r\n\r\nvery  low cost. They are very serious fire hazards.\r\n\r\nIn  most  cases the building of these  unauthorised\r\n\r\nhuts  is  undertaken  in  conjunction  with  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties.  It is known that during  the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths, most of the racketeers have been backed  by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous politicians and secret societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments now proposed will enable immediate\r\n\r\naction to be taken against unauthorised structures,\r\n\r\nby  imposing a daily fine of $50 against  offenders\r\n\r\nas  well  as permitting a local authority to  enter\r\n\r\nthe  premises to demolish as well as to execute any\r\n\r\nwork  ordered by the Court. Further, a penalty  is\r\n\r\nnow laid down for anyone who sells\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor enters into an agreement to sell an unauthorised\r\n\r\nbuilding. In such a case, the offender is liable to\r\n\r\na  term of imprisonment of not less than six months\r\n\r\nor  more  than a year, and in addition a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding   $5,000.  Any  person  who   erects   an\r\n\r\nunauthorised building and sells it subsequently, is\r\n\r\nliable  also to the same imprisonment and fine.  In\r\n\r\naddition, the injured party, that is the purchaser,\r\n\r\nmay be given a refund of the purchase money as well\r\n\r\nas compensation, if so ordered by the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been provided in the new section 170A that\r\n\r\nin any prosecution under this section, the sanction\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister shall be required and  there  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the safeguard that every case  will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  and only the racketeer will be  charged\r\n\r\nin Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to make an\r\n\r\namendment  to  section  117  of  the  Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nrequire  a  person who is aggrieved  by  an  annual\r\n\r\nvalue  fixed on his property to pay the  assessment\r\n\r\ndue  before  his appeal can be dealt with  by  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court. This provision existed in the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  but was inadvertently omitted  from  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government Ordinance and,  because  of  this\r\n\r\nomission,  the  City  Council  has  reported   that\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars  are  being  tied   up   with\r\n\r\nconsequential loss of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, there are two important\r\n\r\namendments in this Bill before the House. One is to\r\n\r\ntake   strong   and   firm   action - merciless   and\r\n\r\nunequivocal action - against the building  racketeers\r\n\r\nwho have built houses in the past and who are still\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses.  These are the  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nmainly  responsible  for such  disasters  like  the\r\n\r\nLorong 3 fire and the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is to bring the process of\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the High Court in assessment  cases  in\r\n\r\nline  with appeals to the High Court on income  tax\r\n\r\ncases.  A person who is aggrieved in his assessment\r\n\r\nshould pay, first of all, the assessment before  he\r\n\r\ncan lodge his appeal to the High Court, because  we\r\n\r\nhave  found from our fifteen months' experience  in\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  that it is  cheaper  for  every\r\n\r\nproperty  owner  to  lodge an appeal  to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt, whether he or she is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naggrieved  or  not aggrieved. Thus  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney he can earn from interest rates is much  more\r\n\r\nthan he would have to pay to his lawyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no objection\r\n\r\nto  the  policy of this Bill, if it is used  mainly\r\n\r\nagainst  racketeers.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nshould   consider  the  views  of  the  population,\r\n\r\nespecially in the rural areas where about 6,000  to\r\n\r\n7,000  houses have been erected and which could  be\r\n\r\nclassified, according to this Bill, as  illegal.  I\r\n\r\nwould  advise the Government to follow the practice\r\n\r\nof  the  City  Council and the previous  Government\r\n\r\nwhereby  owners whose houses are a year old  should\r\n\r\nnot  be touched but should be given the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  get numbers for their houses so that they could\r\n\r\nbe properly assessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to implement this new law, the Government should look at it from the financial\r\n\r\npoint of view as well, as has been explained by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. From that point of  view,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government itself could not erect houses\r\n\r\nfor   the  benefit  of  the  whole  population   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  when we see that annually no  less  than\r\n\r\n40,000   children   are  born.  This   means   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  will have to build no less  than  8,000\r\n\r\nhouses annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are my views for the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider. I repeat once again that I agree with the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  this  Bill if its main  purpose  is  to\r\n\r\ncombat  those  racketeers  who  erect  houses   for\r\n\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in clause 3 (1), on page 1, lines 15 to 17 are\r\n\r\nthe  words \"is about to be erected or is in  course\r\n\r\nof  erection\".  Again in clause 3 (2)  on  page  2,\r\n\r\nlines 5 and 6 are the words \"is being erected or is\r\n\r\nabout  to  be  erected\". Then  in  the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement, it is stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...it is desirable that the local authorities\r\n\r\nshould   be  enabled  to  control  effectively   or\r\n\r\ndemolish speedily all unauthorised buildings...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  this  word  \"all\" applies to  the  category  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  specified in the Bill, then  I  for  one\r\n\r\nheartily support it because lawbreakers should  not\r\n\r\nbe  condoned. Unauthorised houses which do not meet\r\n\r\nthe  minimum requirements of the Government are  or\r\n\r\nwill  be  in future a menace to health and  safety.\r\n\r\nBut  if  this word \"all\" literally means \"all\"  and\r\n\r\nincludes those houses that have been built, let  us\r\n\r\nsay,  a  couple of years ago, then I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  this. When the P.A.P. won the majority in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, they had the reputation of  being  a\r\n\r\nParty  that  worked for the poor. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nrefer you again to the Explanatory Statement,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich goes on to explain that this Bill is intended\r\n\r\n\"to prevent innocent people from being victimised\".\r\n\r\nSir,  there  are  people already victimised.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid, when the P.A.P. won the majority in the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil because of their reputation of helping  the\r\n\r\npoor  and  working for the poor, there was  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong  rumour  that if the poor  people  tried  to\r\n\r\nimprove   themselves   by   building   houses   for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  the  P.A.P.  City  Council  would  not\r\n\r\nprosecute them. I am not condoning the ignorance of\r\n\r\nthe  illiterate, but because they were ignorant and\r\n\r\nbecause they were illiterate they depended on  this\r\n\r\nrumour and many of them built houses for themselves\r\n\r\nat that time. I am not referring to those that have\r\n\r\njust  sprung up. At that time, there were many  who\r\n\r\nbuilt their houses because they were confident  and\r\n\r\nhad  faith that the P.A.P. was going to support the\r\n\r\npoor  and  would  help them. What is  their  plight\r\n\r\ntoday? If the word \"all\" literally means \"all\", and\r\n\r\nthose who have been victimised either by purchasing\r\n\r\nthese  houses  from unscrupulous  opportunists  or,\r\n\r\nhaving  depended on those rumours and having  faith\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P., have built those houses and lived in\r\n\r\nthem  for  a couple of years, and today  find  that\r\n\r\nthey will he thrown out in the streets if this Bill\r\n\r\nis  passed - many of them with 8 or 10  children  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  them  with fathers and grand-fathers  and\r\n\r\nwhat have you to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  family  of  16 to 20 - what will be their  plight?\r\n\r\nThey have been victimised by the opportunists.  Are\r\n\r\nthey  now  going  to suffer at  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  If  the Government  lives  up  to  its\r\n\r\npromise  to  prevent  innocent  people  from  being\r\n\r\nvictimised,  I  think  the word  \"all\"  should  not\r\n\r\ninclude the category I have described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara and also in the manifesto of the P.A.P. \"The\r\n\r\nTasks Ahead\", it is promised that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government is pledged to make an all-out\r\n\r\neffort to ease the housing problem,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the Government will ensure that the welfare and\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  rural  dwellers  are  adequately\r\n\r\nlooked after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided not to raise any objection and not\r\n\r\nto  make any amendment because I am very much aware\r\n\r\nof  the  8  against  43, but I  do  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  based  on  their  pledges  and   their\r\n\r\nassurances  to the illiterate and to  the  ignorant\r\n\r\nwho  had  unknowingly  placed  themselves  in  this\r\n\r\nplight,  that  the  word \"all\" should  not  include\r\n\r\nthose who have already been victimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, referring to this Bill just now,  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  opposite made certain comments  which\r\n\r\nindicated her attitude towards it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about this Bill, I want to say a few\r\n\r\nwords.  The  previous Government, in  demonstrating\r\n\r\ntheir  functions,  pretended to be  merciful.  They\r\n\r\nthought that we are too radical. If we analyse  the\r\n\r\nposition  very carefully, I feel that the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  was without plan or organisation.  They\r\n\r\nleft  us a lot of bitterness to face and to  solve.\r\n\r\nThey  should realise that the P.A.P. policy  is  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a socialistic society. If we  want  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a  just  society for the people,  we  must\r\n\r\nstart  doing  so  from now. We must  not  make  our\r\n\r\nyounger generation face the conditions of living in\r\n\r\nattap houses. We do not want our Government in  the\r\n\r\nfuture to demolish these houses. I think this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  correct, because you can realise at present and\r\n\r\nalso previously in Singapore there have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen many unscrupulous contractors. They will seize\r\n\r\nevery  opportunity  to make a profit  out  of  this\r\n\r\nbusiness.  What  have we seen? We  have  seen  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  an increased number of persons who  have\r\n\r\nbeen victimised by these racketeers. Since this  is\r\n\r\nso,  then  we  will  see that there  will  be  more\r\n\r\ndrastic  and  stronger action against them,  if  we\r\n\r\nreally  want to improve the conditions of work  and\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple case can be taken. At present there is\r\n\r\nno  Ordinance  whereby action can be taken  against\r\n\r\nthe  racketeers in this island. They  do  not  care\r\n\r\nabout  the dangers placed on a person who  want  to\r\n\r\nrent a house from them. They also do not care how a\r\n\r\nperson  will  fare on a rainy day. He can  stay  in\r\n\r\nthis  house  for one or two months, but what  about\r\n\r\none  or  two years? Can the house stand for one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  years?  The  dweller will thus  be  victimised\r\n\r\nliving  under such a roof. Therefore, I think  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  really  a  good Bill.  It  can  help  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to improve the present situation.  Such\r\n\r\nis   the  situation  created  by  the  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nracketeers who are engaged in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who think we are crude. I\r\n\r\nhave  received complaints from many people  because\r\n\r\ntheir  houses  were demolished. But I would  rather\r\n\r\naccept  their  complaints  today  than  see   their\r\n\r\ngenerations  forever living in those illegal  attap\r\n\r\nhuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

It is,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, by virtue of this section 170 that the\r\n\r\nlocal  authority, wherever it may be  situate,  has\r\n\r\npower   to   take   action   against   unauthorised\r\n\r\nbuildings,  be  they about to be commenced,  or  in\r\n\r\ncourse of construction, or be they completed and in\r\n\r\noccupation.  What this Bill seeks to  enact  is  to\r\n\r\ntake  away  completely  the present  provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  170 and to enact in substitution  therefor\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  clause  170. It  seems  to  me,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - perhaps the Hon. the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplain - that   under   the  proposed   new   clause\r\n\r\nunauthorised  buildings  have  been  restricted  in\r\n\r\nscope to those which are about to be erected or  in\r\n\r\nthe  course of erection. It seems to have left  out\r\n\r\nof  the  category  of unauthorised erections  those\r\n\r\nbuildings  which  have been completed  and  are  in\r\n\r\noccupation.   Whether  it  is  the   intention   of\r\n\r\nGovernment to do this, it is not for me to say  but\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister himself. It would appear from his\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement that he hopes, by the  repeal\r\n\r\nand by the re-enactment of the proposed clause 170,\r\n\r\nto take in all unauthorised buildings. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nmay I with respect suggest to the Hon. the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  his proposed enactment does not achieve  that\r\n\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, there\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  some  ambiguity  or  a  conflict  of\r\n\r\nintentions  as indicated by the terms of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nand the Explanatory Statement. I believe, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe  on  this  side of the House are  in  favour  of\r\n\r\nanything to prevent the exploitation of the poor by\r\n\r\nthe  building  of unauthorised houses  and  selling\r\n\r\nthem  to the victims. If that is to be made  clear,\r\n\r\nSir,  then  that  Explanatory  Statement  must   be\r\n\r\namended.

If we continue  to\r\n\r\nsearch  their minds, we know they do  not  work  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the poor people or speak for  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople.  We  know  before  that  there  were   many\r\n\r\nunauthorised  contractors.  They  built  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunauthorised houses and within a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweek they sold all these houses to the poor people.\r\n\r\nThey  could earn a lot of money, and the poor  were\r\n\r\nvictimised.  We  know  the victims  were  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople.  Not only this, these houses are insanitary\r\n\r\nand  are  dangerous because they catch fire easily.\r\n\r\nThese houses are unauthorised, insanitary, and very\r\n\r\nbad for the poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are going to amend this Ordinance. The\r\n\r\nintention is to protect the poor and not to protect\r\n\r\nthe   capitalists  or  the  racketeers.  Today  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  speak again for the people, but  really\r\n\r\nthey  do not. The contractors, within a year, built\r\n\r\nmany  houses and paid only one assessment for  all.\r\n\r\nHow  could  they build so many houses? Because  the\r\n\r\nofficers   of  the  previous  Government  intrigued\r\n\r\ntogether.  Now, in order to avoid future happenings\r\n\r\nof  this  kind by the racketeers, we have  proposed\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  Therefore, I agree with the Government\r\n\r\nin proposing this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, what some Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  said just now showed that at present  they\r\n\r\nrealised  that  the building of these  unauthorised\r\n\r\nhouses  had developed into a serious situation.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  we also know from their  speeches\r\n\r\nthat  the past Government had failed completely  in\r\n\r\nsolving  the  problems of housing for  the  people.\r\n\r\nAccording  to a speech of the Opposition,  if  they\r\n\r\nknow  that  unauthorised houses are  illegal,  they\r\n\r\nshould  uphold  our  Bill.

Why should they wait until  we\r\n\r\nare  in  the government and then say they  too  are\r\n\r\nagainst the racketeers? From this, we can see  that\r\n\r\nthat is hypocrisy.

I feel,  from  the\r\n\r\nexplanation  given  by  the ex-Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands  and  Housing,  that  there  are\r\n\r\nthousands of illegal houses erected in Singapore. I\r\n\r\ndare say that if those people were affected by this\r\n\r\nBill,  they  had been the victims of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment which had purposely kept quiet regarding\r\n\r\nthis  matter. Personally, I feel that the existence\r\n\r\nof   these  illegal  houses  was  because  of  many\r\n\r\nreasons.  First, it is because of the  weakness  of\r\n\r\nthe   previous  Government  in  controlling   their\r\n\r\nofficers   from  corruption  and  activities.   For\r\n\r\nexample, when a person asked for a licence to erect\r\n\r\na  house, there were officers who delayed this  for\r\n\r\nmonths  and  for years. This not only  happened  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but also in the Southern Islands  when  I\r\n\r\nvisited the islands a few weeks ago. This delay was\r\n\r\ndue  to the delay in giving corruption money to the\r\n\r\nofficers. If money was paid early, the permit would\r\n\r\ncome  out early. But those who could not afford  to\r\n\r\ngive  money and who did not want to give  money  to\r\n\r\nthose  said officers, were forced to erect  illegal\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai said earlier that\r\n\r\nthere   were   thousands  of  illegal   houses   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This means that the previous Government\r\n\r\nknew   of  the  existence  of  illegal  houses   in\r\n\r\nSingapore before. But they did not take any action,\r\n\r\nbecause  there were certain people in the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  who, because they had to protect  their\r\n\r\nown  political interest, just kept quiet though the\r\n\r\noffence was clear before their eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to say that if we do not take positive action in this matter, I feel\r\n\r\nthat there would be many more illegal houses, which\r\n\r\nhaving  just  been  erected, they  would  say  were\r\n\r\nerected a long time ago. For example, I was told by\r\n\r\nmy  friends who had observed the erection of  these\r\n\r\nillegal  houses that they would get their materials\r\n\r\nready  at the places; they got ready the roofs  and\r\n\r\nwalls  and  everything, and when the sun set  about\r\n\r\nten  of  them would work to erect the houses  which\r\n\r\nwould be completed in a matter of a few hours,  and\r\n\r\nthat very night they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoved  in  with their children. By tomorrow  a  new\r\n\r\nhouse would be seen in that area. When the officers\r\n\r\ncame  to examine, they would say that these  houses\r\n\r\nhad been erected many years ago, and that they were\r\n\r\njust doing the renovations to the houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to create a Singapore that is\r\n\r\npeaceful,  happy  and just, we  may  be  forced  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  laws which in the beginning  would  seem\r\n\r\ndrastic. For example, take a small child who has  a\r\n\r\nboil.  If the father were afraid to operate on  the\r\n\r\nboil for fear of the child crying, then I feel  the\r\n\r\nchild would get worse. What he should do is to  cut\r\n\r\nout  the  boil and allow the pus to come out.  When\r\n\r\nthe child got well, he would think how lucky he was\r\n\r\nthat his father had cut out the boil, for otherwise\r\n\r\nhe would have lost the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, regarding this\r\n\r\nBill concerning unauthorised houses in Singapore, a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Opposition Members have stated  clearly\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not  opposing  this  Bill  in  its\r\n\r\nentirety.  It seems to me that a number  of  people\r\n\r\nwho  have spoken from the Government side are still\r\n\r\nbringing  up the old story of what had happened  in\r\n\r\nthe  past. I said yesterday that we are now  facing\r\n\r\nthe period in front of us. We should face this with\r\n\r\nfull realisation, a full sense of responsibility of\r\n\r\nbuilding  this  Singapore  and  to  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nGovernment in Singapore that is strong and just. We\r\n\r\nshould   accept  views  that  are   meant   to   be\r\n\r\nconstructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning houses that have already been erected,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a problem which is affected by  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhen it is enacted. For instance, we know that most\r\n\r\nof  the houses which have been erected are most  of\r\n\r\nthem  huts or terrace houses with a number of rooms\r\n\r\nwhich have no numbers and are rented out to various\r\n\r\nfamilies. We know the mistake. But this is a matter\r\n\r\nthat  has happened and it is a matter that we  must\r\n\r\nface,  and if we take the action to demolish  these\r\n\r\nhouses,  it  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to place these people in areas which are\r\n\r\nsafe. So we hope that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if they must take action,  the  action\r\n\r\nwill  be  just,  and without favour to  any  Party.\r\n\r\nWherever the houses are found to be erected the law\r\n\r\nshould  apply.  To  those  who  are  renting  these\r\n\r\nhouses,  they must be given an assurance that  they\r\n\r\nwould get proper treatment from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, it seems there\r\n\r\nhave  been  a  lot of misunderstanding or  possibly\r\n\r\ndistortions in the purpose of this Bill.  The  main\r\n\r\npurpose of this Bill is to declare open war on the building racketeers. It has nothing to do with  the\r\n\r\nhouses  which have been built by farmers  or  other\r\n\r\npersons who are in need of homes due to the  short-sighted and wrong policy of previous Governments in\r\n\r\nnot   building  enough  S.I.T. houses  for   their\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 170 (1), as amended, says, clearly that\r\n\r\n\"Where the Minister is satisfied that a building is\r\n\r\nabout  to  be erected or is in course of erection\".\r\n\r\nThat  is the main purpose of the Bill. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the ineptitude of past administrations\r\n\r\nand  because perhaps of the recent events so-called\r\n\r\npoliticians  have  contacts  with  these   building\r\n\r\nracketeers.  Past  Governments had  never  taken  a\r\n\r\nstand  against these building racketeers,  although\r\n\r\nthe  erstwhile colleague of the Member for Tanglin,\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Koon  Teck, had always repeated  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the Government should  take  strong\r\n\r\naction against unauthorised structures. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  ineptitude of past Governments, we have in the\r\n\r\npast year a big fire in Kampong Tiong Bahru; a  big\r\n\r\nfire  in  Lorong 3, Geylang; and in  the  past  two\r\n\r\nmonths  another  big fire in Kampong  Tiong  Bahru.\r\n\r\nThree weeks ago, another big fire nearly broke  out\r\n\r\nnear  the  Kallang Gasworks. On Sunday  last,  many\r\n\r\npersons came to see me from Kampong Amber which the\r\n\r\nMember  for Mountbatten represents. They were  very\r\n\r\nafraid  because in the past few weeks six cases  of\r\n\r\nfire  have  broken out. I am sure  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten realises the position of the Government\r\n\r\nif Kampong Amber is burnt out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is not to take action\r\n\r\nagainst  the  existing structures which  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  Kampong  Amber. It  is  to  take  action\r\n\r\nagainst  new  unauthorised  structures.  The  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ordinance in itself will be  sufficient\r\n\r\nto  deal  with those structures which have existed.\r\n\r\nThey  will  go with the normal process of  the  old\r\n\r\nlaws. As I have said just now, the purpose of  this\r\n\r\namendment of section 170 is to declare open war  on\r\n\r\nthe  building racketeers and we are very  confident\r\n\r\nthat  from now onwards, when this Bill becomes law,\r\n\r\nno   more  such  racketeers  will  ever  exist   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  will have  to  close  down  their\r\n\r\nbusiness and perhaps, because of that, many persons\r\n\r\nwill  have  their incomes decreased. The  penalties\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  enforced  against  these  building\r\n\r\nracketeers will be very substantial and very  high.\r\n\r\nOn  conviction they might have to pay  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $50 a day for every house they build.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we have this Bill, or if the previous Government had got the courage to enact\r\n\r\nsuch  a  Bill, today there would not be 300 to  500\r\n\r\nhouses in the course of being erected - some of  them\r\n\r\nhave been built in Geylang. They would have to  pay\r\n\r\n$15,000  to $20,000 a day for the houses  they  are\r\n\r\nbuilding, and on top of that they might have to  go\r\n\r\nto  prison for a minimum period of six months or  a\r\n\r\nmaximum period of 12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we believe that fines are not sufficient for the building racketeers, who are in\r\n\r\ngeneral  being backed by secret societies. We  feel\r\n\r\nthat   the  most  important  weapon  against  these\r\n\r\nbuilding racketeers is to put them in jail  and  to\r\n\r\nfix  a  minimum period during which they will  have\r\n\r\nfree  food  and rice and accommodation supplied  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if previous administrations had been more far-sighted or had worked harder or had\r\n\r\nreduced  inefficiency and corruption,  thus  making\r\n\r\nmore  money for the purpose of building more S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouses,  we would not have been saddled today  with\r\n\r\nthis problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof dealing with unauthorised structures on the one\r\n\r\nhand, and trying to build more houses on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government understands that to stamp\r\n\r\nout  these  building racketeers is not  enough,  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  a  market  exists for these  unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures;  and  so  long as  there  are  innocent\r\n\r\nvictims, these racketeers could still flourish.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that, on the more positive side, we  could\r\n\r\nincrease the building of S.I.T. houses which in the\r\n\r\npast  10  years  has been at a very shamefully  low\r\n\r\nfigure.  The fundamental and lasting remedy against\r\n\r\nunauthorised structures is to build more S.I.T. low-cost  houses.  The  previous  Governments  and  the\r\n\r\nprevious  S.I.T. had never tried to build  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing and in great quantities because if they did\r\n\r\nso,  the possibility of corruption would have  been\r\n\r\nreduced. We are determined to remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Eng Guan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hon.

Be\r\n\r\nthat  as  it  may, I have no quarrel with  the  sum\r\n\r\ninvolved, but the Hon. the Minister for Law did say\r\n\r\nthat  this salary is fixed in relation to the  very\r\n\r\nhigh  office  that this person holds by  being  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General.

In this, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I was the last of the British Governors of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is not as Governor and Commander-in-Chief that I deliver this address on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nfirst   elected   Government  of  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, precisely in those few sentences the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has very neatly summed up the change\r\n\r\nof conditions - the change from 1955 to 1959. In 1955\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party contested  the  General\r\n\r\nElections. But it was never our intention  at  that\r\n\r\ntime that we should be returned with a majority  to\r\n\r\nform a government under the Rendel Constitution. We\r\n\r\nknew  precisely  what  were the  pitfalls  and  the\r\n\r\nhandicaps in the Rendel Constitution. In  the  last\r\n\r\ngovernment,  the  Chief  Secretary,  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary, the Attorney-General and above  all  the\r\n\r\nGovernor,    were   colonial   officials.    Power,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  lay  in  the hands  of  these  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials,  and not so much in the hands  of  those\r\n\r\nwho became Ministers under the Rendel Constitution,\r\n\r\nalthough  some  pretence was made  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  his  colleagues held  the  reins  of\r\n\r\npower. We realised their disabilities of forming  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  under these conditions and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nwe put only four candidates in the 1955 Elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 conditions have now changed. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  led  the people of Singapore to obtain  a  new\r\n\r\nConstitution which provides for complete control of\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government in Singapore. It  is  now\r\n\r\ntime  for us to change our policy, for us  to  take\r\n\r\nhold  of the reins of government and use our powers\r\n\r\nwisely  to advance the cause and our objects  which\r\n\r\nwere  stated in our Party manifesto. So it was that\r\n\r\ntwo  months  ago, on 30th May, the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty was returned by the people of Singapore  with\r\n\r\nan   overwhelming  majority,  which  a   well-known\r\n\r\nchurchman  said, \"was an earthquake  to  shake  our\r\n\r\nconscience\".  But  it would be foolish  for  us  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  with the change of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nwe  shall also adopt the ritual and the regalia  of\r\n\r\nthe past without modifying them. Just as an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nEnglish  daffodil  cannot thrive  in  our  tropical\r\n\r\nclimate, it will be foolish for us to believe  that\r\n\r\nthe   pomp  and  circumstances  of  British   State\r\n\r\nfunctions,   the  undiluted  forms  of  uninhibited\r\n\r\nliberalism  of the West, of Hyde Park  corner,  can\r\n\r\nflourish  in  our  political  environment   without\r\n\r\nundergoing certain modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We subscribe to parliamentary democratic rule.\r\n\r\nBut it does not necessarily mean that, in doing so,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  adopt the forms which are known  in  the\r\n\r\nWest.  With  the pending retirement of the  present\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara, so also will  there  be  a\r\n\r\nchange  in  our symbols. The flag of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe crest of Singapore today have still a trace  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  When  our own Malayan-born  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara assumes authority in a few  months'\r\n\r\ntime, we shall have a new flag for the new State of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and also a new National  Anthem.  These\r\n\r\nsymbols  are  important, psychologically,  in  that\r\n\r\nthey  draw  the  loyalty of the population  towards\r\n\r\ncertain beliefs, towards the country. But it is not\r\n\r\nenough that we should reside or dwell in the  light\r\n\r\nof  these symbols. We must come down to the reality\r\n\r\nthat  the success of the future of the country must\r\n\r\nbe  dependent  upon  action, upon  our  own  honest\r\n\r\nlabours,  upon  hard  work,  for  no  country   can\r\n\r\nflourish merely on symbols alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Colonial Government had stood\r\n\r\naloof  from the people they ruled. But the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party has during the past five  years  been\r\n\r\nclose  to  the masses. They have grown out  of  the\r\n\r\nroots,  and now that we are in Government, it  will\r\n\r\nbe our intention that we who come out of the masses\r\n\r\nshall go back to the masses. It is in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthis belief of ours that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nlast  month  shed his uniform, his Colonial  plumes\r\n\r\nand  regalia with which a Colonial Governor usually\r\n\r\nadorns himself. The change of attire of the Yang di-Pertuan   Negara  also  signifies  the  change   in\r\n\r\nattitude of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party has a positive\r\n\r\nideology.  We believe that our ills, the  ills  of\r\n\r\nour society, can only besolved \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non the basis of a socialist ideology, and it\r\n\r\nis because we have a political belief, we therefore\r\n\r\nhave  a principle, and having a principle, we  have\r\n\r\nthe  ability to lay down a line of action by  which\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to advance our cause and the progress  of\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, during the last two months, during the\r\n\r\nelection  campaigning, produced  policy  statements\r\n\r\nall  of  which have been embodied in two  pamphlets\r\n\r\ncalled  \"The Tasks Ahead\". These tasks outline  the\r\n\r\nplans  which  we hope to execute in the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears  when  we are in power. The tasks ahead  have\r\n\r\nincluded the problems of women, education,  labour,\r\n\r\ntrade   unions   and   social  security,   economic\r\n\r\npolicies,   housing,  rural  development,   health,\r\n\r\nreorganisation of Government administrative organs,\r\n\r\nincluding   absorption   of   the   City    Council\r\n\r\ndepartments into Government Ministries, and  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.  These tasks ahead have formed the  basis\r\n\r\nfor  the  speech  which the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\ndelivered at the opening session of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic general problems which we\r\n\r\nface. First is one of nation building. Second,  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of  our existing economy  from  a  non-productive one to a productive one. With regard  to\r\n\r\nnation  building, we realise that that  is  a  task\r\n\r\nwhich is not possible to be solved within the short\r\n\r\nspace of two years or five years. We know that  the\r\n\r\ntask  must necessarily be a continuous one, but  it\r\n\r\nis  our  intention and our object that  within  ten\r\n\r\nyears  the  basis will have firmly  been  laid  for\r\n\r\nnation  building. We are all aware that our society\r\n\r\nis  complicated by the fact that there are  present\r\n\r\ndifferent races and different cultures. Because  of\r\n\r\ndifferent cultures we are also handicapped  by  the\r\n\r\npresence  of  a multitude of tongues.  Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nour  faith  is that despite this diversity  in  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  our  society  we  can  weld   the\r\n\r\ndifferent  elements together into one  nation.  And\r\n\r\ntoday  this  session of the Assembly is  historical\r\n\r\nbecause,  for  the  first time in  the  history  of\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assemblies, not only in Singapore  but\r\n\r\nalso in Malaya, we have four tongues spoken. We are\r\n\r\nproud  that  multilingualism  has  come  into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, and it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  stay.  In this way we have opened  Government\r\n\r\nnot  to  a  privileged few, not to those  who  were\r\n\r\neducated only in the language of a Colonial  master\r\n\r\nbut we have opened Government to the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard yesterday and today speeches made in\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay and English, and it is  our  desire\r\n\r\nthat multi-lingualism will make its effect felt  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  not because of the  fact  that  one\r\n\r\nlanguage  is different from the other and therefore\r\n\r\nit is a novelty to listen to another language which\r\n\r\nis  different from what we have been used  to,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  by allowing our Members in this  House  to\r\n\r\nuse  the tongue they are accustomed to we also feel\r\n\r\nthe reactions and the emotions from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy has during the past hundred years\r\n\r\nbeen  based almost entirely on an entrepot economy.\r\n\r\nOur population has outgrown the ability of such  an\r\n\r\neconomy  to  support us. It is therefore  of  great\r\n\r\nimportance   that   we   should   take   steps   to\r\n\r\nindustralise our economy, and make it a  productive\r\n\r\none, in  this way we hope that some  of  the  ills\r\n\r\nwhich we see in our society will be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said just now, Sir, that the P.A.P. is a\r\n\r\nsocialist Party, and therefore, we have a socialist\r\n\r\nprogramme.  We  must,  however,  recognise  certain\r\n\r\nfacts and conditions which are imposed upon us.  We\r\n\r\nrecognise  that our little island of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nno natural resources, and that our entrepot economy\r\n\r\nhas  remained  static, that there  is  pressure  of\r\n\r\npopulation on the island and that we also have  the\r\n\r\ncomplexity  of  a  multi-racial  society  and   the\r\n\r\nspecial  problems which they pose. The  conditions,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   to  realise  a  completely   socialist\r\n\r\nsociety are not present. But nonetheless, it is our\r\n\r\nintention to do our utmost within these five  years\r\n\r\nso  that  at  the end of this period we  will  have\r\n\r\nfirmly  laid  the  basis  for  a  future  socialist\r\n\r\nsociety,  and it is also our intention that  during\r\n\r\nthese  five years, what is more important  is  that\r\n\r\nexisting  feudalistic  and  conservative  attitudes\r\n\r\nmust be changed to a progressive socialist outlook.\r\n\r\nSocialism  is  not  just merely  a  change  in  the\r\n\r\nownership  of property. For us who are  faced  with\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntask  of  forming a nation, socialism also includes\r\n\r\nthe fostering of an attitude and an outlook towards\r\n\r\na Malayan nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the details of the Yang-di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  will  not  deal with  them  because  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  will capably dispose  of  them  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of this debate. However, I would like to say\r\n\r\nthis:   that  in  1955,  the  Labour  Front   which\r\n\r\ncontested   the  general  elections  never   really\r\n\r\nplanned  to  win  the elections. Neither  did  they\r\n\r\nexpect to win the elections. It must have been  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  surprise of the lives  of  those  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front when they found that they were in  the\r\n\r\nmajority,  and having never calculated  or  planned\r\n\r\nwhat to do if they should form the Government,  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  were faced with the  situation  that\r\n\r\nthey had to scrape together their members from here\r\n\r\nand  there to form a body which they could  call  a\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Labour Front had a vague  political\r\n\r\nideology.  But the ideology was never  strong,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the principles were never strong.  Having\r\n\r\nno  principles they had no plans of what they would\r\n\r\ndo  when  they  formed the Government.  The  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Government was like a ship  sailing  in  the\r\n\r\nPacific Ocean, without a compass and without a pair\r\n\r\nof oars. They are like those who first ventured out\r\n\r\ninto  the  Straits of Johore at Changi in a  little\r\n\r\nrowing  boat  in the hope of having a gay  time  in\r\n\r\ntheir  lives,  and it must have been  the  greatest\r\n\r\nsurprise  to  them  when they found  the  boat  had\r\n\r\ndrifted  into  the Pacific Ocean. But  the  Pacific\r\n\r\nOcean is not that pacific. It is notorious for  its\r\n\r\ntyphoons!  Poor  devils!  They  had  never   really\r\n\r\nunderstood the currents of our political life,  and\r\n\r\nit  was  therefore not unexpected that  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront Coalition Government, and latterly the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government, capsized in the stormy  seas\r\n\r\nof Singapore politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A. Coalition Government lost the general\r\n\r\nelections  not  simply because the P.A.P. captured\r\n\r\nthe City Council. The people of Singapore were wise\r\n\r\nduring  the last four years, that those  whom  they\r\n\r\nvoted  into  power  should honour  their  word  and\r\n\r\nshould  execute  what  they  had  promised  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  The last Government forgot  what  they\r\n\r\nsaid  in  1955.  Their word was not  honoured.  The\r\n\r\nlesson for those who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve  in democracy is that a Government  can  be\r\n\r\nchanged by the electorate if it fails to fulfil the\r\n\r\nwishes  of  the  electorate.  That  is  the   basic\r\n\r\nprinciple of democracy, and that is the reason  why\r\n\r\ntoday we have Members in this House changing seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the P.A.P. have calculated the odds.

We mean what we say and say what we  mean.\r\n\r\nThe  people know this. This is why we have a P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  today. During the next  five  years  we\r\n\r\nwill  give  further proof that we are a  consistent\r\n\r\nParty.  What  we promised before the elections,  we\r\n\r\nwill  make sincere efforts to carry out during  the\r\n\r\nnext  five years. I should like to call the special\r\n\r\nattention of this House to that part of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's speech which deals with  national\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara has promised that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  ensure  that  the  welfare   and\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  rural dwellers  are  adequately\r\n\r\nlooked after. There are three reasons for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A large proportion of our population live in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas and the P.A.P. is  interested  in\r\n\r\nserving  all the people, not merely one section  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Our farmers and fishermen in the rural areas\r\n\r\nhave  been exploited by middlemen in the past. They\r\n\r\nare still being exploited. Our farmers today depend\r\n\r\non the credit of middlemen to provide them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  imported fertilisers and feeding  stuffs.  In\r\n\r\nreturn  for this credit they pay higher prices  and\r\n\r\nreceive  reduced prices for the products  of  their\r\n\r\nindustry.  This  situation  must  end.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  plans  to  organise  and   assist\r\n\r\nfarmers, producers' co-operatives and marketing co-operatives. This will help to break the grip of the\r\n\r\nmiddlemen  on our farming community. It  will  also\r\n\r\nensure  a  fair  return for  the  products  of  our\r\n\r\nfarmers.  We shall have fishermen's producers'  co-operatives  and fish marketing co-operatives  in  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  way,  Sir, for the same  purpose.  If  our\r\n\r\nfishermen  and market gardeners can  be  helped  to\r\n\r\nincrease  their  production by modern  methods,  it\r\n\r\nwill  do  three things. It will increase their  own\r\n\r\nearning  power; it will also strengthen the economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore;  finally,  it  will  mean  more  and\r\n\r\ncheaper poultry, eggs, pigs, and vegetables for our\r\n\r\npeople and also a much greater surplus for export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has another purpose in\r\n\r\nview.  This is steadily to remove the disparity  in\r\n\r\nthe  amenities  of  life between  urban  and  rural\r\n\r\nareas. This means that we must and will take  steps\r\n\r\nto do the following things:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to bring electricity to the rural areas and\r\n\r\nprovide water-pipes for the rural people:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) encourage rural people to build kampong roads\r\n\r\nand   assist  in  carrying  out  kampong   drainage\r\n\r\nschemes.  The  building materials in all  instances\r\n\r\nwill be provided by the Government;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) provide the rural areas with good roads, new\r\n\r\nlink roads, bus services and also bus shelters;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) more and more community centres of modest\r\n\r\nsize but adequately equipped for the rural areas;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) provide two district hospitals which will\r\n\r\ncater largely for those living in outlying areas;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) provide more infant and ante-natal clinics\r\n\r\nfor the women and children in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, and more besides, the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nwill undertake within the next five years to\r\n\r\nimprove the standard of living and the social\r\n\r\nfacilities of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrural   population.  But  these  plans  cannot   be\r\n\r\nfulfilled overnight. This House must remember  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government is working on the basis of  a\r\n\r\nfive-year plan, not a six-month plan or a  one-year\r\n\r\nplan. But of one thing we can speak with assurance,\r\n\r\nSir.    Given   the   necessary   time,    planning\r\n\r\norganisation,  co-operation and hard  work  of  all\r\n\r\nthose  concerned, we can and will fulfil our  five-year plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on this House, Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\nexpress  its  unqualified thanks to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara for his constructive and  inspiring\r\n\r\nspeech on behalf of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, we express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara for his speech at the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthe  session. In his speech, we clearly  understand\r\n\r\nthat our Government is to build an independent non-Communist  Malaya.  This is our  purpose.  For  our\r\n\r\nbright   future   in   this   difficult   and   dim\r\n\r\nenvironment, we struggled very hard with the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore for this purpose. As a result, on the\r\n\r\n30th  of  May, the people of Singapore by  peaceful\r\n\r\nmeans freed themselves from Colonial rule. Together\r\n\r\nwith  the  people  of  Singapore,  we  formed   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This is the Government of the  various\r\n\r\npeoples. We have to work to implement our plans. We\r\n\r\nknow  that  what  we do will be  to  care  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  all the people and be responsible  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just said that we want to bring about a\r\n\r\nsociety  where there is no exploitation. Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  Government must look closely after  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  been exploited and forgotten by the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment, such as the fishermen and labourers. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we must also look after the interests  and\r\n\r\nbenefit   of   other  people.  These  farmers   and\r\n\r\nfishermen  and labourers do not get a  fair  return\r\n\r\nfor  their  labour.  In the  case  of  housing  and\r\n\r\nhealth,  they  do  not  receive  regard  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Regarding the supplying of electricity,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncleaning  of the drains, the fitting of  the water-pipes  and the building of the bridges, it will  be\r\n\r\nup  to the present Government to do it. We must try\r\n\r\nour  best  to  bring  all this  about  under  these\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions. We sincerely hope that  those\r\n\r\nhardworking  and  good people will  give  us  their\r\n\r\nclosest co-operation and trust. Only with this  can\r\n\r\nwe fulfil our tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding those who are against giving benefit to\r\n\r\nthe  people we will persuade them to believe in us.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, we hope that those who worry for\r\n\r\nnothing will realise the aim of the Government  and\r\n\r\nparticipate in our work. They will work harder  and\r\n\r\nco-operate with us to help our new nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, as one\r\n\r\ndirectly connected with trade unions and the day-\r\n\r\nto-day  problems of workers, I wish to make  a  few\r\n\r\nremarks on one aspect of the Government's policy as\r\n\r\ncontained in the speech delivered by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  namely,  that  which  relates  to\r\n\r\nworkers and their organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's guiding principle in industrial\r\n\r\nrelations, as has been stated, is industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith justice. Industrial peace, of course, does not\r\n\r\nmean the same as what our predecessors certained it\r\n\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past era, Government merely interpreted\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace  to  be  \"law  and  order\",   and\r\n\r\ntherefore every effort was made to check and  crush\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  agitations for  improved  wages  and\r\n\r\nconditions of work. Obviously, there was no justice\r\n\r\ndone,  because  the  Government, being  excessively\r\n\r\nkeen  and enthusiastic to maintain law and order - if\r\n\r\nneed  be  by thuggish means - had for the convenience\r\n\r\nof  rich  employers, quite comfortably  ignored  to\r\n\r\nrevise certain laws which were not in the interests\r\n\r\nor in favour of the workers. This ultimately led to\r\n\r\nwarfare  on  the industrial front. The unions  that\r\n\r\nwere  strong  and  well-organised, with  sufficient\r\n\r\nfunds to maintain a prolonged struggle, received to\r\n\r\nsome extent what they wanted; but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  unions  with  poor  organisations  became  the\r\n\r\nunderdogs  and were left at the mercy of  merciless\r\n\r\nand  ruthless  employers. No  effort  was  made  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the trade union movement on  the  whole\r\n\r\nand  the individual unions which, although they had\r\n\r\nlegitimate  demands, were unsuccessful  because  of\r\n\r\nweak  and  poor  organisations. The Government  was\r\n\r\nindifferent   to   the  principle   of   collective\r\n\r\nbargaining  and,  on the contrary, fostered  yellow\r\n\r\nand  splinter  unions  which further  weakened  the\r\n\r\nworkers' movement. Today, Mr Speaker, Sir, what do\r\n\r\nwe have? There are 218 trade unions of workers many\r\n\r\nof  which  are empty ghost unions. It is  not  very\r\n\r\nnecessary to state how ridiculous the situation is.\r\n\r\nIn  an  island  of about 1\ufffd million people,  with\r\n\r\nabout  32  per  cent of the population economically\r\n\r\nactive,  we  have 218 employee trade unions.  There\r\n\r\nare  two  unions - if not more - claiming to  represent\r\n\r\nworkers  of one industry in quite a few cases,  and\r\n\r\nif  we  examine their membership records, we  shall\r\n\r\nfind  one with less than ten members and the  other\r\n\r\nwith  more than 5,000 members. It was not that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was unaware of splinter unions,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  proved  in  the  past. For  example,  in  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board there are about five unions  with  a\r\n\r\ntotal  membership of about 500 and one large  union\r\n\r\nwith  more  than  7,000  members.  Yet  the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment refused to take the necessary action  to\r\n\r\nmake this large union the only voice of the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard   workers.  Besides  this  type,  there   are\r\n\r\nnumerous small unions managed by thugs and hoodlums\r\n\r\nwhich  had  been set up by employers with  specific\r\n\r\nfunctions to break militant unions. At the  moment,\r\n\r\nout of the 218 unions, about 100 have less than 250\r\n\r\nmembers each. About 85 unions have between 250  and\r\n\r\n1,000 members. In other words, about 185 unions out\r\n\r\nof  a total of 218 have each a membership of 1,000.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  workers are fed up with this  sort  of\r\n\r\naffairs  and in the trade union field,  the  trends\r\n\r\nare  for  a unified trade union movement. Unity  is\r\n\r\nthe  call among the workers, as it was in the past,\r\n\r\nbut this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  the  difference is that we have a  Government\r\n\r\nwhich is not impotent or sterile but determined  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the declared policy with the purpose  of\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the trade unions  and  unifying  the\r\n\r\nworking  class movement in order to ensure  a  more\r\n\r\nactive, a more widespread and, on the whole, a more\r\n\r\nmilitant participation of workers' organisations in\r\n\r\nthe  struggle to establish a fair and just  society\r\n\r\nin which man will not exploit man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fully aware of the need to\r\n\r\nestablish  and maintain industrial peace  but  this\r\n\r\nwill certainly not be like the wild cry of the past\r\n\r\nfor  \"law and order\". Industrial peace can only  be\r\n\r\nmaintained if there is justice for the workers, and\r\n\r\nthe  most  practical  way in  which  there  can  be\r\n\r\nlasting  industrial peace is to have an independent\r\n\r\nCourt  of Labour which will not be deterred by  the\r\n\r\npomp and the power of money of the employers, whose\r\n\r\nfindings  and  recommendations will be  binding  on\r\n\r\nboth  the unions and the employers, and which  will\r\n\r\nhave the force of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated clearly that it will\r\n\r\ncancel  the  registration of  yellow  and  splinter\r\n\r\nunions. There may be some across the Floor who  may\r\n\r\nbecome  vociferous about democratic  liberties  and\r\n\r\nfreedom  of association and the rest of  it.  Those\r\n\r\ncrushed  on  the  30th  of  May  by  the  will  and\r\n\r\ndetermination of the working class will attempt  to\r\n\r\nchampion  the cause of anti-unionists  and  hoodlum\r\n\r\nleaders of these unions who do not even represent a\r\n\r\nsizeable  proportion  of  the  workers.  Let  these\r\n\r\npeople  not  forget that the P.A.P. won a  decisive\r\n\r\nvictory at the elections and more than 50 per  cent\r\n\r\nof   the   electorate  voted  in  favour  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment. The electorate were fully aware of  our\r\n\r\npolicies   and  they  supported  us  because   they\r\n\r\nsupported our policies. And let there be  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. will fulfil its obligations to  the\r\n\r\npeople  by  enforcing  its  declared  policies.  To\r\n\r\npretend  and  fake as heroes of the  working  class\r\n\r\nwill result in greater demoralisation than 30th May\r\n\r\nin time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If nobody wishes to speak, I will\r\n\r\nput the Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\ninformation, Sir.

This  majority,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  spared no pains to drive  home  to  the\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition. But I feel that we are a\r\n\r\nbit confused over this matter. We are aware that we\r\n\r\nare 8 against 43. We are aware that the people have\r\n\r\nchosen the P.A.P. We are aware that the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\npublished  \"The  Tasks Ahead\", and the  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  voted P.A.P. have accepted on principle their\r\n\r\nmanifesto. But it must also be remembered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  of those who voted for P.A.P., many have  not\r\n\r\nread \"The Tasks Ahead\". Assuming that everyone  has\r\n\r\nread  and has digested it, \"The Tasks Ahead\"  still\r\n\r\ndoes  not give in detail the methods by which these\r\n\r\nprinciples in the programme are to be carried  out.\r\n\r\nSo,  in  spite  of  the fact that the  people,  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the electorate, have voted P.A.P.,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  but  run  away  with  the  idea  that   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  in  whatever  method  introduced,   no\r\n\r\nmatter  by  what  means they are carried  out,  are\r\n\r\nacceptable   and  are  given  a  mandate   by   the\r\n\r\nelectorate. That is why we have to get together and\r\n\r\nplan  constructively, as I said, for the  paramount\r\n\r\ninterest  of the State. Let us spend our  time  and\r\n\r\nenergy doing that. Evidently, the 54 per cent, when\r\n\r\nthey voted for the P.A.P., had hoped that when  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. formed the government, it would  voice  the\r\n\r\nopinion of the electorate; it would promote  peace,\r\n\r\nfreedom and justice for the people; it would  bring\r\n\r\nabout work for the good and prosperity of the State\r\n\r\nand its people, and improve the standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's determination to wipe out the\r\n\r\nalleged  deficit of $14 million, and the policy  of\r\n\r\ndropping the axe on those whom they think are  best\r\n\r\nable   to  bear  it  is,  of  course,  commendable,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  they have considered  it  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of dropping the axe on those who  are  best\r\n\r\nable  to  bear it so that it would not cause  undue\r\n\r\nhardship  on  those  who cannot  bear  it.  But  to\r\n\r\nimplement those pay cuts, without even one  month's\r\n\r\nnotice,  certainly will cause severe hardship,  and\r\n\r\nin  some  cases  maybe disaster and misery  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  This can be avoided if only time is  given\r\n\r\nto  the  poor  employee to balance  or  adjust  his\r\n\r\nfamily budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the fact that these cuts have been\r\n\r\nimplemented  without negotiations with  the  unions\r\n\r\nhas  given  a  sense  of  insecurity  not  only  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees, but  also  to  employees  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  The  meeting that Government had  with  the\r\n\r\ntrade   union   leaders  can   hardly   be   termed\r\n\r\n\"negotiations\", when, I believe, in  the  words  of\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister - I am not quoting exactly  but\r\n\r\nthe  gist  of it is that Government had decided  to\r\n\r\ndecide for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople,  because the trade union leaders  were  not\r\n\r\nable  to  make any decisions without referring  the\r\n\r\nmatter to their respective trade unions. After all,\r\n\r\nis   not  this  the  essence  of  democratic  trade\r\n\r\nunionism - to  bring  it back  to  the  trade  unions\r\n\r\nbefore  the  leaders decide? Government has  always\r\n\r\nbeen   regarded  as  a  model  employer,   and   if\r\n\r\nGovernment  deals  with its  employees  in  such  a\r\n\r\nhighhanded   fashion   today,   what   right   will\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  to prevent other employers  doing\r\n\r\nthe  same  tomorrow?  No wonder  the  employees  of\r\n\r\ncommercial   firms  are  sharing  this   sense   of\r\n\r\ninsecurity  with Government employees. The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  calls for understanding of the people  by\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants. I am afraid, to achieve  this,\r\n\r\nGovernment will have to show this understanding  to\r\n\r\nits  civil  servants first. As a trade unionist,  I\r\n\r\nhad  the good fortune of working with many who  are\r\n\r\nnow  Ministers on the Government bench, and I  used\r\n\r\nto  admire them for the untiring effort they put in\r\n\r\nto  protect  the  right of trade unions  and  trade\r\n\r\nunionism. It seems incredible to me now to  witness\r\n\r\nthe  position of the very trade unionists, who  had\r\n\r\nbeen  protected,  standing up now to  defend  their\r\n\r\nright  against  their own leaders who,  until  very\r\n\r\nrecently, had been their champions in the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention to wipe out the\r\n\r\ndeficit and to bridge the gap between the different\r\n\r\nsocial strata is, of course, plausible. But it must\r\n\r\nbe  remembered  that the means by which  these  are\r\n\r\nbeing  carried  out  are as important  as  the  end\r\n\r\nitself.  It  does  not take an economic  expert  to\r\n\r\nslash  the  salary  of  its  employees  to  meet  a\r\n\r\ndeficit. The true worth of an economic expert  will\r\n\r\nbe  fully appreciated when he meets the deficit  by\r\n\r\nexpanding trade and industry. If Singapore were  to\r\n\r\nkeep in step with the other countries in the world,\r\n\r\nthis  gap  will  have to be bridged by  pulling  up\r\n\r\nthose from the bottom to meet the top, and not pull\r\n\r\nthose  at  the top to the bottom. This  will  be  a\r\n\r\nretrograde step which should be avoided. The people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore in general and the trade unionists in\r\n\r\nparticular  look up to their trade union champions,\r\n\r\ntheir economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpert,  and their chosen leaders to improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of living and to protect their rights.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure they are confident that the noble instinct\r\n\r\nshown  by  these  leaders  in  the  past  will  yet\r\n\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Community and Recreational Organisations, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided to take over and to exercise\r\n\r\nfull control over these community organisations and\r\n\r\npartial     control    over    the     recreational\r\n\r\norganisations.  Throughout the  world,  the  stress\r\n\r\ntoday  is  on  helping people to  help  themselves.\r\n\r\nVolunteers,  it has been accepted universally,  are\r\n\r\nthe  best  yardsticks by which to measure community\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  social services. The enthusiasm  of\r\n\r\nthe  citizen  volunteers,  as  board  members,   as\r\n\r\nsolicitors  in Community Fund Drives, or  volunteer\r\n\r\nagency   workers,  determines  the   democracy   of\r\n\r\ncommunity  services.  A community  welfare  service\r\n\r\nshould  be  representative of the total  community.\r\n\r\nThere should be room for all in order to strengthen\r\n\r\ncommunity   understanding.  There  should   be   no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  against any group  on  any  grounds\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, be they social, cultural, religious  or\r\n\r\npolitical. Yet Government has discriminated against\r\n\r\na certain group known as politicians. The excuse is\r\n\r\nthat  if politicians are allowed to take an  active\r\n\r\npart in community activities, they will exploit the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and  organisations.  This,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  should be stopped. I agree. But the  means\r\n\r\nof  carrying this out are as important as the  end,\r\n\r\nbecause  Government's method  of  implementing  the\r\n\r\nidea  of  preventing  politicians  from  exploiting\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, is leading to Party politics  at\r\n\r\na  higher  level and on a bigger scale, because  no\r\n\r\none will be allowed to run or take part actively in\r\n\r\nhis  community  activity except the Government.  It\r\n\r\nwill   all  be  run  by  the  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment happens to be the P.A.P. No citizen of a\r\n\r\ndemocratic country should be deprived of his  civic\r\n\r\nrights to serve his community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the world, efforts have been made to\r\n\r\nencourage  civic  consciousness  and  interest   in\r\n\r\ncommunity welfare. At the Ninth Conference  of  the\r\n\r\nInternational Council of Social Welfare held\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Tokyo last November, it was unanimously  agreed\r\n\r\nthat social workers should approach their political\r\n\r\nleaders  and  encourage them to take a more  active\r\n\r\ninterest  in the welfare of the community,  because\r\n\r\nit was felt that they are the people who can render\r\n\r\nvaluable services to the community. I am sure it is\r\n\r\nnot  the  intention  of the Government  to  isolate\r\n\r\nSingapore  from the rest of the world  by  ignoring\r\n\r\nrecommendations which have been unanimously arrived\r\n\r\nat  by  them.  Moreover,  active  participation  in\r\n\r\ncommunity    centres   and   organisations    helps\r\n\r\ntremendously to provide leadership training. If the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and recreational  organisations\r\n\r\nhave  not  come  up  to  the  expectations  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is up to the Government  to  provide\r\n\r\nsuch  training  for  the  citizens,  because  these\r\n\r\ncitizens are not specially trained to carry out the\r\n\r\nwork;  and  the  way  to meet this  is  to  provide\r\n\r\ntraining for the volunteers, rather than chuck them\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, it\r\n\r\nis said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"it now falls upon this Government to instil in\r\n\r\nour people of all races the will to be a nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,   I   maintain  that  depriving  citizens   of\r\n\r\nleadership training and of the right and freedom of\r\n\r\na  citizen to serve his community will not help  to\r\n\r\ninstil in them the will to be a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we have just heard the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Deputy Prime Minister. In my opinion,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  based on the speech of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  What  he has  stated  are  purely\r\n\r\nmatters which concern the struggle of his own Party\r\n\r\nand  they are not related to the Speech of the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to clarify to this Assembly that this self-Government, a democracy through\r\n\r\nelections,  which  we  have  just  been  given   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and  which  we  have  experienced   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   for   the  last  few   years,   is   an\r\n\r\nadministration and a condition that is newly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrought about in Asia. On the other hand, it should\r\n\r\nnot be forgotten that this democracy is a system of\r\n\r\nlife  in Europe which the people have had for  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  thousand years, and which has reached  the\r\n\r\nstatus that is now obtaining throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to come back to the speech of\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It seems to me that  in\r\n\r\nthis speech the aim of the Government is to abolish\r\n\r\nthe  interest of democracy, that is, to abolish the\r\n\r\nCity Council and the District Councils. That, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,  is  not right because we have  only  just\r\n\r\nreceived  power through democratic  means,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  give  an  opportunity  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  not only to vote, but also to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe powers of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara I notice a section where it has been\r\n\r\nstated that the aim of the Government is to shape a\r\n\r\nMalayan nation. Here I would like the Government to\r\n\r\nsay  how  it is to carry this out. Are we to  shape\r\n\r\nthe  new  nation based on the indigenous people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, that is the Malays, or is it to be based\r\n\r\non the Chinese people, or the Indian people who are\r\n\r\ninhabitants staying in Singapore? I feel that if  I\r\n\r\nwere to forget my feelings as a Malay, it would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult. Likewise for the Chinese and the  Indian\r\n\r\npeople,  it would be difficult. So here  we  should\r\n\r\nask for clarification on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nas to how it intends to implement his policy. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  that,  in  the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  it is stated that the stand of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to  form a  society  that  is  non-Communist  but  socialist in nature.  But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  this  society is not  meant  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore,  but  is  called  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nsociety.  In my opinion, this is hardly correct  at\r\n\r\nall  because  when  we  use the  word  \"Malaya\"  it\r\n\r\nincludes  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  and  if  it\r\n\r\nincludes  the Federation of Malaya, it  means,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the Government wishes to take part in\r\n\r\nthe  internal affairs of the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the Government wishes to form\r\n\r\na society that is non-Communist but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocialist in Singapore, there will be no difficulty\r\n\r\nbecause  it has the power to carry it out. But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not bring in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  because Malaya involves the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We know\r\n\r\nour  Government since its formation one month  ago.\r\n\r\nThus  our  self-Government is one  month  old.  The\r\n\r\nprevious Government was a Colonial Government and a\r\n\r\nbureaucratic Government. The responsibility now  is\r\n\r\nto   change   the   former  Colonial   bureaucratic\r\n\r\npractices.  We  must have plans and  procedures  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  present  Government  and  the  present\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the Government to serve  the  people\r\n\r\nwell,  especially  the poor  people,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to approach the Government. For  this,\r\n\r\nthen  the Government employees will be working well\r\n\r\nfor the country and for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in order to carry it out well,\r\n\r\neducation  is  very important.  We  know  that  the\r\n\r\nformer  education policy was a Colonial and servile\r\n\r\none. If the people receive no education or Colonial\r\n\r\neducation then it is difficult for the formation of\r\n\r\nthe  country. We should not just educate  them  for\r\n\r\ntheir profession or work. We should educate them so\r\n\r\nthat,  on  the one hand, they can serve the  people\r\n\r\nand, on the other hand, they can work for their own\r\n\r\nlivelihood.   Formerly,  the  Colonial   Government\r\n\r\nproduced a privileged class. This privileged  class\r\n\r\nwas  the English-educated class. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthey  neglected the interests of the other schools,\r\n\r\nfor example, the Chinese schools, Malay schools and\r\n\r\nTamil  schools, where talented people may be found.\r\n\r\nNow  our education policy has given equal treatment\r\n\r\nto all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, we will train people of all races who\r\n\r\nhave  talent  and ability, to make them  serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry  well. On the one hand they can earn  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood and, on the other hand, they can produce\r\n\r\na  lot  of  goods for the country and increase  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  the country. They  will  be  useful\r\n\r\neconomically  to the country. The former  education\r\n\r\npolicy was to produce clerks and teachers. Now  our\r\n\r\npresent education policy is not of that type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we have decided to make Malay the\r\n\r\nnational language of this country. That is  not  to\r\n\r\nsay  that we will neglect or overlook the languages\r\n\r\nof  other races. The reason is that there  must  be\r\n\r\none  language for the whole nation, and it  can  be\r\n\r\nunderstood  by all the people of the  country.  The\r\n\r\nMalay  language is the most suitable one to be  the\r\n\r\nnational  language.  We  must  learn  our  national\r\n\r\nlanguage, and be loyal to Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, the Colonial education policy produced\r\n\r\na  lot  of  teachers and clerks, and  because  this\r\n\r\neducation  policy contained a tinge of colonialism,\r\n\r\nit therefore corrupted the thoughts of our youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we have stopped a lot of yellow\r\n\r\nnewspapers and also obscene films. But some  people\r\n\r\nwho  published these types of papers and films said\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. is destroying the freedom  of  the\r\n\r\nPress.  Actually they themselves have utilised  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  the  Press to destroy the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nothers. Everyone wants to be good, but this  yellow\r\n\r\nPress and yellow films purposely lead us to do  bad\r\n\r\nthings.   Is  it  not  to  destroy  other  people's\r\n\r\nfreedom?  No one has absolute freedom - otherwise  we\r\n\r\nhave the freedom to kill a person. The servile  and\r\n\r\ncolonial  education  policy was  quite  successful.\r\n\r\nWhat I said just now proves that this education has\r\n\r\nnot failed completely. Why? Because it has produced\r\n\r\na   lot  of  people  worshipping  Western  material\r\n\r\nprogress and civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we have heard that a lot of teachers and\r\n\r\nGovernment officers went to see obscene films. Most\r\n\r\nof   them  were  English-educated.  Therefore   the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Colonial education policy proved  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  not  failed completely. On the other hand,  it\r\n\r\nproduced  Rock and Roll dances for our youths.  Now\r\n\r\nour  present Government has sacked those  teachers,\r\n\r\nwho  went  to  see  the obscene pictures.  Formerly\r\n\r\nunder  the Lim Yew Hock Government, I believe there\r\n\r\nwere  teachers  who also went to see those  obscene\r\n\r\nfilms, and they were arrested by the Government but\r\n\r\ntheir names were not published. Why? Because-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

How were\r\n\r\nthey  corrupted? I give you one example. A  teacher\r\n\r\ntold  me  that he went to the Education Department,\r\n\r\nand asked a clerk, \"Why do you not work seriously?\"\r\n\r\nThe  clerk replied, \"Go and ask Mr Chew Swee Kee.\"\r\n\r\nThis   proves  that  because  the  Government   was\r\n\r\ncorrupted,  therefore  the  employees   were   also\r\n\r\ncorrupted.  If  the  Government serves  the  people\r\n\r\nwell, then the employees of the Government will  be\r\n\r\nworking  for the people. Our Government has  sacked\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  who saw obscene films.  This  proves\r\n\r\nthat our Government is different. Our Government is\r\n\r\na clean Government. We will work for the people and\r\n\r\nwe will take action against irresponsible people. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  some  teachers play mahjong all  day,  and\r\n\r\ngamble  and  see  obscene pictures.  I  hope  those\r\n\r\npeople  will pay some attention. If they  can  work\r\n\r\nwell  for the people I think their rice bowls  will\r\n\r\nnot   be  broken  and  they  will  not  blame   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for breaking them. To promote a  healthy\r\n\r\nculture,  the former Government will say these  are\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities.  But  our  Government   now\r\n\r\nencourage healthy culture. I think our former Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   will  say  that  we  are  \"a  subversive\r\n\r\nGovernment\". We have to wipe out illiteracy  so  as\r\n\r\nto enable all the people to read and write and also\r\n\r\nto  spread  education  and raise  our  standard  of\r\n\r\neducation.  Now  these English-educated  privileged\r\n\r\nclasses no longer exist. Our Government is to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  talented people  from  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nschools - Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil. If they\r\n\r\nare useful and able, we want to make use of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to wipe out the former\r\n\r\nbureaucrats - the  feudalistic,  corrupted,  Colonial\r\n\r\nbacteria.

From the  140  years'\r\n\r\nrule  of  a  Colonial Government,  there  comes  an\r\n\r\ninternal self-government elected by one and a  half\r\n\r\nmillion people. This is an aspect in the history of\r\n\r\nhuman   society   struggling   for   freedom    and\r\n\r\nemancipation.   Although  we  have   not   achieved\r\n\r\nindependence,   the  distance  from   independence,\r\n\r\nhowever, is not very far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 140 years ago our predecessors, for the\r\n\r\nsake   of  freedom  and  of  being  able  to   live\r\n\r\nhonourably  like  human beings,  had  put  in  much\r\n\r\neffort and even sacrificed their own lives, and  as\r\n\r\na result of which, we acquired self-government. But\r\n\r\nhow  are  we  going to treasure this self-governing\r\n\r\nseed  to make it bloom into flower and bear  fruit?\r\n\r\nThis is a heavy responsibility for the 1\ufffd million\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Everybody knows that  it  is\r\n\r\neasy to eat fruit but it is difficult to plant  it.\r\n\r\nThis  is indeed our responsibility and we must  not\r\n\r\nshrink from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an old society we enter into a new society;\r\n\r\nand  from a position of the ruled, we step  into  a\r\n\r\nself-governing  position. In  the  course  of  this\r\n\r\nhistorical  change, people are not ready  to  adapt\r\n\r\ntheir lives and thought to the new environment  and\r\n\r\nthey  always feel somewhat troubled. Those who were\r\n\r\nwell-treated under the colonial rule, would  always\r\n\r\nyearn for the past, hoping that it would linger on.\r\n\r\nThere  are  people  who  were  educated  under  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  servile education. These poor  people  at\r\n\r\none time did not know what to do. But thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople   who   were  oppressed  and  who   actually\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  the struggle, hope  eagerly  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  immediately get rid of the 140 years  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule and fly freely. Even if  this  means\r\n\r\nthat  they have to fare some bitterness, they  will\r\n\r\naccept it willingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not altogether easy for us to\r\n\r\nachieve  self-government. The immediate  and  heavy\r\n\r\ntask  in  front of us cannot be possibly  performed\r\n\r\novernight,  particularly as the previous Government\r\n\r\ndid  not basically look after the interests of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore as a whole. They misused  and\r\n\r\nwasted  public  money and left  a  deficit  of  $14\r\n\r\nmillion  in our State budget for the new Government\r\n\r\nto  balance. It is because of the interest  of  the\r\n\r\n1\ufffd  million  people  and to  prevent  the  public\r\n\r\nfinance from going into a state of bankruptcy  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  no  alternative  but  to  take  immediate\r\n\r\ncorrective measures to economise. Unfortunately, as\r\n\r\nthe  result of the audit and study carried  out  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Finance, our civil  servants  are\r\n\r\nfirst  called  upon  to  bear this  responsibility,\r\n\r\nbecause  the expenditure on the personal emoluments\r\n\r\nof government employees occupies 50 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal  national  revenue.  This  is  an  irrational\r\n\r\nphenomenon. Some irresponsible people may say  that\r\n\r\nif  there  is  a  deficit in public  finances,  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  has just to give an order  to  increase\r\n\r\ntaxation and the deficit will be wiped out.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary to reduce the salaries  of  a  small\r\n\r\nsection of the people. This is the most stupid  way\r\n\r\nof  talking,  just like blind people talking  about\r\n\r\nthe  sky.  We  must realize that a  country  cannot\r\n\r\ndepend  on  increasing taxation  to  wipe  out  its\r\n\r\ndeficit, for it is a negative measure and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, it appears quite illogical. The  reason\r\n\r\nis  very  simple: if we \"drain the  pond  to  catch\r\n\r\nfish\",  we  will be finished in no time. Hereafter,\r\n\r\nour government of 1\ufffd million people must not only\r\n\r\neconomise but must also positively open the sources\r\n\r\nof  income  to  expand  and  develop  our  national\r\n\r\neconomy so as to improve the standard of living  of\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every part of the world, there are good\r\n\r\ncitizens  who, for the sake of building  their  own\r\n\r\ncountry,  have  sacrificed their own interests  for\r\n\r\nthe  good of the people. There is an old saying  in\r\n\r\nChinese, \"Where skin no longer exists, feather  and\r\n\r\nhair  would not survive too.\" The lesson from  this\r\n\r\nsaying  can  be easily grasped. It is  only  in  an\r\n\r\nunevenly developed society where you can benefit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na small section of the people at the expense of the\r\n\r\nlarger proportion of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the people of Singapore control and\r\n\r\nmanage  their public finance, they should  consider\r\n\r\nevery  cent  precious  to them.  If  we  allow  the\r\n\r\npresent  position of our administrative expenditure\r\n\r\nto  continue without any check, we definitely  will\r\n\r\nincrease taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial government left to us the problem of\r\n\r\nunemployment. If we do not find ways and  means  to\r\n\r\nsolve  it,  then this problem of unemployment  will\r\n\r\nbecome more and more serious and consequently  lead\r\n\r\nto  social  unrest  and  the  increase  of  immoral\r\n\r\nconduct. This condition will be further worsened by\r\n\r\nthe  problems of housing, medical services,  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  and the education of children.  All  these\r\n\r\nrequire a great amount of money. Where can  we  get\r\n\r\nall  this  money to finance our projects? How  many\r\n\r\nChristmas Islands then can we sell? Even  if  there\r\n\r\nare,  we  will definitely not sell the property  of\r\n\r\nour  ancestors like a prodigal just to be  despised\r\n\r\nby our coming generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From June 5th this year, the public servant and\r\n\r\nthe  government  are no longer in the  position  of\r\n\r\nemployee  and  employer. The  relationship  between\r\n\r\nthem as employee and employer must naturally follow\r\n\r\nthe Colonial government into oblivion. In its place\r\n\r\nmust  be substituted a new relationship of partners\r\n\r\nwho will fare together in happiness and bitterness.\r\n\r\nWe must quickly develop this attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget our ancestors were the masters\r\n\r\nof  this  country. Today we, (including  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants) recover again the position of masters. We\r\n\r\nare  members of the elected government. In this big\r\n\r\nfamily of ours every member must be responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  economy of this family. We are closely related\r\n\r\nto  one  another and we must be ready to  share  in\r\n\r\nbitterness  and  in  happiness.  Our  1\ufffd  million\r\n\r\npeople  must  work hard together  to  build  a  new\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  are  no longer  working  for  the\r\n\r\nColonial   Government   and   thereby   earning   a\r\n\r\nlivelihood. It is time for them to discard the  old\r\n\r\nattitude.  Although  it is an  honour  for  a  mean\r\n\r\nservant once to become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaster,  but it must be acknowledged that  with  an\r\n\r\nempty treasury, a small section of the people  will\r\n\r\nbe  inevitably asked to make some minor sacrifices.\r\n\r\nWe  must bear in mind that in every corner  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  there  is  hardly any  master  who  is  not\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  the  economy  of   the   family.\r\n\r\nTherefore  we appeal to those people who  may  face\r\n\r\nsome minor sacrifices on their part. In view of the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of this big family and the happiness of\r\n\r\nthe    coming   generation,   they   must    accept\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  the  Government's  pay-cut  measure\r\n\r\nand,  at the same time, cultivate a sense of  self-respect  so that they will be able to shoulder  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of nation-building in  the  capacity\r\n\r\nof master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, and hon. Members, the birth of\r\n\r\nthe  State  of Singapore under its new Constitution\r\n\r\nrepresents  a  change in the political  field,  but\r\n\r\nthis political change would have no meaning if  the\r\n\r\nconditions which prevail in our society do not also\r\n\r\nchange.  If  things were to remain unchanged,  then\r\n\r\nthe struggle of the People's Action Party, which is\r\n\r\nnow  administering  the  Government  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  ineffective. The  changes  which\r\n\r\nwe - that  is  to  say,  my  Party,  the  P.A.P. - have\r\n\r\nplanned  cater for all sections of the  population.\r\n\r\nAnd this has been made clear by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  in  the  First  Opening  Session  of   this\r\n\r\nAssembly recently. What are those changes? I  think\r\n\r\nthey are known by all Members here: they cover  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  economics, finance, medical  facilities,\r\n\r\nhealth,  national  development,  culture,  internal\r\n\r\naffairs  and  others. These changes are  not  being\r\n\r\nbrought  about  for  the benefit  of  a  particular\r\n\r\nsection of the people, but they are for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  all the people of this country, irrespective of\r\n\r\nrace,  religion, colour and ideologies. This  is  a\r\n\r\nbasic  issue which is being pursued by the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party in a country which is multi-racial  in\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Government has made Malay the national\r\n\r\nlanguage  of  Singapore. This  proves  to  all  the\r\n\r\npeople of this island\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this  Government respects the Malay language,\r\n\r\nand  because of the fact that it is a language used\r\n\r\nby  all  the  people,  its  role  as  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage  will  further  strengthen  the  bonds  of\r\n\r\nfriendship  and  relationship  among  the   various\r\n\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the question of the policy of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to build a united Malayan nation from  among\r\n\r\nthe   citizens  of  Singapore,  I  was   just   now\r\n\r\nembarrassed  to hear a Member in this House  making\r\n\r\nspeeches, which are most communal in character. The\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai said. \"If I am a Malay,  I\r\n\r\nwill feel difficult to change my opinions to change\r\n\r\nmy own self. Likewise a Chinese.\" He mentioned also\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. is non-Communist but Socialist. And\r\n\r\nhe said that he was not opposed to this question of\r\n\r\na  socialist, non-Communist Singapore, but  he  did\r\n\r\nnot   agree   with  it  because  it  involved   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. I wish - unfortunately  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  here - to  tell  him  that  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party is non-communal, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  race, religion or colour of skin; that all  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  are  as  one  people   who,\r\n\r\naccording to our long-term policies, will create  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation,  the  aim of the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty being to merge with the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\nIt  is  for  these  reasons that we  use  the  term\r\n\r\n\"Malayan\",  and  if  the Member for  Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  be called a Malayan, it means  clearly\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  still doubtful - he  is  still  in  the\r\n\r\ndark - whether one day Singapore will merge with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. But we of the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty,  who  have,  set  out  in  the  belief  that\r\n\r\nSingapore will merge with Malaya, will continue  to\r\n\r\npursue  our  aim,  although it may  take  years  to\r\n\r\nachieve. Every member of the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nis  determined to work towards that aim.  Does  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai know the meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nterm  \"Malayan\" and the aims of the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty to create a Malayan society? The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and the Ministry of Culture will  pursue\r\n\r\nthis  aim  of  creating  a Malayan  outlook  and  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  consciousness. This is  what  we  have  in\r\n\r\nmind:  that is, to inculcate this attitude  in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  they will have a Malayan outlook and  not\r\n\r\nthink in terms of other countries. Thus if a man is\r\n\r\na Chinese he should not turn to China; and if he is\r\n\r\na  Jew he should not turn to Israel, and so on. And\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  aim which we will pursue.  I  myself\r\n\r\ncannot  understand whether the Member  for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  still wants the Malays to regard  themselves\r\n\r\nas Malays, the Chinese to think in terms of Chinese\r\n\r\npolitics in China, the Indians to think in terms of\r\n\r\nIndian  politics in India and the Jews to think  in\r\n\r\nterms of Israeli politics in Israel. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmention  specifically a Malayan socialist  society,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  ultimately  to  merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwill be one and that is Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning culture - which is also contained in the\r\n\r\nbooklet  \"Towards  a More Just Society\"  which  was\r\n\r\nread  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara - I, as a  Member\r\n\r\nof  this  Assembly  who  is  also  serving  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture, wish to make it known  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Geylang  Serai that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  has taken definite steps to quickly  alter\r\n\r\nor  remould certain attitudes of the people so that\r\n\r\nthey  will  all have a Malayan outlook and  not  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced by decadent Western culture which  comes\r\n\r\nin  the  form of rock and roll. The evil influences\r\n\r\nof rock and roll dances have been too widespread to\r\n\r\nbe allowed in our society. Yellow films and Frenchy\r\n\r\nfilms  of half-naked people must be wiped out.  And\r\n\r\nif  there  are  stage  shows  which  perform  \"Plum\r\n\r\nBlossom\"  acts, which were allowed by the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  then  we  must  put  a  stop  to  them\r\n\r\nimmediately. Artistes and troupes from Hongkong and\r\n\r\nEurope   were  examined  by  the  former  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  and Welfare.  If  they  were\r\n\r\nbeautiful,  they were given permits. This  resulted\r\n\r\nin the struggle against yellow culture - which we aim\r\n\r\nfor - being channelled to undesirable ends. If it has\r\n\r\nbeen so diverted, then it, will be difficult for us\r\n\r\nto  redivert  it  although we will definitely  take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  rectify the wrongs and misdeeds  of  our\r\n\r\npredecessors.  We  must have courage  to  do  this.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are opposed by certain quarters, yet we\r\n\r\nmust  have  courage to carry out the demolition  of\r\n\r\nhouses,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as those in the Geylang Serai area where  the\r\n\r\nowners  let the houses to the people - the Malays - who\r\n\r\nsubsequently  had to go to Court and pay  fines  of\r\n\r\nanything from $10 to $100. This is all the fault of\r\n\r\nthe  previous Government. But as has been said  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten, we should not throw mud\r\n\r\nat  the  previous Government. We are  not  throwing\r\n\r\nmud.   We   are  pointing  out  the  misdeeds   and\r\n\r\nmaladministration  of the previous  Government.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to say frankly what has taken place. What  we\r\n\r\nare  doing  now is the result of what we have  been\r\n\r\nbequeathed with by the previous Government. And  as\r\n\r\nstated  by the Deputy Prime Minister, some of  them\r\n\r\nare   even  more  colonial  than  the  colonialists\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to culture. If I am not mistaken,\r\n\r\nthere  was  previously a cultural organisation,  an\r\n\r\narts  or  cultural body, to appeal  to  the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment, in regard to \"yellow\" films,  rock  and\r\n\r\nroll,  which are detrimental to the moral being  of\r\n\r\nour youth and which should be abolished. But not  a\r\n\r\nsingle  step was taken and, thus, here  is  another\r\n\r\nproof  that  the previous Government was negligent.\r\n\r\nTo  be more accurate, the Ministers themselves were\r\n\r\nfond of such like dances, films, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

Sir,  we  of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nbelieve in that. But more than that, we would  like\r\n\r\nthe  Government to clarify whether  in  seeking  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  more just society they will  strive  to\r\n\r\nbring it about also by just means and methods,  and\r\n\r\nalso  in  a manner which bears the mark of  justice\r\n\r\nand  humanity.  Sir, in the not too  distant  past,\r\n\r\ndictators like Hitler and Mussolini, in the name of\r\n\r\njustice,  invaded  other countries  and  ordered  a\r\n\r\nmassacre  of  millions of inhabitants.  Talking  of\r\n\r\njustice,  Sir, we are reminded also of the immortal\r\n\r\nwords of Shakespeare in a famous play where he said\r\n\r\nthat \"earthly power doth then show like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGod's, when mercy seasons justice\". [Interruption.]\r\n\r\nWe  look  forward to a policy which  will  seek  to\r\n\r\nachieve  not only a more just society but  also  by\r\n\r\nmeans  and methods and in a manner to show  to  the\r\n\r\nworld  that  they also are just and humane  to  all\r\n\r\nsections of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in paragraph 1 of \"Economics and Finance\"\r\n\r\nwe  are  told that the Government will  \"place  the\r\n\r\nfinances  of  the  country on a sound  and  healthy\r\n\r\nbasis\".  Then it states that there is a \"threatened\r\n\r\ndeficit\", I repeat, Sir, \"threatened deficit\",  \"of\r\n\r\n$14  million for 1959\". Judging by the past records\r\n\r\nof  past Financial Secretaries, I am surprised that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance is also adopting the same\r\n\r\npolicy  by  saying  that  there  is  a  \"threatened\r\n\r\ndeficit\".  Every  year from 1947  onwards,  it  was\r\n\r\nfound that the \"threatened deficit\" always ended in\r\n\r\na  surplus.  This was due usually to unspent  votes\r\n\r\nand     under-estimated    items    of     revenue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Sir, instead  of  waiting  for  the\r\n\r\n\"threatened deficit\" to materialise, the Government [Interruption]-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon.

No  doubt  there  was  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nbalancing the Budget, but whereas the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance is able to ensure a balanced Budget, he has\r\n\r\npassed  some  of  the problems  to  probably  6,000\r\n\r\nfamilies - passing  on  worries  to  probably  30,000\r\n\r\npassengers on board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, Sir, that if it is necessary for the\r\n\r\ndeficit to be met, it can be met by spreading  that\r\n\r\nburden on others as well as on their own employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a belief - whether this is true or not the\r\n\r\nGovernment will have to clarify - that this step  was\r\n\r\ntaken as an act of political revenge.
