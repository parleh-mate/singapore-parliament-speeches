Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for t</B><B>he Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, when an NRIC holder reports a change of his address, the registration officer at the reporting centre would obliterate the old address on the NRIC by making cut grooves into the address section on the back of the NRIC with a metal inscriber. He then marks over it with permanent ink, before pasting the new address sticker over the old address.&nbsp; Any attempt to tamper with the change in address will show up. We started this procedure in April 1999 to address the problem of NRIC holders tearing off the sticker, and passing off the original address as the present address.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, we have put in place strict laws against those who tamper with their NRIC. Under the National Registration Act, any person who forges, erases, alters or falsifies any entry in or tampers with an identity card, can be fined up to $10,000, imprisoned for up to 10 years, or both. Using another person's address as his own is an act of cheating, which is an offence punishable under the Penal Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last three years, an average of 193,000 NRIC holders reported a change of address each year. We have made it convenient for those who need to report their new address by allowing them to do so at any Neighbourhood Police Centre or Police Post. The current procedure balances cost and convenience with security.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:BUDGET--><p align=left>Column No : 1351<p>\r\n\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2006 TO 31ST MARCH, 2007--><p align=left>Column No : 1352<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2006 TO 31ST MARCH, 2007<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Paper Cmd. 3 of 2006-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Paper Cmd. 3 of 2006)<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [6th Allotted Day].</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HEAD K - MINISTRY OF EDUCATION--><p align=left>Column No : 1352<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Head&nbsp;K - Ministry of&nbsp;Education (cont.)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resumption of Debate on Question [7th March, 2006],</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" - [Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question again proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, let me first thank Dr Amy Khor, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Zainudin Nordin for raising questions on what more we can do to engage students who are at risk of&nbsp; dropping out from our schools, what more we can do to get them to stay in school and benefit from the quality education that our schools provide. Dr Lily Neo and Dr Loo Chong Yong had raised similar issues during the Budget debate earlier.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, first, address the scale of the problem.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, students who drop out during their primary or secondary school years. This number has been coming down. As a percentage of each student cohort, the number of students who drops out without completing a secondary education has, in fact, declined from 3.6% of the cohort in 2003 to 2.6% of the cohort in 2005.&nbsp; But this is still too many - 2.6% of the cohort is about 1,200 students in each cohort - and we want to bring it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concern for us is the students who do complete their secondary education, but do not progress to a post-secondary education. We do not have a precise handle on the numbers because many of the students who do not enrol in our polytechnics, ITEs or junior colleges, in fact, go on to study in various private institutions, such as NAFA, LaSalle, SHATEC, and so on.&nbsp; And some of them go overseas. They have not dropped out, but are continuing their studies.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our main focus at the post-secondary level is on encouraging as many of our Normal (Technical) students as possible to go on to the ITE.&nbsp; We are making progress. The percentage of Normal (Technical) students who go on to ITE has been steadily increasing over the years. Last year, 76% of our Normal (Technical) students went on to ITE, up from 63% in 1998.&nbsp; The increase reflects the efforts of both the ITE and our secondary school teachers, who bring their students to the ITE campuses to see what they offer and get a taste of the range of courses they can take at the ITE. I will touch more on this later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, again, we want to do more. The number of Normal (Technical) students who choose not to go to the ITE translates to about 3.3% of the overall age cohort, which is about 1,500 students. We will do more to engage this group of students, and encourage them to go on to a post-secondary education.&nbsp; This is the second group we are focusing on, besides the group of students who drop out during their primary and secondary school years. We cannot completely prevent students from dropping out of school.&nbsp; The reasons why they drop out are varied, and the fundamental reasons usually lie outside the school. And, even within the school, there are no quick fixes to this problem.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working on several initiatives, beginning from the pre-primary level and extending all the way up to the ITE - initiatives to help students learn better, see the relevance of what they learn, and feel engaged in the school community. It is a challenging and complex task, and we are trying some new approaches. We are also working with MCYS and the various social agencies, so that what we try to do in schools goes hand in hand with efforts to strengthen the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, first, focus on a key initiative that Dr Amy Khor, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Dr Ong Seh Hong and others have referred to, which relates to vocational education. In each cohort, there is a small group of students who are unable to cope with the mainstream curriculum. In 2005, there were 1,100 students who failed the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).&nbsp; Of these 1,100, about 130 of them failed the PSLE for the third time.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, many of these students enrol at the two Vocational Training Centres (VTCs) under the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), eg, Geylang Serai VTC and Assumption Vocational Institute.&nbsp; But attrition is high, sometimes because of the lack of home support.&nbsp; 60% of the VTC students drop out. Of the 40% that do complete the programme, less than half made it to ITE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spoke to teachers, students and parents, to work out a new pathway that can help these students stay in education and get the best chance to succeed. First, we will open the doors to such students earlier, as Dr Amy Khor has suggested. Currently, the VTCs admit the students only after they have reached 14 years of age, and provide them with a two-year programme - which means that the student would first need to have failed his PSLE three times before he can enter the VTC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the VTC students and their parents told us that even with the best efforts of their primary schools, it was not helpful for them to keep repeating a PSLE curriculum that they were able to benefit from. There are also limits to what we can do to provide a more customised approach for these students while they remain in primary school, as they are distributed among many schools with no more than five or 10 students per school. So we should try to let them move beyond primary school, instead of waiting for them to take a third try at the PSLE, and move them up to a school where they can be provided with an education that is customised to their needs, and their different learning styles and abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will take a more holistic approach to engaging these students. They need a programme that not only focuses on building skills, but on nurturing emotional resilience and giving them a sense of belonging to the school. In fact, the students we spoke to - those who had gone through the VTC and succeeded in going onto the ITE - tell us that they find the teachers of the VTC warm and approachable. But they hope for a fuller environment, with a range of CCAs, for instance, a broader range of courses, and a more holistic and school-like environment.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will set up a new school to implement this new and enhanced pathway for students who can benefit from a more customised and practice-based curriculum. The new school, which will be called NorthLight School, will build on the current VTC programme and enhance it. Geylang Serai Vocational Training Centre will become a part of the new school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NorthLight School will admit students from January 2007. It will allow in students who have attempted the PSLE twice or more (in other words, 13 years old or older). It will thus be able to give them a longer programme - a three-year programme will be offered to students who have failed the PSLE twice and want to enter the school. Parents and students will retain the choice, if they wish, of repeating the PSLE a third time.&nbsp; The school will also be open to students who leave secondary school prematurely. We expect that it will start smallish, about 600 students, including the current Geylang Serai VTC students, and expand up to 1,400 students eventually, which is about the size of a regular school.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting the right school leaders and teachers is critical. Their conviction is critical.&nbsp; The MOE Committee that studied how we can enhance the VTC programme visited a number of similar schools abroad. One was the Life Learning Academy in San Francisco. In fact, it is set on an island called Treasure Island.&nbsp; It chooses students who have done very poorly in nearby schools and puts them together in a 'living and learning' community. The principal and teachers were passionate about what they were doing. The principal herself had a rough start in her youth, but turned her life around. She had a personal mission to help youth in trouble make good. One of the Chemistry teachers was an aerospace engineer who left a high-paying job because he wanted to do the same. And they were achieving results. Some of the school's students even made it to the top universities in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have put some effort into choosing the right people for NorthLight. We have chosen as NorthLight's first principal, an experienced MOE school leader with a zeal for helping students in difficulty. She is Mrs Chua Yen Ching, whose work in recent years as principal of Shuqun Secondary School has gained the attention of the school community and the public. Yen Ching has developed fresh approaches to re-define success for her students, and help them gain the confidence to pursue their dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be accompanied by many dedicated staff from the present Geylang Serai VTC, and other MOE teachers with a passion for helping this group of students. One of them won the Outstanding Youth in Education Award last year, for the way she has used the arts to reach out to students who feel disengaged from their studies. In fact, she had written a thorough report on how we should make more use of the arts to reach out to students at risk, which she had sent to me before she even&nbsp; knew that we would start a new school of this nature. The school will have a collection of passionate teachers like her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NorthLight School will aim to prepare as many of its students as possible for further education at&nbsp;ITE or apprenticeship with industry. It will also aim to give them skills and strengths that they can take with them through life. Its new three-year curriculum will have three key aspects: first, to place emphasis on developing emotional resilience and instilling essential life-skills, as Dr Amy Khor had also suggested, such as taking responsibility and managing relationships. These will take up a greater share of curriculum time but within a longer programme of three years. The school will also have a full CCA programme, including sports, games and the arts, so as to develop bonds amongst the students and develop character. The school will have more full-time, inhouse counsellors to advise and guide students facing social and emotional challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the school will adopt a hands-on and experiential approach to learning, suited to students who learn better in non-traditional classroom settings.&nbsp; As Mrs Chua Yen Ching put it to me, she wants NorthLight to be the school where \"School Comes Alive\" - where students find lessons interesting, and see their relevance to day-to-day life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, there will be a wider range of vocational options to stimulate students' interests and open up their career choices. Each of the options will have a 10-week long industrial attachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school's new approach to learning, especially its attempt to create a living and learning community for students where they apply what they learn in their classes in day-to-day real-world applications, will be of interest to some of our mainstream schools as well. The exchange of experience between NorthLight and the mainstream sector can throw up more ideas on how we can engage all our students and help them stay in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the new vocational pathway that Northlight School will provide, MOE is implementing several other targeted initiatives to assist students who are at risk of dropping out. We have mapped out a comprehensive approach, at various stages of the education system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, at pre-school. We know the early years in kindergarten are important in nurturing children's confidence and interest in learning. Children who are confident and eager to learn are more likely to take school seriously, and want to stay on in school. We have been helping to level up the quality of teachers in our kindergartens, and MOS Chan Soo Sen will be talking more about our approach. We are also working on some more targeted interventions at the pre-school level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is working with MCYS and other partners to help encourage every family to put their children in pre-school education. That is the first&nbsp; priority.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we are starting a prototype project with some neighbourhood kindergartens, aimed especially at helping children who do not receive adequate support at home. We&nbsp; are working with 10 neighbourhood kindergartens on what we call Project SEAL (Sustained Early Assistance for Learning). It is a multi-pronged effort and a multi-agency approach that pulls together expertise from several bodies. An important part of this prototype project is to identify young children with learning difficulties early while they are in kindergartens.&nbsp; For example, the Dyslexia Association of Singapore is developing a simple screening tool to help teachers identify children who need special help in language.&nbsp; MOE will then work with the kindergartens to customise the programme to support these children.&nbsp; The National Library Board will loan story books to supplement the kindergartens' reading resources and assist them to set up reading enrichment programmes for the children.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>12.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, primary schools, when the children enter Primary 1. We are enhancing the Learning Support Programme.&nbsp; As Mr Ong Ah Heng has pointed out, the Learning Support Programme is a critical piece in our strategy to help students who are not school-ready when they enter primary schools.&nbsp; The Learning Support Programme has helped many students.&nbsp; It is a specialised programme, focusing on basic oral language and reading skills.&nbsp; Each year, about 12%-14% of our Primary 1 pupils with weak basic language and literacy skills are identified for support in the programme.&nbsp; And on average, after one year of intervention, about one-third of the pupils supported by the programme will graduate from the programme and rejoin the regular classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now piloting an enhanced Learning Support Programme for English in 34 primary schools this year.&nbsp; It will further differentiate the students, because some of them need much more basic support than others.&nbsp; There is a group of students each year, with very weak language skills, who needs more targeted attention.&nbsp; We will put them through a more intensive reading support programme in the first instance.&nbsp; Over the longer term, if we can reach out to such students when they are in kindergartens, we can hopefully reduce the numbers in this group when they enter our primary schools.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another feature of our enhanced Learning Support Programme is a smaller group size.&nbsp; Pupils are supported in groups of no more than five pupils, as compared to 10 currently.&nbsp; MOE will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot at the end of this year, before fine-tuning and implementing it in all our schools from 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enhancement of the Learning Support Programme will also be supported by changes in English Language classes for all students in the early primary years.&nbsp; This will help all students, but it is particularly impactful for students from lower-income families - whose main language deficit is English, because it is not the language spoken at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have started a pilot programme, or what we call, SEED - English Language. SEED refers to the whole set of experiments we are taking in the early primary years, so SEED - English Language is an experiment that is taking place for English Language teaching.&nbsp; So this is a pilot programme.&nbsp; We have started in 30 schools this year to provide students with an enhanced curriculum for learning grammar and phonics, to help them learn English with confidence. I would not go into the details, but it involves a very careful and gradual building up of the students' language skills.&nbsp; And it also aims to develop amongst young children a love for reading at a young age, by providing more early exposure to books and engaging them in the conversation on what is being read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we are also rolling out Learning Support for Mathematics.&nbsp; We want children with a weak start in numbers to be able to catch up and follow the class.&nbsp; This is now being implemented in 50 schools at Primary 1, after it has spent the last four to five years piloting this programme, and it will be in all our schools from 2007. All the schools will be provided with additional teachers to provide support to Primary 1 pupils with a late start in numeracy skills.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also investing more to help students with special learning difficulties like dyslexia and ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) in our schools.&nbsp; By 2010, we will have 140 trained Special Needs Officers in our primary schools.&nbsp; We already have 28 of them in our primary schools currently.&nbsp; We are also aiming to train close to 100 officers for secondary schools and they will be concentrated in certain schools - some schools that will pull together resources for dyslexia, others for students who are autistic.&nbsp; These are students who do not have severe difficulties and can be well accommodated with our mainstream system and they can benefit from the mainstream curriculum. These provisions that we are making in the mainstream schools will complement what we are doing to improve quality and facilities in our special schools which cater to children with more significant learning difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, secondary schools.&nbsp; We are strengthening counselling resources in all our schools but with priority being given to the secondary schools because that is where the challenges of growing up are&nbsp; greatest.&nbsp; MOE is on track to providing all secondary schools with one&nbsp; full-time inhouse school counsellor by this year.&nbsp; Primary schools and junior colleges will receive a full-time counsellor by 2008.&nbsp; Many of the counsellors we are recruiting are former teachers or some current teachers who decided to switch to full-time counselling and some former principals.&nbsp; They understand students and they have a heart for them.&nbsp; And we put all of them through a rigorous six-month diploma course at NIE.&nbsp; It is early days, but so far this programme is working quite well.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the schools are not just reacting to problems, or dealing with problems as and when they arise and calling the counsellor in.&nbsp; They are taking a proactive approach well before the counsellor becomes necessary.&nbsp; It is a holistic approach, getting students to participate in CCAs, camps and other school activities, so that they develop bonds amongst each other and develop confidence in themselves.&nbsp; The schools are helping students find the best in themselves, whether in their studies or in their CCAs and other activities.&nbsp; This proactive approach to developing bonds among students and creating a sense of attachment to the school is being enhanced in all our schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another initiative is the Normal (Technical) course.&nbsp; We are implementing a revised Normal (Technical) curriculum with a more practical orientation, to better engage students in their learning.&nbsp; The curriculum content is being made more meaningful to students by relating what they learn to daily life.&nbsp; There will be greater emphasis on group work and presentations, creativity, hands-on activities and use of IT, and new ways of assessing the Normal (Technical) students, such as evaluating their coursework, either individually or in groups, instead of the traditional pen-and-paper test.&nbsp;We will start rolling out the revised Normal (Technical) curriculum in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the revised approach to Normal (Technical), we also introduced elective modules last year to create opportunities to broaden the experiences of the students.&nbsp; The students enjoy the elective modules tremendously because of the more practical and hands-on nature of these modules.&nbsp; But they also develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of their learning quite often.&nbsp; One of our principals gave me an example of students who attended an elective module on baking at the Baking Industry Training Centre.&nbsp; They were learning to make swiss rolls.&nbsp; But the four-hour session on swiss rolls also made Mathematics come alive, as the students have to calculate the correct proportion of water, flour, sugar and the other ingredients, in order to bake delicious swiss rolls.&nbsp; The students were so engaged that they asked if the session could be extended to a longer time.&nbsp; And the session also gave ideas to the school teacher who was there, on how to conduct the regular classes for the Normal (Technical) students back in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elective modules are catching on in our schools. More than 40% of schools which offer the Normal (Technical) course are now offering at least one elective module to their students, in a whole range of areas from digital videography to basic mechatronics.&nbsp; They are making schools more interesting and more relevant to life for the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next piece is what we are doing at ITE.&nbsp; We are making ITE a centre of excellence in technical education.&nbsp; All across Asia and, indeed, internationally, ITE's reputation is now up there - it is well-known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ITE's key improvements are in two areas in recent years: new courses to keep pace with the interest of students and the needs of industry, and closer collaboration with industry to ensure that ITE students find fruitful employment after graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes are making an impact.&nbsp; ITE has been attracting more school leavers, year after year, with enrolment of full-time students reaching a high of 23,000 in 2005.&nbsp; As I shared earlier, more and more of our Normal (Technical) students are going on to ITE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ITE's attrition rate has also been decreasing.&nbsp; In 2005, the proportion of students who left&nbsp;ITE without a qualification was about 12% of ITE's full-time enrolment, compared to 17% just five years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin also asked about the relevance of ITE's training to industry.&nbsp; This is something that is foremost in ITE's mind.&nbsp; The market is the best test and the best testimony.&nbsp; According to the ITE graduate employment survey, the last one done in June last year, 89% of ITE graduates found jobs within five months of job search.&nbsp; After 10 years on the job market, ITE graduates had doubled their starting salaries.&nbsp; And more ITE graduates are moving up the educational ladder. Within 10 years from graduation, 10%-12% had acquired degree qualifications and a further 24% had diploma qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can see, we are taking a comprehensive approach in education to address students who are at risk of dropping out at various stages.&nbsp; We are adopting new approaches to help students at risk, from the early years up. We will learn from the experience of these experiments and improve the programmes as we roll them out.&nbsp; I have to repeat that there are no short cuts to reducing drop-out rates.&nbsp; The problems are complex and often rooted in the home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we want is to try harder and do better, and we will.&nbsp; We will help ensure that students are better prepared for school, help them to get a good start in their early primary years, remain engaged through secondary school, and after leaving school go on to a first-class education at ITE that prepares them for employment and further education.&nbsp; And we will provide the NorthLight School a new holistic approach to engaging students who need a more active, hands-on and practice-based approach to learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Members once again for their interest&nbsp;and suggestions on this important topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</B> Sir, Dr Amy Khor raised a number of questions on the Gifted Education Programme (GEP).&nbsp; Allow me to put the GEP into context.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1984, we have established the Gifted Education Programme&nbsp;to cater for the top 1% of our students.&nbsp; The programme provides an enriched curriculum to nurture these intellectually gifted students.&nbsp; It develops their skills in critical and creative thinking, as well as problem solving and allows them to work with specialists through mentorship programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, our education system is more diversified. It provides different opportunities for all students to discover and develop their talents. We have schools with different specialisation and niches as well as different programmes to suit different needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But GEP remains relevant in this broader context of talent development.&nbsp; The core focus of the programme will remain, that is, to meet the educational needs of intellectually gifted students.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we will build on the strong foundation we have achieved and enhance it further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, we have been moving towards greater decentralisation in the shaping of gifted education in schools. The introduction of Integrated Programme (IP) in schools, that are also GEP centres, has allowed these schools to develop their own school-based gifted programmes to stretch their students.&nbsp; The introduction of Specialised Independent Schools also opens up other new branches in gifted education.&nbsp; The NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, for example, offers a whole school approach to developing students with exceptional talents in Mathematics and Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the primary level, we will continue to have special classes to cater to the top 1% of the cohort in nine GEP centres.&nbsp; Because these students are drawn from a large number of schools, it is more practical to gather them in a few primary schools to provide them with customised learning programmes.&nbsp; However, schools will create more opportunities for GEP students to interact with their non-GEP schoolmates, and develop as well-rounded individuals. The interactions should enrich the learning experience for all students involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At secondary level, over 90% of GEP students have joined the Integrated Programme in IP schools.&nbsp; With most GEP students in IP schools, we have therefore moved from a centrally-run MOE programme for all GEP students to giving these schools the flexibility to shape their own approaches to gifted education.&nbsp; They will cater to gifted students within the broader context of talent development that the schools have embarked on.&nbsp; This is in line with the mandate of IP schools to develop our top students by providing broader learning opportunities beyond the 'O' level syllabus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for GEP students who did not join the IP, they will be nurtured through other types of school-based programmes for higher ability students in non-IP schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These enhancements to the Gifted Education Programme aim to make the programme more effective and customised for our intellectually gifted students.&nbsp; Besides the GEP, MOE is also studying ways to identify and develop talents in specialised areas, as well as in non-academic areas, such as sports and arts.&nbsp; There are students with exceptional abilities in just one or two areas but who are not part of the GEP.&nbsp; By providing diverse opportunities in different areas, we hope that more talents can be groomed and that there will be space and opportunities for every talent to develop to the fullest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>12.30 pm<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about the quality of the pre-school sector.&nbsp; Pre-school education lays the foundation for learning in subsequent years.&nbsp; As pointed out by Mr Yeo, there is a diverse range of pre-school programmes in the market.&nbsp; The diversity provides parents with a wide range of choices.&nbsp; However, this does not mean that MOE takes a hands-off approach towards kindergartens.&nbsp; In the past few years, MOE has put in place various initiatives at key leverage points to raise the overall quality of pre-school education in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we have defined the desired outcomes of pre-school education in 2000 to provide direction for the sector.&nbsp; These include moral and social outcomes, such as knowing what is right and wrong, being able to relate to others and being curious and able to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, MOE has formulated and disseminated a kindergarten curriculum framework and teachers' resource package to guide pre-schools to design a curriculum best suited to younger children.&nbsp; To enable kindergartens to examine their own practices in identified areas for improvement, MOE has designed an instrument called Pursuing Excellence at Kindergartens (PEAK) and disseminated it to all kindergartens in 2003 to encourage them to conduct yearly self-appraisals.&nbsp; As at December 2005, 80% of the kindergartens have conducted self-appraisals using PEAK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, MOE has worked on one of the most important factors affecting pre-school education, ie, the quality of teachers.&nbsp; To upgrade the expertise of pre-school practitioners, we have articulated the professional qualifications that kindergarten principals and teachers must have by January 2006 and January 2008 respectively.&nbsp; To help non-profit kindergartens meet these requirements, MOE provides a recurrent grant to incentivise them to upgrade the quality of their staff and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, we will be working with 10 neighbourhood kindergartens on project SEAL (for Sustained Early Assistance for Learning), which my Minister has just mentioned.&nbsp; Through this project, we hope that children in the kindergartens with learning difficulties can be identified early and given help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these measures will take time to bear fruit.&nbsp; With these measures, MOE aims to raise the overall quality of pre-school education in Singapore over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also suggested that the Opportunity Fund be extended to pre-schools.&nbsp; The Opportunity Fund for schools aims to level the opportunities for needy students in terms of enrichment activities.&nbsp; At the pre-school level, MCYS provides the Kindergartens Financial Assistance Scheme to subsidise kindergarten fees for needy students.&nbsp; We feel that this is a more targeted approach to help needy children to have access to pre-school education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me thank Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Ong Ah Heng for their support and interest in the teaching of Mother Tongue languages.&nbsp; I will update Members on the changes made to the learning of Chinese Language.&nbsp; My colleague, Mr Hawazi Daipi, will later elaborate on the implementation of recommendations on the Malay Language and Tamil Language education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilingualism in English and Mother Tongue languages is an asset for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Indeed, bilingualism is the cornerstone of our education system.&nbsp; English is likely to remain the <I>lingua franca</I> of the world for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; On the other hand, learning one's own Mother Tongue helps in building cultural identity and knowing one's roots.&nbsp; It also opens doors to more economic opportunities.&nbsp; In fact, a recent report commissioned by the British Council proclaimed that those who were monolingual in English \"'faced a bleak economic future' as multilingual competitors flood into the workforce from all corners of the globe\".&nbsp; Therefore, we must maintain our linguistic edge of being a multilingual society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the last two years, the Ministry of Education separately conducted reviews on all of our Mother Tongues, ie, Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language, in their curriculum as well as pedagogy.&nbsp; The findings and recommendations from the three reviews set the tone and direction for the teaching and learning of the Mother Tongue languages in the next five to 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the Committee on Chinese Language has recommended a curriculum to enthuse all Chinese Language students and develop in them an abiding interest in Chinese Language and culture.&nbsp; This will be achieved through a more customised and flexible modular curriculum at the primary level.&nbsp; Furthermore, greater emphasis will be placed on oral fluency and reading for the majority of students.&nbsp; Other key recommendations include making CL learning interesting, relevant and engaging, aligning examinations with the revised curriculum, providing more opportunities to use and learn Chinese Language in schools and greater community support.&nbsp; With this framework, the case mentioned by Dr Ong Seh Hong yesterday should not arise.&nbsp; I would want to recommend to Dr Ong Seh Hong that he propose to his constituent to provide the feedback to the school.&nbsp; I am sure it will be very, very happy to look at what the children have gone through and see how it can rectify it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the completion of the CL review, two committees have been set up.&nbsp; One of them is the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, which is chaired by me.&nbsp; The Committee is working on five areas, ie, Chinese Language education in pre-schools, reading, writing, engaging the media as well as educational exchange programmes.&nbsp; I want to say that the support from the Chinese community to the review on Chinese Language teaching has been very forthcoming.&nbsp; In fact, the Chinese community has come forward to initiate a Chinese Language and Culture Fund to raise the standard of Chinese in Singapore.&nbsp; It has already raised more than $7 million out of its $10 million target, and the Government has provided a dollar-for-dollar matching grant to bring its total sum to more than $14 million currently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all these initiatives, support and resources, we hope to create a greater environment in which Chinese is a living language for our students.&nbsp; I am happy to note that more schools and students are showing enthusiasm for learning Chinese.&nbsp; At present, more than one-quarter of our schools have twinning programmes with schools in China.&nbsp; Schools from primary up to tertiary level have organised many immersion programmes to China for students as well as teachers.&nbsp; These exchanges will allow our students to pick up the language more naturally as well as deepen their appreciation of the Chinese culture and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second committee, which I think is a more important committee, is the Chinese Language Curriculum and Pedagogy Implementation Steering Committee, which is chaired by Mr Wee Heng Tin, former Director-General of Education.&nbsp; Mr Wee's committee coordinates and oversees the implementation of the recommendations from the Chinese Language review.&nbsp; Let me provide Members with an update on the enhancements made to the teaching of Chinese Language so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education is piloting the modular Chinese Language curriculum at Primary 1 and Primary 2 in 25 schools this year.&nbsp; Under this approach, students study a Core Module for 70%-80% of the curriculum.&nbsp; On top of this, they can take a Bridging Module or an Enrichment Module, depending on their ability and interest.&nbsp; If they are relatively weak, they can take the Bridging Module.&nbsp; If they are relatively strong, then they can take the Enrichment Module.&nbsp; This helps ensure a baseline standard without a ceiling effect (\ufffd?\u5e95\ufffd?\ufffd?\u9876), ie, ensure that there is a strong base but we do not impose a ceiling for those who can achieve more.&nbsp; The modular curriculum will be implemented across all primary levels by 2010.&nbsp; Feedback from students, teachers and parents from pilot schools has been positive and encouraging so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong shared that one of his young constituents encountered a teacher who emphasised rote learning.&nbsp; I want to assure him again that this is precisely the type of teaching approach which we hope to change.&nbsp; Many of the Chinese Language teachers, I spoke to, are passionate about teaching the language and, in fact, many of them have come up with very creative ways of helping their students learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese Language teachers in many schools are embarking on pedagogical experimentation to make learning more engaging for their students.&nbsp; At Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School, Chinese Language teachers use a thematic approach on \"Chinese Traditional Herbs\" to make CL learning come alive.&nbsp; Other examples include the use of comics in Dunman Secondary School, broadcasting programmes in Xin Min Secondary and blog diary in Tanjong Katong Girls' School.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has organised more than 15 sharing sessions to propagate good practices, and we will continue to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting from this year, we will introduce an interim examination format at PSLE and at O-levels.&nbsp; Handheld CL-to-CL electronic dictionaries will be allowed in the CL composition component of national examinations from 2007 as an alternative to the print dictionary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new Literature in Chinese syllabus is being offered to O-level students starting this year.&nbsp; The new syllabus has included more works of eminent local writers and contemporary literature, which we believe are closer to students' interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we have set up a fourth Chinese Language Elective Programme Centre in Jurong Junior College and three more Zonal Centres of Excellence to promote best practices in CL learning and teaching to other schools.&nbsp; These additional zonal centres are in Pei Chun Public School, Chung Cheng High School (Main) and CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls' School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong asked whether fewer students were taking Chinese Language as a result of the change in university admission criteria in 2004.&nbsp; I would like to say that, in the same year, MOE also relaxed the criteria for students to take Higher Chinese at secondary level.&nbsp; Since the changes, in fact, more students have opted to take Higher Chinese at O-level and A-level.&nbsp; At the AO-level in the junior college, the number of students taking the subject has remained roughly the same, but what has changed is that fewer students have opted to retake the CL 'AO' examination at JC2.&nbsp;Previously, JC students have been retaking their CL 'AO' examinations to better their scores because it is compulsory to count it for university admission.&nbsp; Since then there is a drop in the candidature for the CL 'AO' examination at JC2, not the number of students taking CL.&nbsp; Therefore, I would say that the situation is promising.&nbsp; There is no decline in number nor interest in the learning of Chinese Language in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chay Wai Chuen suggested allowing Singaporean students to learn each other's language, with a focus on conversational skills.&nbsp; MOE encourages our schools to offer such lessons to students.&nbsp; We are very encouraged to note that 60 schools have already initiated programmes for students to pick up conversational skills in either Malay Language or Chinese Language.&nbsp; To facilitate them, MOE provides schools with teaching guides and allows schools to tap on existing resource provisions to conduct these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-native students, who are keen and interested to study Malay or Chinese Language to a higher level, can also take these subjects as third languages, which will have a greater emphasis on listening as well as speaking skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all this, we need to be realistic.&nbsp; Not all students have the ability to cope with a third language.&nbsp; In fact, it is a very big challenge for most of us to master just two languages.&nbsp; Besides Malay and Chinese Languages, MOE also offers French, German and Japanese as third languages. Mr Chay suggested Spanish could be offered to our students.&nbsp; I would like to say that if there is strong student interest and demand for it to be offered Spanish as a third language, we are open to this proposal provided our resources permit.&nbsp; But the important thing is students' interest.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked whether it might be more cost-effective to refurbish and upgrade school buildings, especially to preserve its sentimental value, rather than just demolish and build new ones elsewhere. Wherever possible, the Ministry of Education does refurbish and upgrade school buildings, instead of demolishing and building new ones. This is for better cost-effectiveness, as well as to preserve the feeling of loyalty from the students to the school.&nbsp; But this is done only when the current site is still suitable, in terms of location, size as well as population catchment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in many instances, a school building is vacated due to merger or relocation of schools. This usually reflects the falling demand of school places in that vicinity, because the estate has matured. At the same time, new demand is created in new towns as young couples set up homes and younger families move in.&nbsp; Therefore, we will continue to see the Ministry of Education building new schools in newer estates like Punggol in line with population characteristics.&nbsp; We are, however, looking into merging schools in more mature estates, such as Jurong, precisely to avoid having a school with no students and, therefore, wasting land and physical resources. Vacated school sites are returned to the Singapore Land Authority to put to alternative use, or sometimes, it may be used for holding schools for the Ministry of Education's Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools (PRIME).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan also commented that some primary school buildings are too large.&nbsp; He specifically mentioned Henry Park Primary School, which is a very popular school with parents. Since PRIME in 1999, almost all our primary schools are built with standard 42 classrooms.&nbsp; In the case of Henry Park Primary School, it was built to be slightly larger to provide it with another six classrooms to run the Gifted Education Programme to cater to the additional Primary 4 to 6 students for the programme. This explains why the school campus is slightly larger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan expressed concern that the larger campus may be too imposing for the young students. We would like to assure him that Primary 1 students are grouped into smaller class size of 30 each and they are buddied with an older primary student who will look after them and bring them around in the first few weeks of school, so that the new students are comfortable with the new environment. As for the ramp in front of Henry Park Primary, which Dr Tan mentioned, it is a traffic safety feature that is put in place because of the larger enrolment in Henry Park.&nbsp; It helps to ease traffic congestion entering the school by separating the buses that go to the ground level and the cars which will go up to the elevated level. Therefore, having that ramp is necessary for the safety of our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chan, you may want to leave some time&nbsp;for the rest of&nbsp;the replies&nbsp;for your &nbsp;Ministry.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</B> <p><br>\r\nYes, Sir.&nbsp; Dr Tan Cheng Bock also asked for the Ministry's stand on teachers who give their handphone numbers to students and parents. I want to say that respect for teachers is central to education.&nbsp; Our teachers play an important role in nurturing and developing our young.&nbsp; MOE believes in upholding the standing of teachers so that the role is not compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of their work, teachers may be required to share their personal contact numbers with their colleagues and supervisors so that they remain contactable. This is especially necessary during times of emergency. Teachers are also encouraged to maintain contact with their students and&nbsp;parents, and many of them do, but they are not compelled to disclose their personal contact numbers to their students or parents if they feel uncomfortable in doing so. Teachers will normally, however, provide their students and parents with either their office or staff room numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools value good relationship with parents and will work with them in the interest of their children as far as it is possible. The Ministry of Education does not condone harassment of teachers by parents and view any such harassments seriously.&nbsp; In addition, I want to say that anybody found verbally abusing a civil servant could be taken to task in a court of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, just a brief response to Mr Ang Mong Seng's point about school bags. I want to say that this has nothing to do with Teach Less, Learn More, but it has something to do with our normal <I>kiasu</I> attitude.&nbsp; When I was a student, I also carried all the books to school when it was not necessary to do so.&nbsp; With proper planning, in fact, students only need to bring whatever that is required to school.&nbsp; In school, there are also places and lockers that they can keep their stuff.&nbsp; So it is not necessary for the students to carry exceptionally heavy school bags to school. Having said that, if parents notice that their children's school bags are still too heavy, maybe they should go through with them and see whatever is necessary or unnecessary for them to bring to school.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, to be able to bring the necessary books and leave the unnecessary stuff at home is also a very good habit of housekeeping.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> I wonder if the Minister could make a clarification for me.&nbsp; I wonder if the enhanced Learning Support Programme is made available to those PSLE students who have failed three times.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> I am sorry that I did not make myself fully clear on this.&nbsp; In fact, students who have failed three times would certainly go into the NorthLight School.&nbsp; In addition, the school will also open its doors to students who have failed twice and who wish to progress on to that school, whereas&nbsp; previously, you need to have failed three times and reached the age of at least 14 years old before you can enter one of the VTCs.&nbsp; So the first group is still a very important target group, ie, those who have failed three times.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir,&nbsp;I would like to seek two clarifications on school drop-outs.

Currently, all schools draw on a network of social workers, both those who are working part-time with the schools as well as those provided through the entire MCYS' network, the Family Service Centres and the various voluntary agencies.&nbsp; And we are taking this a step further. We are going to provide full-time counsellors in each of our secondary schools by the end of this year and even primary schools by 2008 - people who can try to help the teachers to spot problems early and prevent students from coming to a point where they make the wrong decision of dropping out of school.&nbsp; So it is something which we are working on and, in fact, it is a question of recruiting the right people and putting them through a training pipeline before sending them out to the schools.&nbsp; It takes a bit of time but we are getting there.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her second question, this is a very important focus, particularly for the pre-primary years, but also for the older children.&nbsp; MOE, MCYS and all the community agencies, as well as some specialist agencies, those that specialise in students with specific learning difficulties like the Dyslexia Association, for instance, are working together quite closely.&nbsp; First, to make sure that at the pre-primary level, every family sends their kid to kindergarten. Secondly, to be able to detect students with learning difficulties early and have a multi-pronged approach to helping that child and also, sometimes, having to help the family realise the importance of education and try to provide some support for the kids when they are in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is a lot of work, a very challenging task, quite complex, no easy fix, but we are trying hard.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Chairman, I would like to ask the Minister what about the Inter-ministry Committee to relieve the congestion on the road itself.&nbsp; Basically, we still see a lot of congestion in the main road in front of all the schools, even for those which have undergone PRIME as well.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> <p>That is not a topic that pertains to the matter I was talking about.&nbsp; There is progress being made.&nbsp; I do not have the details.

The schools appraise based on the guidelines, and they learn a lesson from it.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education does not micro-manage the kindergartens.&nbsp; They remain private.&nbsp; We feel that it is good to have a very diversified range of kindergartens in the market.&nbsp; The reason is really one of&nbsp; resources.&nbsp; Mr Yeo is trying to, I think, persuade the Ministry of Education to start implementing official programmes before the age of six, maybe playing a much more active role in K1 and K2, or maybe bringing in pre-primary education.&nbsp; But the point is this.&nbsp; Resources are limited.&nbsp; We would rather concentrate on the age beyond the compulsory education requirement, do a good job out of it and put in a good LSP programme to make sure that all the students are up to speed.&nbsp; Because, if were to keep on moving down the age, resources and commitments are going to be greater and, frankly, the issue is also an iterative one.&nbsp; If we were to go down to five-year olds, then the question would be how about the education programme for those who are three or four years old, and so on.&nbsp; So, I think there is no end to it.&nbsp; Our strategy is to concentrate on those years starting from the year that compulsory education becomes compulsory, and do a good job out of it.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> I take it that the Member is referring to the Learning Support Programmes in the early primary years.&nbsp; It has been working quite well.&nbsp; It is an intervention which, by international reckoning, has achieved more success than most.&nbsp; 12%-14% of Primary 1 students go through the programme in the first year.&nbsp; About one-third&nbsp;is able to graduate out of the programme and join regular classes after one year.&nbsp; It does not mean that we solve all their problems, but I think we have achieved a lot to correct early deficits.&nbsp; Second year, another portion of them, also at the end of the second year, managed to graduate to regular classes.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite resource-intensive because we have got to train up teachers, especially to deal with the students in these Learning Support Programmes - small classes, different teaching methods.&nbsp; It is not something that you can just scale up at the word \"Go\".&nbsp; I think we can do more.&nbsp; We can do more in Primary 3, 4 and 5.&nbsp; I do not think we have the resources to continue our Learning Support Programmes for four or five years.&nbsp; It would be more practical to improve what we are doing in Primary 1 and 2, which is what we are doing.&nbsp; We will not be able to reduce the failure rate to zero.&nbsp; In fact, if we reduce the failure rate to zero, it would probably mean that examinations are not doing what they are meant to do.&nbsp; If a student has not mastered the basics, it should be reflected in his grades.&nbsp; What we have got to do is to keep trying to improve our teaching, and where a child is really not able to benefit from a regular academic curriculum, even the EM3 curriculum, find something else that he can do well in, take an interest in,&nbsp; motivate him, that gives him confidence, which is what we are trying to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we have a whole set of initiatives, starting from pre-primary to early-primary, through primary school upwards, plus having the NorthLight School, that would provide a holistic approach for this group of students who are not suited to a regular academic curriculum.&nbsp; Let us give them time.&nbsp; I can assure him that we are putting a lot more efforts and resources into this, a lot more time and a lot more expertise, quite apart from the financial resources, which is the easier part.&nbsp; I think we will achieve success as we go along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not unique in facing this problem.&nbsp; In fact, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, our problems are not large.&nbsp; We think they are too large for us.&nbsp; We want to do more, 2.6% of kids dropping out&nbsp; is far too large a number, as far as we are concerned.&nbsp; But they are not large by international standard.&nbsp; If you look at the UK drop-out rates, if you take those who drop out all the way through the end of secondary school, they are far higher.&nbsp; And truancy rates are extremely high for those who remain in school.&nbsp; I was just reading a report by the National Drop-out Prevention Centre in the United States, in some US cities, as much as 50% of the pupils are totally disengaged from their studies.&nbsp; I am not saying that that should give us comfort.&nbsp; All I am trying to say is that this is a problem the world over - truancy and dropping-out.&nbsp; Our problems are not large by international standard, but they are too big for us, too big for our comfort and we want to do more, and we will do more.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The truth is, many of our teenagers are having sex.&nbsp; We do not need technology like mobile phones to highlight this.&nbsp; The starting point would be the 2,000-plus teenage pregnancies a year.&nbsp; But, nowadays, it would seem youths are having sex at an earlier age.&nbsp; I believe the call to improve our sexuality education has been made before.&nbsp; But&nbsp;has anything changed?&nbsp; I can cut and paste the reply that was given in Parliament two years ago from MOE's current webpage on sexuality education.&nbsp; Why is that?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this Government tries very hard to be pragmatic.&nbsp; It does not ban prostitution.&nbsp; It legalises it.&nbsp; Does anyone say, therefore, that the Government is anti-marriage?&nbsp; Sir, I think the key message in MOE's sexuality education should be adjusted.&nbsp; I agree we should teach our children to love and respect others as they love and respect themselves.&nbsp; However, to premise our sexuality education on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society is not going to help teens who have had and who are having sex, because it is not relevant to them.&nbsp; This is the premise that presents and promotes abstinence until marriage and, therefore, a premise that excludes those who need help, knowledge and good counsel the most.&nbsp; Above all else, sexuality education must deal with the realities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can recognise why pupils are taught to understand and respect the attitudes, values and beliefs regarding sexuality propagated by other communities, but do our communities&nbsp;recognise why sexuality education must be approached, most importantly, from the point of view of the adolescents?&nbsp; It is the best way to connect with him or her.&nbsp; It is the best way to create an environment where a pupil can feel more comfortable confiding in an adult.&nbsp; In other words, it is the best way to help our children to exercise responsibilities and make informed decisions with which they can live.&nbsp; But we should not fool ourselves to think we can make this decision on behalf of our children, which means sexuality education should not come with a moralistic-laden approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, a sexuality workshop at a junior college triggered a furore precisely because of this.&nbsp; It is a pity because external organisations and individuals can play a useful role.&nbsp; They can complement teachers by providing an objective third party perspective.&nbsp; However, I would like to ask if MOE has an accreditation scheme for groups which teach sexuality education.&nbsp; In this way, MOE is responsible to ensure that sexuality education is kept objective and schools need not fret about hidden agenda should they outsource such programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from helping teens to protect themselves from sexual abuse, our educators should ask if they have been successful in staying on top of the trend and real-life dilemmas of our teens.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for the Minister's assessment on this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I understand that some parents have complained that their children were channelled to CCA that they are not interested in.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry could clarify to what extent this is true and what is the Ministry's plan to ensure that all our students can pursue their interest through CCA, and not joining CCA for the sake of having one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, most of the students, particularly those in&nbsp;secondary and Pre-U, have to take their meals in school canteens.&nbsp; I would like to know whether the Ministry is monitoring the price and&nbsp;quality of the food providers in the school canteens.&nbsp; With more and more schools tendering out their canteen operation, would there be an adverse impact on the quality and price of the food provided for our students in the school?&nbsp; I hope the Ministry would also monitor this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many students have also voiced the concern that there is no place for them to play sports game, for example, football, during weekends.&nbsp; I would like to know how many schools have so far opened their school fields to the community to enable our kids to play football during weekends?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

When used, it shall expose the school children, on a daily basis, to extreme danger.&nbsp; I have no doubt in my mind that if the Minister allows that bus-stop,&nbsp;facing the open road to be used, one of these days, a child shall be knocked down or even killed by on-coming traffic.&nbsp; If the Minister does not want that to happen, then it is best not to use that bus-stop in the open road.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B>&nbsp;(<I>In Mandarin</I>): Sir, the number of young people joining grassroots organisations&nbsp;in community service is on a declining trend in recent years, resulting in a lack of successors for our community leaders.&nbsp; Singapore has a population of 4 million but only 26,000 people participate in activities of the grassroots organisations, accounting for only 0.65% of the population.&nbsp; Volunteers in our local charitable organisations make up another 15.2%, making a total of 15.85%. This is inferior compared to other countries.&nbsp; In the USA, it is 44%; in the UK, it is 47.5%; in Hong Kong, it is 22%.&nbsp; With an ageing population, we need more young people to participate in community activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, in my constituency, there are many students who volunteer to take part in our youth group organisations and&nbsp;help us to organise community activities.&nbsp; I suggest that the Ministry of Education&nbsp;allows the participation in grassroots organisations' activities to be considered as a form of regular co-curricular activity for the schools.&nbsp; This will encourage more young people to take part in community activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can then have more volunteers to serve our people and to promote our community activities, enhance our cohesiveness and, together, we can build a warm and harmonious society for our multi-racial and multi-cultural society.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will also help to arrest the declining number of grassroots leaders.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think this is very important in such a multi-racial and multi-cultural society.&nbsp; We will be able to respect one another's culture, traditions and customs.&nbsp; This is very important to a multi-racial society like ours.&nbsp; If we cannot start to inculcate in our students from the primary schools on such a concept,&nbsp;it would be very difficult&nbsp;later on to persuade them to come forward and serve the community, even when called upon by&nbsp;Government leaders to&nbsp;do so.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Mr Chairman, schools play an important role in providing students with the education necessary not just for their academic development but also their holistic development as individuals.&nbsp; I thank Members for their interest in ensuring that our schools provide well for our students, not just in \"hard\" aspects such as academic performance, but also in \"softer\" aspects and equally important aspects of ensuring that they will grow up to be well adjusted and responsible members of the society.&nbsp; I wish to stress, however, that in these efforts, MOE and the schools must be supported - by parents, the community and the media.&nbsp; MOE is always keen to engage stakeholders in the well being and proper development of our students, but this is the responsibility that lies with all of us.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first thank Mr Zainudin Nordin for his question on the work of the committees that were set up to promote Malay and Tamil languages.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education conducted comprehensive reviews of the teaching and learning of Malay and Tamil last year.&nbsp; The conclusion of both reviews was the articulation of a vision of Malay and Tamil being closely intertwined with the Singapore society in which they are practised.&nbsp; For Malay, the vision is in the development of Arif Budiman, a Malay expression that encapsulates the learned person who contributes to society and nation.&nbsp; For Tamil, the vision is for it to be a living language and a vibrant part of our multi-racial society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We fully agree with Mr Zainudin that the promotion of Malay and Tamil, therefore, has to be a community effort in partnership with stakeholders.&nbsp; In February 2006, MOE set up the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee, chaired by myself, and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee, chaired by Mr S Iswaran, Deputy Speaker of Parliament.&nbsp; The terms of reference are precisely to collaborate with Malay and Tamil communities to organise activities to promote the teaching and learning of these languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role of these Committees is also to win support from the communities to pursue these goals.&nbsp; The two Committees will therefore work with Malay and Tamil community organisations, institutes of higher learning, the media, parents as well as schools. The mandate will be to collaboratively organise language, literature and cultural activities to expand the space in which Malay and Tamil are used in our daily lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organisation of these activities is aimed at supporting and complementing the present efforts of the Malay and Tamil communities to promote these languages.&nbsp; So the two committees are not to supplement the existing efforts by the communities.&nbsp; We hope that they will provide momentum for language, literary and cultural groups to come together in a sustained and focused effort to promote the living and&nbsp;daily use of Malay and Tamil.&nbsp; If, through these activities, we are able to infuse in Malay and Tamil Singaporeans a sense of excitement about the role of these languages in their daily lives, I am confident that this would be the most successful type of&nbsp; \"movement\" that Mr Zainudin talked about.&nbsp; Indeed, we need all the collaborative efforts of the whole community to support the use of the Mother tongues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the teaching of the Malay&nbsp; and Tamil languages, Mr Ong Ah Heng sought updates on the review of the teaching and learning of these two Mother tongues.&nbsp; To spearhead these efforts, MOE has set up working committees for the implementation of the new Malay and Tamil Language curriculum and pedagogy.&nbsp; The committees will also implement new initiatives for assessment, examinations and teacher training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key initiatives would include opening up more space for classroom discussion, giving greater emphasis to assignments that require deeper thinking, and providing differentiated instruction to cater to students from different backgrounds and of different abilities.&nbsp; There will also be more focus on oral communication skills.&nbsp; Such initiatives will provide a richer classroom experience. MOE will implement the new Malay and Tamil curriculum at Primary 1 to Primary 4, starting from 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on sexuality education, Mr Ong Ah Heng and Ms Eunice Olsen asked about the effectiveness of the sexuality education programme in our schools.&nbsp; Sexuality matters have become increasingly complicated in a rapidly changing world with evolving mores.&nbsp; We all recognise this.&nbsp; Why adolescents indulge in sexual behaviour that results in teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases is a complex issue.&nbsp; Lack of family support, low self-esteem and lack of understanding about the responsibilities in relationships are among the contributing factors.&nbsp; Many forces, including the influence of the family and media, contribute to shaping the attitudes of teenagers towards sexuality&nbsp;-&nbsp;rightly or wrongly.&nbsp; To tackle these issues, I cannot stress enough the necessity of parents, the community and the media also playing their part to inculcate sound values in our children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is MOE's approach&nbsp;to sexuality education?&nbsp; Sir, sexuality education is provided for all students in our schools.&nbsp; The emphasis of the programme is ensuring that students have the knowledge and ability to make responsible, informed choices, a point that Ms Olsen alluded to.&nbsp; It is premised on the importance of the family as the unit of society&nbsp;-&nbsp;an objective, a vision that we still hold to&nbsp;- which is a sensible approach that acknowledges the nature of our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the formal curriculum as well as the co-curricular programme, the \"Growing Years Series\", schools provide students with the knowledge that they need to make responsible decisions about relationships.&nbsp; The \"Growing Years Series\" discusses the consequences of teenage sexual activity, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.&nbsp; As a realistic approach to dealing with these issues, the Science curriculum at secondary school also provides information on contraception as a means of prevention against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, and this is taught at Secondary 2 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond hard facts, the programme also provides the context in which sexuality matters should be viewed - what it means to be in a relationship; what it means to build a family;&nbsp;what it means to be responsible to your loved ones.&nbsp; In addition, schools provide students with the necessary life-skills to be able to make responsible decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To augment their resources, schools have the autonomy to bring in relevant resources, including the Health Promotion Board or other external agencies.&nbsp; I would like to assure Members that guidelines have been provided to schools to help them screen external agencies.&nbsp; We are a secular nation.&nbsp; MOE ensures that all messages on sexuality matters that are transmitted through our schools are likewise secular and sensitive to our multi-religious make-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"Growing Years Series\" is meant for students in primary and secondary schools as well as junior college/pre-university level.&nbsp; Tertiary institutions customise their sexuality education programmes in accordance with the needs of their students.&nbsp; Although parents can opt out of the \"Growing Years Series\", less than 1% of parents have done so.&nbsp; This suggests that parents and students have found this programme useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, MOE intends to ensure that the \"Growing Years Series\" maintains its relevance and is engaging and useful.&nbsp; MOE will encourage schools to adopt an even more customised approach.&nbsp; We recognise that different groups of students might have different needs with regard to sexuality education&nbsp;-this is a point which Ms Olsen talked about.&nbsp; Having smaller group discussions, for instance, will allow teachers to reach out differently to different groups of students, and use different approaches in discussing the same issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, sexuality education is taught only by selected and trained teachers.&nbsp; MOE will additionally strengthen their training.&nbsp; We will ensure that such teachers are more regularly updated on matters concerning teenage sexuality.&nbsp; There will be a greater emphasis on how teachers should deliver information and advice on this delicate topic to their young students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are schools equipped to educate students on sexuality matters?&nbsp; I would say that MOE ensures that students obtain the best possible foundation from the school environment that allows them to later make informed choices about their relationships.&nbsp; But it is important that parents also play an equally active role in such efforts, reinforcing and customising sexuality education for their children based on their respective family values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on student well-being, I would like to address Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's queries.&nbsp;Schools have to decide for themselves the most appropriate starting time.&nbsp; There are many local factors that schools are best placed to balance, such as the scheduling of the curricular and co-curricular time-tables and traffic conditions at different times.&nbsp; Mr Yeo would be pleased to know that with the move towards some single-session schools, some of our schools have implemented later starting times after consultation with stakeholders, although others have also kept to the same starting time after feedback from stakeholders.&nbsp; 46 of our schools also start after 7.45 am now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has not done any studies on how much sleep students get.&nbsp; I think this is something that generally we all can have more of.&nbsp; However, may I offer two simple pieces of advice.&nbsp; First, to get adequate rest for students, they should go to bed at a reasonable time at night, and this must be supervised by parents.&nbsp; Second, in choosing schools, parents might also wish to consider the distance of the school from their home if this is a serious concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On football fields, Mr Yeo asked about the use of school fields during the weekend.&nbsp; Fifty schools allow the public to use their fields during the weekend as part of the Singapore Sports Council's Dual Use Scheme.&nbsp; In addition, another 90 schools have arrangements with community groups such as football clubs, constituency clubs and alumni groups to allow them to use the school fields.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>1.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may be pleased to know that every school has a School Tuckshop Committee that is chaired by the Principal, whether the tuckshop operation is tendered out or not.&nbsp; This is a very good thing to see in our schools.&nbsp; I am sure that not all other organisations maintain their canteens so seriously.&nbsp; The School Tuckshop Committee monitors the quality of food in the tuckshop to ensure that it meets the health and nutritional standards of the Health Promotion Board, and that the tuckshop maintains a high standard of hygiene.&nbsp; The Committee also monitors the prices.&nbsp; Annual surveys have shown that prices at school tuckshops remain reasonable.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to clarify that 82% of our schools do not tender out the tuckshop operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong is concerned about a bus bay at Potong Pasir.&nbsp; He asked us to persuade LTA to allow a loading/pick-up bay at Potong Pasir to be used as a bus stop.&nbsp; We agree that the safety of our students is of primary importance, and we take this very seriously.&nbsp; MOE will forward this suggestion to LTA, the competent authority on the siting of bus-stops.&nbsp; In the interim, we will consult LTA should any issue arise for the students of St Andrew's Junior College with this arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On CCAs, Mr Ang Mong Seng requested MOE to consider letting students serve on grassroots organisations as co-curricular activities, or CCAs.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform Mr Ang that the Ministry allows our students to do so.&nbsp; Students' involvement in community-based activities, including appropriate grassroots activities, is recognised as participation in a CCA if schools approve it.&nbsp; To ensure that students choose such activities with thought, students are required to work out formal proposals with their partner organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also hope to bring about the concept of service learning in our students.&nbsp; Part of this is through the Community Involvement Programme (CIP), and part of this is through CCAs.&nbsp; In this regard, schools may include as school-based CCA activities with organisations that fulfil this idea of service learning.&nbsp; This could include grassroots organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also wanted clarification on whether students have full freedom to choose their CCAs.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Yeo that this is very much the case. Students are free to indicate and try out the CCAs of their choice. Of course, this is subject to the availability of places in some cases.&nbsp; In other cases, there might be selection involved, for instance, onto the school's competitive basketball or soccer team, and not all students that want to join can get in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to emphasise that it is very much the wish of MOE for students to pursue their interests through CCAs.&nbsp; On top of the comprehensive range of CCAs already provided in schools, students can also initiate other CCAs that they would like to see.&nbsp; This scheme was started in 2004 and, to-date, has been implemented by at least 88 schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On racial integration and understanding, we cannot agree more with Mr Ong Ah Heng on the importance of ensuring that our students understand one another's cultures and religions.&nbsp; Recent world events have given us a sober reminder of the paramount importance that we must place on racial harmony and understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, MOE is fully aware that true understanding will not take place in a forced and unnatural manner.&nbsp; MOE's approach is to infuse the importance of mutual understanding and respect through the formal and informal curricula, and provide opportunities for students of different races to interact.&nbsp; Additionally, we look for teachable moments in everyday life. Racial harmony and understanding that is sustainable can only take place in this manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we encourage students of different races to work and play together.&nbsp; Schools provide such opportunities through CCAs, CIP, project work, camps and overseas trips.&nbsp; For instance, Jurong JC sent 170 students to the recent Thaipusam Festival to be road marshals.&nbsp; Joint activities between schools also provide a good platform for students of different races to interact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also pleased to inform Members that we are providing more opportunities for students to learn non-native Mother Tongue Languages.&nbsp; Starting from 2007, we will no longer impose the academic eligibility criteria for students to offer the non-native Mother Tongue Languages as a third language.&nbsp; An increasing number of schools have also been conducting conversational non-native Mother Tongue language lessons.&nbsp; While only seven schools offered conversational Malay in 2002, 60 schools do so on a regular basis today.&nbsp; Thirty-seven schools offer conversational Mandarin on a regular basis.&nbsp; I visited Tampines Secondary School last year, where non-Chinese students are taught conversational Mandarin and non-Malay students are taught conversational Malay.&nbsp; Lower secondary students attend one period of such lessons every two weeks. In the classroom of Malay students I saw learning Mandarin, students were alert and very excited about learning new phrases which are very commonly used by their friends.&nbsp; This is something that we can encourage schools to do more.&nbsp; These are excellent opportunities for students to gain access to the cultures of other races, and enlarge our common space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take racial harmony to the next level, MOE will encourage a more widespread adoption of these activities, and provide more opportunities for students to get to know one another better.&nbsp; One of our initiatives will be to encourage students to try traditionally ethnic-based activities such as Chinese Orchestra, Malay Dance and Indian Dance. A Malay student in my constituency attending Marsiling Secondary School is playing the <I>erhu</I> and he is now in Marsiling Constituency Orchestra, the only Malay boy among 120 or so Chinese youths who are members of the orchestra. This is something that we should always encourage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, our SAP schools are aware of their responsibility to ensure that their students have the opportunities to interact with students of other races, and already do much in this regard.&nbsp; Since 2004, Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) has had a joint cultural activities programme with Westspring Secondary School (WSS).&nbsp; HCI students meet West Spring Secondary students once a fortnight for six months and have a camp during the June holidays.&nbsp; These students have taught each other activities ranging from <I>Dikir Barat</I> to <I>Wushu</I>.&nbsp; Since 2002, St Nicholas Girls' Primary School has had an annual one-day camp with Malay students from Admiralty Primary School, with the Admiralty students teaching them Malay phrases and dance.&nbsp; Looking ahead, MOE will encourage a more structured and sustained approach, with the SAP schools having at least one partner school with students from a different ethnic group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, MOE will further engage stakeholders, including students, parents, teachers and the community.&nbsp; Schools will identify suitable students and parents to act as Racial Harmony Ambassadors to initiate programmes for their peers and to take joint ownership of this issue.&nbsp; We will also be further deepening school leaders and teachers' understanding of cultural issues and sensitivities.&nbsp; MOE will work with educational and community partners, including the CDCs, to provide training on areas such as multi-cultural studies, facilitating conversations on racial harmony and understanding racial and religious practices and taboos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, MOE takes a multi-pronged approach to promoting racial harmony.&nbsp; However, bringing about racial understanding and harmony is ultimately a nation-wide effort.&nbsp; Schools simply cannot do this on their own.&nbsp; But, as one of the first platforms through which students will have the opportunity to interact with and get to know students of different races, we recognise and acknowledge the key role that our schools must play in this effort.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Many students heard about the increases through the media, so it came as a rude shock to them. They are also unhappy with the administration's explanation for the reasons for the increase which at 3% is probably quite small.&nbsp; The increase ranges from $200 to maybe almost $2,000, depending on the course you study.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can sympathise with the medical student who pointed out in the press that his fees have increased by some $1,320 in the past two years, from $16,200 in 2004 to $17,500 this year. That is a lot of money to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the issues raised by students was for the need for more transparency and accountability on the part of the university administration.&nbsp;All our universities say they have sufficient safeguards in place to ensure good governance and best practices but this has failed to alleviate the students' grievances.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the NUS increase took place against the background of NUS' 100 years centennial celebrations and the building of a multi-million dollar new University Hall characterised&nbsp; by opulence, thus reinforcing the perception of a NUS that is extravagant in splashing on image building events and posh buildings.&nbsp; Bad timing, bad PR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the reasons for the increase&nbsp;- higher operating costs and the need to upgrade resources, and the assurance that it works hard to keep costs down&nbsp;- sounded hollow to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our universities depend a great deal on donations from the public and very generous philanthropists. NUS alone received some $200 million from donations in the past&nbsp;two years. However, most donors are very specific in how their money should be spent, for&nbsp;example, for scholarships, for research, for a particular facility or building.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me that NUS can reduce fees by $500 per student for its 20,000-odd students, if NUS just raises $10 million for this general purpose from its donors.&nbsp; Of course, donors prefer to have&nbsp;pet projects and naming rights and when universities get big donations, they always make the headlines.&nbsp; But in fund-raising, universities should try harder to convince donors to give more that would help students alleviate their financial burdens directly.&nbsp; Or it could tweak its budget and cut back on something else like high-profile glamorous projects. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am reminded of the time when I was an undergraduate in the then University of Singapore.&nbsp; Dr Toh Chin Chye was then the Vice Chancellor.&nbsp; The Deputy Vice Chancellor was a man called Reginald Quahe.&nbsp; The late Mr Quahe ran the university like a tight ship, and he was really tight-fisted when it came to money matters.&nbsp; I remember that as a&nbsp;student leader, I used to nag him persistently for rain shelters to be built so that we could be protected from the rain from the lecture theatres to the Union House.&nbsp; He refused to give way for years.&nbsp; And his answer was very simple: \"Haven't you guys heard of umbrellas?\"&nbsp; If you consider the fact that we were not a wealthy country at that time, I think he was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS could also focus its efforts on raising money for bursaries, as only 500 bursaries were given last year.&nbsp; A total of $1.4 million went to needy students, which is really peanuts, if you consider that only one in 10 needy students who applied got bursaries, which means nine&nbsp;others are left in the lurch. &nbsp;Therefore, increasing the pool of bursary beneficiaries should be an urgent priority for NUS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have advocated that our universities adopt a lock-in scheme whereby fees are fixed for the students during the whole duration of their studies.&nbsp; This is the approach now being taken by SMU.&nbsp; It is probably a sound approach, as students can plan ahead and set aside specific sums of money, rather than face uncertainty during their studies.&nbsp; But fees must be locked in at a low cost, not a high one, otherwise it makes a mockery of the system.&nbsp; Ultimately, the key lies in&nbsp;our universities working harder in cost management and cutting back on lavish expenditures that do not directly benefit students, something which students and parents feel our universities are not doing enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have just one specific question:&nbsp; I would like to know if NUS intends to renovate the Bukit Timah campus vacated by SMU when it moves there, bearing in mind that SMU has also spent a lot of money renovating it not long ago and, if so, how much will this cost?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, at last year's Budget debate, I raised some concerns about the change in funding model for our universities as they become autonomous and corporatised.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output funding model, adopted for universities, requires students to bear more of the cost of running the universities.&nbsp; According to the steering committee report released in January 2005, students would be expected to bear more of the operating cost and also part of the infrastructure cost of the universities.&nbsp; It was also recommended that universities be allowed to raise tuition fees every year by not more than 10%.&nbsp; The universities have responded by passing on bigger financial burdens to the students under the new funding model.&nbsp; Just a few months after legislation to corporatise NUS and NTU was passed, students are asked to pay 3% more in fees.&nbsp; And this is just a year after NUS raised fees by 5%.&nbsp; SMU is also raising its fees by $1,000 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the fact of the matter is that, on the whole, wages in Singapore do not go up by 10% per year, particularly for the lower-income group, where wages have actually been going down.&nbsp; Increases in fees will bring a strain on many families.&nbsp; In response to concerns about affordability, the official counter-argument is that no poor students will be deprived of a tertiary education as there are financial assistance schemes available.&nbsp; I do not know how true this is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in terms of bursaries,&nbsp;it was reported in the <I>Straits Times</I>&nbsp;of 15th February 2006 that only 500 out of the 1,300 applicants were successful in receiving bursaries to study at NUS.&nbsp; Does this mean that the universities are not making sufficient funds available for award of bursaries to needy students?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, while the students can always take loans, the question is: how much debt do we want our students to incur before they start work?&nbsp; Assuming that fees do eventually go up by 10% per year, a four-year undergraduate programme will see a student paying about 33% more in fees compared to his first year.&nbsp; Assuming that his fees are $6,110 in Academic Year 2006, it will go up to $8,132 in his final year in Academic Year 2009.&nbsp; If he borrows the maximum of 90% of the tuition fees under the Tuition Fee Loan Scheme, he would be indebted to the amount of $25,520.86 cents, before he starts work.&nbsp; This is not a small sum for someone just starting to work, and it may take him several years to pay.&nbsp; This will adversely affect his quality of life and ability to support his family.&nbsp; Some, I believe, may not have the confidence to incur such a debt and may choose instead to work rather than go into university.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, education is supposed to be the great leveller, enabling&nbsp;poor Singaporeans to improve their socio-economic status.&nbsp; By reducing Government funding and putting such financial burdens on our students, the Government is discouraging the upward mobility of poor Singaporeans.&nbsp; By so doing, the Government also imposes a heavy financial burden on young graduates whose families are poor and are unable to support them through university education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like the Minister's view on this, and whether the new policies and funding model are equitable.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen:</B> Sir, I think Singaporean youths must be very confused.&nbsp; Two years ago, the Prime Minister called on them to play a part in shaping decisions made in this country.&nbsp; But last month, many youths realised their roles were often marginalised.&nbsp; I am referring to the university fee hikes.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without disregarding efforts by MCYS to engage the youths, eg, by seeking ideas for *scape, I believe the litmus test to determine if youths are being taken seriously is in matters like tuition fee hikes - matters which affect them directly, in which they have equal stake - matters in daily life and institutional matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is not to argue that the fee hikes are too much.&nbsp; One cannot make such a judgment without detailed information.&nbsp; But that is why students were similarly in the dark - going by their reactions last month - about the rationale for the increase.&nbsp; At the very least, they were unconvinced of the rationale.&nbsp; Some speculated on reasons other than the ones offered.&nbsp; And should we be surprised when they were informed only after the hike was a <I>fait accompli</I>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue is whether the process for adjusting university fees should always include student consultation.&nbsp; In considering this, we should not forget how best we want our youths to feel ownership in issues, decisions and institutions that matter to this country.&nbsp; I have read how, in a meeting with the students' union, the NUS President regretted that management was unable to engage students this year because of the looming corporatisation.&nbsp; Personally, I think that, with a more established culture of consultation, students would not have been excluded from what is a very important decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for example, the University of British Columbia.&nbsp; It circulates to student societies its proposals to increase tuition fees; holds open forums for students, who are invited via email; and offers access to an interactive website.&nbsp; It projects how much will be raised by fee increases and how these will be allocated by category, such as classroom and laboratory support or teaching assistantships, as well as by department or faculty.&nbsp; As funding allocations sometimes change, it even provides reports on the tuition increase allocation for the previous year.&nbsp; CalState University, Sacramento, goes so far as to mandate a student referendum for fees that affect the whole student body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do our universities compare?&nbsp; It should not matter if NUS and NTU have yet to become autonomous.&nbsp; Whether we engage our youth should not depend on certain conditions.&nbsp; On the other hand, whether our universities can become truly world-class institutions may well depend on how they engage their students, not just in tuition fees but even hostel fees.&nbsp; Students will only buy in to a decision when they feel there is accountability.&nbsp; Our universities would do well to remember that students who kick up the most fuss are going to be the ones who want to be involved and who want to serve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I would like to ask the Minister if he could give all our tertiary institutions an encouraging nudge - since I doubt he would give a directive - to foster a spirit of consultation in all matters.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, Sir, as human capital is our nation's only resource, our Government has spared no efforts to nurture our human capital through investing on education generously.&nbsp; With more than half of our cohort now entering post-secondary education and higher education, it is crucial that we must ensure that school fees in the ITEs, polytechnics and universities always remain affordable to all Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it was quite understandable that students in the local universities and polytechnics as well as the ITEs and their parents are concerned with the recent fee hikes.&nbsp; For the university, in particular, this comes on the back of a fee hike just the year before.&nbsp; And what is of particular concern to parents and students is that the university fee hikes came after the universities have become autonomous.&nbsp; Now they wonder if they are at the mercy of university administrators.&nbsp; Unlike countries with many universities, we have only three, and our universities really have a ready captive audience who have not much&nbsp;choices.&nbsp; Our students' alternative is to go to foreign universities, which is a choice not many Singaporeans can afford.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, our university administrators cannot expect our population to simply accept their argument that our universities are world-class or that the students have to pay more as they will earn more when they graduate.&nbsp; I do not think this is a good explanation.&nbsp; The starting salaries for graduates from our local universities do not compare very well with those for&nbsp;graduates from global cities like London, New York and Chicago.&nbsp; In London, the starting salary of a college student is about \u00a321,000, ie, about S$60,000, a year;&nbsp; in New York, it is about US$35,000.&nbsp; And these are not from the top universities, such as Yale, Harvard or Oxbridge, but typical universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I would, therefore, like MOE to tell us how does the Ministry ensure that our post-secondary and higher education will always be affordable to all Singaporeans.&nbsp; How does MOE hold universities accountable for their fee hikes?&nbsp; How does the Ministry ensure that there is greater transparency in these universities when it comes to fee hikes?&nbsp; How does the Ministry ensure that the universities improve their efficiency rather than simply pass on the increases in their costs to the students?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Low Seow Chay, and Assoc. Prof. Ong Soh Khim who spoke yesterday as well, for their various comments on the universities and the higher education sector.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first address the issue of university fees.&nbsp; The Government's objective is to ensure that our universities, polytechnics and ITE provide Singaporean students with a top-quality education at affordable cost - top quality and affordable.&nbsp; Our aim is not to gear up our institutions to provide a lowest cost education, low-quality education, but to provide an affordable education that is top quality.&nbsp; This is, in fact, what our universities are providing. They are able to do so for three reasons:&nbsp; first, the Government funds them substantially, more than three-quarters of the cost of an undergraduate education; second, they charge realistic fees; and third, they provide substantial financial assistance to needy students.&nbsp; This is what is called \"needs-blind admission\", ie, you get in as long as you qualify on merit, and the university helps you with your needs and takes care of your cost once you are in.&nbsp; It allows for a top-quality education, affordable to all university students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This outcome is quite different from what we see in most other developed countries.&nbsp; In the US, UK and Australia, public funding of the universities is much lower than in Singapore. In the US, the top state universities - I am not even talking about the private universities - will get something in the order of 20% of their funding from government.&nbsp; In the UK and Australia, it is 50% or less.&nbsp; But all the universities face the same cost pressures as, globally, the cost of high quality university faculty has gone up, together with the cost of knowledge-based professionals at large.&nbsp; So in the US and Australia, they have raised fees substantially more than Singapore, and to a substantially higher level than Singapore.&nbsp; They try to deliver quality, but they can only do so at a much higher cost to students compared to the situation in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Europe, it is the other way around. The governments prevent universities from raising fees.&nbsp; In fact, the universities charge very low fees.&nbsp; Despite high taxes, the governments are not able to fund the universities adequately to be able to provide a good quality university education. The universities are faced with relentless financial pressures and, particularly, in the last decade, they are close to a breaking point.&nbsp; So they have no choice but to lower quality because the funds are not there.&nbsp; They cannot raise fees, and the only option is to lower quality.&nbsp; They pack in more students per lecturer and hire more part-time lecturers.&nbsp; And because they cannot pay their best lecturers the market rate, they lose them.&nbsp; So, with the exception of a few top European universities, you get a low-cost education, but a low-quality education.&nbsp; I say this not as my own assessment, but the assessment of European university heads and academics.&nbsp; In fact, there are a number of independent analyses pointing to the problems. Everyone knows the problems. I just quote very quickly from an <I>Economist</I> article. This is a very good survey of higher education.&nbsp; I think it was in September last year called \"The Brains Business\".&nbsp; And I quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The basic problems with the universities are the same across Europe: too much state control and too little freedom to manage their own affairs. Governments have forced universities to educate huge armies of students on the cheap, and have deprived them of the two freedoms that they need to compete in the international marketplace: to select their students and to pay their professors the market rate for the job.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nEveryone knows the problems, but they have tied themselves into a political knot that prevents them from solving the problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have avoided this, and we can continue to provide an excellent university education to Singaporeans if we keep up public funding at 75% of costs as we will do, and if our universities charge realistic fees and continue to provide every needy student with financial assistance.&nbsp; I will speak a little more on that later. What we must not do is to give up on quality, give up on getting the best faculty, give up on improving teaching and keeping the laboratories up to date.&nbsp; The universities have to aim to provide the highest quality, while keeping overall costs under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say something about quality.&nbsp; We know the latest rankings.&nbsp; NUS and NTU were both ranked within the top 50 universities in the world globally by <I>Times</I> Higher Education Supplement. That is well known.&nbsp; But what is less well known and even more remarkable is that NUS and NTU are providing top-quality education to a sizeable proportion of Singaporeans, a far larger proportion of citizens than what the top universities in other countries provide. We are providing high-quality education to all our university students, not high-quality education for a few.&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS and NTU take in slightly over one-fifth of each Singapore cohort.&nbsp; In comparison, the universities ranked within the top 50 universities, like NUS and NTU, in the same survey provide education for only a very small percentage of each cohort in their countries.&nbsp; In Japan and China, it is well below 1%:&nbsp; China, 0.02%; and Japan, about 0.5% of cohort; in India, the same order of magnitude.&nbsp; In the US, although there are 20 universities in the top 50 rankings, in total, they cater to about 1% of cohort.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, it is 6%, somewhat higher; and in Australia, which is the only country which comes close to Singapore in this regard, the six Australian universities in the top 50 rankings provide for 15% of Australian cohort. So NUS and NTU are quite exceptional and, together with SMU, we are going to provide for 25% of cohort a top quality, affordable education, unparalleled to anywhere else in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other indications on quality but because time is short, I will not go through them.&nbsp; But let me emphasise this - that we all have a stake in ensuring that our universities provide high-quality education and receive international recognition for doing so.&nbsp; The high standing of our universities is in the interest of students, the alumni, donors and all stakeholders of the universities.&nbsp; It is in the interest of Singapore. Students in the alumni would not want to see a decline in the standing of the universities and their alma mater over time.&nbsp; So, it is not in anyone's interest that we skimp on quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now go into a few specifics on university fees.&nbsp; First, I think we all agree that fees need to be revised regularly in the universities to allow them to meet their cost increases while improving on the quality of education they provide. There is a certain natural cost increase but there is also some cost increase over time as we aspire to provide better quality. I do not think we disagree with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no intention on the part of the universities to raise fees by 10% every year once they go autonomous, which incidentally has not started yet - it is only from 1st April that universities go autonomous.&nbsp; I will be very surprised if I&nbsp; or any future Minister for Education will be happy if each year university fees go up by 10%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the record so far? With all the cost pressures that I have been talking about that all top universities face internationally, since the start of this decade, from 2000 until last year, fees in NUS and NTU increased by an average of 1.8% per year.&nbsp; This is, in fact, lower than the average rate for wage increase in Singapore. This year, fees are going up by 3% in NUS and NTU. I do not think we expect wages to go up by less this year.&nbsp; I do not have a forecast, but 3% is not unreasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will ensure that fees are never beyond the reach of the average Singaporeans, and I do not just mean needy Singaporeans but the average Singaporeans, the middle-class, even those in the upper middle income bracket.&nbsp; It will never be beyond their reach.&nbsp; We will keep tuition fees competitively priced.&nbsp; I do not want to get into details.&nbsp; I answered Mr Steve Chia last week in Parliament. But a quick scan of what is going on in the rest of the world - Australia and UK - shows that fee increases in recent years have been much more substantial.&nbsp; In fact, Australian universities raised fees up to the full limit allowed by the government under their autonomous status, 25% in one year.&nbsp; UK universities are going up by almost three times this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our universities are fully aware and will have to be aware of the need to keep costs down.&nbsp; They have put in place cost control measures.&nbsp; Measures like reducing administrative staff headcount, bulk tendering for goods and services, demand aggregation for electricity, outsourcing of non-core activities and constant leveraging on IT to improve productivity. The University Hall, whatever you might say about it, was funded by philanthropic donations.&nbsp; And I quite agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that the universities might want to specifically seek out philanthropic donations for the purpose of financial assistance, which I will come to in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we will keep up our hefty subsidies. The universities will continue to exercise control over cost and we will adjust our subsidies over time to keep pace with cost increases that are necessary to deliver quality education.&nbsp; But what we cannot do is to increase the universities' share of the Education budget, ie, increase it beyond what it already is, which is a large share. We fund the universities 1% of GDP.&nbsp; Three universities, 1% of GDP - that is far higher than what almost any other country I can think of funds for their universities.&nbsp; It is one-quarter of the Education budget now. Ten years ago, it was about one-fifth.&nbsp; It has gone up mainly because we succeeded in educating more Singaporeans in our schools such that they are able to go on to universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can justify our significant investment in the universities. We are not apologising for this.&nbsp; I am not saying that 1% of GDP is too much.&nbsp; It is a significant investment because it brings benefits to the wider economy.&nbsp; But we cannot increase the share of the universities in the Education budget, and it will not be equitable to do so.&nbsp; To put it very simply, the average Government funding per year which an university undergraduate receives, if I take last year as an example, was twice that of a polytechnic or an ITE student.&nbsp; And if we consider the fact that we are funding our university students over more years - two years in junior college and four years in university, compared to a polytechnic or an ITE student - then we arrive at an outcome where we are currently funding a university student five times more than we subsidise an ITE student and three times more than we subsidise a polytechnic student.&nbsp; So it will not be fair to take more resources away from schools, polytechnics and ITEs in order to give more to university students, particularly when you take into account also that university students will have higher lifetime earnings compared to other graduates from our system.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is important is that we are committed to two key things.&nbsp; First, to continue to enhance the quality of university education; and, second, to ensure that university education is accessible and affordable to all Singaporeans.&nbsp; We have revamped our financial assistance framework.&nbsp; The universities have revamped it and we have also given them a supplement.&nbsp; We are significantly expanding financial assistance provision for our universities.&nbsp; Let me mention three enhancements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, starting from this year, the maximum Tuition Fee Loan quantum has been increased from 80% of fees to 90% of fees, to minimise the cash outlay the students need.&nbsp; Needy students can get an additional Study Loan for the remaining 10% of fees and to cover a substantial portion of their living expenses.&nbsp; And all these loan schemes have quite generous terms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, NUS and NTU are setting aside larger amounts of funds for financial assistance and I think Mr Tan Soo Khoon's point is a useful one.&nbsp; They may also want to consider, besides their regular funding resources, to seek out dedicated resources from philanthropic donations to boost the sum up.&nbsp; It is not one in ten who obtained a bursary last year.&nbsp; One in&nbsp;10 referred to year 2003.&nbsp; In fact, it has been going up year by year.&nbsp; Last year, four out of ten NUS students who applied for bursaries obtained them.&nbsp; But they will take it beyond it, going forward, with the increase in NUS' and NTU's allocation for financial assistance - an increase of two to three times on average, in fact, in the case of NUS it is three-fold.&nbsp; We will be able to cater to more students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, MOE is providing a new Government bursary of $800 per year to help needy students pay for their living expenses.&nbsp; This will apply to students with a per capita household income of about $900 per month, which is roughly equal to the 50th percentile and below of the Singapore population.&nbsp; So all Singaporean students, with a gross monthly per capita household income of up to $900, will be eligible for the new MOE bursary of $800 per year.&nbsp; In lieu of the MOE bursary, students will also be eligible for university bursaries.&nbsp; So, you will have more than four out of ten NUS students qualifying for bursaries because of these increased provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just give you an example, since Mr Low has given us an example.&nbsp; Let us take a needy student, who comes from a four-member family with gross monthly household income of $2,000, taking a four-year undergraduate course.&nbsp; We estimate he would need about $11,000 per year to pay for tuition fees plus full provision for living expenses, if I am not economising too much on the estimates.&nbsp; So tuition fee is about $6,100, maximum expenses about $5,500.&nbsp; He can apply for a Tuition Fee Loan and Study Loan to cover his total cost of fees.&nbsp; He will be able to get a living allowance under the Study Loan of about $3,600.&nbsp; He will be able to obtain a bursary that could come up to about $1,500.&nbsp; That would leave about $400.&nbsp; And the $400 can be easily covered by the work-study programmes that the universities have introduced.&nbsp; It does not mean you work every night.&nbsp; Occasional work, you get paid for it, you can easily cover the $400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also some students who want to cover part of the fee costs using their parents' CPF accounts but that probably does not refer to the lowest income category, but the middle-income category.&nbsp; For the middle-income students, in fact, for higher income students, they too can go through the university years without any cash outlay for their fees because of the Tuition Loan, plus being able to use their parents' CPF account.&nbsp; But I will focus on the example concerning a low income student to show how, not just his fees, but his living expenses can be covered completely.&nbsp; The loan repayments are not onerous.&nbsp; For the Tuition Fee Loan, it is a minimum amount of $100 per month after he graduates and obtains a job. Study Loan, it is also $100 per month.&nbsp; So if he takes both, that is $200 a month, spread out his Tuition Fee Loan repayment period over twenty years.&nbsp; Study Loan is interest free*.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite generous.&nbsp; It is quite manageable.&nbsp; The main thing is that we have expanded our financial assistance facility.&nbsp; We want more students to qualify, and this is the way forward as we continue to allow the universities to charge realistic fees to meet the cost of providing top quality education.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a little short of time but let me say very quickly regarding Prof. Low Seow Chay's comments.&nbsp; I know what he is referring to.&nbsp; First, I think we should distinguish between the reputable universities that do confer honorary degrees, quite rightly, on distinguished individuals who made significant contributions either to a university or to society.&nbsp; Our own universities do so and they have very clear guidelines regarding who they confer such degrees on.&nbsp; There is no proliferation of such degrees from our own universities.&nbsp; What Prof. Low was concerned was about people buying or somehow engaging in some donations, so as to be able to obtain either a Doctorate degree or some other degree.&nbsp; It takes place all over the world.&nbsp; There is a market for it.&nbsp; The Ministry cannot do anything to stop this.&nbsp; It is a global phenomenon and the market can judge.&nbsp; I think Prof. Low judges very well the worth of these degrees.&nbsp; Most people know how to judge these things.&nbsp; I do not encourage the obtaining of degrees by transaction, but I would add that the fact that people are very keen to obtain a degree by donating money to the university is probably also a reflection of our society's reverence for education and educational advancement, probably better than obtaining knighthoods and peerages by donation.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir,&nbsp;I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.&nbsp; But, Sir, it seems to me that the Minister's reply on&nbsp;affordability depends very much on&nbsp;the Tuition Fee Loan.&nbsp; I wonder whether it is affordability by mortgaging the students' future, by paying so much loan that they have to be indebted after their university education.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second clarification is that the Minister said the university should charge \"realistic fees\".&nbsp; I would like to know what is \"realistic fees\"&nbsp;and whether that includes expenditure of buying expensive chairs and thereby&nbsp;charging realistic fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Sir, the Minister said he will not foresee that the university will increase fees to the full amount by 10%, but I understand the Steering Committee's Report allows the university to increase up to 10% of the fee per year. &nbsp;How sure is the Minister that this will not happen and, if it happens, are they allowed to&nbsp;increase 10% of tuition fee at all?&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Let me start with the last point.&nbsp; The framework for the autonomous universities allows for fee increases of up to 10%, but it does not happen automatically.&nbsp; In fact, the framework states quite clearly that the universities have to first make a submission to the Ministry six months beforehand on what their fee proposals are, and the Ministry will have to look at it to make sure the cost increases are reasonable, apply some standardised benchmarks for cost-increases across the universities, before it gauges whether the universities' proposals are justifiable.&nbsp; So it is not an automatic 10%.&nbsp; In fact, this is a different framework from what exists in some other countries.&nbsp; We do not envisage a situation like what happened in Australia.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On loans, I am not sure what Mr Low is getting at.&nbsp; This is an equation where if you disagree with all the parts you are not going to get the outcome.&nbsp; You cannot disagree with realistic fees being charged with loans being a means of financial assistance and, at the same time, disagree with the Government having to raise taxes in order to fund the universities more, or disagree with the policy that we should keep some fair proportion of subsidy in education between universities, polytechnics, ITEs and schools.&nbsp; What is our strategy?&nbsp; Not to charge fees that are unreachable to Singaporeans?&nbsp; That would be crazy.&nbsp; And it would not be in the interest of our universities to do so because a needs-blind admission must mean not just financial assistance provisions, but fees that are basically within the reach of the middle-class as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to make sure the university keeps cost in check, that fee increases are within reach, that financial assistance is always there for needy students and even students right up to the median income level.&nbsp; Beyond the median income level, we provide loans as well.&nbsp; The loans are not onerous.&nbsp; As a percentage of the starting pay of a graduate, $100, maximum $200, if he has also taken the Study Loan.&nbsp; Over time, as the university graduate's pay goes up, it is a smaller and smaller fraction of his monthly income.&nbsp; It is the practice all over the world.&nbsp; In fact, the proportion of students who take loans in Singapore is somewhat less than in many other places, especially Australia.&nbsp; So this is a pragmatic way forward to have a top quality and affordable education.&nbsp; Top quality cannot mean 100% Government subsidy because that must mean taking money away from very deserving investments in our school, polytechnic and ITE sectors.&nbsp; Top quality must mean charging realistic fees, but making sure that those who cannot afford it, get assistance.&nbsp; That is how we avoid tying ourselves into a political knot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This subsidy is about 3.5 times higher than what an Australian medical student, for instance, would receive at, say, the University of Sydney.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Graduate Medical School, it has not announced the details of its fees and other financial details.&nbsp; They would have to charge higher fees because they are providing for a graduate medical programme and is also aiming at a very small, select group of students who are going to receive a much more costly programme that requires much more substantial investment.&nbsp; They would price their fees realistically.&nbsp; They are not going to price it beyond what the market can bear, but the details would be announced later.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The process can be improved.&nbsp; The universities want to, for a start, begin the whole process earlier in future, the whole process of deciding on revised fees earlier to allow more time for consultation and explanation.&nbsp; But I think there are some positive things that came out of this year's exercise.&nbsp; The universities have taken on board some very useful points made by the students, in particular the point that Mr Tan Soo Khoon also referred to, that students want to have some degree of certainty as to the total outlay that they will face over the full course of their university education.&nbsp; SMU has now gone for that practice of telling students exactly how much they pay for the full duration.&nbsp; NUS and NTU think this is a useful and practicable suggestion and are looking into it.&nbsp;

Specific questions on gaming revenue can be addressed to the Minister for Finance when the money finally comes about.&nbsp; But the point is a basic one.&nbsp; Whatever our sources of revenue, we end up with a total revenue cake&nbsp;-&nbsp; 18% of GDP, maybe 19% thereabouts.&nbsp; It has got to be divided up amongst many competing sources&nbsp;- defence, economic infrastructure, the whole health infrastructure, including the higher cost of catering to the aged in future, and educating very well all our students - primary school, secondary school upward to ITE, polytechnic, university.&nbsp; We have to make fairly tough decisions there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are funding our university students - per student as well as the universities as a whole far more than other countries.&nbsp; I justify it because it has wide benefits for the economy as we enter into a knowledge-based era.&nbsp; But you cannot increase the share without taking something away from the polytechnic, ITE and secondary school students.&nbsp; And the return on an investment in education in the early years is important even in a knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; We should not shrink from spending more to deliver high quality in our schools, polytechnics and ITEs.&nbsp; Sir, what we are doing is more equitable than what Mr Low is suggesting - more equitable, because we charge realistic fees so that we do not subsidise the middle class or the upper middle class.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, workers in Singapore face many challenges today.&nbsp; I would like to touch on a few key issues, namely, structural unemployment, labour market,&nbsp; supply demand disequilibrium, women in the workforce, older workers and medical benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural unemployment is the greatest manpower challenge today.&nbsp; Workers of all levels are hit, some more badly than others.&nbsp; Even executives are not spared.&nbsp; As our economy restructures and moves towards more knowledge-based activities, there is a rising danger that the less educated and the less skilled workers will find it increasingly difficult to find new jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way to address the problem is clearly skills redevelopment and training. In this regard, the WDA, together with other tripartite partners, ie, NTUC and SNEF, has made very good progress.&nbsp; I think it is timely for the Minister to provide an update, particularly an assessment of whether our drive to upgrade the skills of our workers is bearing fruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding our skills redevelopment efforts, there are two critical issues that we need to address.&nbsp; They are the mismatch of skills between demand and supply and the low level of training among those most vulnerable to structural unemployment.&nbsp; I understand that, for example, on average, those who have less than secondary education received only one day training per year.&nbsp; The tripartite partners have to find ways to reach out to them more effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the services sector, where 75% of our jobs are coming from, is a key engine of employment and GDP growth.&nbsp; Does the Ministry have any plan to build up our service capacity and&nbsp;capability, and plug the skill gaps?&nbsp; The WQS and the other WDA initiatives have ambitious plans for the services sector.&nbsp; There is, however, room for improvement in the running of the actual training programmes.&nbsp; For example, would it not be more practical to have course materials available in Chinese since a substantial number of workers from the services sector may not be conversant in English?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the declining birth rate, new entrants into the job market in future would be reduced substantially.&nbsp; The local workers' net inflow per annum will drop from 41,000 today to 28,000 after year 2010.&nbsp; Moving ahead, there is a pressing need for MOM to ensure equilibrium of manpower demand and supply.&nbsp; One serious implication is greater foreign worker dependency.&nbsp; There is already a large pool of foreign workers today in Singapore.&nbsp; MOM should help industries that are heavily dependent on foreign workers to reduce its dependency by raising productivity, and encourage these industries to adopt innovative methods to redesign and re-engineer their work processes.&nbsp; If we do not restructure work processes and redesign our jobs fast, we will see not just a disequilibrium in the labour market but even our continued dependency on foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of concern is women in our workforce.&nbsp; The women workforce participation rate is far from desirable.&nbsp; Much has been debated, but I personally would hope to see more concrete action being taken.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Ministry to consider doing a deeper study on how other countries achieve higher female labour participation rate than us even without a heavy reliance on domestic maids.&nbsp; This will definitely help us fine tune our policies to encourage more women to rejoin the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One key challenge we face is an ageing workforce.&nbsp; The life expectancy of our population has also increased significantly compared in the past.&nbsp; While all workers face retrenchments and unemployment, the older workers feel the heaviest brunt.&nbsp; Some people argue that our efforts to get our employers to employ older workers and effectively raise the retirement age beyond 62 may not work, as the employers may remain unwilling to hire older workers.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;MOM consider introducing the older worker re-employment legislation implemented in Japan, if our promotional efforts fail?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key obstacle discouraging employers from employing older workers is the higher medical costs.&nbsp; Employers are not willing to incur higher medical costs associated with older workers, particularly those who may have developed medical conditions as they change jobs.&nbsp; The way to address the problem is the portable medical benefit system (PMBS).&nbsp; The concept is simple, ie, a worker can get portable and continuous seamless medical coverage during his working years, and extending into his retirement.&nbsp; With portable medical benefits, the worker does not lose out when they change jobs, even if he develops medical conditions.&nbsp; At the same time, there will not be unnecessary cost burdens to his employers as he ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the portable medical benefit system to firmly take root, we need to enable workers to use the additional contribution of the minimum 1% of his salary by the employer to enhance the medical insurance coverage on top of MediShield, according to the employment, financial and health conditions of the worker at the various stages of his life.&nbsp; The workers want to have the employer-based medical benefits converted into cash equivalent, so that they can keep it and wait until when they need it, and keep those that is not used.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; where should the money be kept?&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to urge the Ministry to set up a national PMBS account to manage the additional contribution for workers' inpatient needs.&nbsp; It is timely for the Ministry to take firm steps towards making medical benefits portable in Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, I will be raising three issues.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, about our efforts to attract the brains or the talents to our shores.&nbsp; Many were attracted here especially with the billions of R&amp;D fund being dangled before their eyes. We have been wooing many top researchers to conduct their highly-priced and high-risk work in our laboratories. After spending so much money into R&amp;D, my concerns are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; How do we ensure that the billions that we invest on this pool of talent to enable them to make these forays to expand the boundaries of mankind's knowledge on many complex and life-important issues remain within our country?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; How do we ensure that what is discovered is inherited by our own experts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; How do we train the second echelon of local experts so that they can carry on from where others have left off?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, we have to build up our own talent base as we cannot go on relying on foreign talents.&nbsp;A recent&nbsp;<I>Reuters</I>' report on staffing highlighted that&nbsp;employers&nbsp;have difficulty in finding the right people to fill jobs despite high unemployment in Europe and the US.&nbsp; This phenomenon is also experienced across North America and Asia, and&nbsp;the talent shortages&nbsp;identified are: sales representatives followed by engineers and technicians.&nbsp; It polled 33,000 employers in 23 countries in January, including 627 in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the Ministry of Manpower done any study to look into the talent shortage? What is the action plan to mitigate this problem? Should a knowledge management&nbsp;database be launched to see how we can inventorise and nurture our knowledge so that we can add value and expand on it? In building up our knowledge base, we may gradually become less dependent on foreign talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my third point is on mindset training.&nbsp; Whilst we&nbsp;worry&nbsp;about&nbsp;the shortage of talents and over reliance on foreign talents, we have, in our midst, a group of what I call,&nbsp;PMETs - professionals, managers, executives and technicians&nbsp;- who can fill&nbsp;many vacancies.&nbsp; What&nbsp;we need is&nbsp;a wake-up call for these PMETs and our employers in Singapore - to help&nbsp;them to re-adjust&nbsp;and re-mould their work ethics and attitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not meant to be disrespectful of their quality and abilities.&nbsp; It is more trying to energise them to take a fresh look at what is available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the way to do it is to put them through a mindset training programme.&nbsp; Some may say that this is a step backwards for them, but&nbsp;I think it is more a case of taking one step backwards and two steps forward.&nbsp; So I urge that we structure a scheme for PMETs to be put through a training of mindset awareness.&nbsp; This will ensure that the PMETs&nbsp;will get a better chance of getting a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, employers need mindset training to&nbsp;eliminate their prejudice for these PMETs.&nbsp; I urge for a national training scheme to reach out to these employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I thank you for my participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Jobs</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:&nbsp;</B> &nbsp;Sir, we have to ensure that there will be continued availability of jobs for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With much changes taking place in the employment structure, we see a drastic increase in the number of contract workers.&nbsp; While the compensation package of direct contract workers&nbsp;is comparable to permanent workers, indirect contract workers receive less favourable terms.&nbsp; Generally, their wages are lower and they are not paid CPF contributions.&nbsp; They also do not enjoy benefits, such as leave entitlement, medical benefits and training opportunities.&nbsp; This is an anomaly we must correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have to look into ways to enhance contract workers' jobs and income security, as the nature of contract work is short term and contracts are subjected to renewals.&nbsp; In addition, indirect contract workers may find themselves under new employment contracts with lower terms than what they had previously received.&nbsp; This is due to \"cheap sourcing practices\" whereby the bidding war of the labour suppliers drives the tender price down. Wages are reduced in order to cut cost.&nbsp; This is detrimental to the&nbsp;contract workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inadequacy of savings for long-term needs among this group of workers is also another key concern.&nbsp; As indirect contract workers are often paid higher take home-pay without CPF contributions and other benefits, they will face the problem of inadequate savings for long-term needs, such as retirement, medical treatment and housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, contract workers also lack awareness of their basic employment rights.&nbsp; Even if they are aware, they may be unable to assert their rights for fear of non-renewal of contract and discrimination from their employers.&nbsp; In view of these problems that contract workers face, what is MOM's plan to enhance the wages and employment terms of contract workers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a need to review our labour legislation.&nbsp; We need to review the legislative protection to ensure that employers comply with minimum standards, such as&nbsp;paying the employees promptly even for contract workers.&nbsp; Under the Employment Act, entitlement to some statutory benefits is based on a worker's minimum continuous period of service.&nbsp; The labour movement here is suggesting that for the purpose of calculating the length of service under the Employment Act, \"minimum service period rendered within a time frame\" should be used as the basis instead of \"continuous service\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM should also step up enforcement efforts.&nbsp; Finally, the Ministry should also publish better labour statistics on contract workers.&nbsp; Without them, it is difficult to effectively analyse the trends on contract employment in Singapore, much less make the policy to help contract workers.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Human resource is the strongest, if not, the only resource we have in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; MOM should be more concerned with this phenomenon of people not being able to optimise their talent, so that&nbsp; human resource potential could be developed to the fullest for our economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the problems of the so-called structural employment.&nbsp; As such, we feel that we should compile \"Under-employment\" and \"Skills Inadequacy Employment\" statistics so that we have a better understanding of the situation here in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the 16th International Conference of Labour Statisticians held in October 1998, a statement was made that \"under-employment\" and \"skills inadequacy employment\" statistics are very important to the nation.&nbsp; This is because such a potential problem reflects the inability of the national policy to enable the economy to make full use of this potential.&nbsp; This is a very important indicator for nations which are undergoing economic restructuring. Some of these people who are under-employed due to economic reform may migrate to other countries.&nbsp; They could well be our home-grown elites who have benefited from our education system and the cultivation of our society.&nbsp; We spend a substantial part of our budget on education and skills training every year.&nbsp; If we continue to allow our local elites to migrate or being in the state of&nbsp;\"skills inadequacy employment\", it would be a great loss to our resource-scarce <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Ah Heng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, I am happy that the Government has announced a $40 million package to support the Job Recreation Programme.

Secondly, the services can be done professionally with no stigma that it is welfare, to borrow a current word in vogue, it is Workfare.&nbsp; Lastly, by centralising at MOM, I wish to urge the kind Minister to provide more funds and resources for job search programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most feedback from residents is that they are not getting sufficient help and satisfaction on job search services at the CDC level.&nbsp; Looking for a job&nbsp;in itself is really a very stressful and heart-wrenching affair.&nbsp;Go and ask the older unemployed workers.&nbsp;We should not make it more difficult or emotionally draining.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;job assistance agencies should be more helpful, sympathetic and professional.&nbsp; Can the Minister please consider how to better help the unemployed workers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Re-designing Work</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to raise this issue of redesigning work.&nbsp; We have an ageing workforce and one of the issues in redesigning work is to make sure that our workers are continually trained and retrained, and WDA is doing programmes to retrain the workers with proper allowances, and so on.&nbsp; But I believe equipment and machines also have to be redesigned to suit the older workers.&nbsp; So the question we should ask is whether there are incentives given for employers using new equipment, to employ retrained workers and possibly older workers.&nbsp; All these new workers and new equipment in redesigning work must, at the end of the day,&nbsp;make&nbsp;a profit.&nbsp; Otherwise, there is no incentive to use the proper equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to give an example that was piloted in the Tanjong Pagar Town Council three years ago when I was the Chairman&nbsp;- the current Chairman, Dr Chong is sitting here&nbsp;- when we decided to switch from a 30% local workers environment in cleaning work to 70%, which is currently in the Town Council there today.&nbsp; There was no big need for us at that time to really do this change,&nbsp;apart from the periodic disturbance that we had from MOM to check on foreign workers.&nbsp; So we sat down with the management staff and we just wanted to show Singaporean workers, even older ones, how to respond to incentives and training, so that this 70% local portion ratio can be achieved by the right alignment of process, incentives and productivity.&nbsp; Workers alone, redesigning work, with all the training, will not solve and address this problem.&nbsp; They need suitable equipment to do the job.&nbsp; And the corresponding output productivity must make economic sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, jobs have to be redesigned by retraining workers in learning&nbsp;the use of equipment.&nbsp; Secondly, equipment have to be&nbsp;suitable for the job of cleaning that we undertake in the Town Council. There are many definitions and standards and requirements regarding standards of cleaning.&nbsp; What we have to do is that we must be sure that there must be an outcome of performance that is satisfactory to the Town Council and&nbsp;residents.&nbsp; So it is only with this suitable equipment that we can match together with the workers that we have to undertake this kind of realignment.&nbsp; Thirdly, sourcing of contracts has to change.&nbsp; The cheapest guy with a broomstick may not be the preferred solution. Fourthly,&nbsp;contracts have to be redesigned so that the legacy contract documents which, for example, were handed down from HDB days with the old set of parameters and yardsticks of measurements also have to be changed to a better set of performance indicators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in our new pilot, cleaning equipment were leased from the respective suppliers, so that the serviceability of the machines and equipment&nbsp;is assured and the replacement units are delivered should there be a contract failure or an equipment failure.&nbsp; Contract terms also have to be fixed for a longer term, instead of yearly, to stabilise the risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these, which were successfully implemented, the 70% local ratio was achieved in the Town Council without much increase in cost.&nbsp; The local workers were better paid because productivity is higher.&nbsp; Today, the Tanjong Pagar Town Council has a full roll out of mechanisation in the town where 70% local workers are doing the cleaning services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, some enterprising&nbsp;businesses and&nbsp;grassroots people have even come up with better ideas on equipment&nbsp;and machines designed to suit</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If the SDF is not the proper fund, could&nbsp;MOM think of other ways to provide subsidised training for PMETs?&nbsp; This is an area that is important that we need to pay a lot more focus on, although hitherto a lot more attention has been paid on the non-PMETs.&nbsp; I think, as the economy churn takes its effect, it would also affect the PMETs and they also need some assistance.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If Members of this House will remember, and certainly those who stepped in with me to this august Chamber in 2002 and that was not long ago, where&nbsp;the spectre of a jobless recovery loomed in the aftermath of several difficult years, when Singapore's unemployment peaked at 4.8% in September 2003.&nbsp; The corresponding resident unemployment rate then was 6.3%.&nbsp; I remember the prevailing mood then was one of despair and despondence.&nbsp; But in contrast to that bleak period, the economy grew by 6.4% last year, and the outlook for this year is favourable.&nbsp; And Members will also remember that there were concerns during that&nbsp;period that even recovery would be a jobless one.&nbsp; It has not happened. Growth has&nbsp;translated into jobs for Singaporeans. Overall unemployment fell to just 2.5% by the end of last year.&nbsp; The situation has turned for the better and indeed, there are jobs, jobs, jobs for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked for a table to be distributed.&nbsp; If you look at the table, years 2002 and 2203, we have GDP growths of 4% and 2.9% respectively, and they were indeed very difficult years.&nbsp; Following a negative GDP growth in 2001, if Members cast their minds back,&nbsp;our GDP shrank by -2.3%. This was compounded by SARS and other factors. And because of that, if you look at the chart, 2002 and 2003 combined, those two years, we actually lost&nbsp;jobs, in other words, the economy, in terms of jobs, shrank about 36,000 in those two years.&nbsp;But in contrast, our economy and employment rebounded vigorously in 2004 and 2005 and we created together something like 181,000-182,000 jobs.&nbsp; These two periods served as very useful periods of contrasting fortunes and indeed, they provide for us valuable lessons that should guide our efforts and strategies, moving forward in helping all Singaporeans find jobs,&nbsp;earn decent wages and remain employable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we forget too quickly, it would be useful&nbsp;for us to use this occasion where the economy is up and jobs have returned, to recap broad policies that have worked, many of which were prompted by Members of Parliament in this House.&nbsp;But we should also learn from the ideas that were not taken up or those, if&nbsp;implemented, would have created problems for us today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of these difficult times, let me just say that I was very encouraged that Members supported the Government when we did not resort to quick and ineffective fixes.&nbsp; We did not succumb to calls for protectionist policies to shut out foreign workers and impose minimum wages.&nbsp; We avoided unemployment insurance.&nbsp; These policies would have led to economic stagnation and more job losses.&nbsp; Members in this House&nbsp;would have read&nbsp;recently of press articles about how these very same protectionist&nbsp; policies in some European countries have increased unemployment rates there.&nbsp; They do not insulate workers from global competition, but worsen their plight. In contrast, we face challenges head-on, press on with restructuring to remain competitive and relevant in a global marketplace. And because we persevered with sound policies, and unions were able to persuade workers to bear some hardship in the process, with some sacrifices,&nbsp;we now have a more resilient and competitive workforce to deal with challenges that lie ahead. We are in a much better position having gone through the difficult periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many jobs have been created for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked for a particular breakdown and I would give her the figures later.&nbsp; But let me revisit the key strategies that were put into place which ensured this job creation.&nbsp; First, in response to calls from many of you, we pushed for skills upgrading and supported strongly NTUC's efforts in job recreation. That made&nbsp;a big difference. We set up the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) which many of you called for in September 2003.&nbsp; I would like to remind Members that WDA is a relatively infant organisation, but much needed.&nbsp;This&nbsp;was to help unemployed Singaporeans gain employment and to upgrade their skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we maintained flexible wage and labour market policies. We worked with employers and unions to reduce CPF and implement more flexible and performance-based wage systems.&nbsp; That we did this in a downturn was a significant effort and has enabled us to better cope with further downturns and hence protect jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we maintained&nbsp;the fine balance of allowing companies&nbsp;to have access to foreign workers while&nbsp;having jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; In 2004, we introduced the S-Pass to give companies access to more mid-skilled manpower.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, to help companies meet additional demands, we allowed them to hire work permit holders beyond the prevailing Dependency Ratio then, but at a higher levy of $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These three major efforts have produced results.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob asked how many of these jobs created last year went to Singaporeans.&nbsp; From preliminary estimates, last year, we created 110,800 jobs, and the majority of 61,000 jobs went to locals.&nbsp; That figure of 61,000 has to be explained. First of all, more jobs went to Singaporeans than foreigners.&nbsp; But 61,000 is the highest annual employment creation on record for locals, not only the last few years, but&nbsp;even exceeding pre-Asian crisis level. We looked back at the statistics and&nbsp;we never had a year of such strong local job creation. Two-thirds of the jobs, or close to 72,000 jobs were in the services sector.&nbsp; In the services sector, of all the jobs created in the services sector, 70% were taken up by locals.&nbsp; The gains in local employment&nbsp;were mainly in business, wholesale, retail, trade, financial services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, the average number of new labour entrants that enter into our labour market was only around 31,000. So for the fact that we created 61,000 jobs in that year shows that our economy is buoyant.&nbsp; It translates to jobs and Singaporeans benefit.&nbsp; It indeed has been jobs, jobs, jobs for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we created jobs for locals in every year since 1999.&nbsp; If you look at the figures that I have shown you in the table, foreign workforce bore the brunt of the economic downturns. The total number of jobs shrank but it was the foreign workers that bore the brunt of this. For locals, there were still net job creation.&nbsp; This tells us that we have struck the right balance in our manpower framework because companies are able to adjust their manpower needs quickly, in good and hard times, and this reduces the adverse impact on our own workers.&nbsp; MOM will release more details later this month in&nbsp;its annual report on the state of the labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have these been good jobs?&nbsp; Members may have been given the impression that just because we have concentrated an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers, that all jobs were poor quality jobs. That is very far from the truth.&nbsp; I will give a fuller picture when I address PMETs that some Members have asked.&nbsp; But these have been good jobs and, in fact, the percentage rise has been higher for professionals, managers, executives, and technician jobs and wages for higher percentiles, the better jobs, have also increased. So our economy has provided jobs for Singaporeans with good wages and good quality jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See raised some concerns during the Budget debate that labour productivity rose only 1.9% but he has to understand this was against the background of very strong employment creation. There were many more jobs added in that flow and things may round up, and that is the reason why our productivity only increased by 1.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economy is forecasted to grow by 4%-6% this year.&nbsp; Barring any external shocks, such as the avian flu outbreak or rising oil prices, there will be enough jobs for new entrants and unemployment is likely to remain around the current levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the jobs will come from the services sector. Manufacturing and construction sectors are also expected to create jobs but with higher value add&nbsp;and skill levels for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But amidst these strong economic and employment performance, I agree with some Members - Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned structural challenges that continue to persist.&nbsp; He is quite right.&nbsp; We do face a shrinking workforce growth as a result of our aging population and the decline in fertility.&nbsp; He said that MOM must meet long-term manpower challenges and indeed he has a point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond 2010, labour growth will slow significantly because our baby-boomers would have passed the age of 50 years by then.&nbsp; It grows about two-odd percent every year.&nbsp; It will shrink about 1.2%, about half the rate of growth.&nbsp;With&nbsp;the shrinking rate of growth in the labour force, Singapore's economic growth could be stunted if businesses cannot find sufficient workers here&nbsp;because you are adding too few and, secondly, sufficient workers with relevant skills.&nbsp;We need to encourage older workers and, as Mr Yeo has pointed out, women to stay in the labour force longer and remain productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second challenge is economic restructuring.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to increased globalisation, we recognise our workers are facing wage pressures from millions of workers from China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America. That is why we must continually upgrade their skills and maintain their cost-competitiveness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to thank many Members who recognised and understood these challenges and spoke in support of our policies.&nbsp; When we set up the WDA in September 2003, Members&nbsp;gave very good suggestions when I moved the Bill on setting up WDA.&nbsp; Let me quote from what some of you said. Mr Seng Han Thong said, \"priority should be given to the industries which are vulnerable to the New Economy\".&nbsp; Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon emphasised generic employability skills training.&nbsp; Other Members also rallied our workers.&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Magad pointed out, \"Today's world takes no pity on the individual who gets lazy about training\".&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See reminded us that \"the Government can only do that much if the workers do not exercise personal responsibility.\" &nbsp;We have taken your suggestions to heart and indeed many of the ideas that you have put out have been&nbsp;translated into programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the employers' contributions into the Skills Development Fund and&nbsp;the Government's Lifelong Learning Fund, I am happy to report that 166,000 received training in 2005.&nbsp;Of this, 40% were aged 40 and above.&nbsp; As PM announced in his Budget speech, the Government will top up the Lifelong Learning Fund with another $100 million. This will generate another $4 million per year in interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the economy has rebounded, let me assure Members that we will not let up in our efforts in skills upgrading.&nbsp; On the contrary, we will invest more resources to raise training standards and enhance outcomes to benefit all Singaporean workers.&nbsp; The Government has set aside $100 million to develop the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) system which is a national framework for vocational skills and this is recognised and accepted by industries because we worked with industries to develop this.&nbsp; WDA has implemented the WSQ in the retail, finance and training sectors and we will also include new industries like infocomm, food and beverage and tourism by the end of this month.&nbsp; Other industries, such as education and creative industries, are in the pipeline and to date, we have more than 6,000 workers trained under WSQ.&nbsp; I take Mr Yeo's point that we should include Mandarin.&nbsp; I am not sure whether we do or not, but if we do not,&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>I agree with&nbsp;him that we might have to include some of the material in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having industry and training providers participate in the WSQ framework is similar to&nbsp;Dr John Chen's&nbsp;suggestion&nbsp;brought up during the Budget debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are building WSQ training institutions to make sure that the delivery of training&nbsp;is high.&nbsp; These institutes&nbsp;will research how adults learn, undertake industry outreach, and ensure that training is tied to jobs. We have the first of such institutions, which&nbsp;is the Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS), jointly set up by WDA and Nanyang Polytechnic in October 2005.&nbsp; This institute&nbsp;aims to upgrade the skills of at least 5,000 existing retail workers, and to train a further 1,000 new workers in 2006.&nbsp; We will add more quality institutions.&nbsp; So, just as we have done for the pre-employment training, we are striving to build top-notch quality institutions for our workers,&nbsp;because we believe that&nbsp;investing in our workers is investing in our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WDA will also collaborate with top international institutions such as the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, William F Harrah College of Hotel Administration, to develop WSQ for executive training in the&nbsp;Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions (MICE) industry, in anticipation of the growth in that sector.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I assure Members that even though the economy is doing well and there are jobs, we will not let up, because as you have rightly pointed out, we need to invest in our workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I share Members' concerns for the vulnerable segments of our workforce, the low wage and older workers, who face more difficulty coping with economic restructuring.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam See Tong gave good ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not been to Morocco.&nbsp; I would certainly like to go there and see what&nbsp;he saw.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;say that&nbsp;we recognised and, actually discussed, the idea of having an informal economy&nbsp;in the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Low Wage workers.&nbsp; We recognise that in neat and cookie-cutter-style Singapore, it is sometimes very difficult and daunting for, say, a housewife who wants to sell <I>kueh</I>, <I>nonya</I>, Malay,&nbsp;Indian, or whatever, to enter into the market place, because there is sometimes a huge bureaucracy that&nbsp;they have to confront.&nbsp; So, one suggestion which MCYS is willing&nbsp;to champion is for it to be the one-stop centre.&nbsp; In other words, if you have an idea, whether it is micro-enterprise or a small idea, you come to us in terms of financing, outlet,&nbsp;licensing,&nbsp;being able to cook in the house, and&nbsp;I will offer you a one-stop shop front.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take time to develop.&nbsp; I must say that a number of Mayors have already launched these initiatives in the CDCs and have some success.&nbsp; But he is&nbsp;quite right that this is an area we feel that they can supplement their income in an informal economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As more jobs have been created, let me also give some good news to Members that</p>\r\n\r\n<p>even those who were vulnerable to structural unemployment have found jobs. &nbsp;The number and share, which is the proxy we use, of the long-term unemployed, that is of those who were&nbsp;unemployed more than six months, have fallen sharply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimates show that 13,200 or 21% of the unemployed residents&nbsp;in December 2005 have been looking for work for at least 25 weeks.&nbsp; This is a significant improvement from&nbsp;the 21,300 workers or 28% of the unemployed, a year ago. &nbsp;The long-term unemployed, that is, those unemployed for more than six months, has also&nbsp;reduced.&nbsp; The figure now is&nbsp;0.7% of the resident labour force, and this is&nbsp;down from 1.2% in December 2004 and 1.5% in December 2001.&nbsp; In other words, compared to December 2001, the long-term unemployed has fallen by about 1.5% to 0.7%, which is half.&nbsp; But, despite these improving trends, I agree with Mr Yeo that we must continue to assist those aged 40 and above, and as Mdm Halimah mentioned, especially those&nbsp;without secondary qualifications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about under-employed, in other words, someone wants to rise higher than&nbsp;what he is in his current job.&nbsp; As Members can well imagine, it is a difficult proxy to measure aspirations.&nbsp; You could have, say,&nbsp;a CEO who earns half a million dollar and still wants to earn a million, or wants to do a bigger job, and by that definition, he would also be under-employed.&nbsp; So, it is a difficult measurement.&nbsp; The way to look at it is really unemployment rate, the types of jobs created and the wages.&nbsp; What type of jobs has the economy created over the last&nbsp;10 years?&nbsp; And this is to address the impression that the jobs we created are low-quality, low-class, which is far from the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you some figures.&nbsp; You take two contrasting marks, June 1994 and June 2004,&nbsp;a 10-year difference.&nbsp; Look at the occupations and you&nbsp;separate them.&nbsp; If you look at managers, proprietors and senior officials, in 1994, they formed about 11% of all occupations.&nbsp; It has risen now to 14%, a 4% jump.&nbsp; Professionals are up by 7%.&nbsp; Associate professionals and technicians are up by another 4%.&nbsp; In fact, the ones that have shrunk are really the lower quality jobs in terms of plant and machine operators, production craftsmen, service and sales workers.&nbsp; And wages have also gone up in terms of real wages and nominal wages.&nbsp; So, I want to assure Members that the Singapore economy, as we have done our restructuring, has delivered in terms of providing good quality jobs to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Now, there is a skills mismatch between what Singaporeans have and what the jobs want.&nbsp; But that is a very different argument from saying or giving the impression that our economy has not provided good jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to help those&nbsp;with the skills that they have and the skills that the job or economy needs.&nbsp; The first area is employment assistance. &nbsp;Our training programmes are geared towards this objective. &nbsp;WDA trained and placed about 3,000 job seekers last year.&nbsp; It&nbsp;placed about 27,000 job seekers through the various job centres in the&nbsp;Distributed CareerLink Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee has suggested that MOM should centralise certain job functions.&nbsp; Yes, we will see how we can improve, but let me just explain that we do centralise some functions.&nbsp; We have already created&nbsp;a nation-wide Integrated Job Bank where every CDC or, even&nbsp;WDA&nbsp;and&nbsp;partners, see the same thing.&nbsp; It is data-linked.&nbsp; It is the same job bank.&nbsp; There are common user items that we also share.&nbsp; But, as he has pointed out, the CDCs do offer&nbsp;wider geographical outreach and access to job seekers.&nbsp; Many of us at the MPS have recognised this.&nbsp; It is more convenient.&nbsp; I am very happy that the CDC, as a job centre, is in Toa Payoh, because as long as I tell my residents where it is, they just hop over to the interchange.&nbsp; It is very convenient.&nbsp; So that geographical access is important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;there are other&nbsp;micro-trends that are also important.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the CDCs have quite a good understanding of what are the local trends and unique challenges.&nbsp; If you speak to the Mayors in different sectors, in fact, Dr Teo Ho Pin knows that there are certain industries that have a particular flavour and need.&nbsp;Other Mayors would have also understood there are different dynamics, and they have been able to, for example, organise job fairs which suit their districts, because people also do not want to travel very far when they want to work, if they can.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee said the CDCs may have a particular mould and they may get a stigma.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain to Members that, indeed, we are moving towards a work-assisted programme rather than pure&nbsp;unconditional handouts, and new terms beyond \"Workfare\", the CDCs have come up with \"WorkSupport\", \"WorkAssist\" - there is always a \"Work\" in front - which is what we are trying to move our system towards.&nbsp; That, \"Yes,&nbsp;you can come and we can help you, but you also must put in some effort and we can tie up social&nbsp;assistance and employment assistance at the CDCs\".&nbsp; That is actually what the Mayors, MCYS and MOM want to do.&nbsp; In fact, that indeed is the correct direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think there are possibilities because we have, as you said, decentralised it.&nbsp; These possibilities include things like micro-enterprises and even an informal sector.&nbsp; The CDCs offer out, for example, local licences to sell ice-creams or other items, and they can integrate these programmes because it is very geographically-based.&nbsp; But let me assure&nbsp;Members that we do not adopt a hands-off approach.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;WDA supports, and will continue to support the CDCs in several ways, in addition to more&nbsp;funding.&nbsp; It will work with the CDCs to constantly review on how they can improve their placement, and&nbsp;draw on best practices.&nbsp; We also organise and train on profiling and career counselling of job seekers.&nbsp; You actually need trained professionals who know how to do it. &nbsp;It provides IT support and information on jobs and we&nbsp;also deploy managers to head certain job centres.&nbsp; Sometimes, WDA seconds managers to head these job centres.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will regularly monitor and review the performance of these job centres with the CDCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So although job placements are done at the CDCs, there is quite a strong&nbsp;coordination and&nbsp;support.&nbsp; But I agree with&nbsp;Members that we will review, learn and improve.&nbsp; Let me just say, to be fair to the CDCs, that they have done a very good job.&nbsp; They have placed more than 16,000 job seekers in 2005, 55% of whom had secondary and below education.&nbsp; When we met with the Mayors, as we started this, and some Mayors will remember, I was very careful to point out that the CDCs can actually make their lives easier by choosing only the more and better qualified ones, the ones with good education, and that makes their placement rate very high, but they may not need&nbsp;their help.&nbsp; But as you and I know, some of the cases that come to us during the meet-the-people sessions, indeed, it is quite challenging for anyone to look at face value and say, \"Well, I am going to employ you.\"&nbsp; They need a lot of hand-holding, training and confidence-building.&nbsp; And for the CDCs to have placed 16,000, including some of these job seekers, is indeed an achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;53% were aged 40 and above. So the CDCs cannot be accused of selecting the best ones to place.&nbsp;&nbsp;58% of those directly placed in jobs by the CDCs remained in their jobs for at least&nbsp;three months.&nbsp; So let us be fair to them.&nbsp; We know the type of people that we send to CDCs to ask them to place and they are not easy, they are not the ones with sterling resumes or, some, to be frank, with good job attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I do not think that removing the CDCs from the Distributed Careerlink Network will serve us&nbsp;better.&nbsp; In fact, we will lose them as valuable partners.&nbsp; I constantly assure them that we will support them, and we will continue to support them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second key focus is the Job Recreation Programme (JRP) and this is spearheaded by&nbsp;NTUC and has been very successful.&nbsp; The most important element in my mind, the most significant success that NTUC has done in the JRP, is to give hope.&nbsp; That is very tangible, and in many sectors, much needed for workers.&nbsp; It is very hard to get. Some of their stories are simply uplifting.&nbsp; To give hope to the masses of workers to say, \"I can compete at my own level.&nbsp; I can have the confidence.&nbsp; I can move up.&nbsp;I, indeed, can see my wages go up.&nbsp; I can see my life being better\", is something that very few unions in the world, and many have promised, but I tell you very few have delivered and NTUC should be given full credit for what they have done to the JRP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will show its support by giving $40 million over the next three years to support this programme.&nbsp; The $40 million will be used to recreate existing jobs and they work with&nbsp;companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions have an enormous and extensive network that knows the ground, so they are going to work with companies, and as Mr Chay and&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng have pointed out, it is not just giving money.&nbsp; You have to raise productivity, enhance job worth, improve the image, train workers to do the job well.&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see Mr Lim Swee Say&nbsp;wearing different costumes, depending on which month you flip back in the newspapers -&nbsp;one month is a baker's hat, then it is a security guard, and I am not sure what he is going to wear next.&nbsp; The point is it is a total package.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have other programmes.&nbsp; WDA and NTUC are supporting the Singapore Taxi Academy and this is&nbsp;to enhance the job scope of local taxi drivers.&nbsp; Sir, the idea that NTUC and the JRP had was: how&nbsp;do you increase the value add?&nbsp; So, not only restricted to a taxi driver, but can he be a&nbsp;medical services chaperon?&nbsp; Because he is&nbsp;the first person to meet the patient, can he be a&nbsp;medical services chaperon (MSC) to ferry patients to and from hospitals?&nbsp;&nbsp;To become MSCs, the taxi drivers will undergo training to acquire patient handling skills, I suppose, how to move people on wheelchairs,&nbsp;and to familiarise themselves with the hospitals. With the enhanced job scope, the taxi drivers can expect to take home higher pay. By providing a transfer service for medical tourists between hospitals and airports, the project will also support Singapore's development into a regional hub for international medical services.&nbsp; It is a smart idea.&nbsp; He brings the patient to the hospital, and the family would also want to do some shopping and sightseeing and he also recommends to them.&nbsp; The economy wins.&nbsp; So this is what NTUC means by a win-win-win formulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with what Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Chay Wai Chuen have said, that it really is a complete supply chain that you need to work it out, in terms of job redesign.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>We need to look at a range of solutions.&nbsp; And I was very thankful to&nbsp;Mr Chay&nbsp; that he brought up the Tanjong Pagar Town Council, because that is one classic example of how, as he pointed out,&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to only change the landscape in terms of contract, we have to change on how&nbsp;we mechanise and what&nbsp;we need to do to finally make a change in the industry.&nbsp; I will tell&nbsp;Members that that is a very good example of how partnership between Government&nbsp;and the unions have allowed us to navigate through difficult circumstances in restructuring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to move on to more industries.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;in healthcare, the National University Hospital is implementing a flexible work scheduling system.&nbsp; This will allow nurses to enjoy a better work-life balance.&nbsp; The Singapore General Hospital is reviewing the job responsibilities and career paths of staff in nursing and nursing support -&nbsp;enhance their&nbsp;job scope so that they can earn more and professionalise the jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister launched the&nbsp;JRP and gave out&nbsp;some awards.&nbsp; Each story was an inspiration, but let me just mention one that has made a difference to a JRP, Ms Thilagarani.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Thilagarani is currently undergoing training in the ITE Skills Certificate in Health Care, and&nbsp;when she&nbsp;graduates, she will work as a Patient Services Clerk at SGH. Once the job redesign has been implemented, Ms Thilagarani will take on the non-nursing tasks and some of the nursing duties currently performed by enrolled nurses.&nbsp; She&nbsp;can expect to receive a higher pay, ranging from $1,100 to $1,300.&nbsp; In fact, many beneficiaries of the JRP have enjoyed higher earnings -&nbsp;between $1,000 and $1,800.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we take Mr Chay's point that the JRP is&nbsp;not just giving money.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;under the job redesign incentive, each company can get up&nbsp;to $120,000.&nbsp; They can use it for&nbsp;job redesign, and this includes consultancy, procurement of equipment and training.&nbsp; This reflects the multi-faceted aspect of job redesign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang pointed out that older and lower-skilled workers can encounter difficulties.&nbsp; We will put in $30 million over the next three years to help these workers - about 45,000 of them&nbsp;can benefit&nbsp;-for basic aspects of IT literacy, workplace literacy and numeracy. &nbsp;WDA will&nbsp;provide another $4 million&nbsp;for SMEs, because we recognise that workers in SMEs also need training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at end of last year, more than 4,000 workers have been trained under ESS. Again, these figures can get bland, they can get dull, but they represent individual lives which have been touched&nbsp;by these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members&nbsp;have also expressed concern for PMETs - professionals, managers, executives and technicians.&nbsp; Specifically, Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mdm Ho Geok Choo urged for more help for this group.&nbsp; Again, I have good news.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point is that&nbsp;we can render&nbsp;help to these workers if&nbsp;we create&nbsp;enough jobs.&nbsp; The economy will take care of them and, indeed, it has.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two&nbsp;years, it&nbsp;benefited&nbsp;PMETs, more so than other groups. In 2005, PMETs formed the biggest share of private sector job vacancies at 37%.&nbsp; In other words, of all the jobs in the private sector, 37% were due to PMETs.&nbsp; This is in contrast to&nbsp;1995 when only 19%&nbsp;-&nbsp;it is almost double&nbsp;-&nbsp;the proportion of PMET jobs in our economy in the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On average, in 2005, 65% of retrenched PMETs managed to find a job within&nbsp;six months, which is higher than the overall re-employment rate of 61%.&nbsp; This is the highest re-employment rate experienced by retrenched PMETs in four years.&nbsp; So it has improved. &nbsp;Similarly, the unemployment rate for degree and diploma holders above 40 years has dropped to 1.8%.&nbsp; This is the unemployment rate.&nbsp; For degree holders, it is 1.8%; for diploma holders, it is 2.1%.&nbsp; A year ago, it was double that&nbsp;-&nbsp;3.6% and 4%.&nbsp; So the unemployment rate has halved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do have specific programmes for PMETs, including in the SME sector.&nbsp; The SME Manpower Scheme (SMS) is one example.&nbsp; It was introduced in December&nbsp;last year, just recently.&nbsp;This was to recognise that SMS restructured and de-layered.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be fewer jobs.&nbsp; But our SMEs sometimes have many job openings.&nbsp; So this was to help PMETs make a transition to SMEs, and we started this programme in areas such as finance, business development and human resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Members would remember the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme (SMCP) for the healthcare sector, and it&nbsp;has helped registered nurses and diagnostic radiographers.&nbsp; Since its inception,&nbsp;282 PMETs are currently undergoing training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also placed jobs&nbsp;for PMETs.&nbsp; About&nbsp;15,000 PMETs were attended to and&nbsp;about 4,300 found new jobs.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked that we monitor this talent shortage,&nbsp;and this was the point that Mdm Halimah Yacob said, \"Can you give some forecast?\"&nbsp; Indeed, we do.&nbsp; We have the National Manpower Council which is a multi-agency&nbsp;and we meet together&nbsp;-&nbsp;economic agencies, manpower -&nbsp;and we give some forward projections.&nbsp; I agree with the Member that we need&nbsp;to give&nbsp;out more information.&nbsp; This is an area that we need to,&nbsp;not only for PMETs, but also for lower-skilled workers and across-the-board so that people can make career choices and decide what they want to go for training.&nbsp;So we will do that and we will work with industry, and that will form somewhat, as Mdm Ho suggested, a network hub for an advantage scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to be realistic and be honest to say that it does cost more to help one particular PMET.&nbsp; For example, a conversion course for healthcare nursing could, theoretically,&nbsp;help 50 lower-skilled workers.&nbsp; But we recognise the investment and we will pour some investment but there is a need to allocate resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will go the extra mile for service, as many have rightly pointed out.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang says we should up our service capabilities and we will spend $48 million over the next three years to build service capabilities and cultivate a service mindset, because that is where the majority of jobs will come from.&nbsp; I think it has helped.&nbsp; There is a nation-wide service awareness that now occurs.&nbsp; And we will develop&nbsp;WSQ and quality schools in key service industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow service workers to pursue&nbsp;their training. WDA is currently developing national customer service indicators.&nbsp; We want to know whether we have improved nation-wide and sectors.&nbsp; So we need to build some indicators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, before I close this&nbsp;section, let me address Mdm Ho's point about talent shortage,&nbsp;in terms of R&amp;D.&nbsp; She is quite right.&nbsp; We need to understand whether we have enough, and we will conduct regular dialogues with HR and industries -&nbsp;to get from&nbsp;them&nbsp;a sense whether&nbsp;we have&nbsp;a steady pipeline to support our growth initiatives.&nbsp; There are some issues - portable medical benefits and contract workers which Mr Yeo has brought up.&nbsp; With his indulgence, let me defer&nbsp;to answer later together&nbsp;with other Members who have also raised cuts on those issues&nbsp;too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Mr Chairman, people are our most precious asset.&nbsp; We will increase efforts and resources to invest in our workers&nbsp;- young or old and of all educational backgrounds because, indeed, that will be investing in our future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, I just want to seek a clarification from the Minister.&nbsp; I note his explanation that a lot more high value-added jobs have been created.&nbsp; In fact, on the ground, that is the trend that we have also seen.&nbsp; Even as manufacturing companies relocate, more higher value-added jobs are created.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do note that in these sectors where high value-added jobs are created -&nbsp;high-value added manufacturing, aerospace, bio-medicals -&nbsp;there seem to be a strong presence of foreign workers.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; is there a strategy on the part of MOM working with EDB, maybe working with the Ministry of Education, in order to ensure that, over time,&nbsp;three-five years or so, there will be more Singaporeans actually going into these higher value-added jobs in some of these sectors?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, it is a valid and good point.&nbsp; Our overall strategy is to ensure that our growth benefits Singaporeans first.&nbsp; That is the cardinal rule and over-arching strategy.&nbsp; But, of course, there are realities.&nbsp; For example, whether it is the bio-medical manufacturing sector or aerospace, where we, first, wanted to&nbsp;establish an aerospace MRO -&nbsp;maintenance, repair and overhaul - we needed to ramp up.&nbsp; The airline industries were willing to send their planes here, but we did not have the technicians.&nbsp; And it takes at least two-three years to go through a polytechnic course and another&nbsp;four years for experience.&nbsp; To train our local pipeline, we only train them for what RSAF needs, for example,&nbsp;for some of our planes, and this would mean that&nbsp;we have to hold back.&nbsp; We recognise these practical realities.&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the same time that we allow more foreign workers initially, we slowly scale back, and this is indeed what happens.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will happen for every sector.&nbsp; As some Members may have read, Macau is facing a shortage of workers in IR industry.&nbsp; And I am sure that we will face the same shortage.&nbsp; So we will calibrate it. But, overall, I think the figures will give some assurance&nbsp;-&nbsp;as I said, our unemployment has dropped&nbsp;-&nbsp;that the value of the jobs has gone up and Singaporeans have gone up the value chain.&nbsp; So it is a metric that we watch very closely.&nbsp; We will ensure that Singaporeans have good quality jobs and that their wages can go up.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister why he thinks that statistical data on under-employment and skills inadequacy employment are not really useful to understand the extent of the problem of structural unemployment, given the fact that some of these people might actually not&nbsp;maximise their skills and also their qualifications and experience in certain jobs.&nbsp; And that would not generate a maximum effect&nbsp;in the economy.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, I did not quite say that I did not think they were useful.&nbsp; I was saying that it was very hard to measure under-employment&nbsp; -&nbsp; not unemployment.&nbsp; It is under-employment which is Mr Low Thia&nbsp;Khiang's point.&nbsp; In other words, if we took a survey of 1,000 workers in a particular company and say, \"How many of you think you can do a bigger job than what you are currently doing?\", you may get answers.&nbsp; In fact, the service worker may think that he or she should be manager. But how do I act on it?&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey of under-employment is a measure of aspiration&nbsp;-&nbsp;what I want to become or what bigger job I want to do.&nbsp; Very few countries track that, honestly.&nbsp; The only proxy that we have is asking somebody, \"You are working part-time, do you want to work full-time?\"&nbsp; That is quite objective.&nbsp; That is based on time.&nbsp; But if you&nbsp;ask him, \"Are you working to the fullest of your potential?\",&nbsp;I would venture a guess that many Members in this House would say that a good proportion would say no and, therefore, you are under-employed too.&nbsp; So it is a difficult metric to measure and it is not useful from a planning point of view.&nbsp; What we want to do is to make available training courses and provision for&nbsp;workers to step up, so that if they want to, we provide the training to the best of our ability.&nbsp; And then,&nbsp;they must also go and market themselves in the marketplace to move to a better job.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is not that we do not find it useful.&nbsp; It is that the data is quite subjective.&nbsp; But we do look at other issues, in terms of part-time, full-time, employment rate, wages and the percentage share of PMETs' jobs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, in encouraging the low-income workers to qualify for the Workfare Bonus, they have to work continuously for six months before they can qualify for the Workfare Bonus.&nbsp; I am glad that the Government has been flexible in allowing workers who have worked accumulatively for six months during the last 12 months to qualify as well.&nbsp; I think accumulatively is very good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many low-income workers can now qualify for the Workfare Bonus.&nbsp; We know that a lot of low-income workers work for three days and stop for two days.&nbsp; Today, they work as a painter, next week, they&nbsp;sell durians.&nbsp; On another week, they&nbsp;may be doing&nbsp;another job.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very grateful that the Government is&nbsp;flexible in dealing with this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing is a technical problem which MOM would face, ie,&nbsp;how do you count the six months?&nbsp; There are many&nbsp;workers who ask,&nbsp;\"If&nbsp;we work five months and 28 days, will we be ruled out?\"&nbsp; I think we should take five&nbsp; working days as one week, hence,&nbsp;28 working days should be&nbsp;deemed to be&nbsp;one month.&nbsp; If they work hard and deserve the bonus, we should give it to them.&nbsp; They are the people who deserve our help.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

However, this goes to show that people do feel that even 40 years old and above are deemed older workers by some employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will do more to encourage both the public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private sectors to employ more older workers. We know that workers above 50 years old are not necessarily less energetic, slower or less capable than the younger workers.&nbsp; Older workers have experience and wisdom.&nbsp; These traits are in fact very valuable.&nbsp; There are many fine examples of people around the world who are still productive when they reach the age of 50, 60, 70 and even 80.&nbsp; In the US, Warren Buffett, the world's richest man is still working at the age of 82. He has not mentioned about retirement.&nbsp; In Singapore, we also have our own notable examples of our President, Mr S R Nathan, and, of course, our Minister Mentor, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who are also in their 80s.&nbsp; They are doing a great job and soldiering on.&nbsp; Most commendable, Sir!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As medical care and healthcare improve, people will live longer and remain mentally and physically active for longer years.&nbsp; I feel strongly that the Government should lead by example.&nbsp; It should stop labelling the older workers and curb the practice of early retirement of our senior civil servants, army officers, police officers, general staff and workers.&nbsp; Older workers should be encouraged to work as long as they can and willing to.&nbsp; They would agree to be paid less as they have passed their peak, but employment should continue.&nbsp; Older workers would not feel any sense of shame or stigma if they are paid less, provided they continue to be gainfully employed.&nbsp; They will retain their pride.&nbsp; Therefore, I strongly urge the Government, statutory boards, GLCs, and TLCs to&nbsp;take the lead to employ more older workers.&nbsp; The private sector would then follow the Government's example.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Sir, finding employment for older workers, especially those who are not equipped with special skills, is a problem.&nbsp; The current trend among employers is to find ways and means to retrench older workers and push them back into the job market.&nbsp; For the next employer, it is a long and painful process to reassess the ability and performance of these retrenched older workers.&nbsp; We need to change this trend of shoving our older workers to&nbsp;the job market at age 40 to 50.&nbsp; While I am not advocating an iron rice bowl mentality, we need to encourage our employers to look into the redeployment of their workers at each stage of their employment career so that their skill sets stay relevant and they can contribute positively to the job market.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should make definite review at definite stages of a worker's employment.&nbsp; The review of the skill set of the employee can be from a helicopter view of the person or a review of the actual skill set needed for him or her to handle the work.&nbsp; Employers should plan and chart ahead of a person's career in the company.&nbsp; This review can be done when the employee is at the age of 30,&nbsp;40,&nbsp;50,&nbsp;and after which the review can possibly be done at shorter intervals as the employee becomes older.&nbsp; At each stage, the workers are encouraged to stay on at work.&nbsp; The main objective is to keep people working and to create the environment so that they can stay longer to get additional training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this definite review would also be in line with the&nbsp;remuneration of an employee.&nbsp; He is paid for what he is doing and not based on his seniority.&nbsp; In this manner, companies are more willing to keep the older workers within the company.&nbsp; They would&nbsp;have to assess between reliability and agility.&nbsp; And as human beings, at different stages in our life, our physical and mental capability will vary.

Where are we stalling?&nbsp; When can we begin this portable medical benefits scheme?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we should be able to review the jobs within the job market as many of our older workers do not have specific skills.&nbsp; We can get employers and unions to agree that certain general jobs be reserved for older workers, eg,&nbsp;F&amp;B work, kitchen helpers, storekeeping, support staff in libraries and childcare centres,&nbsp;and other backroom operations where the demands are not pressing.&nbsp; The older workers can be channelled to work in these areas.&nbsp; Those who have the qualifications,&nbsp;skills and&nbsp;ability to cope will, of course, take on more front-end jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I am glad that the Minister has mentioned that it is important to develop the service culture under GEMS.&nbsp; Unfortunately, recently, when we encouraged our hawker stallholders to talk about GEMS, WDA is not as supportive of this matter itself.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few years ago, we were saying that by&nbsp;age 50,&nbsp;we need to have savings for our old age, a wife to keep us company, some friends to talk to and good health to do what&nbsp;we want to do.

Some of the training courses should be conducted in Mandarin to enable the older workers to participate in.&nbsp; We need to actively settle this matter.&nbsp; If we do not do it now, it would be a problem in the future.&nbsp; As we promote lifelong learning and lifelong working, we should encourage everybody to work and find some suitable work for them to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I have residents coming to me looking for jobs.&nbsp; They used to be 40-plus or 50-plus, but, increasingly, over the last few years, 60-plus, 70-plus, and they always ask where are the jobs for them.&nbsp; I have referred them to the North East CDC,&nbsp;as all of us are now looking for jobs for older workers and they share a databank with other CDCs. And a few months, half a year&nbsp;or sometimes a year later, the same residents would come back and say no job-matching for them yet.&nbsp; Even those who have been job-matched, they say the employers tell them, \"Sorry, you are too old\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a recurring story, Sir, and I feel that there must be some truth in what they are saying.&nbsp; I understand that the CDCs are doing as good a job as they can.&nbsp; But I think the problem is deeper.&nbsp;&nbsp;One is whether there are jobs for them.&nbsp; The Minister said that there were 61,000 jobs created last year.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, of these 61,000 jobs, how many have gone&nbsp;to older workers.&nbsp; I also want to support the point made by my hon. colleague, Mdm Cynthia Phua, about whether we can reserve some jobs for older workers.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;looking at the job landscape and&nbsp;these jobs that are being created, which&nbsp;all the investments are bringing in, can we, say,&nbsp;\"<I>chope</I>\" a few for our older workers, without introducing rigidity into the system or&nbsp;making our employers uncompetitive, ie,&nbsp;giving them wage enhancement and&nbsp;training, making sure that they are up to&nbsp;the job?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister whether he would consider setting up a job-matching centre dedicated to older workers because, with the present system, we have the CDCs doing it.&nbsp; They have many other things to look out for.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are community programmes to do and&nbsp;welfare&nbsp;assistance to look out for.&nbsp; So, when the older workers&nbsp;go to them&nbsp;with their problems - they may&nbsp;have medical problems and&nbsp;some of them may have problems finding suitable jobs - they may not receive the care and attention that they need.&nbsp; Given that we have an ageing workforce, and that this trend will continue far into the future, should we not invest in a centre dedicated to finding jobs for older workers, training them, placing them, giving them the necessary support that they need?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is done in other countries.&nbsp; In Japan, as we know, it has the Silver Jinzai Centre, a human resource centre which matches employers and job-seekers aged 60 and above.&nbsp; It registers about 750,000 senior workers and, according to their record, about 80% of them are placed in jobs ranging from school tutor to gardener.&nbsp; I am not sure whether we have achieved anywhere near their&nbsp;success rate for our older workers in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Britain, they have a government programme that provides job search assistance for people aged 50 and older when they have been out of work for six months or longer, and also offers training opportunities and wage enhancement.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for such a centre, and I hope that our Minister for Manpower will consider this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasingly, we are also moving towards&nbsp;the re-employment of older workers beyond the&nbsp;retirement age of 62.&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend all the initiatives done under ADVANTAGE! to give incentives to employers to hire older workers, and I know more will be invested in this initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope, when the contracts are being renegotiated, that MOM will make sure that older workers will not be discriminated against or even exploited.&nbsp; Sometimes, I wonder, especially for higher skilled workers, say,&nbsp;they are 62 years&nbsp;today, doing the same kind of job, contributing as much as ever, then when&nbsp;they are 63, suddenly,&nbsp;their value drops, as if, overnight,&nbsp;they have changed.&nbsp; But all that has changed really is that time has passed.&nbsp; And I worry that, if we move in this direction without clear guidelines, employers will say, \"OK, you are 63 today, half your pay, no medical benefits and no annual leave, because the Government is now moving towards re-employment of older workers and this is what employers must do.&nbsp; Therefore, it is acceptable to cut your pay according to a new contract.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know that the unions are working very hard to make sure that workers get fair terms.&nbsp; But I hope that employers will also do their part, and that the Ministry of Manpower will also make sure that when&nbsp;employers hire older workers beyond 62,&nbsp;it will be on fair terms for them.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is more so, as our population matures and Singaporeans live longer as a result of improving standards of healthcare and quality of life.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I applaud the Minister for setting up the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers.&nbsp; The Committee has submitted an interim report, and I understand it is expected to complete its work by the end of the year.&nbsp; The Committee may be looking at legislation for the re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; I have read the report.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whilst I acknowledge that the Committee's work is work-in-progress and it may be some time yet before legislation can take place, I suggest we start changing perceptions and mindsets among employers, and this includes the Government, to encourage them to employ older workers.&nbsp; Older workers have the advantage of wisdom, experience, stability and knowledge,&nbsp;which, like what&nbsp;my colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, has said,&nbsp;the younger workers do not have.&nbsp; Perhaps, we could initiate a nation-wide campaign to educate all employers on the virtues of employing older workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I suggest that the Government take the lead and implement practices to employ older workers in the public sector, in much the same way as what the Government had done in the past in taking the lead in employing handicapped Singaporeans, ex-prisoners and ex-drug addicts in the public service.&nbsp; The&nbsp;engagement of these older workers could be on shorter durations, on contract basis, say, one-year, two-year or&nbsp;three-year contract, renewable every year subsequently, or it can be on a project or assignment basis.&nbsp; These jobs need not necessarily be limited to menial jobs like cleaners, sweepers and lift attendants, but could be extended to include the services of&nbsp;older professionals such as engineers, accountants, managers, and clerical officers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, by doing so, we can convince private sector employers to do the same and start re-employing older workers.&nbsp; May I urge the Minister to convey this suggestion to the Public Service Division of the Ministry of Finance for implementation?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, with the number of changes proposed and made to CPF, for example, lower CPF contribution rate and ceiling, Singaporeans worry that savings for old age will be eroded.&nbsp; We must ensure that our workers' CPF savings will have stable and reasonably good returns.&nbsp; Allowing individual CPF members to invest their savings seems not to be&nbsp;a preferred choice, and the privately-managed pension plan also does not seem to be an effective alternative.&nbsp; So what is the Ministry's long-term plan for CPF savings&nbsp;to ensure that we have better returns?&nbsp;

Members who have spoken in support of the recommendations from the Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers.&nbsp; This is in specific reference to Workfare and other initiatives.&nbsp; Indeed, many MPs - Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Mr Wee Siew Kim, Mr Ong Ah Heng, Dr Amy Khor and&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng -&nbsp;had previously in this House raised the need to look after the lower-income group and to help them&nbsp;cope with the effects of economic restructuring and globalisation.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp;in response to these calls and public feedback that the Prime Minister set up the Multi-Ministry Committee in July 2005.&nbsp; In formulating our strategies, the ministerial committee consulted widely and listened attentively. &nbsp;Members of the committee met with employers, unionists, community and social&nbsp;leaders, low-wage workers themselves - we had some sessions with them -&nbsp;and the general public.&nbsp; This gave the committee an in-depth appreciation of the poverty traps, the vicious cycles of the low-wage workers&nbsp;and their families that kept them down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Members of this House would have read the report that we had circulated, and&nbsp;will be gratified that the majority of stakeholders that we consulted, like many Members in this House, and indeed the low-wage workers themselves, argued against \"unconditional needs-based assistance.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;Many&nbsp;understood that such an approach was not sustainable and, in fact, did not help workers over the long term.&nbsp; Workers wanted help to contribute to the economy and gain self-reliance.&nbsp; This is what they told us.&nbsp; The recommendations were crafted, taking in their feedback and views. &nbsp;After the release of the report, the committee received positive feedback from diverse groups of Singaporeans. &nbsp;While we are gratified with the resonance and affirmation, it would be prudent to focus on the fundamentals of our recommendations on how we should assist low wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, continued economic growth and job creation is the best assurance of a better future for low wage workers;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the efforts to help low wage workers must reinforce our strong work ethic;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, increasing opportunities for upward mobility should be the main means to help low wage workers; and&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we will focus on raising the skills and know-how of the next generation, to create hope for their future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the four fundamental principles which we listed in our report.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has approved the recommendations and set aside $1 billion to implement them.&nbsp; While the Workfare Bonus has attracted much attention during the Budget debate, I want to refocus attention on where the main emphasis of our recommendations lies.&nbsp; Yes, the Workfare Bonus was meant to incentivise work and help meet short-term needs.&nbsp; This was a practical response to the reality that the incomes of low wage workers were held down as a result of globalisation.&nbsp; We understood that.&nbsp; And it was positioned as a one-off scheme over two years for reasons spelt out by the Prime Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want Members to&nbsp;note also that the larger share of $630 million of the&nbsp;$1-plus billion is to meet long-term goals through recurrent spending.&nbsp; Not one-off.&nbsp; $230 million will be spent on enabling work, expanding job opportunities and training for higher skills.&nbsp; About&nbsp;$250 million will be spent on helping the children of such families move ahead in life.&nbsp; Another $150 million will be spent to help them own homes and have assets as a reward for their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations are not an election ploy, as some have suggested. &nbsp;The ultimate goal, through the next election and every election thereafter, is to ensure that Singaporeans progress together, as one people.&nbsp; I quote from the report, chapter&nbsp;1, paragraph 10:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The common vision of Singaporeans working and progressing together must carry on through to the next generation.&nbsp; We must help those who can work to find meaningful jobs and earn adequate wages to support themselves and their families. &nbsp;They should be able to own their homes, educate their children and put aside enough for their medical and retirement needs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Singaporeans must share in the fruits of our progress.&nbsp; These are not just short-term aspirations but long-term goals that this Government has committed itself to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some of the specific concerns and questions about the Workfare Bonus raised by Members during the Budget debate and in this COS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Seng Han Thong's question, we assess regular work based on the number of months worked, rather than on the number of days worked.&nbsp; We know that there are&nbsp;cases that&nbsp;need special consideration.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are not&nbsp;completely inflexible.&nbsp; As the hon. Member rightly pointed out, we have already made one adjustment by relaxing the six continuous months' rule to six months over one year for those who have really genuine difficulties. &nbsp;But I would like to remind Members that the thrust of the Workfare Bonus scheme&nbsp;is&nbsp;to incentivise long-term goals, to make sure that the worker keeps a steady job, for at least six months or more, to be self-reliant.&nbsp; That is the overall goal of the scheme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Workfare Bonus is deliberately divided into two portions, so that those who did not qualify for it this year will do so next year.&nbsp; So we want to encourage them to try to enter the economy, now that the jobs are there, to find a regular job.&nbsp; I know that it will cause some pain on the ground, but workers will have to adjust.&nbsp; I think it is the right thing to do, and we will need, as we said, help from the community, as well as business and unions, to achieve that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our counter staff at the various CCs, CDCs and CPF Board&nbsp;have been trained to direct the unemployed who cannot qualify to the Distributed CareerLink Network and the job centres to allow them to have&nbsp;more comprehensive assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam pointed out that those who work hard and then exceed the upper limits may not receive the Workfare Bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that for&nbsp;that person&nbsp;who has worked very hard and does not receive it, he may feel that this is not equitable.&nbsp; But all of us recognise that we are targeting that assistance to the lower-income group and that there has to be a ceiling to that, and we have chosen $1,500.&nbsp; In response to his example of&nbsp;the $2,500, he has forgotten that that family can benefit from the housing grant, which is not a small sum by any measure -&nbsp;$20,000, $15,000, $10,000 and $5,000 - and this is on top of other housing&nbsp;grants</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>that we have given out.&nbsp; I do not think that we should cast it as if Singaporeans will not get anything if they work very hard. That is not the message, but we are targeting our assistance to lower-wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate and COS, both Dr Lily Neo and Dr Warren Lee&nbsp;highlighted that some workers would be afraid to sign up for the Workfare Bonus in case they got themselves and the employers into trouble for not paying their CPF.&nbsp; Let me assure Members that the purpose of the income declaration exercise is to facilitate those without CPF contributions and who not have received&nbsp;an income tax return to receive their Workfare Bonus if they fill up that declaration form.&nbsp; It must be a true declaration because we can verify in some cases and the penalties are quite stern.&nbsp; But if it is a true declaration, the purpose of the income form is to facilitate the Workfare Bonus.&nbsp;If during the process, they decide that they want to complain against the employer, we will act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on Workfare Bonus, Mr Seng Han Thong has suggested using this exercise to promote the concept of Workfare.&nbsp; We agree, because we believe that for Workfare to work,&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to help that layer of Singaporeans who find it hard to cope with restructuring.&nbsp; Yes, there will be skill gaps, attitude gaps and aptitude gaps, but if we resort to an unconditional need-based, in other words, if you need, I give it to you, we would&nbsp;have done them a disservice because they will expect the next handout every time they need it.&nbsp; So we have to couple it with these efforts to make them self-reliant and I take that&nbsp;some difficulty there will&nbsp;incentivise them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about&nbsp;employability of older workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has been close to many Members' hearts in the past.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee, Mr Loh Meng See, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ahmad Magad and, recently, Mr Seng Han Thong talked about training that we&nbsp;ought to incentivise this training, and we agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members&nbsp;- Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Chew Heng Ching - have now asked that we&nbsp;ought to ask employers and industries not to view older workers negatively, and to highlight enlightened employers who hire older workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested an Equal Opportunities Commission.&nbsp; Let me say that Government feels as passionately as Members, but we&nbsp;need to translate your passion into real results, and that is our job.&nbsp; And we want to&nbsp;take a very pragmatic approach that works.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;want to caution ourselves that this would take time. We will need to work with industries and every industry&nbsp;that we succeed in will be a step forward.&nbsp; But there will be very few magic bullets that we can shoot.&nbsp; We do not agree with the quota system and&nbsp;for good reasons that the PM&nbsp;mentioned.&nbsp; If you move&nbsp;down that way, it will be no different from having moved down, and,&nbsp;in my last reply, I talked about how when you&nbsp;asked for quotas for older workers, it will basically&nbsp;rigidify your labour market and&nbsp;it is very inflexible and&nbsp;people can work around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are quotas for older workers, why not we have quotas for women or other groups?&nbsp; In the end,&nbsp;you are left with&nbsp;a very small group that would not have a quota, so it&nbsp;is&nbsp;reverse discrimination.&nbsp; In other countries where quotas have been applied, it has not worked.&nbsp; We&nbsp;think that we&nbsp;ought to change practices pervasively and work very hard at it.&nbsp; But we have acted on some of&nbsp;the Members'&nbsp;suggestions, and&nbsp;one way to go is the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment and Practices, which is one suggestion of the Tripartite Committee to promote mindset change of&nbsp; employers and employees. They will go on a roadshow sometime this year. This is in response to Mr Chew Heng Ching and Mr Ong Ah Heng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will&nbsp;publicise examples of good employers and excellent older workers.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will facilitate sharing of best&nbsp; practices and pilot projects that have worked.&nbsp;Many of&nbsp;you have asked for the civil service to take the lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Teo Chee Hean&nbsp;has answered&nbsp;on what&nbsp;the civil service position is.&nbsp; To just add on to his reply, civil service is aware and&nbsp;is in tune.&nbsp; In fact, they were&nbsp;very much involved in our discussions. There are certain organisations that require certain aspects. We do need a&nbsp;vibrant and young SAF to be optimal&nbsp;but where the civil service can move in certain areas.&nbsp; We will work with them to develop some of the programmes&nbsp;that can&nbsp;redeploy some of&nbsp;the older workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of it, we have to convince businesses that there is a business advantage for hiring older workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forward-thinking companies around the world have already started changing their employment and work practices to accommodate older workers. In essence, they are&nbsp;turning the problem on its head and using an ageing workforce to its business&nbsp;advantage because they know that that is the group that is growing the fastest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you one example,&nbsp;IBM&nbsp;in the United States. IBM was concerned about the shortage of IT workers, and it&nbsp;looked at post-retirement employment, alternative work schedules, benefits, mentoring, and ways to transfer knowledge. The company is now working to engage former IBM alumni.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;have an IBM alumni where they worked for the company, they&nbsp;keep a database, if&nbsp;they move and the company needs them&nbsp;later,&nbsp;they will bring them&nbsp;back.&nbsp;This is an on-call-on-demand workforce which they&nbsp;are capitalising.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these retirees are engaged via intermediaries to work on projects.&nbsp; The scope may not be long but&nbsp;it may work both for the company and the employee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BT Group in the United Kingdom is&nbsp;another forward-thinking employer. It started a programme&nbsp;called&nbsp;NewStart and this&nbsp;challenges employees' expectations about retiring early. The programme provides flexible options.&nbsp;&nbsp;I presume near retirement, they would say that these are options that you&nbsp;can tick off, that you do not have to retire, you can either be redeployed, job-share at lower grades,&nbsp;phased sabbaticals, reduction in working hours, and secondment to other companies. There is a menu of choices, and we will learn from these examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who act now will find it in their best interest, but we have to work with industries.&nbsp; This is something that you cannot grandstand and say that this is good or this is what you want.&nbsp; You have to engage the industries to slowly change their practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers also need to change their mindsets, in terms of being redeployed and being adaptable to flexible working schedule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of specific measures, what have we rolled out?&nbsp; I am pleased to report that even though we launched the ADVANTAGE! scheme quite recently,&nbsp;31 companies have&nbsp;come on board.&nbsp; Together, these 31 companies&nbsp;who hire more than 800 older workers retain 480 workers approaching or above age 62, and implement job redesign projects that will improve the work of 4,400 older workers. They span various sectors, including manufacturing,&nbsp;F&amp;B, retail, public transportation, and healthcare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you one local example.&nbsp;&nbsp;SingHealth&nbsp;has tapped on ADVANTAGE! to set up what they call a Silver Connection Office.&nbsp; I promise you that you will get a slew of these new initiatives coming up.&nbsp; It is called the&nbsp;Silver Connection Office run by mature workers for mature workers, something like what Ms Irene Ng said, a dedicated centre for job search for older workers.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Silver Connection Office will recommend working options, new roles and older worker-friendly policies as well as run activities, workshops, and counselling services for SingHealth's 5,200 mature employees.&nbsp; For a start, the Silver Connection Office has hired a 60-year-old Programme Consultant on a one-year contract to manage this set-up.&nbsp; Programme executives&nbsp;will be hired to staff the office and go through a preparatory Diploma in Counselling Psychology course, subsidised by ADVANTAGE's training grant.&nbsp; This office aims to re-employ about 80% of its retiring employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translink Express&nbsp;is another company that has come on board.&nbsp; Translink Express helps&nbsp;food service chains like Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf to deliver food products from the warehouse to the outlet. Originally, the products were transported in pallets and this&nbsp;required physical strength to lift them.&nbsp; Further, you have to do it in two trips because you have to do it for chilled and non-chilled,&nbsp;so&nbsp;delivery workers had to do it twice and this required manual strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;This favoured younger workers.&nbsp;The company recognised that they did not want to change that and with the help of ADVANTAGE! scheme, they found a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of using pallets, it now uses containers and cages which can be used to pack both chilled and unchilled, and this saves the workers one extra trip.&nbsp; They are wheel-mounted for easier movement, and productivity has gone up and is suitable for older workers.&nbsp; These are simple examples that you&nbsp;can do, company by company, process by process, to be able to move this initiative forward.&nbsp; I know it is slow sometimes but we need to persevere.&nbsp;I encourage more companies to come on board and we need to get business leaders and there are many enlightened business leaders who will come on board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Budget debate, some MPs&nbsp;- Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Wee Siew Kim and Mdm Cynthia Phua - asked whether we can help&nbsp;older and less educated workers to set up their own business. WDA is piloting a 12-month programme to help individuals become self-employed and earn a living by starting and managing a business.&nbsp; This is a pilot programme where they are taught how to start and&nbsp;write business plans.&nbsp; One participant in the pilot that has been done so far is&nbsp; Mdm Toh Ah Tuan, who is 45 years old.&nbsp;She has two young children,&nbsp;relying on her husband's monthly pay of $800. Mdm Toh joined this pilot scheme and was put through a three-month job attachment programme at McDonald's, where she was rotated to do different types of work. She also&nbsp;attended the Retail Workforce Skills Qualification&nbsp;course&nbsp;and in February this year,&nbsp;with the help of the mentor,&nbsp;Mdm Toh rented a stall at a coffeeshop to sell fish soup. Her business is doing well&nbsp;and they tell me that&nbsp;she takes in about $180 a day,&nbsp;not bad. The mentor will continue to guide her for the next&nbsp;nine months.&nbsp;I give you this individual example to explain&nbsp;to us that it does require hand-holding and helping for these processes to move along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's earlier question, and also Mr Chew Heng Ching who also talked about&nbsp;looking at re-employment legislation,&nbsp;we will be looking at the legislation that Japan puts in where&nbsp;older workers beyond age 62 are given a re-employment contract.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Ms Irene Ng,&nbsp;we do issue&nbsp;tripartite guidelines on re-employment,&nbsp;medical and other benefits that need&nbsp;to be&nbsp;adjusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were formulated with the inputs of employers and workers, so it is a set of&nbsp;guidelines that form the yardstick and benchmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about portable medical benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, MOH reviewed and revamped MediShield.&nbsp; The changes are to protect Singaporeans against the financial burden of large hospital bills, at least at the Class B2/C level.&nbsp; Members should understand that&nbsp;this is a de facto national scheme that providers will have to subscribe to and cannot cherry pick. In this way, premiums for essential coverage under MediShield are kept affordable. If you think about it, this, in fact,&nbsp;enhances the portability of medical benefits.&nbsp; I want us to be careful, when Members talk about portable medical benefits, where indeed, they may not be talking about portable medical benefits, but&nbsp;about comprehensive medical coverage.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; As long as someone has enough in his Medisave to pay for the premiums for MediShield, even if he is not working or has retired, in essence, he is covered for basic medicare.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the MediShield premiums are affordable. Let me give you an example.&nbsp; We keep saying that it costs a lot to hire workers and we work against ourselves because the messaging is conflicting.&nbsp; We actually reinforce that notion that if the older worker is hired and he falls sick, you have to pay a very high medical bill and if he does not have MediShield, maybe the employer has to pay.&nbsp; The truth is not there.&nbsp; Let me explain why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the annual premium for MediShield for someone age&nbsp;40?&nbsp; It is $40.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>For age 50 it is&nbsp;$80,&nbsp;aged 60 it is&nbsp;$160, and&nbsp;aged 70, it is $275.&nbsp; This is the annual premium.&nbsp; This means that even a worker who earns a few hundred dollars a month would have enough Medisave to pay for his annual premium plus many more years' premium even if he is not working.&nbsp; So the key to portability of medical benefit is you must work long enough and accrue enough in your Medisave.&nbsp; So we should not send mixed messages.&nbsp; I think the revisions in MediShield, in fact, work for older workers, because they were set to protect larger hospital bills, and it is the older workers that are likely to have longer hospital stays to incur larger bills.&nbsp; So, companies, therefore, do not need to be biased against hiring older workers for fear of being saddled with high medical expenses.&nbsp; Now, the tripartite partners are studying how medical coverage can be increased, but that is different from portability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.00 pm&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One idea, as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang pointed out, is to convert what the company spends on medical benefits for its Workfare into individual contribution.&nbsp; Then the worker purchases coverage for himself.&nbsp; The civil service, for example, moves to an individualised system.&nbsp; This is known as the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient System (MSO), where in-patient subsidies were replaced with 1% additional CPF contribution in the civil servant's Medisave account.&nbsp; This may be a model that the tripartite partners can study.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But MPs have also asked to increase coverage to reduce deductibles and co-payment elements.&nbsp; That is quite different from increasing the portability.&nbsp; I want to issue an universal caveat that nothing is for free.&nbsp; For the same premium paid, you can either choose to buy a policy that insures against a big medical bill or a different policy that pays for your smaller bills but less of your big bills.&nbsp; It is a necessary trade-off.&nbsp; But if you want a policy that comprehensively covers&nbsp;the first dollar from the smallest bill to the biggest bill, then your premium must go up.&nbsp; As most big bills are incurred when one is older, I think it is prudent to opt for a system that covers more of your bigger bills through higher deductibles which excludes smaller bills.&nbsp; This will ensure that Medisave contribution lasts beyond retirement, where most medical costs are incurred.&nbsp; So, to reiterate, as long as the person is working and contributes to his Medisave, and has enough in his Medisave account to pay for his premiums for&nbsp;MediShield, even when he is not working the premiums are still paid, he is still covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for helping CPF account holders gain better returns.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh and Dr Teo Ho Pin raised similar issues in the Budget debate.&nbsp; As a first step, many Members will remember that, as on 1st February, we tightened the criteria for entry of new funds.&nbsp; Now they have to meet the benchmark of the top 25 percentile in their global peer group and their expense ratios must be lower than the average.&nbsp; But beyond that, we will help members understand the factors that&nbsp;impact&nbsp;the&nbsp;fund's performance, and make available tools and information through CPF's website.&nbsp; We will also encourage greater disclosure&nbsp;by fund managers and publish information on fees and costs to help members make comparisons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second strategy is PM's suggestion in September last year of a default pension plan which is optimised for the needs of a typical member.&nbsp; Such a scheme would basically aggregate members' funds for long-term investments, to reap economies of scale and lower costs. We are presently studying this, but it will take time.&nbsp; Because it is not just about designing a scheme that is more cost-efficient.&nbsp; The greater challenge is to explain to CPF members that nothing is for free, that higher returns will be accompanied by higher risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The improvements that we need to make to the CPF system will have significant implications for all of us and so I am going to take my time.&nbsp; But we should also draw from the experience of others, taking advice from local and foreign experts. To facilitate this, I am, therefore, pleased to announce that we have set up the International CPF Advisory Panel, chaired by Mr Koh Yong Guan, who is also the Chairman of the CPF Board.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will ask the Clerk to now&nbsp;distribute to Members a press release to be issued by CPFB today on the composition of the Panel. &nbsp;As you can see, the Panel will comprise both local and foreign experts in pension funds and investment management.&nbsp; We do not need to reinvent the wheel.&nbsp; We can learn from their mistakes as well as their pluses. &nbsp;Their advice will help us to better achieve our objective of enhancing returns for members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our combined efforts on these various fronts - low-wage workers, older workers, CPF adequacy, medical benefits - will improve conditions for Singaporeans. &nbsp;It will ensure that we work and progress together.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, the Minister did not reply to my question on whether there are jobs out there for older workers and to reassure that where there are jobs they will be matched to them.&nbsp; Also, he did not reply to my question on whether he would consider having a national centre that will cater to job matching and also to train older workers for new jobs, not SingHealth, but a national one.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, in a sense, I did.&nbsp; I said that last year there were 61,000 jobs created for&nbsp;everyone.&nbsp; So the first&nbsp;question to ask is: are there enough jobs created for Singaporeans?&nbsp; When we create 61,000 jobs for Singaporeans, obviously, if your average number of entrants per year is only 31,000, you have actually created quite a lot of jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the issue becomes:&nbsp; can the person do the job?&nbsp; This is where we can help the older workers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will consider the idea of a dedicated centre for older workers.&nbsp; I am not sure whether that works for&nbsp;or against us.&nbsp; So, let me study that.&nbsp; But let me say on a programmatic basis, we do have specific programmes catering to older workers.&nbsp; She&nbsp;mentioned, for example, whether we can give certain&nbsp;wage supplementation for certain aspects.&nbsp; Indeed, wage supplementation for certain programmes in electronics and other sectors&nbsp;is for older workers.&nbsp; And, indeed, the Workfare Bonus, there is an age criterion&nbsp;-&nbsp;Many of you tell me that I cannot use \"age 40 and above\" and I cannot call them \"older workers\" - so I do not know what I am supposed to say, but it is meant for this special group of people with special age characteristics but, indeed, that is what that programme is called.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</B> Sir, since the Northeast CDC's name was invoked, may I have a chance to clarify?&nbsp; First of all, I would like to thank hon.

I know the Ministry carries out surprise checks and enforcement actions, but these apparently are not regular.&nbsp; Every now and then, I have Singaporeans calling me to&nbsp;complain of certain coffeeshops employing foreign workers to clear their dishes and that certain Town Councils are employing construction work permit holders to do the cleaning service, and that certain construction companies are deploying Bangladeshi work permit holders as drivers to ferry the workers from the hostel to the worksite and back.&nbsp; You can see many of these illegal redeployed drivers along Kranji Road and Admiralty Road turning into Sembawang Shipyard, etc.&nbsp; Sir, these are not allowed under the law, but enforcement action is slack.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry do not just report but the enforcement ---\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman:</B>&nbsp;

<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</B>:&nbsp; Week after week, in my meet-the-people sessions, I see residents coming for financial assistance, and if you scratch the surface a bit, they are often contract workers - contract workers who are not paid regularly or contract workers who have no CPF, or contract workers who have just lost their jobs and are in the hunt for another contract, or contract workers who found another contract job later on at a lower pay.&nbsp; Sir, it seems to me that the trend is on the increase and I feel that more should be done to address this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as my hon. colleague, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said, especially for indirect contract workers, those employed by agencies and deployed to individual employers&nbsp;are often not paid CPF, do not enjoy&nbsp;benefits such as leave entitlement and medical benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a big problem due to cheap sourcing practices, which is still currently the trend, even though we have been promoting best-sourcing.&nbsp; When the bidding of labour supplies drives the tender price down, what happens is that they will eventually squeeze the workers and the wages will suffer.&nbsp; And there is little that the workers can do.&nbsp; Sometimes, they worry about complaining to the Ministry of Manpower because it would mean that they would get into trouble with their employers,&nbsp;it would mean that they would get into trouble with CPF Board if they are not paid CPF,&nbsp;and this is often the case.&nbsp; I also want to reinforce the point made by Dr Lily Neo, and it has been raised to me just last night&nbsp;by my grassroots leaders, that workers are afraid&nbsp;to even&nbsp;apply for Workfare Bonus if they are not paid CPF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister give a very clear signal that if they&nbsp;fill their income declaration form and they claim that they are not paid CPF, that the Government would not go after them or their employer and get them into deeper trouble?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the need to address the trend of contract workers and ensuring that workers' interest are protected,&nbsp;from time to time, the labour movement on its part has helped contract workers where there are problems with payment of salaries, for instance, and now the NTUC is also looking at how to organise them, how to help this growing group of contract workers more effectively.&nbsp; But we need the tripartite efforts of all parties, and I would urge Government Ministries and statutory boards to show the way in adopting best-sourcing practices instead of cheap-sourcing so that the wages of workers are not driven down.&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower should also take&nbsp;active enforcement measures to ensure that contract workers are provided with statutory benefits that they are entitled to under our labour laws.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also want to raise one last issue, which is the fear of losing their jobs.&nbsp; While I understand that from the employer's point of view the trend&nbsp;should be encouraged, that it encourages labour flexibility, helps them to save cost, I hope that the Ministry of Manpower would do more to assure workers that their interests are also protected.&nbsp; The labour movement is doing its part, but we need the Ministry of Manpower to enforce its labour laws and make sure that our contract workers are well taken care of and that there are more options beyond low-wage jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, there is a Chinese saying: \"Rich water must not flow into other people's field.\" In other words, what is good should be retained for your own use and not be extended to others.&nbsp; That was why in the old days, almost all the factories made everything themselves so that they did not lose the business to others. But now, as long as it is more viable, the manufacturers will outsource parts of their processes to save cost.&nbsp; Because of globalisation, everything can now be outsourced, not to only one location but all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, not all outsourcings yield good results. If you are unlucky, your outsourcing may end up as bad-sourcing.&nbsp; Just the other day, Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned the translation&nbsp; in which Katong, the sea turtle became the grandfather of Chew Joo Chiat. This is a typical example of bad-sourcing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outsourcing is a trend that cannot be stopped.&nbsp; In NTUC, our preliminary responsibility is to protect our workers.&nbsp; To us, good-sourcing means if the work is done well, the bosses will not go away.&nbsp; Now, we learn from MOM that there are in fact a lot of cases of bad-sourcing.&nbsp; In order to win the tender, the contractor has to cut its cost, and hence the wages of the workers. If the workers are not well-paid, they would not put their hearts and souls into their work. As a result, the product is sub-standard. The outsourcing became bad-sourcing. When business stops coming, the company will collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that MOM would look at this problem squarely and&nbsp; see how&nbsp; the interest of the workers can be looked after. We should get to the root of the problem early, so that the workers can have good protection.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Workplace Safety and Health</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the number of industrial accidents and occupational diseases has been steadily declining over the years.&nbsp; This is the result of the efforts put in by the Ministry, the employers, unions and the workers in improving the workplace health and safety.&nbsp; What I like to ask is that, with the new Workplace Safety and Health Act introduced on 1st March 2006, what is the response so far from all the stakeholders, particularly the employers?&nbsp; What is MOM's plan to ensure that all workers will be able to have a better understanding of the OHS&nbsp;risk at work so that they can be effectively a whistle-blower at the ground as mentioned in the Act?&nbsp; How would MOM alleviate the fears of the workers being whistle-blowers?&nbsp; There are numerous ways to make the whistle-blower's life hell as soon as he is exposed,</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>and when the employers get to know about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM has introduced a hotline for workers to report safety breaches.&nbsp; What is the volume of the calls and how effective is this hotline?&nbsp; What will MOM do to effectively prevent the whistle blowers being penalised by the employers?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Workplace Safety</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</B>&nbsp; Sir, like Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, I too want to talk about the new Workplace Safety and Health Act, which was passed in Parliament and enacted this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Act is a major piece of legislation for workplace safety in Singapore.&nbsp; It covers general factories, construction sites and&nbsp;shipyards, totalling about 17,000 workplaces.&nbsp; There were 44 fatal&nbsp;workplace accidents last year, and MOM has set a target to reduce workplace fatalities by half within 10 years.&nbsp; I applaud MOM for taking a firm stand on workplace safety.&nbsp; If the tripartite partners, ie, the Government, employers and workers, take a collective and collaborative approach to improving workplace safety, I am confident that our workplace&nbsp; fatality and accident rate could be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I support MOM's objective and approach in improving workplace safety, I have received negative feedback from construction companies who felt that the approach relies too much on using the stick rather than the carrot. Some also felt that the system of workplace safety checks and demerit points could be improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MOM, currently, has a system where demerit points are given for safety breaches at the construction site.&nbsp; Upon accumulating a number of points, the company will be penalised.&nbsp; In the more severe cases, the construction site will be given stop-work orders.&nbsp; The construction companies are also informed of these breaches.&nbsp; Furthermore, the demerit points are given to the construction company regardless of the number of construction projects under its portfolio.&nbsp; With the Workplace Safety and Health Act in place, the enforcement of the demerit system has been retched up.&nbsp; Some large construction companies are facing imminent disqualification from hiring foreign workers.&nbsp; Once they are disqualified, they might as well close shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am sympathetic to their plight and that it is&nbsp; unfair to apply the demerit points to a single company as a whole, regardless of the number of ongoing construction projects.&nbsp; This could act against big companies with multiple projects.&nbsp; Applying the demerit points to&nbsp;a single&nbsp;construction site would be logical if it is also in line with the Government's requirement of the formation of green fuel company for each development project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if the current demerit system were to be retained, perhaps MOM could consider fine tuning it to give more allowances to companies with multiple ongoing construction projects.&nbsp; Further, I hope that the Ministry would move towards a more collaborative approach and work together with companies to improve workplace safety rather than relying heavily on a system of punitive measures.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Gan Kim Yong):</B> Sir, let me, first,&nbsp;begin by thanking&nbsp;Members who have spoken on employment practices and workplace safety. Our efforts to nurture a quality workforce must be supported by parallel programmes to build great workplaces. Employment practices must be fair and equitable, based on ability and productivity. Occupational safety and health systems must be comprehensive and robust.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globalisation and competition may put pressure on companies to cut costs in order to survive. Some may be tempted to take the easy way out by cutting back on the provision of legislated employment benefits. Some may&nbsp;even&nbsp; be prepared to compromise safety and health standards and, in the process,&nbsp;put their workers at risk. These practices are not acceptable and will in the long term undermine the interests of our&nbsp;workforce and our&nbsp;economy as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On employment practices, the Government recognises that more needs to be done to prevent discrimination and other unfair practices at work. During the Budget debate, Mr Ahmad Khalis raised the concern that the \"Mandarin requirement\" in job advertisements was not always relevant to the job. I agree that employers should not use discriminatory criteria. They should assess candidates based on their merits. The Tripartite Guidelines on Non-Discriminatory Job Advertisements serve as a useful guide to employers in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM investigates all complaints of discriminatory employment practices, including those alleging that the \"Mandarin requirement\" was used to exclude non-Chinese candidates. In some cases, employers are able to justify the requirement, such as the need to deal with Mandarin-speaking clientele. However, imposing the \"Mandarin requirement\" in jobs where this is not needed is inappropriate and&nbsp;it will prevent&nbsp;companies from getting the best candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers also recognised the need to improve HR standards in relation to recruitment and retention. It recommended establishing a Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices, which will go beyond age-related issues.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob has asked what role the Alliance will be taking and what measures it will put in place and what resources have been given to the Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Alliance will be set up by June. Led by SNEF and NTUC,&nbsp;it will receive&nbsp;support from MOM.&nbsp; The Alliance will also work with employers, employees and unions to promote&nbsp;a culture of fair and responsible employment practices. The Alliance will start by publishing guidelines and good practices to help shape behaviour. It will also partner relevant agencies to develop industry capabilities and introduce training programmes. Employers that are exemplary in implementing fair employment practices will be recognised. I expect the scope of the Alliance's role to evolve over time as it gains more experience and confidence in&nbsp;promoting fair employment&nbsp;practices at the workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members expressed concern over the impact of certain employment&nbsp;practices on workers.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng was concerned that&nbsp;contract workers were not paid CPF and other statutory employment benefits. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned the need for legislative protection for these workers.&nbsp; Mr Seng Han Thong had urged a more holistic approach to outsourcing to reduce its impact on workers and how we can help them.&nbsp; I will take these issues in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the number of contract workers has been increasing&nbsp;over the past few years, although the overall proportion remains small. MOM's <I>Labour Force Survey</I> showed that the share of workers on short term contracts of less than a year rose from 2.9% in 2001 to 4.9% in 2004. Notwithstanding this increase, the number of successful claims lodged by contract workers under the Employment Act has remained stable over the past few years, at about 200 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract workers enjoy the same protection as permanent full-time employees under our employment laws, such as the CPF Act, the Employment Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act. Their employers must contribute to the CPF if their income exceeds $50 a month. They are also entitled to specific employment benefits under the Employment Act, such as annual leave and medical leave, and overtime pay if they work beyond the contracted hours of work.&nbsp; Mr Yeo pointed out that there is a minimum service period of 3-6 months to qualify for benefits under the Employment Act, and suggested that this should be reviewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, it is not easy to track intermittent employment and it is not easy to verify such employment.&nbsp; It is also not easy to justify on-going liability for an employment contract that has been severed.&nbsp; For example, an employee&nbsp;works for an employer for a short period of time, say, one month. At the end of the month, the contract is terminated or is completed.&nbsp; Later on, if he were to return to the employer to continue to work, the employer would then become liable for the previous employment that they have entered into.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not be fair to the employer and, in the long term, it may, in fact, deter the employer from employing these employees who have left the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we will look at the Act from time to time and see whether we can improve the effectiveness of the Act to protect the interests of contract workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue, today,&nbsp;really is&nbsp;one of compliance and enforcement, not the lack of legal protection for these contract workers. &nbsp;The CPF Board and&nbsp;the Ministry of Manpower will continue to investigate complaints against violations and take serious actions against errant employers, including legal prosecution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees, including contract employees, who are denied their employment benefits under the Employment Act should seek advice and assistance from their unions, if they are union members. Non-unionised workers can approach my Ministry&nbsp;officers for help. Our officers will help the workers to pursue their claims if they have a valid case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important for employees to bring incidences of non-compliance with the law to the attention of the authorities promptly. Any delay in reporting non-payment of salary and CPF will make recovery much more difficult, especially when the company is facing financial difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some employees may agree with their employers to forgo CPF payments in return for higher take-home pay. By doing so, they compromise their retirement savings and financial security, as pointed out by Mr Yeo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo&nbsp;also asked for more statistics on contract workers to be published.&nbsp; We do provide such statistics but, as Mr Yeo would appreciate, it is not easy to track contract workers as many of them are informal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to Mr Seng Han Thong's comments on how we can help workers affected by outsourcing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies operating in Singapore are increasingly outsourcing&nbsp;part of their&nbsp;operations to focus more on their core businesses, and to reduce costs. Of the 10,200 workers retrenched from private sector establishments with at least 25 employees in 2005, about 4,000 were from companies with relocations overseas. It is inevitable that we will continue to lose some of the lower-end activities to the lower cost countries. Therefore, we need to continue to build up high-value, high-technology industries, and&nbsp;identify new growth areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can understand that workers are concerned. Those who are affected by outsourcing may be displaced and have difficulties coping.&nbsp;Under the Employment Act, a retrenched worker is eligible to claim for retrenchment benefits if he has at least&nbsp;three years of service. Singapore employers are generally enlightened and responsible, and they do pay retrenchment benefits to their staff who are made redundant, sometimes even for those with less than&nbsp;three years' service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers should also try to help retrenched workers in their search for jobs, where possible. Some companies have engaged counselling services to help retrenched employees cope with the psychological impact. We encourage more companies to do so.&nbsp; Unions can also help in the process too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WDA has various programmes to help&nbsp;displaced workers acquire new skills needed to secure new jobs. WDA also runs a network of job centres under the Distributed Careerlink Network (DCN) to advise on job opportunities and help retrenched workers find jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia has highlighted the need for my Ministry to step up its enforcement action against illegal workers,&nbsp;and suggested regular but surprise checks.&nbsp; Perhaps we should inform them ahead of time!&nbsp; Such illegal activities are clearly in breach of the Ministry's work pass conditions and they do&nbsp;undermine our manpower policies.&nbsp; But I would like to inform the House that we have, in fact,&nbsp;stepped up our enforcement efforts significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in the food and beverage sector, the Ministry's stepped-up enforcement has resulted in a significant increase in the number of illegal workers arrested, from 474 in 2004 to 603 in 2005. In November last year, a series of coordinated raids were conducted at 13 coffee shops which led to the arrest of 52 illegal workers over a period of&nbsp;two days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This stepped-up enforcement has resulted in more errant employers being prosecuted in court. Last year, the total number of errant employers jailed&nbsp;was 42%&nbsp; more than the average during the period from 2001 to 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, we intend to continue our emphasis on enforcement and we will expand the Ministry's Employment Inspectorate in the coming year. The Ministry is also reviewing the Employment of Foreign Workers Act with a view to increasing the penalties against illegal employment, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the other important area of workplace safety and health raised by some Members. During the COS debate last year, MOM announced that it would be revamping the existing&nbsp;occupational safety and health (OSH)&nbsp;framework to engender a strong safety culture at the workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, we have put in place a new legislative framework. The new Workplace Safety and Health Act was passed by Parliament in January this year. It came into force on&nbsp;1st March, replacing the Factories Act as the primary Act regulating occupational safety and health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked what the reaction has been since the passing of this new Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unions have been supportive, as this Act means better protection for workers. There has been good support from industry too&nbsp;- particularly from companies which have a strong OSH culture and appreciate its long-term benefits. Understandably, some businesses have expressed concern. SMEs, in particular, are concerned with the potential increase in costs to meet the requirements of the Act. They are also worried that they do not have the skills and competencies to comply with the Act. MOM acknowledges these concerns. We will provide written and online guides to explain the new legislative regime.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also devote additional resources to helping industry build stronger OSH capabilities, including the use of third-party safety professionals. Together with the industry, we will develop a framework of competency standards for OSH personnel to raise their competency levels. We will also step up the accreditation of training providers to ensure that there are adequate and competent providers to support the needs of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to persuade all employers to become willing partners by embracing and adopting sound OSH practices as part of their corporate culture. The newly formed Workplace Safety and Health Advisory Committee (WSHAC) will champion various promotional activities, at the national and sectoral levels. The Advisory Committee will be playing an active role in this year's National Workplace Safety and Health Week to be held next month. One early initiative of the Advisory Committee is to publish a report jointly with the Ministry on accident trends and analysis. This will highlight the \"hotspots\" and will be useful in designing programmes to curb accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Second Reading of the new Act, Dr Amy Khor, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm Halimah Yacob urged MOM to increase our pool of inspectors and step up enforcement. I am pleased to inform the House that we will increase our enforcement presence significantly. The number of inspectors will be increased by 50% to about 150 inspectors over the next&nbsp;two years. A range of new targeted enforcement programmes will be introduced, supported by new capabilities in collecting and analysing information through an electronic reporting system. This information system and analytical capability will guide our enforcement measures, as well as our promotional and educational efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new framework, the conduct of comprehensive and proper risk assessments will be a key requirement. Some companies may not have the capabilities or competencies to do this on their own and may need to engage external parties for this purpose. To help companies defray these costs, MOM has set aside a $5 million Risk Management Assistance Fund, which would be used to co-fund the cost of engaging a consultant to assist in identifying and addressing risks at the workplace. Under this Fund, employers who qualify will receive up to 70% co-funding when they engage safety consultants to conduct risk assessments, subject to a cap of $7,500. We will announce the full details of the scheme soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM will also step up worker outreach, to ensure that workers are aware of their rights and know the channels to voice their concerns. We will be enhancing the orientation course for foreign workers for this purpose. We have already published a new booklet for foreign workers to help them understand their rights to a safe working environment and their responsibilities. We will be producing more materials with safety messages&nbsp;and&nbsp;make them available to the workers. Under the new Workplace Safety and Health Act, it is illegal for employers to dismiss their workers or threaten to dismiss them if they raise legitimate safety and health matters with the authorities. We want to create a culture of openness in this area, and foster a spirit of co-operation and feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Yeo for his questions and inputs over the past year on the reform of occupational safety and health in Singapore. He has been a consistent and tireless supporter of our efforts to raise standards and thereby protect the welfare of our workers. Other Members, such as Mdm Halimah Yacob, Dr Amy Khor and Dr Teo Ho Pin have also made important contributions to the debate and given us valuable suggestions and insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang Kai Yuen has&nbsp;asked whether the current enforcement regime and demerit points system used in the construction sector&nbsp;are too harsh on contractors.&nbsp; MOM's enforcement framework is not penalty-driven. Our inspectors do not have to meet targets or quotas for detecting violations, and it is not a numbers game. In addition to detecting non-compliance, we will focus on systemic weaknesses, and giving feedback to companies on how to improve. This will have a greater impact over the long term rather than simply penalising errant companies. Recalcitrant companies will be closely monitored and guided under a special surveillance programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, we have increased our enforcement activities and will continue to do so over the next few years, but our inspectors will be fair and professional in carrying out their inspections. Stop-Work Orders will be issued only where there are imminent dangers to workers. Remedial Orders will be issued instead where there are serious lapses, particularly systemic lapses, which require attention so that we can compel companies to take remedial actions. Other penalties will be calibrated to better reflect the costs of irresponsible practices. Where appropriate, we will also hold directors and managers who are responsible personally accountable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors who have not instituted comprehensive safety management systems should do so promptly. They should ensure that their workforce is adequately trained and that resources are allocated to proper safety equipment and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently reviewing our demerit points system for the construction sector. I note concerns that contractors, who have multiple worksites, would find the current system a disproportionately heavier burden on them. We will factor this into&nbsp;our calibration of the demerit points system. But let me emphasise that we will not hesitate to stop work or impose other penalties against all worksites, if a contractor is found to have serious systemic flaws in his safety management practices, because the lives of workers at all his sites could be endangered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, our ultimate objective is to shape behaviour to create workplaces with fair and acceptable&nbsp;employment practices, and which take care of workers' safety and health.&nbsp; In doing so, we will make Singapore a great place to work.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir, the MOS did not explain what enforcement action has been taken on the illegal deployment of Bangladeshi work permit holders, acting as lorry drivers and ferrying workers to their worksites.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> The Ministry has a programme on&nbsp;enforcement action against illegal workers.&nbsp; Some of these programmes, for effectiveness reasons, have to be kept confidential.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not possible for me to tell him&nbsp;when we are going to conduct a raid on illegal drivers who are ferrying workers to the construction sites.&nbsp; But we take note of his&nbsp;comments and, at&nbsp;the appropriate time, enforcement actions will be taken against employers who employ illegal workers, whether in the construction sites as drivers or in any form of illegal employment.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Just three clarifications.&nbsp; The MOS said that MOM will be coming up with safety materials.&nbsp; I would like to request MOM to come up with materials in multi-languages, taking into account not just the local workforce, but also the huge presence of foreign workforce with multi-nationalities.

Prof. Ong Soh Khim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>ElderCare Leave</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Ong Soh Khim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, Singapore's population will age rapidly over the next few years.&nbsp; Compounding the problem is the trend of families with only one or two children, such that for every two old dependent persons, there is only one young person to provide continuous physical and economic support.&nbsp; Singaporeans increasingly find themselves in the caretaker role, having to cope with the stresses of caregiving as well as work demands.&nbsp; At present, there is an absence of employee leave scheme to meet this group of employees in most private and public sector organisations.&nbsp; Although a variety of eldercare benefits can be introduced, an effective option is the Eldercare Leave Scheme.&nbsp; Currently, the majority of caregivers are forced to rely on personal, urgent or compassionate leave to meet this specific need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, the Committee for Ageing Issues recommended holistic healthcare and eldercare for the seniors but did not recommend provisions for Eldercare Leave for Singaporeans who need to look after old dependants while struggling with their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The employers have a significant role&nbsp;to play in providing eldercare leave.&nbsp; But a majority of Singapore employers&nbsp;have not become actively involved in helping caregivers.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry to consider entitling employees who are caregivers three to five days of paid Eldercare Leave per year, for&nbsp;the purpose of bringing elderly parents above the age of 70 to the&nbsp;clinic or hospital for their routine check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eldercare Leave Scheme is widely practised in countries, such as the US, for some years, but it has yet to be widely implemented in the public sector in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Government to take the lead in this practice in the various Ministries as a model to encourage the private sector to follow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women more than men find themselves in the caretaker role, in spite of taking on wage employment.&nbsp; Since a sizeable proportion of caregivers are women, providing eldercare support in the workplace means that employers are choosing to be gender-sensitive in two ways.&nbsp; First, the employers are involved not only in retaining female employees but also concerned with their career development.&nbsp; Second, the employers are contributing actively to the CPF benefits of the female employees, which means that the latter would be more likely to be prepared for old age on retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, Sir, every month, we read in the newspapers that some foreign maids were abused.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a comprehensive plan to review the welfare given to our foreign maids, and whether there is any channel for the maids to voice their grievances.&nbsp; Could the Ministry legislate to ensure that the maid agencies visit their maids at least once a month or once every two months?&nbsp; This will reduce the number of maid-abuse cases.&nbsp; I hope the Minister will consider this.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<I>Marriage Restriction Policy<br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, it is very difficult for Singaporeans to marry work permit holders.&nbsp; Very difficult indeed!&nbsp; We all know that.&nbsp; But we read in the newspapers that some Singaporeans find it much easier to marry brides from China or Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any foreigner who is in Singapore, but not holding a work permit, can marry a Singaporean any time.&nbsp; But for those who come here to work in the factories, meet their Singaporean colleagues here and maybe build up&nbsp;a relationship with them, they are not permitted to tie the nuptial knots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, Singaporean workers meet their prospective brides in the workplace and hope to eventually marry them. But because their prospects are work permit holders, they become the forbidden fruit.&nbsp; In the end, they have to resort to brides from Vietnam and China.&nbsp; Why can we not relax this rule?&nbsp; Can we have some flexibility?&nbsp; Now, the Singapore population is not growing, and our women are not giving birth.&nbsp; Why should we force our men to marry these brides from China or Vietnam?&nbsp; Since our men are colleagues of these foreign workers and they are working together, why should we not consider letting them marry these work permit holders, instead of having to go to Vietnam and China?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Sir, the debate in this House has centred on skills upgrading, employability, employment practices and workplace safety thus far. &nbsp;Apart from these, we must continue to protect the interests and well-being of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our unions serve an important role in this regard.&nbsp; I am pleased that Dr Tan Sze Wee has asked for an update on the unionisation rate of workers in Singapore.&nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;10 years, from 1996 onwards, the total number of \"unionisable\" employees has grown from 1.2 to 1.5 million.&nbsp; Union membership increased&nbsp;from 255,000 in 1996&nbsp;to 450,000 in 2005.&nbsp; As a result, the unionisation rate rose markedly from 21% in 1996 to 30% in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rising unionisation rate bucks the global trend where union membership in many countries has been declining.&nbsp; I believe this bears testimony to the ability of our labour movement to stay relevant.&nbsp; Our labour movement under NTUC has been a constructive partner. &nbsp;It has made significant contributions to our harmonious industrial relations climate, economic growth, and to enhancing the well-being of workers.&nbsp; Our unions have worked closely with employers and the Government to help workers upgrade their skills, enhance their employability, and improve their employment terms based on higher productivity.&nbsp; The labour movement has also set up various workers' co-operatives and introduced a wide range of programmes and activities for workers.&nbsp; All these various efforts have pulled in more members, further affirming the achievements of our labour movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should&nbsp;applaud the excellent work of NTUC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I move&nbsp;next to the issue of leave entitlement, which is an integral part of employment benefits.&nbsp; We recognise that, as our population ages, employees will need more support to take care of their elderly dependants. &nbsp;Employers are already responding to this by providing family care leave or unofficial time-off for employees to look after their aged parents.&nbsp; In addition, annual leave entitlements have been going up.&nbsp; In 2004, 41% of full-time employees enjoyed 15 or more days of&nbsp;annual leave.&nbsp; Ten years ago, the percentage was only 34%.&nbsp; A five-day work week in the civil service and in many parts of the private sector has also helped.&nbsp; I thank Prof. Ong Soh Khim for raising this question.&nbsp; Indeed, we must continue to encourage companies to support their employees who need to care for their elderly parents.&nbsp; However, making eldercare leave an entitlement will affect companies' costs.&nbsp; A stipulated three to five days&nbsp;for eldercare leave may not allow companies flexibility to tailor their leave benefits to the diverse needs of individual employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to providing adequate leave, employers should try to introduce work-life programmes, including flexible work arrangements.&nbsp; These will help employees balance work and their family responsibilities as well as&nbsp;personal needs.&nbsp; Companies which have done so have found that work-life programmes make business sense, as workers perform better and their productivity increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, my Ministry introduced the $10 million Work-life Works! Fund&nbsp;in August 2004 to help companies design and implement work-life programmes.&nbsp; This includes catering to the work-life needs of all employees, including the older workers who may be part of their companies' workforce. &nbsp;To date, the Fund has attracted more than 100 private sector applicants. &nbsp;We hope more companies will tap on the Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the well-being of foreign workers.&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng has passionately raised several points on the&nbsp;employment of foreign domestic workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Ong has asked if rest days could be mandated for these workers, similar to that enjoyed by other workers covered under the Employment Act.&nbsp; Sir, all foreign domestic workers generally work and stay in their employer's house.&nbsp; Their work patterns and duties vary across households.&nbsp; Prescribing minimum employment terms and conditions will inevitably lead to rigidities and inconvenience for many households.&nbsp; For example, some households have elderly or infirm members with special needs who require constant attention, and may find it difficult to release the domestic workers for a prescribed period every week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, MOM agrees that all workers should be accorded adequate rest.&nbsp; As part of the work permit conditions, employers are held responsible for the well-being of their foreign domestic workers, including the provision of adequate rest.&nbsp; Employers who breach these work permit conditions can be fined up to $5,000 or&nbsp;served&nbsp;with a jail term of up to six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also understands that CaseTrust and the Association of Employment Agencies (Singapore) (AEAS) are looking at introducing a standard employment contract which would include terms on rest days.&nbsp; We understand that the two accreditation bodies are still in discussion on the exact terms.&nbsp; We look forward to the finalisation of this initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Mr Ong asked&nbsp;MOM to review the conduct of employment agencies which place foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; Sir, the Ministry has actively prosecuted and removed the licences of errant employment agencies over the past two years.&nbsp; Since January 2004, 13 employment agencies have had their licences revoked or non-renewed due to infringements of the Employment Agencies Act.&nbsp; Since February this year, MOM has also implemented a demerit points system for the industry.&nbsp; This system provides early warning for employment agencies that have breached minor infringements to improve.&nbsp; It also helps the public identify errant agents which flout the Ministry's rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I now respond to Mr Ong's question on&nbsp;available channels for&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp; While employers and employment agents have to fulfil their responsibilities, the Ministry also believes that foreign domestic workers should be empowered to safeguard their own interests.&nbsp; All foreign domestic workers are therefore given a list of telephone numbers to contact upon entry into Singapore, as well as at the Safety Awareness Course, which is compulsory for first-time foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; These numbers include a dedicated hotline run by MOM to provide assistance to foreign domestic workers in distress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to address several questions which have arisen on the foreign domestic worker levy during this session as well as in the earlier Budget debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the levy serves as a pricing mechanism to moderate the demand for foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; Currently, there are already about 160,000 foreign domestic workers in Singapore, and about one in every six households hires a foreign domestic worker. &nbsp;In recent years, the levy has already been lowered twice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on 1st August 2004, as part of the marriage and procreation support package, families with young children and those with elderly parents or grandparents residing in the same household were granted a concessionary levy rate of $250, as compared to the normal levy rate of $345 per month.&nbsp; This concessionary rate applies to both single as well as married employers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, this concession was followed by a further reduction of $50 to both the normal and concessionary levy rates on 1st April last year.&nbsp; We will, therefore, not be lowering the levy further for the time being.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I beg to move,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore continues to stay engaged in the globalised economy, it will increasingly be confronted with the reality that the gap between the rich and the poor will continue to widen.&nbsp; In an environment where labour and capital&nbsp;are not confined to national boundaries, those who can adapt to the challenges and the demands of the changing economy will not only survive but will be given the opportunity to reach for the sky.&nbsp; On the other hand, those who cannot compete will continue to suffer from job insecurity and low wages.&nbsp; Very often, many of these lowly educated workers have no bargaining powers and are left to the mercy of the market place, as foreign workers continue to come and \"steal\" their lunches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such stark differences in wealth distribution do not augur well for the future of our society.&nbsp; With the income gap widening, there is a greater likelihood of unhappiness existing among&nbsp;poorer Singaporeans.&nbsp; One can understand the feelings of a coffeeshop assistant, struggling to meet the monthly expenses of the family when he looks at the increasing number of spanking and brand new Mercedeses and BMWs whizzing past him.&nbsp; At best, the coffeeshop assistant could have&nbsp;shrugged it off by saying that this is his destiny in life; at worst, the perceived differences of wealth could breed deep resentment, jealousy, hatred and alienation from the wider society that he lives in.&nbsp; If this is so, it would be sad for Singapore and all Singaporeans, as this would undermine all that we have worked hard at building over the past 40 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge&nbsp;for us is indeed present and real.&nbsp; As a society, how do we go about organising ourselves in the face of a globalising economy so that everyone can stay together, bonded with the unity of purpose, and committed to building this place we all call home? &nbsp;This concern becomes especially acute, if the economic disparity mirrors the ethnic groups in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge must surely be to remain not only a cohesive society but also a resilient one as well. &nbsp;We want our people</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>to bond as a community, where those who are more capable are not adverse, but feel it their duty to carry those compatriots who are not able, either through choice or circumstance, to look after themselves. We want to build a society where our people are united in the face of adversity, whether through hard times or arising from forces that threaten to tear our social fabric and multi-racial harmony apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In rising to these challenges, our approach has been to build a nation based on the self-evident principles of individual responsibility, family support, community outreach and Government assistance; in other words, providing many helping hands to help forge a common sense of destiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with this principle, the Government, either through the ComCare Fund or the Progress Package, as&nbsp;announced in this year's Budget, has sought to ensure that no one is left behind in our nation's progress. These measures, although seen as short-term relief by some, are no doubt generous and would lay the foundation for the long-term development of our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, despite the generous handouts and active intervention by the Government over the years, we are constantly faced with the basic&nbsp;question of whether or not we are a more cohesive society and a&nbsp;resilient one&nbsp;today than we were 10 years ago. Are we confident that our people are now better able to share in the belief that ours is a common destiny, and that our collective interest is better served by helping each other and going out of our way to accommodate each other's custom and religious belief? Can our society better withstand the sectarian forces that threaten to tear us apart as it has with the other societies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be fair, our Government has done much in this regard, including the formation of the IRCCs. However, we know that these initiatives are often perceived as coming from the top. Unfortunately, these matters of the heart are just not matters that can be induced externally, but are matters that should, at the same time, come from within. It has to be imbibed into the values of the population and grown internally at the same time. Sadly, when we try to introduce these values in schools through the curricula, it is seen as an unnecessary detraction from the real business of focusing and doing well on the core examinable subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these efforts, we still have Singaporeans leaving this country&nbsp;permanently to settle in greener pastures elsewhere; we are still very concerned about over taxing the rich so that more assistance can be extended to the needy Singaporeans; we are still very concerned about giving the poor Singaporeans too much and over too long a period to the extent of robbing them of their work ethic; and we are still very concerned over the fall-out that a terrorist incident in Singapore might create on&nbsp;religious and racial harmony in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the next two days, we will no doubt be deliberating the various subject headings under the charge of MCYS. I&nbsp;hope that my introductory statement will set the framework with which to consider these issues. This is, after all, our country and if we do not make ours a more cohesive and resilient society, no one will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>ComCare</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the ComCare Fund was the big bang for many of us.&nbsp; When it was first announced in January last year, the thing that stayed in my mind was the phenomenal sum that Government has committed to helping the poor and needy.&nbsp; And&nbsp;this is, indeed, a welcome news for those who are&nbsp;in need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have two questions. The first question, of which a series is related, is whether we can have an update of&nbsp;what has been achieved to date?&nbsp; How many people have been helped?&nbsp; How have the various community grassroots been involved?&nbsp; Is there a common set of criteria to be applied across in giving out these funds?&nbsp; Is there a central database that is increasingly relied upon in handing out these schemes?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, can I also ask the Minister whether the administration of ComCare funds across the various Ministries is not hampered because different agencies are involved and also to give the assurance that the money to be dispensed&nbsp;will not suffer the delays&nbsp;arising out of the necessity to deal with the different Ministries?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the ComCare Fund has brought about greater flexibility in the administering of help for the needy.&nbsp; The unique feature of decentralisation and targeted help as well as the enlistment of the community, grassroots and voluntary welfare organisations to tailor the help to the specific needs of families have contributed to the success.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask if there is a multi-agency forum by the Pro-Enterprise Panel or Zero-In-Process (ZIP) where more complex cases can be better addressed?&nbsp; This is because there are still needy families which fall through the cracks.&nbsp; A number of these cases fall outside the established guidelines, short-term band aid is inadequate. Some of the families that have fallen on hard times have a slew of problems and may require multiple agencies to coordinate help solutions. This means that agencies and departments working in isolation may not be able to deliver our desired outcomes. Social workers must be deployed in enough numbers to craft help packages.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Social Workers for Schools and Low-income Families</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, there is a slew of assistance schemes available to help Singaporeans; so many, in fact, that it is difficult to follow and to administer. Could MCYS consolidate them and make them more comprehensible and accessible?&nbsp; It would be good to vet through the various schemes to remove stifling benchmark and blanket rules&nbsp;and to factor in the complexities of individual needs so that fewer people fall through the system cracks.&nbsp; Perhaps, there can be a central register for our destitute, chronic poor and disabled so that effective and thorough assistance can be given to them without&nbsp;anyone falling by the wayside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I request the Minister to consider providing integrated two-generation strategies assistance for young poor families?&nbsp; This is to address both the needs of adults and children simultaneously and address the co-occurrence of these issues among vulnerable families. Could MCYS take a more extended approach to help this group?&nbsp; Sir, without intervention that will change their course, they may not be able to get out of their dire situation.&nbsp; Would the Minister assign a family social worker to each of such families to evaluate, coordinate, direct and follow up for them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Working in conjunction with grassroots and voluntary organisations in the community, social workers are best suited for this role to better tap and maximise and take advantage of all the available schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the parents in this group, do we have social workers that can provide guidance in job training, life-skills training and better job placement, additional family planning and budgeting skills as well as some parenting guidance and parental counselling in order to get better educational support and attitudes towards school for their children at home through supportive, nurturing family and home environment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the children of this group, do we have social workers that can initiate and direct intervention programmes, such as early intensive reading, subsidised childcare and student care, tutoring, mentoring, education and career guidance and counselling, and moral and social support?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I request the&nbsp;Minister to assist in preventing school drop-outs by providing school social workers that can intervene, assist and follow up on potential drop-outs?

For one, the income ceiling has been raised for the Ministry of Education's financial assistance scheme, which helps children with their school fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this new measure, some 33,500 low-income family children pay little or no school fees -&nbsp;more than double the current 15,000.&nbsp; The qualifying household income level for the Edusave Merit Bursary has&nbsp;also been raised, enabling 17,000 more children to receive the award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of all, a $48 million Opportunity Fund has also been set up to subsidise such children for things like enrichment courses, overseas trips and computers. To me, the most important part of this part has to do with its regressive nature of&nbsp;assistance, ie,&nbsp;neighbourhood schools will get double the amount for every student they have compared to independent and autonomous schools.&nbsp; This is because most children from low-income families attend neighbourhood schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know what has been said about MCYS -&nbsp;that social causes are a black hole into which you can pour money, and still more is needed.&nbsp; This is, however, not what I am going to do.&nbsp; It is unrealistic to expect that all children, regardless of their home background, to have exactly the same kind and type of classes - I am not sure at all that this is&nbsp;good&nbsp;for the longer term. The school of hard knocks is perhaps a good training ground for life. &nbsp;There are many of us here who came up the hard way, and feel we are more resilient and tougher because we came through a more difficult route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I am asking for is for the Government to ensure that no child receives a second-rate education because his parents could not afford a first-rate one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am grateful for what has been done, and for the help announced so far.&nbsp; I would like the Ministry to consider&nbsp;whether or not&nbsp;more can be done, and&nbsp;whether or not more can be done&nbsp;differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one, the school is only&nbsp;part of a child's life. What we have done is only&nbsp;address what goes out in school. We need to help children at home to be looked after as well, and&nbsp;that means looking after the child's education as part of&nbsp;his growing up experience within the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to consider how we can help the parents, who&nbsp;are facing problems with their marriage and&nbsp;other personal problems, to help their children as they are growing up and&nbsp;as they are going through the educational experience.&nbsp; We need to support them by giving family service centres&nbsp;more incentives to help families&nbsp;in counselling and providing earlier&nbsp;intervention so that these children from these families will not be deprived simply because of the family background that they come from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parliamentary colleagues, such as Dr Lily Neo, have noted that there should be more programmes to support children&nbsp;from lower-income homes and these would include providing them with additional enrichment lessons at the state's expense, which would&nbsp;include reading lessons, more education exposure trips, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have&nbsp;previously said that what was considered \"nice-to-have\" in the past, is now a \"must-have\" for students. I, therefore, would like to urge the Minister to consider how else we can level the&nbsp;playing field, through the various schemes, so that the \"nice-to-have\" which has now become a necessity for our children can become something that they can realistically come to expect in their lifetime in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Social Enterprises</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to speak on a sort of organisation that marries the aims of commerce and social mission. These are called social enterprises which are defined as sustainable businesses that exist to achieve some form of social mission or objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not-for-profits, and they operate and generate the capital they need to carry out their mission&nbsp;- a new paradigm based on sustainability and social entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Cooperatives are a good example of these sorts of enterprises that one talks about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social enterprises should have a viable and sustainable business model, just like any other business.&nbsp; So, to those who think that social enterprises are in some way immune to the vagaries of the market, they would be mistaken. Having said this, social enterprises ought to receive special attention from the Government because they go beyond the simple concerns of making&nbsp;profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, social assistance is given in the form of handouts to those in need. This is akin to giving fish rather than teaching people to fish. We need to empower our grassroots organisations with the ability, flexibility and financial resources to start business initiatives for our&nbsp;residents.&nbsp; These may include cooperatives, for&nbsp;example, to run bakeries that are tied up with pastry shops, and&nbsp;cooperatives that provide micro-financing for housewives&nbsp;to start&nbsp;small businesses so that they can be financially independent in their undertakings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask whether or not the Government can support such initiatives at the grassroots level to empower these grassroots to build on this initiative so that we can allow people the ability to do work meaningfully themselves rather than to continue to receive and depend on Government&nbsp;for handouts.&nbsp;This is really the&nbsp;essence of social enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.15 pm</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>within this debate and so this cut is really to fill in the blanks.&nbsp; May I start first by congratulating the MCYS for its foresight and very enlightened view on social enterprise.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;the Social Enterprise Fund was started one or two years ago and which will be, I think, put under the ComCare Enterprise Fund, going forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the concept of social enterprise is new and often not very well understood.&nbsp; Much of the funds that were given earlier went quite generously, I must say, to organisations that did not really have a real business model.&nbsp; In some cases, it was so stringent that it also ruled out businesses that were for-profit.&nbsp; In other words, regardless of whether they have a social mission or not, as long as they had a profit motive, it was&nbsp;rejected.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if he could relook at these criteria and include businesses, whether it is for-profit or not-for-profit but, so long as they carry a social mission, to be given some form of help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, perhaps we should also judge the social enterprise applicant based on how serious is their enterprise model, in other words, the business model and, of course, the return on investment (ROI) itself could be measured in terms of market-related or equity-related ROI, as well as the ROI on our social capital.&nbsp; After all, I think it was the late management guru, Mr Peter Drucker, who defines \"social entrepreneurs\" as \"people who raise the performance capacity of society\".&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can comment on that and also give a little bit more help, to not just the social enterprises, but also the social entrepreneurs themselves, by putting the focus, the funding and perhaps the help on the leaders, who can then go on to create not just one social enterprise but, two, three or four, which empirical evidence has suggested that many of these social entrepreneurs do go on to create more than just one.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In many countries, the elderly have been roped in to participate in the various activities.&nbsp; I can think of getting the elderly to participate in municipal-level activities, such as the Town Council&nbsp;and&nbsp;the grassroots organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the context of our society, I wonder whether or not more can be done to rope in, and provide a special location for the elderly and the retired to stay active by being more actively involved, either in the grassroots organisation or the Town Council.&nbsp; I do know that within the community centres they&nbsp;have the Senior Citizens' Executive Committee.&nbsp;The question really is whether or not we are satisfied with this present arrangement and whether or not more can be done to rope in these senior citizens and engage them in the management of our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, I would like to also ask whether the Ministry is actively looking at how the elderly is relating to the younger generation of Singaporeans and also how they are relating to members within the family itself.&nbsp; I do know from my MPS that, very often, the elderly finds it difficult to get along with family members simply because with limitation of health, they are placing an increasing burden on their family members and, thereby, creating much tension within the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Ministry, for example, looking to study how the present situation is and whether or not steps can be taken to improve inter-generational interaction and dynamics between the elderly and the younger members of our society and also within the family itself?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Some of these elderly are single or widowed, with others prefer to live separately from their children to avoid family conflict.&nbsp; It is a pity that there are not more inter-generation families living together.&nbsp; May I ask, like&nbsp;the hon. Member, Mr Sin Boon Ann,&nbsp;if the Ministry has any information on the current state of relations between the elderly and the younger family members?&nbsp; With this information, I believe, we would be in a much better position to have policies to promote greater interaction among different generations.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, the elderly should be staying with their families.&nbsp; If they are sickly they would be taken care of by their loved ones in familiar surroundings.&nbsp;In fact, this is also the objective of the&nbsp;Ministry of Health with regard to senior citizens ageing within Singapore.&nbsp; However, this could be a heavy task for the caregiver.&nbsp; It can be extremely tiring and straining, emotionally.&nbsp; I would like to ask if the Government has any new measures to give our caregivers, as well as caregivers support group, more support.&nbsp; Those elderly who live on their own will need more community services and facilities&nbsp;that cater to their needs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, currently many of these services remain patchy at best.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;the Government be facilitating the development of more client-centric care services for the elderly?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, we also need to increase the number of homes that charge affordable fees to take care of senior citizens with difficult conditions and, in those circumstances, where it is quite difficult to have elderly within the family.&nbsp; This includes, especially, dementia cases.&nbsp; Due to the high fees currently, often a spouse, usually a woman, would have to quit her job to take care of such an elderly person.&nbsp; Considering that the median household income is about $4,000, the household income would be halved if she quits, thereby creating financial hardship and family stress.&nbsp; I thus hope that the Ministry would look into this need soon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For their convenience, I think the Minister could consider setting up daycare centres for senior citizens in each and every one of the community centres or clubs because every constituency has&nbsp;at least one community centre.&nbsp; They are very conveniently located.&nbsp; It would be very convenient for our residents to send their old folks there.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we should also have some educational courses for our senior citizens.&nbsp; In other countries it is very popular.&nbsp; In the United States, Europe and Japan, there are&nbsp;educational courses for the senior citizens.&nbsp; In China, there are at least 20,000 senior citizen universities.&nbsp; In fact, some of them&nbsp;conduct their courses through television or Internet.&nbsp; In Taiwan, there is a radio university for the senior citizens.&nbsp; In 1973,&nbsp;France&nbsp;started the first&nbsp;third age university and now they have a few thousand third age universities in about 15 countries in the world.&nbsp; I have visited one third age university in Australia and all the undergraduates are senior citizens.&nbsp; They are taking courses that are relevant to the senior citizens like law, humanity, health, sports, etc.&nbsp; I think we should also have such a university in Singapore so that the senior citizens will have a chance to be educated.&nbsp; We should also issue&nbsp;licences to those who are experienced in organising&nbsp;third age university to fulfil our lifelong learning spirit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</B> The Committee on Ageing Issues has issued its comprehensive and well-considered recommendations.&nbsp; I applaud the Prime Minister's move to accept and address all the recommendations therein.&nbsp; I would now also like to draw attention to changes in our family dynamics.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we predicate our policies on the concept of many helping hands and the primacy of the family as the first source of help for the elderly.&nbsp; While it is ideal for Singaporeans to practise filial piety and live in harmonious three-generation families, the realty is sometimes very different.&nbsp; Families are getting smaller and more nuclear.&nbsp; Young couples are not used to the give-and-take and dynamics of large families.&nbsp; Young couples often do not take kindly to advice or interference from the in-laws.&nbsp; Cultural differences abound even in&nbsp;same race marriages, while over time, underlying tensions can be accentuated by differences in spousal expectations, differences in religion, values and child-bearing practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs are familiar with the situation whereby elderly couples come looking for separate rental accommodation because they see it as a better&nbsp;alternative to constant quarrelling with their married children.&nbsp; Some elderly do not seem to have a choice in the matter as their children make it plain that they are not welcome.&nbsp; Forcing these families to live together leads to much unhappiness and can be a factor in discouraging couples from marrying and having more children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Children of all ages suffer emotional distress and negative role models and guilt as tempers fray and ugly situations abound.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we must first of all recognise this realty and factor this into our policy responses.&nbsp; We cannot hide behind platitudes and motherhood statements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognising this reality, we perhaps could do more to allow the elderly to live close to children, but not in each other's pockets, and not outstay their welcome.&nbsp; Elderly couples living alone may not have been our previous paradigm, but may be our present and future reality for some Singaporeans.&nbsp; We must make it a valid and comfortable option for those who need this option.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, ageing in place may not mean retirement villages or sheltered housing for all.&nbsp; The elderly may be able to live on their own if someone helps with the shopping or the housekeeping or with little problems that can have large consequences, such as leaky taps and stagnant water or even frayed power cords in appliances.&nbsp; In Israel, there are communities whereby a middle-aged or young elderly person is employed as a community parent.&nbsp; This community parent will visit, shop for, and do little handyman jobs around the house for a group of more elderly people living alone.&nbsp; He may&nbsp;also function as substitute next-of-kin.&nbsp; Technology can also help.&nbsp; A wearable personal alarm like a handphone can, once the button is pressed, instantly connect the elderly&nbsp;with the telephone operator who can then despatch an ambulance or the community parent, depending on whether the problem is that the elderly has fallen and broken her leg or has misplaced his or her glasses and cannot see well enough to leave the house.&nbsp; Similarly, a&nbsp;mini-camp located in a strategic location could help the community parent to keep an eye on an elderly person or help the elderly person keep up emotional contacts with the far-flung family members, especially nowadays when Singaporeans are encouraged to work abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the community parent, children who need to work long hours or overseas need not worry endlessly about their elderly parents living alone.&nbsp; With a paid community parent taking the role of the elderly person's living companion, domestic maid, housewife or unmarried sibling, who gives up family and career to look after the elderly parent, we can free up a lot of young people for the workforce while providing meaningful employment for their young elderly as they themselves transition into this role.&nbsp; Why not give this idea a try?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry on the various measures to encourage senior citizens to lead healthy and active lifestyles, especially in view of our growing ageing population and their higher expectations.&nbsp;

Nonetheless, the range and number of activities for senior citizens are still limited currently.&nbsp; We need to have more outlets in terms of recreation and community involvement for the elderly.&nbsp; Would the Ministry give us an update on the&nbsp;initiatives that are being drawn up.&nbsp; I made a cut in MND on displaced parents.&nbsp; I echo Dr Warren Lee's call to pay some attention to parents who no longer have a roof over their heads as a result of tension with the children within the family.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Indicators show that the population of elderly will increase from about 7% today to about 19% by 2030, or one in every five persons.&nbsp; Singapore has a fast greying population and the issues that will arise due to this trend should be addressed.&nbsp; In order to support the greying population, a significant number of young Singaporeans, particularly the sandwich generation, will have to stay at home and take care of their ageing parents, in addition to taking care of their own families and children.&nbsp; Further, there are some families who have to take care of children, siblings or parents, who are mentally or physically disabled, in addition to taking care of their own families.&nbsp; Therefore, there is an additional strain on these sole breadwinners or able Singaporeans to take care of their loved ones who are less able.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if the MCYS has given any consideration or made any plans to recognise those caregivers who opt to stay at home to care for their children or look after their aged parents or loved ones who are incapacitated, either physically or mentally.&nbsp; I mention this concern as this form of sacrificial love cannot be compensated adequately by money, but at least it makes it easier for the caregivers if their sacrifices are recognised.&nbsp; In some ways, the Government will be seen as promoting the values it espouses and, thereby, inculcating a sense of filial piety, compassion and gracious living in the hearts of younger Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Are we similarly up to date in our education infrastructure and programmes for the disabled?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the education system for&nbsp;disabled children is fairly well developed.&nbsp; At primary level, we have VWOs running 21 special education schools (SPEDs), with funding from the Ministry of Education and NCSS.&nbsp; For those who are able, they continue their secondary education in specially equipped mainstream secondary schools.&nbsp; The others proceed to one of the training centres or workshops run by VWOs.&nbsp; What happens next?&nbsp; Can we improve upon the current education and training opportunities for them after they leave school?&nbsp; I am sure that we can do more to equip them with updated skills to help them qualify for a wider selection of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, employment assistance for people with disabilities is coordinated by a VWO&nbsp;- Bizlink Centre Limited&nbsp;- which is supported by the Government and the NCSS.&nbsp; The Centre assesses their suitability for employment and helps them with job placement.&nbsp; Follow-up services and support are also given to help the disabled person remain employed.&nbsp; Could the Minister update the House on how successful the job placement service has been in terms of (1) the number and percentage of successful job placements by type of disabilities; (2) the average duration of employment; and (3) the range of remuneration and median salaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, are there any plans to introduce new measures to increase job opportunities for the disabled?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Warren Lee:</B> Sir, how are we progressing in the area of helping people with disabilities integrate into normal society?&nbsp; The introduction of kneeling buses, lifts on every floor and the move to make HDB estates barrier free is laudable and will benefit not just the elderly but also those with physical disabilities.&nbsp; However, more targeted help will be welcome.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also think in terms of life-time benefit versus life-time cost.&nbsp; For example, a $50,000 cochlear implant or artificial ear implanted into a deaf infant will allow the child to grow up with normal hearing and much better employment prospects.&nbsp; Motorised wheelchairs and other assistive technology may help an amputee retain his job or live more independently.&nbsp; Are we able to help these people financially and design inventions that they can afford to use?&nbsp; Are we building enough barrier-free schools for children in wheelchairs and having skeletal deformities?&nbsp; Have we enough facilities for children with dyslexia or autism?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we must find ways to make sure that&nbsp;people with disabilities enter our workforce.&nbsp; In leaving no one behind, I think there is a cost, but there is also a tremendous opportunity to make these people much more productive members of our society.&nbsp; In this regard, I think it is important that we have enough trained manpower.&nbsp; We can start thinking in terms of training middle-aged or other silver-aged workers in the areas of gerontology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy and other therapies which are useful for the treatment of people with autism and dyslexia.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
