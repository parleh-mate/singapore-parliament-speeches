In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the situation is further  aggravated\r\n\r\nby  the fact that Singapore's coastlines do  not\r\n\r\ncontain  much  fish, and also  during  the  past\r\n\r\nyears, due to over-intensive fishing, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncatch  has  become smaller and smaller  year  by\r\n\r\nyear. To improve the catch of our fishermen,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for  them  to  take  up  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing  and  seek  new  fishing  grounds,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  in the South China Sea or  the  Indian\r\n\r\nOcean.  This is not an easy task, because  deep-\r\n\r\nsea  fishing requires both capital and technical\r\n\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other problems facing the fishermen;\r\n\r\nfor  instance, the exploitation by the middlemen\r\n\r\nand  unscrupulous  moneylenders,  the  lack   of\r\n\r\ncapital to buy the necessary gear and equipment,\r\n\r\nthe   poor  living  conditions  of  the  fishing\r\n\r\nvillagers,  the lack of jetties where  fishermen\r\n\r\ncan land their catch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the many problems which are\r\n\r\nreceiving    Government's   consideration.    At\r\n\r\npresent,  we  can  only do whatever  we  can  to\r\n\r\nassist  these fishermen. For instance,  we  have\r\n\r\ntried  to improve the living conditions  of  the\r\n\r\nfishermen  in  the  Southern  Islands.  We   are\r\n\r\nproposing to construct a jetty at the 18th Mile,\r\n\r\nJurong  Road, for fishermen to land their catch.\r\n\r\nThe  situation cannot improve appreciably  until\r\n\r\nour  fishermen can also go to the Federation and\r\n\r\nIndonesian waters to catch their fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, neither is the solution of the farmer's problems in an island like Singapore an\r\n\r\neasy task. The main problems of the farmers are,\r\n\r\nbriefly,  the  shortage of  land,  the  lack  of\r\n\r\ncheaper  fertilisers and seeds, the need  for  a\r\n\r\nbetter  marketing system which will  reduce  the\r\n\r\nexploitation  by  the middlemen,  better  credit\r\n\r\nfacilities and the lack of real co-operatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems cannot be overcome at present\r\n\r\ndue  to  various difficulties. We are attempting\r\n\r\nto  do whatever we can to help the farmers.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  are carrying out  experiments  to\r\n\r\nobtain better strains of pigs and chickens,  and\r\n\r\nexperiments in pig-stuff and fertilisers. We are\r\n\r\nalso  providing better veterinary  services  for\r\n\r\npigs  and chickens, offering a ploughing service\r\n\r\nat  cheaper cost and converting more prawn ponds\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore's swamp land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

But he did not tell the House  how\r\n\r\nmuch  he expected to collect in the way of port\r\n\r\ndues under this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has also told the House that the Government intends to collect\r\n\r\nport dues from ships, which stay in the harbour\r\n\r\nfor  more than 30 days. By that, I take it, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that most of the foreign  ships\r\n\r\nand ocean-bound liners will more or less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nescape  the provisions of this Bill,  and  that\r\n\r\nmost  of  the craft which will come within  the\r\n\r\nambit  of  the Bill - and, therefore, liable  for\r\n\r\nthe  payment of dues - will be craft anchored and\r\n\r\nstationed  in  Singapore  and  plying   between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the neighbouring countries. While\r\n\r\nnot denying that some dues should be collected,\r\n\r\nI think Government should bear in mind that the\r\n\r\nport is one of the vital arteries of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand before any port dues are charged on vessels\r\n\r\nusing   Singapore,  particularly  local  craft,\r\n\r\nGovernment should be satisfied that  this  does\r\n\r\nnot mean putting a certain type of craft out of\r\n\r\nbusiness,  or  enhancing the  fees  which  such\r\n\r\ncraft  have to pay, which might have an  effect\r\n\r\nnot only on the lives of certain people who use\r\n\r\nthe sea, but also on the cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is interested in creating a\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore,  which  will  attract\r\n\r\nindustry. Therefore, it is imperative that  any\r\n\r\ntaxation  policy, or any policy  such  as  this\r\n\r\nfollowed by Government should be one which will\r\n\r\nattract  industry  to  Singapore.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nrevenues of the Colony are in such a state that\r\n\r\nit is necessary -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. Whether the revenues of the State are such\r\n\r\nthat  it is necessary to impose these port dues\r\n\r\nis  another  matter on which the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has not seen fit to address the House.\r\n\r\nFrom  the very efficient Budget, which the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance presented some time  ago,\r\n\r\nit  appeared to me that no further taxation was\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I  think  he  gave  the  House   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that no further taxation  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  But  within a  few  months  of  his\r\n\r\nstatement,  here is another form  of  taxation,\r\n\r\nwhich it is sought to enforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those are some of the\r\n\r\nobservations which I have to make on this Bill.\r\n\r\nClause 7 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All port dues collected under this Ordinance\r\n\r\nshall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, of course, that the Government is\r\n\r\ninterested  in  creating a Port  Authority  with\r\n\r\nextended powers and an extended area of control.\r\n\r\nThe  Deputy Prime Minister did say that when the\r\n\r\nPort Authority was created, Government would, at\r\n\r\nthe  time of its creation, consider whether  the\r\n\r\nmonies collected under this Bill would not  then\r\n\r\nbecome payable to the Port Authority. We do  not\r\n\r\nknow  when this Port Authority will be  created,\r\n\r\nor whether it will be created within the life of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  or  outside  the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Could the Deputy Prime Minister  say\r\n\r\nwhether  the  port dues which will be  collected\r\n\r\nunder  this  Bill  would  be  maintained  in   a\r\n\r\nseparate  fund  until  such  time  as  the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority  is  created, and whether  the  monies\r\n\r\nwould then be transferred to the Port Authority?\r\n\r\nOr whether it is the intention of the Government\r\n\r\nthat  these  monies  would become  part  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  revenue  of  the State,  and  need  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be used for the improvement of  port\r\n\r\nfacilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  has made certain observations, and I would\r\n\r\nlike to correct some of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I inform the House that the\r\n\r\nimposition of port dues in Singapore  is  not  a\r\n\r\nprecedent? There are ports in other parts of the\r\n\r\nworld, which are already charging such dues. For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  London,  river  tonnage  dues  are\r\n\r\npayable at rates varying from 2 pence to 6 pence\r\n\r\nper  ton.  In Liverpool, the rates vary  from  1\r\n\r\n11/16th  penny  to 9 pence per  ton,  and  these\r\n\r\nrates  have recently been increased  by  a  two-\r\n\r\nthird  per cent. In Southampton, the rates  vary\r\n\r\nfrom 1\u00bd pence to 2\u00bd pence per ton, plus a 20 per\r\n\r\ncent  surcharge.  In New York and  other  U.S.A.\r\n\r\nports, the rates vary from 2 cents per ton to  6\r\n\r\ncents  per ton. In Rotterdam, harbour  dues  are\r\n\r\npayable at varying rates which are calculated on\r\n\r\ngross  tonnage  in  cubic  metres  and  on   the\r\n\r\nquantity of cargo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndischarged  and  loaded. In  Antwerp,  the  dues\r\n\r\ncharged  vary from Belgium francs 5.25  to  2.50\r\n\r\nper ton. In Manila, port dues are payable at the\r\n\r\nrate of 12.5 centavos per ton or 35 centavos per\r\n\r\nton  full load of cargo discharged or loaded  at\r\n\r\nthe ship's option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the present time, harbour craft have\r\n\r\nmade  no contribution to the cost of maintenance\r\n\r\nand  the development of the port, although  they\r\n\r\nderive  their livelihood from it. At  present  a\r\n\r\n100-ton lighter pays only an annual licence  fee\r\n\r\nof  $6.75. Such a craft will now be called upon,\r\n\r\nin  addition,  to  pay a port due  of  $150  per\r\n\r\nannum.  However,  there is an  analogy  in  that\r\n\r\ncommercial  lorries  pay licensing  fees,  which\r\n\r\nvary  from $132 to $560 per annum, depending  on\r\n\r\ntheir  size.  So we can consider that  the  port\r\n\r\ndues   charged  for  harbour  craft  are   quite\r\n\r\nreasonable. Moreover, harbour craft do not pay a\r\n\r\nheavy-oil  duty  tax to the Customs  Department,\r\n\r\nwhereas  diesel lorries pay from $450 to  $1,975\r\n\r\nper  annum. Sampans and other little  craft  are\r\n\r\ncalled   upon  to  pay  only  nominal   charges.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the Second Schedule of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be covered by Class I and Class  II,\r\n\r\nand, according to their size, these sampans will\r\n\r\nbe  called upon to pay either $1.50 per  ton  or\r\n\r\n$2.50  per  ton, depending on whether  they  are\r\n\r\nmechanically-propelled or not. The charges  they\r\n\r\nwill  ultimately pay will vary from the  minimum\r\n\r\nof  $5 to perhaps $20 or so. But these are  only\r\n\r\nannual payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue from port dues, based on\r\n\r\ntonnage  figures related to the 1959 Light  Dues\r\n\r\nReceipts,  is  as  follows: revenue  from  ships\r\n\r\npaying  at  10  cents' rate is  $1,890,000,  and\r\n\r\nrevenue from harbour craft is $110,000, making a\r\n\r\ntotal of $2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure on the port for the\r\n\r\nyears  1955  to 1959 is $3,958,343. The  greater\r\n\r\npart  of  this sum has been devoted to dredging,\r\n\r\nabout $3,764,665 having been spent on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to come to certain points which the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park made a moment ago. Ocean-going\r\n\r\nvessels  which  call at Singapore  to  discharge\r\n\r\npassengers or cargo or to embark passengers or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nload  cargo do not escape paying port dues. They\r\n\r\nare   covered  in  the  First  Schedule,   where\r\n\r\nparagraph (a) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"For every ship entering a port for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  loading or discharging cargo or embarking or\r\n\r\ndisembarking  passengers,  ten  cents  per  ton,\r\n\r\nsubject to a minimum payment of one dollar and a\r\n\r\nmaximum stay of thirty days.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow the second part of the Schedule covers those\r\n\r\nships, which stay in the port for longer than 30\r\n\r\ndays. The second part of the Schedule reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(b) For every ship occupying an anchorage or\r\n\r\nberth within a port -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for the first period of thirty days - no\r\n\r\npayment;\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>having  already paid once. If they  stay  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod exceeding 30 days they have to pay:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(ii) thereafter at the rate of ten cents per\r\n\r\nton per thirty days.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add, Mr Speaker, that the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  in  his  Budget  speech  did  give  due\r\n\r\nwarning to the House that the Government had the\r\n\r\nintention  of imposing port dues. I  would  also\r\n\r\nlike to add, as I have said just now, that up to\r\n\r\ndate  all expenditure spent on the port has come\r\n\r\nout  of  the  Consolidated Fund, it is  natural,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  until the  Port  Authority  is\r\n\r\nestablished,  whatever dues  we  collect  should\r\n\r\njustly  and  rightly go back to the Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund.  When  the Port Authority is  established,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  hope will be within the  lifetime  of\r\n\r\nthis   Government,  a  separate  fund  will   be\r\n\r\ncreated, and the port dues so collected will  be\r\n\r\npaid into this fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported,\r\n\r\nwithout  amendment;  read  the  Third  time  and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REARRANGEMENT OF ORDER OF BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That item 3 on the Order Paper be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith immediately before item 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That item 3 on the Order Paper be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith immediately before item 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONDOLATORY ADDRESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(DEATH OF YANG DI-PERTUAN AGONG)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an Address be sent to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in the following terms:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Assembly has learned with deep sorrow of\r\n\r\nthe death of His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nAgong of the Federation of Malaya, and pray\r\n\r\nthat Your Excellency will be pleased to convey\r\n\r\nto the Government of the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nthis Assembly's deep sense of the loss which\r\n\r\nthe whole country has sustained, and their\r\n\r\nprofound sympathy with the Raja Permaisuri\r\n\r\nAgong and the late Yang di-Pertuan Agong's\r\n\r\nfamily and with the Government and people of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In expressing our sorrow over the death of His\r\n\r\nMajesty  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, we are paying tribute  not\r\n\r\nonly to a man who was held in high esteem by the\r\n\r\npeople of the Federation, but also to a man  who\r\n\r\nwas  called upon to symbolise the continuity and\r\n\r\ndignity of a new and developing nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention today to add to the\r\n\r\ntributes  already paid to his personality.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   with  the   introduction   of\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting, one of the penalties is  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of the voter's name from the  register\r\n\r\nif   he   does  not  vote.  It  is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nanomalous that a person could be penalised  for\r\n\r\nnot  voting by not being allowed to  vote,  and\r\n\r\nyet  he could still legally stand for election.\r\n\r\nIf  a man has not taken the trouble to vote and\r\n\r\nkeep  his name on the register, it follows that\r\n\r\nhe should not be qualified to be voted for, and\r\n\r\nwe have, by this amendment, carried the logical\r\n\r\nchanges  which  compulsory  registration   must\r\n\r\nintroduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 13 will reduce the overall\r\n\r\nperiod  between the date of the  issue  of  the\r\n\r\nwrit of election and polling day. In clause  9,\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  period between the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nissue  of Writs of Election and Nomination  Day\r\n\r\nwill be nine days, instead of 16 days, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminimum period from the date of publication  of\r\n\r\nthe  Notices of Contested Election  to  Polling\r\n\r\nDay  will be reduced from three weeks  to  nine\r\n\r\ndays. I would like to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  the  fact  that  these  are  minimum\r\n\r\nperiods. The maximum periods remain as they are\r\n\r\non  the  Statute  Book. These  amendments  will\r\n\r\nbring our legislation more in line with what is\r\n\r\ncurrent   in   other  parts  of   the   British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  and  in the United  Kingdom.  The\r\n\r\nonly  reason  why the minimum periods  were  as\r\n\r\nlong as they were originally provided for,  was\r\n\r\nthat in the early days the Elections Office had\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently worked out the procedure  and\r\n\r\nthe  administrative arrangements necessary  for\r\n\r\nconducting   the  elections.  It  was   thought\r\n\r\nprudent  that  a  considerable length  of  time\r\n\r\nshould  be provided for the preparations before\r\n\r\nvoting. I am glad to say that, partly from  the\r\n\r\nexperience  we have gained, and partly  through\r\n\r\nthe   impetus   of  the  new  Government,   the\r\n\r\nElections  Office now feel that they  can  keep\r\n\r\nabreast  of  the electoral machinery  in  other\r\n\r\nparts of the British Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the administrative changes, may I draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  House to  clause  3,  which\r\n\r\nprovides for the establishment of more  polling\r\n\r\nstations  at  the discretion of  the  Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer, rather than limiting it as at  present\r\n\r\nto  two per polling district? At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  are repealing the provision with regard  to\r\n\r\nseparate polling stations for the exclusive use\r\n\r\nof female voters. From the experience gained in\r\n\r\nthe  Local Government and Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nelections  over the last three years, Returning\r\n\r\nOfficers  have  discovered  that  it  might  be\r\n\r\nsometimes necessary to have more than just  two\r\n\r\npolling stations in a polling division. We have\r\n\r\nalso decided, from experience, that there is no\r\n\r\nneed  for  the  provision of  separate  polling\r\n\r\nstations for women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 8 are changes which will allow\r\n\r\nthe  Registration Officer to transfer the  name\r\n\r\nof  a  voter from one register to another, even\r\n\r\nthough the time for objections has elapsed,  if\r\n\r\nit is discovered that he had been wrongly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaced.  At present, the law does not  allow  a\r\n\r\nReturning Officer to correct the register of  a\r\n\r\nvoter  once  the period allowed for  objections\r\n\r\nhas  elapsed, even though it is discovered that\r\n\r\nhe   had   been   classified   in   the   wrong\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill, which provides for the\r\n\r\npreparation  of combined registers of  electors\r\n\r\nfor  Legislative Assembly and Local  Government\r\n\r\nelections, will now be repealed, as there  will\r\n\r\nno   longer   be   any   elections   to   local\r\n\r\nauthorities,  such  as  the  City  Council  and\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides that it will now only be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the Minister alone  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nnotice at least five clear days before the date\r\n\r\nfixed  for nomination. At present, it  is  also\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Returning Officer to make the\r\n\r\nannouncement. We have considered it unnecessary\r\n\r\nto  have this duplication. Henceforth,  by  the\r\n\r\namending  clause  10, there will  be  only  one\r\n\r\nannouncement  five days before the  date  fixed\r\n\r\nfor nomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 is complementary to clause 3 in that\r\n\r\nit repeals the second proviso to section 38 (5)\r\n\r\nof   the  Ordinance,  since  it  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nnecessary  to have polling stations established\r\n\r\nfor the exclusive use of female voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 21 will transfer the power to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations and prescribe forms from  the\r\n\r\nGovernor in Council to the Minister. This is in\r\n\r\nline  with  section 72A of the Ordinance  where\r\n\r\nthe former Governor in Council's powers to make\r\n\r\nregulations  for  the display  of  posters  and\r\n\r\nbanners  have been transferred to the  Minister\r\n\r\nby  virtue  of the Transfer of Powers Ordinance\r\n\r\n(No. 71 of 1959).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the clauses in clarification. First, I\r\n\r\nwould like to draw the attention of Members  to\r\n\r\nclauses  11  and  12 and to the  amendments  of\r\n\r\nwhich I have given notice. Under section 27 (3)\r\n\r\nas  it  stands at present, a candidate must  be\r\n\r\npresent  at  the  time  of  his  nomination  to\r\n\r\ndeliver   a   statutory  declaration   of   his\r\n\r\nqualifications  and  a  nomination  paper.  But\r\n\r\nsection  29  (2) is so drafted that either  the\r\n\r\nproposer  or  the  seconder could  put  in  the\r\n\r\nnomination paper of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  candidate. As the Bill stands at present, it\r\n\r\nwas the original intention to resolve the doubt\r\n\r\nin  favour of allowing the proposer or seconder\r\n\r\nto  put  in the papers of a candidate.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  had  discussions with my  colleagues  and\r\n\r\nwith  leaders of the Opposition,  and  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  resolve  the doubt  in  favour  of\r\n\r\nsection  27 (3); in other words, requiring  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  to put in his nomination  paper  and\r\n\r\nalso his statutory declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14, Sir, amends section 35 (1) of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to make it clear that each Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficer is supplied only with that part of  the\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the  register which  applies  to  his\r\n\r\nparticular  polling place. This is  to  obviate\r\n\r\nthe possibility that a person's name may appear\r\n\r\nin  that  part  of  the  register  given  to  a\r\n\r\nReturning  Officer  and  that  more  than   one\r\n\r\nReturning  Officer may have  his  name  in  the\r\n\r\nregister   that  he  has  given.  Theoretically\r\n\r\nspeaking, there is always the possibility  that\r\n\r\none  voter  might be able to go to two  polling\r\n\r\nplaces  and acquire two ballot papers from  two\r\n\r\nReturning Officers. I am not suggesting for one\r\n\r\nmoment that that had happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 will amend section 36 (2) and will\r\n\r\nclarify  the position of Presiding Officers  or\r\n\r\nSenior  Presiding Officers with regard  to  the\r\n\r\nvoting  facilities for electors. They will  now\r\n\r\nbe  made responsible only for the provision  of\r\n\r\nsuch facilities in respect of their own polling\r\n\r\nstation only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, in clause 20, it is now necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  candidate to inform the Returning  Officer\r\n\r\nbefore 12.30 p.m. on the day of nomination,  of\r\n\r\nthe  name  or names by which he would be  known\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of election. There appears  to\r\n\r\nbe no necessity for the extension of time up to 4.00 p.m. on the day of nomination. Practice in\r\n\r\nthe  past has indicated that all candidates  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  of  nomination are in a position  to\r\n\r\ndecide  by  what name or names  they  would  be\r\n\r\nknown on the ballot paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 6 and 17 are amendments, which are\r\n\r\npurely  of a formal drafting nature, and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it  is  necessary  for  me  to  say\r\n\r\nanything on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nprinciple adumbrated in the Bill.

The\r\n\r\nvalidity of the objection will be decided by the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Marriages subject to an appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court. It is made an  offence  for  a\r\n\r\nperson    to    make   false    statements    or\r\n\r\nrepresentations in a caveat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, upon being satisfied that there is no lawful impediment to a marriage and that\r\n\r\nthe  necessary consent to the marriage has  been\r\n\r\nobtained or validly dispensed with, may dispense\r\n\r\nwith the giving of notice and issue a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertificate  for  marriage  and  may  grant  his\r\n\r\nlicence for the marriage.

Marriages  may\r\n\r\nbe  solemnized by the Registrar of Marriages  at\r\n\r\nhis  office,  or  by a licensed  person  at  any\r\n\r\nplace,  for  example, a church, a  temple  or  a\r\n\r\nclub.  The  Bill does not lay down  any  special\r\n\r\nrequirements  for  the  solemnization   of   the\r\n\r\nmarriage except that it requires the parties  to\r\n\r\ngive  their  consent to the marriage freely  and\r\n\r\nbefore  at  least two witnesses. Marriages  can,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   if   so  desired,   be   solemnized\r\n\r\naccording  to  the ceremony of the  religion  to\r\n\r\nwhich the parties belong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a marriage has been solemnized, it must\r\n\r\nbe  registered.

Where the  marriage  is\r\n\r\nsolemnized by a licensed person, the parties  to\r\n\r\nthe   marriage  are  required  to  register  the\r\n\r\nmarriage by giving the prescribed particulars to\r\n\r\na   Deputy   Registrar  of   Marriages.   Deputy\r\n\r\nRegistrars of Marriages will be appointed by the\r\n\r\nMinister and may, for example, be the Head of  a\r\n\r\nChurch  denomination or the Head  of  a  Temple.\r\n\r\nPenalties  are provided for failure to  register\r\n\r\nand   for  giving  false  particulars   of   any\r\n\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that all marriages\r\n\r\nsolemnized in Singapore and registered under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  will be monogamous and will  continue\r\n\r\nin force until dissolved by death or an Order of\r\n\r\nthe  Court. The Bill also provides that  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  married whether to one or more spouses\r\n\r\non  the  2nd  of March, 1960 (the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the Bill)  will  be  incapable\r\n\r\nduring  the  continuance  of  such  marriage  or\r\n\r\nmarriages  from contracting any valid  marriage.\r\n\r\nWhere  a  person who is married to one  or  more\r\n\r\nspouses on the 2nd of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch, 1960, ceases to be married to such spouse\r\n\r\nor  to  all such spouses and thereafter  marries\r\n\r\nagain,  he will during the continuance  of  such\r\n\r\nmarriage  be incapable of contracting any  valid\r\n\r\nmarriage.  Similarly,  where  a  person  who  is\r\n\r\nunmarried  on  the  2nd of March  1960,  marries\r\n\r\nafter that date, he will be incapable during the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of such marriage of contracting  any\r\n\r\nother marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date, 2nd March 1960, has been chosen so\r\n\r\nas to prevent people from contracting polygamous\r\n\r\nmarriages  between the date of  introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  and  the  date  of  the  coming  into\r\n\r\noperation of the Ordinance. The Bill applies  to\r\n\r\npersons who are resident in Singapore and to all\r\n\r\npersons  who are domiciled in Singapore but  are\r\n\r\nresident   outside  Singapore.  The  Bill   also\r\n\r\nprovides that such persons who, on the  date  of\r\n\r\nthe  coming into operation of the Ordinance, are\r\n\r\nlawfully  married  in  Singapore  and   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya under any law,  religion,\r\n\r\ncustom or usage, shall, if such marriage has not\r\n\r\nbeen  registered  under the  provisions  of  any\r\n\r\nwritten law in Singapore or of any enactment  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya, apply within one year\r\n\r\nof  the date of the coming into operation of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   to  have  the  marriage  registered.\r\n\r\nFailure  to  do  so  is  made  an  offence,  and\r\n\r\nprovision is made for the settlement of disputes\r\n\r\nrelating to the existence of such marriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill re-enact,\r\n\r\nwith  amendments,  provisions  of  the  existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in Singapore. The rights  of  married\r\n\r\nwomen  in  regard  to their property  and  their\r\n\r\nperson  are  set  out  in  this  Bill.  The  law\r\n\r\nrelating   to  the  maintenance  of  wives   and\r\n\r\nchildren  has been amended to give  the  wife  a\r\n\r\nright to maintenance in certain cases, and  also\r\n\r\nto  give  the  Court the discretion  as  to  the\r\n\r\namount  of maintenance to be given to legitimate\r\n\r\nand  illegitimate children alike.

The Court is also given powers to\r\n\r\nexercise jurisdiction in certain cases where the\r\n\r\nwife  is  resident  in Singapore,  although  the\r\n\r\nhusband  is  not  domiciled  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ngrounds  for  divorce, nullity of  marriage  and\r\n\r\njudicial  separation remain the same as  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the existing law relating to offences\r\n\r\nagainst  women and girls is re-enacted, but  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the law have been strengthened and\r\n\r\nthe   punishments  for  the  offence  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased. It can be hoped with confidence  that\r\n\r\nthe  Women's Charter will not only maintain  but\r\n\r\nwill  also increase and safeguard the rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen. It is felt that, because of the wide  and\r\n\r\nfar-reaching implications of the Bill, it should\r\n\r\nbe  referred  to  a  Select  Committee,  and   I\r\n\r\ntherefore shall propose, when the Bill is read a\r\n\r\nSecond time, to move that it be so referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  regarding  the  Women's  Charter\r\n\r\nwhich  was introduced by the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law  at the last Assembly sitting,  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  improving the lot of women, I  support\r\n\r\nthe  motion  of the Minister. This  Charter,  as\r\n\r\ndrafted  has incorporated some of the provisions\r\n\r\nof   a   number  of  Ordinances.  It  has   also\r\n\r\nincorporated  the  opinions  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  has also adopted  those  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting laws in China, which have some  merits.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I believe the Minister has  improved\r\n\r\nthis   Bill,   which   is  applicable   to   and\r\n\r\npracticable  for  the people of Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nBill, I believe, will receive the support of all\r\n\r\nsections of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle of the Women's Charter\r\n\r\nis   to   enable   women  to  have  their   rights\r\n\r\nsafeguarded by legislation, and to give people far-reaching stability in marriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage system provides for monogamy to\r\n\r\nenable  both  the husband and the  wife  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nequal  status  in  their  matrimonial  life.   The\r\n\r\nprevious  evil custom will vanish with the  coming\r\n\r\ninto operation of this Charter The passing of this\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter will not only enable women  to  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded  in law but will also  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  change in society  on  a  practical\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, I wish to point out\r\n\r\nthat  the  fundamental principle of  this  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter is twofold. The problems of women are  the\r\n\r\nresult of an unreasonable society. Men take  women\r\n\r\nas  pieces of merchandise. The inhuman feudalistic\r\n\r\nsystem  has deprived women of their rights.  In  a\r\n\r\nsemi-colonial  and semi-feudalistic  society,  the\r\n\r\ntragedy  of women was very common. Men could  have\r\n\r\nthree   or   four  spouses.  Men  are   considered\r\n\r\nhonourable, but women are considered mean. It  was\r\n\r\ncommon  in  those days to regard having  one  more\r\n\r\nfemale   in   a  Chinese  family  as  being   very\r\n\r\ndespicable.  Women in our society are like  pieces\r\n\r\nof meat put on the table for men to slice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P Government has made a promise. We\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  this inequality in  the  family  to\r\n\r\nexist in this country. We will liberate women from\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of the oppressor. With the passing  of\r\n\r\nthis  legislation, women can contribute their part\r\n\r\nto the country. Our country has now obtained self-\r\n\r\ngovernment.  To  safeguard the  stability  of  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, we must first of all have\r\n\r\ninternal  stability. We must put  our  society  in\r\n\r\norder.   Only   then   can   we   safeguard    our\r\n\r\nparliamentary   democracy.  On  the   whole,   the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial system plays a very important part  in\r\n\r\nthe  social  order.  There is a  Chinese  proverb,\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that if every family has  matrimonial\r\n\r\nharmony,  then  we  can control the  country.  The\r\n\r\npeople in the old days abused marriages. They took\r\n\r\nto marriages as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschoolboy  would  take to playing.  The  rich  had\r\n\r\ntheir way with marriages. This created disorder in\r\n\r\nthe  society,  and  the women  rose  against  this\r\n\r\nunreasonable social system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore under the colonial government,\r\n\r\nmarriages  were  given a feudalistic  aspect.  The\r\n\r\nideals behind marriage were not respected. In this\r\n\r\nnew  society there are many people who  have  many\r\n\r\nwives.  To the rich people, their wives are  their\r\n\r\nproperty.  But  to  the  poor, things  are   very\r\n\r\ndifficult.  These  are due  to  the  bad  marriage\r\n\r\nsystem  and it also affects our society. In  order\r\n\r\nto show respect for marriage, we must have a sound\r\n\r\nmarriage system. Of course, to depend only upon  a\r\n\r\nlaw  to  get  rid of all these bad  practices  and\r\n\r\ncustoms  is  very difficult, because marriages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have not been put on a proper basis  for\r\n\r\nmany  years. It takes a very long time to  educate\r\n\r\nthe people to regard marriage in the proper light.\r\n\r\nOnly  then  can we have a good and sound  marriage\r\n\r\nsystem.  Only  then can we solve  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nmarriages  and the relationships between  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  principle of one man  one  wife  is  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  one,  and  I  wish  to  compliment  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Law for his  attempt  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this  principle  through  the   Women's\r\n\r\nCharter.  I am glad to hear that he is  trying  to\r\n\r\nmaintain and increase women's rights. If  all  the\r\n\r\nmen  in  Singapore have the same concern  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  women, probably we will  not  need  a\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter; probably it will be the men  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  the meat on the table to be sliced,  and\r\n\r\nbecome merchandise to be purchased! However,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   question   is,  does  the  Women's   Charter\r\n\r\nimplement this principle of one man one  wife?  If\r\n\r\nso, are the clauses in the Charter the best method\r\n\r\nof  implementing it? Instead of restricting a  man\r\n\r\nto  one  wife, the Charter makes it legal for  the\r\n\r\nman  who  has  got more than one wife  before  2nd\r\n\r\nMarch,  1960, to have as many wives as  he  likes,\r\n\r\nprovided he has not missed the boat by 2nd  March,\r\n\r\n1960!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fact which I find difficult to understand\r\n\r\nis  that,  while  one  clause  compels  people  to\r\n\r\nregister their marriages - it even imposes a fine up\r\n\r\nto  a maximum of $3,000, or a maximum period of  3\r\n\r\nyears' imprisonment - in another clause (clause  32)\r\n\r\nit  gives  no  legal  effect to the  registration.\r\n\r\nClause 32 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing in this Ordinance or rules made\r\n\r\nthereunder shall be construed to render  valid  or\r\n\r\ninvalid merely by reason of its having been or not\r\n\r\nhaving   been   registered  any   marriage   which\r\n\r\notherwise is invalid or valid.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSir,  if it does not give extra legal status, then\r\n\r\nwhy  compel a man to register his marriage? I also\r\n\r\nfeel,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Bill  does  not\r\n\r\ndeserve  the  name  of \"Women's  Charter\".  To  be\r\n\r\nworthy  of  that  name, a Women's  Charter  should\r\n\r\nuplift  the status of women not only in one field,\r\n\r\nbut  in  all fields, such as political,  economic,\r\n\r\nsocial,    legal,    civil,    educational     and\r\n\r\nprofessional.  This Charter only  deals  with  the\r\n\r\ncivil  rights of women. It merely touches  on  one\r\n\r\naspect of the economic right, and that is property\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A problem which has been worrying women ever\r\n\r\nsince  1948  is that of equal pay for equal  work.\r\n\r\nThis  has  not  been touched on at  all.  Thirteen\r\n\r\ncountries   in  the  world  have  rectified   that\r\n\r\nprinciple  and  have  made  it  law.  The   United\r\n\r\nKingdom,   unfortunately,  have  been  unable   to\r\n\r\nimplement totally this principle of equal pay  for\r\n\r\nequal work because of economic circumstances.  But\r\n\r\nthey  are doing it step by step and they  hope  to\r\n\r\nimplement   it  completely  by  1965.  A   Women's\r\n\r\nCharter,  I feel, should at least take  the  first\r\n\r\nstep  towards the principle of equal pay for equal\r\n\r\nwork,  even if it is not able to implement totally\r\n\r\nthe principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr  DEPUTY  SPEAKER (Mr G.

I believe the hon.  Lady  from\r\n\r\nDelta has stressed the importance of education. I\r\n\r\nassociate  myself with that statement.  Education\r\n\r\nfor women is very important, as they represent 50\r\n\r\nper  cent of the population of Singapore; and  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government wishes to have contributions from\r\n\r\nthem,   they   certainly  must  have   sufficient\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point in the Charter, which may cause\r\n\r\nsome  confusion, Sir, is the expression \"lawfully\r\n\r\nmarried  under  any  law,  religion,  custom   or\r\n\r\nusage\".  Sir,  this so-called Chinese  custom  or\r\n\r\nusage in marriage ranges from a grand ceremony of\r\n\r\n12  days  to a simple burning of two candles  and\r\n\r\nthree joss-sticks. The burning of two candles and\r\n\r\nthree joss-sticks does not necessarily constitute\r\n\r\na  wedding. Sometimes this is a daily practice of\r\n\r\nobeisance  in some homes. Would it  not  then  be\r\n\r\npossible  for  the  man,  who  has  picked  up  a\r\n\r\nprostitute from a brothel and has lived with  her\r\n\r\nfor  a short time, to be forced into marriage  by\r\n\r\nthis prostitute, because he has gone through this\r\n\r\nact  of burning two candles and three joss-sticks\r\n\r\nprobably  as a daily obeisance? But,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, it could also sometimes be interpreted as a\r\n\r\nwedding  ceremony.  Moreover,  Sir,  is  it   not\r\n\r\npossible  that  this  prostitute  may,  if   this\r\n\r\nCharter is passed and her marriage registered, be\r\n\r\ngranted  the same legal status as the  honourable\r\n\r\nand  legal first wife and be given the same right\r\n\r\nto  the man's property as the legal wife? Surely,\r\n\r\nit is not the intention of the Charter to protect\r\n\r\nprostitutes and mistresses at the expense of  the\r\n\r\nhonourable legal wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another confusion which the Charter might create\r\n\r\nis  in cases such as this, Sir. Let us take a man\r\n\r\nwho  marries a Chinese girl here. Let us  say  he\r\n\r\nwent through the 12-day grand ceremony. After  30\r\n\r\nyears,  he  goes  to Europe and marries  a  young\r\n\r\nEuropean   girl.  He  naturally  registers   that\r\n\r\nmarriage. Now, this Charter says he must register\r\n\r\nhis  other marriage or marriages. As far as  that\r\n\r\nChinese wife\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis concerned, she is still the legal wife. As far\r\n\r\nas  the  public is concerned, she  is  still  the\r\n\r\nlegal wife, and on the death of that man, she  is\r\n\r\nentitled to claim part of his property. If she is\r\n\r\nregistered  today, she may be forced  to  go  and\r\n\r\nlive  with the second wife. If she does not, then\r\n\r\nafter three years the man can claim desertion and\r\n\r\ndivorce  her.  She thus loses all  her  right  to\r\n\r\nclaim his property. Moreover, would the fact that\r\n\r\nher   marriage  has  been  registered  after  the\r\n\r\nregistration of the marriage between her  husband\r\n\r\nand that other young girl in Europe make her, who\r\n\r\nwas   married   30   years  ago   and   by   whom\r\n\r\ngrandchildren  have  been born,  a  second  wife,\r\n\r\nbecause  her  marriage has been registered  after\r\n\r\nher  husband's  marriage with the European  wife?\r\n\r\nGranted    that   this   legislation    legalises\r\n\r\nillegitimate  children - which  is  a  good   thing\r\n\r\nbecause  children should not suffer for the  sins\r\n\r\nof  their parents - I do hope that the Minister  (I\r\n\r\nam  sure he is capable of doing it) will  find  a\r\n\r\nbetter way of helping these illegitimate children\r\n\r\nin  getting out of this situation and helping the\r\n\r\nwomen without penalising or making the first  and\r\n\r\nlegal  wife  suffer.  They have  suffered  enough\r\n\r\nmental torment and social humiliation already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another boomerang, Sir, which might\r\n\r\nhit  the  women  if this Charter  is  passed.  At\r\n\r\npresent, no court of law will grant a decree  for\r\n\r\ndivorce  on  a marriage which has been solemnized\r\n\r\nby  a  national  custom, no  matter  whether  the\r\n\r\nhusband  marries or keeps 10 wives.  Even  if  he\r\n\r\ndeserts  her and does not live with her,  on  his\r\n\r\ndeath  she  could claim his property and  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  eyes  she  is still his wife.  She  still\r\n\r\nholds  that prestige provided she is not  married\r\n\r\nto  another man. Now, she is required to register\r\n\r\nher marriage and, as I have mentioned before, she\r\n\r\nmight be forced to go and live with the secondary\r\n\r\nwives,  otherwise the charge of  desertion  after\r\n\r\nthree years might make it possible for the man to\r\n\r\ndivorce her. Is this not a boomerang on the first\r\n\r\nwives?  If  this  Charter is passed,  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid the mothers in Singapore will have to wear\r\n\r\nsack cloth and go into mourning - to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmourn for the death of a mother's privilege and  a\r\n\r\nmother's right. If any mother dares to threaten to\r\n\r\ndisown her son or daughter who is over 20 years of\r\n\r\nage, if he or she marries a person she disapproves\r\n\r\nof,  clause  35 makes her liable on conviction  to\r\n\r\nthree years' imprisonment or a fine of $3,000,  or\r\n\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this does not only deprive a woman of a\r\n\r\nmother's  right  but also of her human  right.  It\r\n\r\nwould not be inappropriate, Sir, to describe  this\r\n\r\nCharter as the rich women's charter, as they  seem\r\n\r\nto  be  the only people who could possibly benefit\r\n\r\nby it. By registering her marriage, whether she be\r\n\r\nthe  first, second, third or tenth wife,  provided\r\n\r\nshe  has  been  a wife before 2nd March,  1960,  a\r\n\r\nwoman  will  strengthen her  claim  on  the  man's\r\n\r\nproperty.  As  far  as  the  poor  man's  wife  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  she has no property to claim.  Neither\r\n\r\nis  there a likelihood that her husband will  take\r\n\r\nanother   wife,  because  he  already   finds   it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  feed  his  one  wife  and   several\r\n\r\nchildren, and another woman would not want  to  be\r\n\r\nhis second wife just for the sake of starving.  It\r\n\r\nis  the rich man's wife who lives in fear that her\r\n\r\nhusband  would  indulge himself in the  luxury  of\r\n\r\nhaving  more than one wife. But poor  or  rich,  a\r\n\r\nwoman  will  be  required to spend nearly  $20  in\r\n\r\nregistration fees, photographs, her own transport,\r\n\r\nher  husband's  transport and  transport  for  the\r\n\r\nwitnesses. Probably this is only a fleabite to the\r\n\r\nrich woman, especially when the bait of inheriting\r\n\r\na  big  property is in view. But to a poor family,\r\n\r\nit  might  mean  a  month's pocket-money  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren,  or  a  month's  market  money  for  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  Why should the poor children be  deprived\r\n\r\nof  their  pocket money, or the poor housewife  of\r\n\r\nher  market  money so as to enable  the  wives  of\r\n\r\nmillionaires   to  strengthen  their   claims   on\r\n\r\nproperties?  Why should the poor be exploited  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the rich? Why should they sacrifice\r\n\r\na  day's  earnings to queue up at the Registration\r\n\r\nOffice  and  spend nearly $20 just to  enable  the\r\n\r\nwives  of  millionaires to inherit a fortune?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  a  poor  couple who are probably  over  80\r\n\r\nyears  of  age,  go  through the inconvenience  of\r\n\r\ntravelling perhaps 10 miles and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqueuing up for a whole day for the benefit of  the\r\n\r\nmillionaires'  wives? Who is the  Women's  Charter\r\n\r\nsupposed  to cater for? The poor masses of  women,\r\n\r\nor  the  handful of rich men's wives?  I  suggest,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  registration for those married  before\r\n\r\nthe  2nd of March be made optional. Those who feel\r\n\r\nthat  they are going to benefit by it can register\r\n\r\ntheir  marriage. The Minister, I know, is  capable\r\n\r\nenough  of  inserting clauses into the Charter  so\r\n\r\nthat  those  men  who  refuse  to  register  their\r\n\r\nmarriages when they should do so would not  escape\r\n\r\nregistration. The poor to whom it can  only  be  a\r\n\r\nburden  and  nothing  else should  be  spared  the\r\n\r\nordeal.   However,  if  Government  insists   that\r\n\r\nregistration for those who were married before 2nd\r\n\r\nMarch  be  made  compulsory,  then  may  I  humbly\r\n\r\nsuggest that the registration fee be just a  token\r\n\r\npayment of one dollar instead of, I believe it  to\r\n\r\nbe (at present) $14, that the identity card number\r\n\r\nbe  used  for identification purposes instead  of\r\n\r\nphotographs, so that a poor couple will  not  have\r\n\r\nto  go  into  unnecessary  expenditure,  and  that\r\n\r\nregistration  be decentralised so  that  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople   can  walk  to  the  registration  centres\r\n\r\ninstead  of  travelling  several  miles?  As  many\r\n\r\ncentres  as possible should be organised  so  that\r\n\r\nthe   poor  people  need  not  waste  their  day's\r\n\r\nearnings queuing up to register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter in its present form not only\r\n\r\ndeprives  the honourable first and legal  wife  of\r\n\r\nher privileged position as the wife, not only does\r\n\r\nit create some confusion by contradictory clauses,\r\n\r\nnot  only does it exploit the poor for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the rich, not only does it rob a mother of her\r\n\r\nprestige  and  rights, but it  is  in  itself  too\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to  be worthy of  the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest, Sir, that it be referred to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, because the principle of one man\r\n\r\none   wife  is  a  very  important  and  essential\r\n\r\nprinciple,  and  its  implementation   will   make\r\n\r\nhistory.  We  should  therefore  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ndignity and prestige which the Charter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeserves  is not destroyed by rushing  it  through\r\n\r\nwithout first ensuring that all avenues have  been\r\n\r\nexplored to make it as near perfect as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the principle of one man\r\n\r\none  wife  as embodied in the Women's  Charter.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  do  not  believe that  any  reasonable\r\n\r\nperson  could oppose the idea that one man  should\r\n\r\nhave  only  one wife. The People's Action  Party's\r\n\r\nstand  on this matter has had the full support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, as this was one  of  the\r\n\r\nelection issues of our Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  this Bill is introduced primarily  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  regularising the  position  with\r\n\r\nregard to monogamy. I believe that all the Members\r\n\r\nin  this  House  support  the  idea  of  monogamy.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is a very big difference  between\r\n\r\nbelieving  in  an idea in a rather vague  sort  of\r\n\r\nway,  and  making legal provisions  to  regularise\r\n\r\nsuch beliefs. In Singapore, it is unfortunate that\r\n\r\nthe situation arises in which any marriage, unless\r\n\r\nit is conducted under Christian rites or under the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Civil Marriage Ordinance, can be\r\n\r\nregarded    as   a   polygamous   marriage.    The\r\n\r\ntransitional problems that arise out of legalising\r\n\r\nmonogamy are therefore legend and varied, and  may\r\n\r\nindeed   lead  to  certain  unavoidable  or   even\r\n\r\nsometimes   somewhat   amusing   situations.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,   in   attempting   to   implement   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of monogamy, it is necessary to require\r\n\r\nall  married people whose marriages have not  been\r\n\r\nconducted  under  Christian  rites  or  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Civil Marriage  Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nregister.  Every married man (unless his  marriage\r\n\r\nhas been registered) would be required to register\r\n\r\nhis  wife or wives, and thus the amusing situation\r\n\r\narises,   as   mentioned   by   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten, wherein the Government, in attempting\r\n\r\nto  legalise monogamy, has actually legalised  the\r\n\r\nexisting polygamous marriages in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nmarried man with more than one wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that there\r\n\r\nare   many   other  similar  transitory   teething\r\n\r\nproblems  which the Bill as it is has created.  In\r\n\r\ncommitting  the  Bill to a Select  Committee,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  ready  to listen  to  constructive\r\n\r\nproposals  as  to  how  to avoid  such  transitory\r\n\r\ndifficulties. On the principle of the  Bill,  Sir,\r\n\r\nof  one man one wife the Government is irrevocably\r\n\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the principle of the Bill without\r\n\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  it may seem strange  that  we  men\r\n\r\nshould  rise to speak for a Charter that seeks  to\r\n\r\nprevent the wandering encroachments of the male. I\r\n\r\nam  saying  this,  Sir, not  merely  to  gain  the\r\n\r\naffection  of my wife but as a general  principle,\r\n\r\nwhich all decent-thinking men should follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally recognised that women, though\r\n\r\nthe  equal  of  men  in many respects,  are  still\r\n\r\nphysically  much the weaker sex. Women  are  still\r\n\r\ntoo  exposed to the economic and moral  forces - or,\r\n\r\nshall  I  say,  the immoral forces - in  this  cruel\r\n\r\nworld  of  ours. Accordingly, it becomes necessary\r\n\r\nfor  society  to seek provisions to protect  these\r\n\r\nwomen  from  the  clutches of  certain  men.  They\r\n\r\nespecially  need  the protection of  a  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  is  working towards a more equal  and  just\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. stand on this, Sir, is too well known\r\n\r\nto need repetition, it is in the Five-Year Plan. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to point out, however, that  although\r\n\r\nmany have mouthed platitudes about the rights  and\r\n\r\nequalities of women, it has become the duty of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  to implement  what  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople have talked about so much. It has been left\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P. to take up the cudgels on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe women, pioneer their just cause, treat them as\r\n\r\ntrue  equals,  and  enshrine this  equality  in  a\r\n\r\nconcrete and tangible form, in what we have before\r\n\r\nthe House today - the Women's Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, may I answer a couple of\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the Member for Mountbatten?  She\r\n\r\nsaid  a little while ago that women have not  been\r\n\r\ngiven the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  higher education  so  that  they\r\n\r\nmight  be better equipped to perform higher duties\r\n\r\nlike  Ministership  or fill higher  posts  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Surely, everybody knows that education\r\n\r\nin  this country is free, that everybody can go to\r\n\r\nany  higher seat of education to equip himself  or\r\n\r\nherself so that ultimately every person will  have\r\n\r\nan  equal chance. In view of our present policy of\r\n\r\ngiving  equal treatment to all the streams and  to\r\n\r\nmales  and females, surely that would be a  proper\r\n\r\nanswer to the Member for Mountbatten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned a little while ago about\r\n\r\nregistration and how it would make this Charter  a\r\n\r\nrich  woman's Charter because the poor woman would\r\n\r\nhave  to  spend  a  lot of money going  about  and\r\n\r\nultimately  wasting a lot of time and  spending  a\r\n\r\nlot of money which she might not be able to spare.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Member for Mountbatten is a  bit  too\r\n\r\nquick  in  prejudging the issue. Surely she  knows\r\n\r\nthat today we are only talking about the principle\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill and that the actual running  of  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  marriages  will  ultimately   be\r\n\r\ndecided  upon after due consideration. Surely  she\r\n\r\nis  not trying to teach the Government what to do.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Government knows more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The whole weight of the State machinery\r\n\r\nwill  be  brought  to  bear on  those  anti-social\r\n\r\nelements who seek to enslave women to their  whims\r\n\r\nand  fancies. Only too often, Sir, do we  hear  of\r\n\r\nstories  and unfortunate cases where a  mother  of\r\n\r\nseveral children is left destitute and to fend for\r\n\r\nherself  and  her  children  by  some  errant  and\r\n\r\nirresponsible  husband;  or  where  an   expectant\r\n\r\nmother  finds out all too late that she  has  been\r\n\r\nled   up  the  garden  path,  that  her  so-called\r\n\r\nmarriage with the man is not legally binding,  and\r\n\r\nthat  she has been tricked into the position of  a\r\n\r\nsubservient,  clandestine  mistress.  The  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter will help to rectify all these anomalies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in spite of all this in the Charter,\r\n\r\nthere will still be women who will be weak and who\r\n\r\nwill  be  greedy enough to succumb to  temptation;\r\n\r\nand  there will be women who will lead men astray,\r\n\r\nthough  this  in  most  cases  is  not  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary. However, as our country is just on  the\r\n\r\nthreshold  of  a  new era and will  need  all  the\r\n\r\nenergy and help from all quarters - male as well  as\r\n\r\nfemale - in the gigantic task of nation building, it\r\n\r\nmight be advisable for those who are blessed  with\r\n\r\nmore zest and vitamins in their system than may be\r\n\r\ngood  for  them,  to  re-channel  their  exuberant\r\n\r\nenergy   into  other  socially  useful  and   non-population    increasing   types   of   productive\r\n\r\noccupations.  The  practice of the  noble  art  of\r\n\r\nsexual sublimation will serve as a shining example\r\n\r\nto  our  future generations and will also  lighten\r\n\r\nvery  much  the  burden  of  the  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation. It is a long cry, Sir, from primitive\r\n\r\ncommunism  and  polygamy  as  had  been  practised\r\n\r\nthroughout the ages in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\nCustoms   die   hard,  but  in   all   progressive\r\n\r\ncountries,  the  one  man  one  wife   system   of\r\n\r\nmarriages  is  the  recognised  social  order.  In\r\n\r\nembodying this principle in the Statute  Book,  we\r\n\r\nare merely reflecting the current and modern views\r\n\r\nof  society. The Women's Charter has become an all\r\n\r\nin one and a one to one Women's Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Mountbatten has\r\n\r\nintimated,  I will even go so far as to  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  Women's Charter, which is before  the  House\r\n\r\ntoday,  will  find, as various other  charters  in\r\n\r\nother parts of the world have found, the same kind\r\n\r\nof  place - that  is,  as a permanent  monument  and\r\n\r\nmilestone -   in the history of social struggle  for\r\n\r\nthe betterment of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Charter wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe many\r\n\r\nmen  support  many  things for many  reasons.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown supports this Bill.  So  it\r\n\r\nseems  he  still wants to retain the affection  of\r\n\r\nhis wife! That is a good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can think  of\r\n\r\nno  better  reason for supporting this Bill  than\r\n\r\nthat advanced by the Member for Queenstown. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know how many of the Members in this Assembly\r\n\r\nare  placed in the position where they could have\r\n\r\ntaken  more than one wife if they had wished  to.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself, I am in the position where I\r\n\r\ncan  only  take  one wife, which I  have  already\r\n\r\ndone. So the implications of the Bill, in so  far\r\n\r\nas  I am personally concerned, do not affect  me.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps, I am in a\r\n\r\nbetter  position  to look upon  this  Bill  in  a\r\n\r\ncompletely objective and detached manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of one man one wife and, if I may\r\n\r\nsay  so, one woman one husband, is acceptable  to\r\n\r\nall  of  us. But what some of us on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  are  worried about is the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich this Bill has been drafted and whether some\r\n\r\nof   its  provisions  are  really  in  the   best\r\n\r\ninterests  of both men and women as such.  As  it\r\n\r\nsays in clause 3, this Bill is designed to \"apply\r\n\r\nto  all  persons resident in Singapore and  shall\r\n\r\nalso  apply to all persons domiciled in Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  are  resident outside Singapore.\" Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  the Bill is to take  in  everyone\r\n\r\nliving in Singapore, be he a Singapore citizen or\r\n\r\notherwise; and also to take in Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nor  people  who  are domiciled in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nliving  outside. There is a further provision  in\r\n\r\nsub-clause  (2)  of  clause  3  which  says  that\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions \"of this Ordinance shall  not\r\n\r\napply  to any person who is married under, or  to\r\n\r\nany  marriage solemnized or registered under, the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Muslims Ordinance, 1957.\"  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  made a statement  that  this  Bill\r\n\r\nshall  in  no  way  affect any Muslim  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I am going to suggest to the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat, as drafted, it does take in some Muslims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill\r\n\r\naffects   all  persons  resident  in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Federation  Muslims  living   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  come within the ambit of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nbecause sub-clause (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  clause 3 exempts only Muslims who are married\r\n\r\nunder  the  provisions of the Muslims  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1957.  Federation  Muslims,  married  under   the\r\n\r\nMuslim  laws in the Federation and who come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore   are   apparently  affected   by   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this Bill. What the  consequences\r\n\r\nare is not as intended by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the point I wish\r\n\r\nto  touch  upon  is clause 45.  This  clause  and\r\n\r\nclause  166  are  the  two  clauses,  which   can\r\n\r\nprobably  be called the Women's Charter,  because\r\n\r\nevery  other provision (except for the  provision\r\n\r\nwhich  says \"No person shall marry more than  one\r\n\r\nwife  after  the  2nd day of March\")  is  already\r\n\r\ncontained in the existing provisions of  our  law\r\n\r\nin  this  State. Therefore, clause  45  is  worth\r\n\r\nreading out to Members of this House, because  it\r\n\r\nis  really the meat of the Bill. Clause 45  reads\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) The solemnization of marriage creates a\r\n\r\nconjugal union between the husband and wife  and\r\n\r\nthey  thereby  mutually bind themselves  to  co-\r\n\r\noperate  with  each  other in  safeguarding  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  union  and  in  caring   and\r\n\r\nproviding for the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The husband and the wife shall have the\r\n\r\nright  separately  to  engage  in  any  trade  or\r\n\r\nprofession or in social activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The wife shall have the right to use her\r\n\r\nown surname and name separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The husband and the wife shall have equal\r\n\r\nrights   in   the  running  of  the  matrimonial\r\n\r\nhousehold and in the ownership and management of\r\n\r\nthe family properties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, let us examine clause 45, sub-clause by sub-clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) The solemnization of marriage creates a\r\n\r\nconjugal union between the husband and wife\". The\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter is not going to create that. When\r\n\r\na  man and a woman join together in matrimony, be\r\n\r\nit  holy  or otherwise, it does create a conjugal\r\n\r\nunion.  So  we  really do not  need  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter to tell us that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...and they thereby mutually bind\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  co-operate  with  each  other  in\r\n\r\nsafeguarding  the interests of the union  and  in\r\n\r\ncaring  and providing for the children.\"  I  will\r\n\r\nadmit  that this goes beyond the law  as  it  now\r\n\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  law,  Mr Deputy Speaker, as I understand  it\r\n\r\nnow,  is that once a marriage takes place,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  only the right and privilege, but it is  also\r\n\r\nthe duty of the husband to look after his wife and\r\n\r\nhis  children. The legal liability to maintain the\r\n\r\nwife and children fairly and squarely rests on the\r\n\r\nshoulders  of the husband and on no other  person.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Bill,  in  seeking  to  create  equality\r\n\r\nbetween man and woman in marriage, allows  the  wo\r\n\r\nman  to  share  the  financial  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nlooking after both herself and her husband and her\r\n\r\nchildren.  Does  the  Government  really  want  to\r\n\r\nchange the law in that respect? If this Bill  goes\r\n\r\nthrough as it is, that will be the net result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (2):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The husband and the wife shall have the right\r\n\r\nseparately to engage in any trade or profession\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is the law as it now exists, but something\r\n\r\nhas been added to the clause, which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"or in social activities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  apparently is some new right to be conferred\r\n\r\non  the women of Singapore - that after this Charter\r\n\r\nhas  been  passed, they are going to have complete\r\n\r\nequality  in  so  far  as  social  activities  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. What these \"social activities\"  are  it\r\n\r\nis  difficult  to  know. As I understand  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, \"social activities\" might mean  a\r\n\r\nnumber of things. It might mean the mahjong table;\r\n\r\nit  might  mean the dance floor; it might  mean  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of things in which the wife will  socially\r\n\r\namuse herself. Any activity, which provides social\r\n\r\namusement to any person, I understand, is a social\r\n\r\nactivity.  Therefore, if the wife  wants  to  play\r\n\r\nmahjong  at  8 o'clock at night, she  says,  \"Look\r\n\r\nhere,  darling, I am off to a game of mahjong.\"  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  the  poor husband will then  be  quite\r\n\r\nhelpless  to  do  anything about it,  because  the\r\n\r\nCharter  says complete equality of rights  to  the\r\n\r\nmahjong  table.  That, as I look  at  it,  is  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation    of   the   expression    \"social\r\n\r\nactivities\". Perhaps the Minister might have  some\r\n\r\nother interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (3) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The wife shall have the right to use her own\r\n\r\nsurname and name separately.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Does the Member object to it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, I do not object to that, but I\r\n\r\nhope  the  women  are satisfied and  pleased  with\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is a thing, which does not cost\r\n\r\nthe man anything. Sub-clause (4):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The husband and the wife shall have equal\r\n\r\nrights in the running of the matrimonial household\r\n\r\nand  in the ownership and management of the family\r\n\r\nproperties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  more serious. Quite frankly, Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  do  not quite follow the  meaning  of\r\n\r\nthis. The implications of this sub-clause could be\r\n\r\nvery  drastic. Some of the phrases used  are  such\r\n\r\nthat  they  cut  across the  whole  conception  of\r\n\r\nproperty  and operation of the law of property  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  \"The husband and the wife  shall  have\r\n\r\nequal  rights  in  the running of the  matrimonial\r\n\r\nhousehold\" - now what exactly does that mean?  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know, but it could mean a number of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Half the bed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, it could mean half the bed, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker. It could mean many other  things.\r\n\r\nThe  law as it now stands is that in so far as the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  household is  concerned,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nhusband that is the master. He is the guardian  of\r\n\r\nhis children. He is by law obliged to maintain the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial household according to the best of his\r\n\r\nmeans  and according to his status. If it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention that a person has equal rights, then  it\r\n\r\nmust  also  mean equal duties? Does it mean  then,\r\n\r\nafter  this  Charter has been passed,  that  women\r\n\r\nwill become financially liable in equal shares? If\r\n\r\nthat  is  the intention, I wonder what  the  women\r\n\r\nopposite and behind me think of it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\". . . and in the ownership and management of\r\n\r\nthe family properties.\" \"family properties\" is not\r\n\r\ndefined. \"family properties\" is a phrase which  is\r\n\r\nnot  known in our system of law. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to know what it  is  intended  to\r\n\r\nmean, because the succeeding clauses, particularly\r\n\r\nfrom clause 47 onwards, keep on talking about  the\r\n\r\nseparate property of a married woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny  property  that she has before  marriage,  any\r\n\r\nproperty that she gains by virtue of her work,  or\r\n\r\nprofession,  or  business,  remains  her  separate\r\n\r\nproperty, and the man cannot touch it. So it is  a\r\n\r\nbit  difficult to understand how \"the husband  and\r\n\r\nwife shall have equal rights in the running of the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  household and in  the  ownership  and\r\n\r\nmanagement of the family properties\". Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister has an explanation. If he has, I shall be\r\n\r\nobliged  for  it,  but  at the  moment  I  see  no\r\n\r\nexplanation  for  it, and I do not  know  how  the\r\n\r\nCourts  are going to interpret the phrase  \"family\r\n\r\nproperties\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause, which, I think, is part and\r\n\r\nparcel of the Women's Charter and which, in  fact,\r\n\r\nreally  puts this Bill beyond the existing law  is\r\n\r\nclause  166. This clause provides for transitional\r\n\r\nprovisions regarding those gentlemen who have been\r\n\r\nfortunate  enough - or  unfortunate  enough - to  have\r\n\r\nmarried  more than one. This clause says that  all\r\n\r\nsuch  persons must register their marriages within\r\n\r\na  year  of  the  coming  into  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  As  drafted, Mr Deputy  Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nobligation to register not only lies on the  male,\r\n\r\nbut also on the female. So if the female wishes to\r\n\r\nhave  her marriage registered, she may do  so.  If\r\n\r\nshe does not do it, then of course she herself  is\r\n\r\nliable  to imprisonment for three years  or  to  a\r\n\r\nfine not exceeding $3,000. This, of course, is the\r\n\r\nother end of the Charter, which gets her round the\r\n\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Minister has agreed that this Bill\r\n\r\nshould  go to a Select Committee, because  my  own\r\n\r\nview  is  that, while supporting the principle  of\r\n\r\none  man one wife, and one woman one husband,  the\r\n\r\nconceptions  in this Bill with regard  to  \"family\r\n\r\nproperties\"  and matrimonial household\"  are  such\r\n\r\nthat  they  should be carefully  examined  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  with  a  view  to  finding  out\r\n\r\nwhether they do not cut across, or are in conflict\r\n\r\nwith, the existing provisions of the law as we now\r\n\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last matter on which I would like to touch,\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, is this.

Most  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions in this Bill are the same as those\r\n\r\nin  existing laws. In principle, we fully  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill will suit the people,  because  it\r\n\r\ntakes care of their welfare. The P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas  promised  to fulfil the people's  desire  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning of the many steps, which\r\n\r\nwe  will take towards solving women's problems. In\r\n\r\nthe  past  people have exploited women.  From  the\r\n\r\neighteenth  century, women's  problems  have  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  again and again. After  two  centuries,\r\n\r\nthese  problems are still fresh in  the  minds  of\r\n\r\nmany  people. Although for a long time in  history\r\n\r\nwe  have  tried  to solve women's  problems,  they\r\n\r\nstill  remain  to be solved. The reason  is  this.\r\n\r\nWomen's problems are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neasily  solved. It is very difficult to solve  all\r\n\r\nthese  problems just by passing a Bill. Only after\r\n\r\nother  social problems are solved can the  women's\r\n\r\nproblems be solved. In a society where people  are\r\n\r\nexploited,  it  is very difficult to  solve  these\r\n\r\nproblems. Only after a socialist society has  been\r\n\r\nestablished  can women's problems be  solved.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is trying its best to help solve\r\n\r\nthese  problems. These problems are,  among  other\r\n\r\nthings,  economic, educational and moral in  their\r\n\r\nnature. The solving of these problems is only  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step  taken  towards  solving  the  women's\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore and in the Federation of Malaya, it\r\n\r\nis  very  common to see villagers,  both  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen, going out to work early in the morning  and\r\n\r\ncoming  home  late in the evening. They  are  very\r\n\r\nbusy. Women are very important in the life of  the\r\n\r\nfamily. They take a direct part in laborious work.\r\n\r\nThey work together with the men, and they help  to\r\n\r\nshoulder   the   family   responsibilities.    The\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  for them is  how  to  share  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of  their  labour,  irrespective  of   the\r\n\r\nproblems  of distance and transport. We  must  let\r\n\r\nthem enjoy the fruits of their labour and not  let\r\n\r\nthem  be exploited by middlemen. They must not  be\r\n\r\nrestricted  by  conventional  rules  and  customs.\r\n\r\nAlthough their intellectual standard is low,  they\r\n\r\nmust try to improve themselves every day. What  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  do is to see that they are not exploited\r\n\r\nagain,  and that they must not be deprived of  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  of education. I give this example  not\r\n\r\nwith  the  idea of saying that village  women  and\r\n\r\nother  women workers want to have greater  respect\r\n\r\nshown  to them, but in order to show that  women's\r\n\r\nproblems are closely related to other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some women want equality with men, but they do\r\n\r\nnot  take  part  in laborious work,  nor  do  they\r\n\r\ncultivate  their abilities and their talents.  The\r\n\r\nmere  passing  of  a  law cannot  change  people's\r\n\r\nattitude  towards them. It is useless  to  improve\r\n\r\nthe   society   if   the  women   cannot   improve\r\n\r\nthemselves. I want to tell the House  that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  face  these  problems realistically - in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  if we do not change our social system  but\r\n\r\nonly pass a single law in order to solve the pro-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblems  of women or to raise their status  - then  it\r\n\r\nwill be completely useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell all women that if we do not play\r\n\r\na positive part in the work of changing the social\r\n\r\nsystem,  but to depend on a single Bill  to  solve\r\n\r\nall  their problems, then the result would be that\r\n\r\nthey  would be looked down upon by others. We want\r\n\r\na  socialist  society to exist. This is  what  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore want. But before this aim  can\r\n\r\nbe achieved, we must help ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must again say that I agree with the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Women's Charter Bill, because  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of this Bill shows that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has the will to help women.  The  women\r\n\r\nthemselves must, therefore, work hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>\r\n\r\n<b></b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, with the tabling of the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter Bill in front of us, I  feel  the\r\n\r\nwives  in Singapore will give a smile and will  be\r\n\r\nhappy  now  that  their  welfare  is  safeguarded.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there are certain quarters who say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Women's Charter is incomplete, on the grounds\r\n\r\nthat  it  excludes education, economic  and  other\r\n\r\nprovisions,   I   feel  that  with   the   present\r\n\r\ndemocratic  government which we have in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere  are, in fact, no restrictions on women.  To\r\n\r\nany extent that the women would like to achieve in\r\n\r\nthe  fields of education or in other spheres, they\r\n\r\ncan  now  do  so.  If there is any restriction  on\r\n\r\nwomen going to the University, I am quite positive\r\n\r\nthat this Government will introduce legislation to\r\n\r\nfree  them  from such a restriction. There  is  no\r\n\r\nrestriction whatsoever imposed on women. Hence, in\r\n\r\nthis Women's Charter Bill, there is no mention  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions, which were enumerated by  Members\r\n\r\non the Opposition side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is our experience to date that the cause of women's suffering is marriage. There\r\n\r\nis  a  saying  that a married man  will  give  two\r\n\r\nthings. If the women do not experience hell,  they\r\n\r\nwill  experience heaven, because there is no  law,\r\n\r\nwhich will guarantee the freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  the  rights of women. It is only the  men  who\r\n\r\ntaste the good things in life. Therefore, with the\r\n\r\nenactment  of this Women's Charter Bill,  it  will\r\n\r\nnot  only be the men who will be in a position  to\r\n\r\nobtain all the privileges, but the women also will\r\n\r\nbe able to obtain the privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what we have heard just now, it has\r\n\r\nhitherto  been the fate of women to be ignored  by\r\n\r\nthe  men, because if the women, who give birth  to\r\n\r\nthe children, are deserted by their husbands, then\r\n\r\nthey have to shoulder the responsibilities without\r\n\r\nany  recourse to the proper authorities  to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  their rights. Hence I think the women  should\r\n\r\nbe  proud  today because of the enactment  of  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter Bill which we are debating now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on principle, there is no human being who practises humanitarianism who will not\r\n\r\nsupport the principle of one-man one wife. I think\r\n\r\nthose  who do not support the principle of one-man\r\n\r\none wife, that is, a monogamous marriage, have the\r\n\r\nintention  of marrying at a later date  more  than\r\n\r\none  wife.  During the debate on this Bill,  there\r\n\r\nare  people who have asked about the stand of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Members  on the Government  side  on  this\r\n\r\nBill.  Mr Speaker, after a thorough investigation\r\n\r\ninto  the religious beliefs practised by the  non-\r\n\r\nMuslims,  we  find  that there is  no  mention  of\r\n\r\nmonogamous  marriages.  Without  interfering  with\r\n\r\nthese religious beliefs, we wholeheartedly support\r\n\r\nthis  principle  of  a monogamous  marriage  being\r\n\r\nimplemented in Singapore. At the same time,  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  people  who wish to take unto  themselves\r\n\r\nmore  than  one  wife,  by  converting  to  Islam,\r\n\r\nbecause  Islam  permits polygamy.  It  is  not  my\r\n\r\nintention to go deeply into these matters, because\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims Ordinance is the subject of study  by\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee, which has not yet completed\r\n\r\nits  deliberations.  However,  I  would  like   to\r\n\r\nemphasise,  firstly, to the new  generation  that,\r\n\r\naccording   to  the  Islamic  law,  a   polygamous\r\n\r\nmarriage  is  not encouraged. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nIslam  encourages  its devout followers  to  marry\r\n\r\nonly  one  wife. This has been underlined  in  the\r\n\r\nHoly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKoran  in  the fourth chapter, third verse,  which\r\n\r\npermits  a man to take unto himself more than  one\r\n\r\nwife  but with certain specific conditions.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure that if the men are sincere and hold on\r\n\r\nto  their  Islamic  concepts,  they  will  not  go\r\n\r\nagainst this rule. Among other things, this  verse\r\n\r\npermits  polygamy. It permits, a man to take  more\r\n\r\nthan  one wife on condition that \"if ye fear  that\r\n\r\nye  shall  not  be  able to  deal  justly  ...then\r\n\r\n(marry)  only one\". So, Mr Speaker, I  feel  that\r\n\r\nnot  only  in  other religions  but  also  in  the\r\n\r\nIslamic  law, a certain stiff condition is imposed\r\n\r\non a man who wishes to take unto himself more than\r\n\r\none  wife. This condition does not concern  money,\r\n\r\nbut it is concerned that equity and justice should\r\n\r\nbe meted out to the wives. It means that if we buy\r\n\r\na  red  baju  for one wife, then we  have  to  buy\r\n\r\nanother  red baju also for the other  wife.  I  am\r\n\r\nciting  this  as  an example. Similarly  in  other\r\n\r\nmatters, if we give 50 per cent of our love to the\r\n\r\nfirst wife, we must give the other 50 per cent  to\r\n\r\nthe  second  wife.  But this  kind  of  equity  or\r\n\r\njustice cannot be fully practised, in spite of the\r\n\r\nfact  that  you  are  anxious  to  carry  it  out.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   although  the  Islamic  law   permits\r\n\r\npolygamy,  if  the  question is considered  deeply\r\n\r\nenough, it will be found that the law itself  does\r\n\r\nnot  encourage polygamy. It has been stressed that\r\n\r\nmen cannot mete out justice to more than one wife.\r\n\r\nSo, Mr Speaker, I think this decision will not be\r\n\r\nin  contradiction  to  any religious  beliefs.  We\r\n\r\nshould not smile because we do not come under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Women's Charter, which  we  are\r\n\r\ndebating  today. Mr Speaker, I think  it  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the man to see  that  his  wife\r\n\r\ndoes   not  take  unto  herself  another  husband.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the  husband  should  not  take   unto\r\n\r\nhimself another wife, thus disappointing his first\r\n\r\nwife. In other words, a crisis does not arise only\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of  material causes,  but  it  also\r\n\r\nresults  from other factors. If we are not  happy,\r\n\r\nwe  will grow thin. Then there will be unhappiness\r\n\r\nin  the home, thus bringing about chaos. With  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of one-man one wife, I think the society\r\n\r\nin Singapore will live in peace and harmony. Those\r\n\r\nwho desire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen  to  be at their whims and fancies  will  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled by this Charter. This Charter will also\r\n\r\naffect  the millionaire who cannot see a beautiful\r\n\r\nwoman  without desiring to take her  for  a  wife,\r\n\r\nalthough he may have been married. So, he must now\r\n\r\ndecide  which beautiful girl to take as  his  wife\r\n\r\nbefore he marries her. Under this Women's Charter,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot marry one girl today and, when  she  is\r\n\r\nold,  discard  her  and marry  another  one.  This\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter will safeguard women's rights  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can live in peace and harmony  in  the\r\n\r\nhouse. When this is achieved, the children will be\r\n\r\nwell cared for and looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park touched on Federal citizens of Muslim faith who are\r\n\r\nmarried  in the Federation and who have come  down\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. I have stressed just now  that  the\r\n\r\nmarriages of Islamic people are controlled by  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  Ordinance, which is still under study  by\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee, and very soon we will be  in\r\n\r\na position to know how things stand. The enactment\r\n\r\nof  this  Women's Charter will not interfere  with\r\n\r\nany section of the community. It is enacted in the\r\n\r\ninterests of peace, prosperity and well  being  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I am a hundred  per  cent  in\r\n\r\nsupport   of  the  Women's  Charter.   The   women\r\n\r\npopulation in this country is nearly half  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal population. In other parts of the world they\r\n\r\nalso  make  up  half of the total  population.  In\r\n\r\nother  countries the legislators dare not overlook\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of  women. We the P.A.P.  Government,\r\n\r\nclaim  to be a Socialist Government. The principle\r\n\r\nof  socialism  is to treat all alike, irrespective\r\n\r\nof race or sex. In other advanced countries, women\r\n\r\nare  in a position to enjoy an equal share of  the\r\n\r\nfruits of their labour. We can say that they  have\r\n\r\nachieved real liberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore, although we enjoy a modern\r\n\r\nway  of  living  with modern facilities,  we  lack\r\n\r\nproper  legislation  to safeguard  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen.  What is more sickening is that some people\r\n\r\nare  still inclined to have feudalistic ideas. Day\r\n\r\nand   night   these  people  think   of   marrying\r\n\r\nconcubines. Others never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreat women as human beings but as playthings.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen a small section of the people - they  are\r\n\r\npetty  merchants - who take too  much  advantage  of\r\n\r\ntheir  establishments, which employ women workers,\r\n\r\nand  who eventually make these women workers their\r\n\r\nconcubines.  Such things do happen. They  are  not\r\n\r\nrare.  Once  the  Charter is put  into  operation,\r\n\r\nthose having this ulterior motive will not be able\r\n\r\nto  achieve  their aims, and the idea of  marrying\r\n\r\nconcubines can no longer exist in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we in this Assembly who are debating the\r\n\r\nCharter  believe that thousands upon thousands  of\r\n\r\nwomen outside heartily hail the Charter. They wish\r\n\r\nthat  this  Charter will soon be approved  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Even  the Strangers'  Gallery  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly is crowded with people, many of whom  are\r\n\r\nwomen who have come here to hear the debate on the\r\n\r\nCharter.  Among  them  are  the  wives   of   some\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members. They have come  here  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether their husbands are honest and faithful  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the Women's Charter is to deal with\r\n\r\nthe immediate problem of women's rights in matters\r\n\r\nregarding  marriages. As to their other rights,  I\r\n\r\nthink the Government will make provisions for them\r\n\r\nstep  by step. This means that the time will  come\r\n\r\nwhen women will be able to enjoy equality with men\r\n\r\nin all respects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Mountbatten expressed\r\n\r\nher  regrets  about  the Bill because  it  is  not\r\n\r\nprovided  therein  that  women  will  enjoy  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity   for  education.  We  understand   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at present that almost every  woman  is\r\n\r\nable  to  receive an education. If the  girls  can\r\n\r\nprove  their worth, I think their parents will  be\r\n\r\npleased  to lift them up. We can see for ourselves\r\n\r\nthat there tire many women taking courses of study\r\n\r\nin  local  Universities, and  that  many  even  go\r\n\r\noverseas  for  further  study.  Therefore,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  the argument put forward by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten  is invalid. Further  there  are\r\n\r\nmany high administrative posts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the Government service held by women officers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order that this Charter be  approved\r\n\r\nby  the Assembly, I support the motion that it  be\r\n\r\nreferred to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Who can deny that we, as married\r\n\r\nmen,  are not attracted by a beautiful girl  in  a\r\n\r\ncheongsam   walking  and  exposing  her  beautiful\r\n\r\ncalfs?  This  Women's Charter will no doubt  bring\r\n\r\nabout  discipline in the morals of the  people.  I\r\n\r\nfully understand those matters, which might result\r\n\r\nin  the  break-up of my family and a  disgrace  to\r\n\r\nsociety. Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that if we  try\r\n\r\nto  clap with one hand, there is no noise. We must\r\n\r\nuse  both  hands. So in the case of a  man  and  a\r\n\r\nwoman. Who will then be at fault? Is it the man or\r\n\r\nthe  woman who is to be blamed? Who is encouraging\r\n\r\nmen  to  marry more than one woman? Why are  women\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept men who are already  married?\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must go slowly and carefully in this\r\n\r\nmatter, because, as a follower of Islam, I do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  interfere with the rights of  the  other\r\n\r\ncommunities  who  are friends  of  the  Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Muslims took unto themselves\r\n\r\nmore  than one wife in ancient days. Many  of  the\r\n\r\nwomen were widows. The reason for the men in those\r\n\r\ndays  taking more than one wife was to stop  these\r\n\r\nwidows  from going into prostitution. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that is the point I would like to bring home\r\n\r\nto  the  Member who touched upon the stand of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim Members of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not oppose the Women's Charter, because it\r\n\r\nwill be referred to a Select Committee. Sir, I  do\r\n\r\nnot   deny  that  we  must  pay  tribute  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for introducing this Charter. There  is\r\n\r\nprovision  therein which will safeguard the  moral\r\n\r\nrights  of  women,  so  that  they  will  not   be\r\n\r\nvictimised  or treated as chattels. As a  follower\r\n\r\nof  Islam,  I would like to stress that I  respect\r\n\r\nthe  findings of the Government without  affecting\r\n\r\nthe  Islamic law of this country. However, as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  explained  by the Member  for  Farrer  Park,\r\n\r\nthere  are many provisions in this Charter,  which\r\n\r\ncould perhaps be misinterpreted in relation to the\r\n\r\nMuslims  Ordinance, 1957. I hope that the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  will  be in a position  to  explain  in\r\n\r\ndetail  whether  the provisions  embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nWomen's   Charter  are  related  to  the   Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1957.  This is the question  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen worrying me. I myself am not in a position to\r\n\r\nknow whether the Women's Charter is related to the\r\n\r\nMuslims  Ordinance,  1957.  However,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  will  be  in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nclarify  explicitly the position, so as to  remove\r\n\r\nall  doubts, which may exist in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Islamic faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, unmarried Members of the  House  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to pick a quarrel with husbands who  are\r\n\r\nmore  experienced than them.

In\r\n\r\nthe  \"Tasks Ahead\" (Part I), we said that as  part\r\n\r\nof  our  Five-Year  Plan we  shall  work  for  the\r\n\r\nemancipation of women. In this booklet, we said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Women who form nearly half of our population\r\n\r\nhave  an  important part to play in  our  national\r\n\r\nconstruction.

In  the  West,\r\n\r\nwomen  were  placed on a pedestal; in  the  Middle\r\n\r\nEast,  women were kept in purdah, and in the  East\r\n\r\nwomen became beasts of burden. Sir, it might  have\r\n\r\nbeen  true  forty years ago when the man travelled\r\n\r\nin  his journey from the West to the East.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that we take the female sex for granted  out\r\n\r\nin the East. It is equally true that, in the past,\r\n\r\ngirl  babies  were at a discount in China  and  it\r\n\r\nused to be the past practice that girl babies were\r\n\r\ndisposed  of  by  drowning. Times have  moved  and\r\n\r\nconditions  have changed, and it is equally  right\r\n\r\ntoo  that  we  in Singapore should  recognise  the\r\n\r\ndeficiencies and the unequal treatment, which  are\r\n\r\nmeted out to the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will this Charter affect the women of\r\n\r\nSingapore? Sir, this Charter will not affect those\r\n\r\nwho   are  already  married  under  the  Christian\r\n\r\nMarriage   Ordinance   or   the   Civil   Marriage\r\n\r\nOrdinance. We have taken it for granted that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose women who are married under these Ordinances\r\n\r\nwill  be  fully  conscious of  their  rights - their\r\n\r\nrights of divorce if their husbands were to commit\r\n\r\nadultery,  or if they were to take unto themselves\r\n\r\nanother  wife. It is because many of  those  women\r\n\r\nwho are married under these two Ordinances are the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated that we fail at times to see that\r\n\r\nthere  are thousands of other women who  have  not\r\n\r\nreceived  any  formal education and who  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen married under any of these Ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past we cannot change, but it is the future\r\n\r\nthat  we  must protect. It is the future of  those\r\n\r\nunfortunate women who may have been inveigled into\r\n\r\na hasty marriage that we must protect. But I would\r\n\r\nsay  this:  that the Bill alone will  not  stop  a\r\n\r\nmarried man from keeping a mistress. That  is  not\r\n\r\npossible. What is more important is that our women\r\n\r\nshould  achieve the economic independence to  make\r\n\r\ntheir lives secure; that is basic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill places certain restrictions upon the\r\n\r\nhappiness  of a married family, but  in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  this Bill will work, it  is  equally\r\n\r\nimportant, too, that our women should realise that\r\n\r\nif   they   were  to  marry  solely  for  economic\r\n\r\nsecurity,  then  that Bill, or  whatever  Marriage\r\n\r\nOrdinance  under which they marry, is as  valuable\r\n\r\nas  the  piece  of paper on which it  is  printed.\r\n\r\nBasically,  the  security of  women  can  only  be\r\n\r\nattained   if   their  economic  independence   is\r\n\r\nassured, and conditions of work are the same  both\r\n\r\nfor women as well as for men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has gone into some\r\n\r\ndetail into the clauses of the Bill. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  say  that it is more important that we  should\r\n\r\ndistinguish between the principles of the Bill and\r\n\r\nthe administrative acts necessary to carry out the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill. It may be  true  that  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill there are certain clauses, which can  be\r\n\r\nimproved upon. We say that we are receptive to any\r\n\r\nideas or suggestions, which can be put forward  to\r\n\r\nimprove such clauses.

As   a\r\n\r\nfather,  I say that the happiness of the home  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  achieved if there is one mother and  one\r\n\r\nfather.  To those of us who believe that from  the\r\n\r\nhappiness of the home will spring the happiness of\r\n\r\nthe  country, it is but right that one man  should\r\n\r\nhave one wife. I say this, Sir, with all humility.\r\n\r\nMany  a  time  have I said that it is  always  the\r\n\r\nwomen  who suffer most. It is but right that there\r\n\r\nshould  be laws enacted to protect women from  the\r\n\r\ninhumanity  and inequalities perpetrated  by  some\r\n\r\nwrong-thinking men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having said that, Sir, I will try to\r\n\r\nexamine  in  what way the P.A.P. can  justify  the\r\n\r\nclaim  that  they are fighting for the  rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen,  and that this Women's Charter is indeed  a\r\n\r\ncharter  for  women.  It  is  strange,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\naccording  to the reckoning or estimation  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government,  wives   are   classed   with\r\n\r\nprostitutes  in one law. That is their estimation.\r\n\r\nSurely  there  could  be a law  for  wives  and  a\r\n\r\nseparate  law  for  the protection  of  women  and\r\n\r\ngirls.  Why should wives be put on the same  plane\r\n\r\nwith  prostitutes in the law? I cannot  understand\r\n\r\nthat. They say that it is only through such a  law\r\n\r\nthat  women will have their just rights. It  would\r\n\r\nseem that women have had no such rights until  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came into power. It would mean that  women\r\n\r\nhad no equal rights for education, for appointment\r\n\r\nin  Government service, for almost all the  things\r\n\r\nthat  they are enjoying now until the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  power.  And  so, during the  elections  they\r\n\r\nthought that with 50 per cent of the voters  being\r\n\r\nfemales, they would do a grand thing and put out a\r\n\r\nbait to the women, \"If you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvote  us  in, we will see that you are protected.\"\r\n\r\nBut  let us examine this proposed law and  see  in\r\n\r\nwhat way women are protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when the newspapers gave an almost word-\r\n\r\nfor-word report of this Bill, first wives of  rich\r\n\r\nmen were jubilant and gleefully said, \"Ha! ha! See\r\n\r\nthat  woman there? She is no more. I am the  first\r\n\r\nwife.\"  What does this Bill say? That  that  woman\r\n\r\nshall   be  of  an  equal  status  and  shall   be\r\n\r\nregistered as the wife! Poor misguided  wife!  She\r\n\r\nlaughed too early! She did not try to examine what\r\n\r\nthat  law provides for her. If she had, she  would\r\n\r\nhave  felt despondent, at least before such a Bill\r\n\r\never came out, she could have had the pleasure  of\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the  second wife of her  husband  and\r\n\r\nsaying, \"You so-and-so.\" But today after this Bill\r\n\r\ncomes  into force, would she dare to do  it,  when\r\n\r\nthat  woman can say, \"I have as much claim on that\r\n\r\nman  as  you  have. And the P.A.P. Government  say\r\n\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What has the S.P.A. done?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is not a question of\r\n\r\nlegislation. We cannot regulate the life of a  man\r\n\r\nand  his wife by legislation. It is education, it\r\n\r\nis  training, it is upbringing. It  is  the  home\r\n\r\nenvironment. It does not mean that, if we were  to\r\n\r\ntell a man before he steps into the home after his\r\n\r\nwork  just to kiss her, that his family life would\r\n\r\nbe  a happy life. It cannot be laid down that way.\r\n\r\nMarriage is a contract - that is quite rightly  said\r\n\r\nhere. But it is a contract which demands from both\r\n\r\nparties  understanding of  what  life  means;  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding that one must give to the other, and\r\n\r\nnot what one must take as much as one can from the\r\n\r\nother.  That  can never be legislated,  no  matter\r\n\r\nwhat  government  is in power. That  can  only  be\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  education.  And  that  can  be\r\n\r\nbrought about easily by mothers who look after the\r\n\r\nchildren and tell them, \"This is the thing that is\r\n\r\nexpected of you. When you grow up, when you marry,\r\n\r\nthis is what you should do.\" It is not for the law\r\n\r\nto say that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again, the P.A.P. say that it is by\r\n\r\nregistering   a  marriage  that  the   wife   gets\r\n\r\nprotection.  But,  as the Hon, the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinster  says,  even though the man registers  his\r\n\r\nmarriage,  there  is nothing to prevent  him  from\r\n\r\nkeeping  a  mistress outside. The only restriction\r\n\r\non  him is that he shall not have another woman of\r\n\r\nequal  legal  status. That is all. So  it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  the law says, \"Thou shall love thy  wife\"\r\n\r\nthat a man will always love his wife, it cannot be\r\n\r\ndone  that  way.  I have been married  many,  many\r\n\r\nyears,  and I know that we have ups and  downs  in\r\n\r\nmarried  life. But it always comes down  to  this,\r\n\r\nSir:  if there is real understanding, even  though\r\n\r\nmarriage  demands sacrifice from  both,  life  can\r\n\r\nalways  be  happy. Yet they say, \"With  this  law,\r\n\r\nwomen  can  indeed  be free from the  inequalities\r\n\r\nperpetrated  by men.\" But what are they  protected\r\n\r\nfrom?  What I can say is that under clause  45  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  brought up that a woman  shall  have  a\r\n\r\nlegal  right  and  a  legal  claim  on  the  man's\r\n\r\nproperty.  Can  the law prevent a man,  before  he\r\n\r\ndies, from saying to his wife, \"Here you are. Take\r\n\r\nall  this  that  I  have. I will  just  give  that\r\n\r\nmiserable house to you in my will.\" Where then  is\r\n\r\nthe  protection  for the wife  whose  marriage  is\r\n\r\nregistered?  All  this is just  trying  to  dangle\r\n\r\nsomething in front of the women and make them say,\r\n\r\n\"It  is  a  wonderful Bill!\" Women, I am sorry  to\r\n\r\nsay, and I am sure the men will have to admit  it,\r\n\r\nare  so  easily misguided, if men know how to  use\r\n\r\nsweet words. Just like this: \"Vote us in and  thou\r\n\r\nshalt  only have that husband to thyself.\" What  a\r\n\r\nbluff! Sir, it says here  - and I will go through it\r\n\r\nclause  by clause if I may. The most important  is\r\n\r\nclause 166, the gist of which says that every  man\r\n\r\nand  woman who have been married in Malaya  before\r\n\r\nthe  2nd of March, 1960, under any written law  in\r\n\r\nthe  State  must register. If my grandfather  were\r\n\r\nstill  alive,  he  might have to use  his  walking\r\n\r\nstick just for the pleasure of saying, \"Please,  I\r\n\r\nam  married. All my children are legitimate.\" Must\r\n\r\nyou ask an old man to go there and register? Or  a\r\n\r\nman  having  three wives. How do you want  him  to\r\n\r\nregister  with  the wives? If  he  has  a  special\r\n\r\npreference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  third wife, he will bring her along  and\r\n\r\nregister. Three days later, he might register  the\r\n\r\nsecond  wife,  and  finally, if he  remembers,  he\r\n\r\nmight  bring  his first wife. What  protection  is\r\n\r\nthere  for the first wife? And again, if the first\r\n\r\nwife  has  been  so angered and  so  hurt  by  the\r\n\r\nhusband, who has two other wives, would that first\r\n\r\nwife  willingly  say  to the  husband,  \"Come  on,\r\n\r\ndarling.  Let  us go and register and  be  married\r\n\r\nagain.\"  She might spit at the man and  say,  \"Get\r\n\r\nout of my house! I will not see you.\" How then can\r\n\r\nyou  effect the registration of marriage  of  that\r\n\r\nman   and  the  first  wife?  Where  then  is  the\r\n\r\nprotection for the woman? It is nothing  but  just\r\n\r\nthis carrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (2), Sir - I have been trying to read it\r\n\r\nand  trying  to  understand  it.  If  I  read   it\r\n\r\naright - and  I think I am right and it is  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to prove I am wrong - clause  4  (2)  says\r\n\r\nthat  if I have one wife and subsequent to 2nd  of\r\n\r\nMarch  1960, I cease to be married to her, then  I\r\n\r\ncan  marry again under any custom before this law.\r\n\r\nAnd  that is all right. But I cannot marry another\r\n\r\nwoman  up to the date of that marriage to  replace\r\n\r\nmy  wife. That is quite right. But then if  a  man\r\n\r\nwere  to  have three wives, then under  this  sub-\r\n\r\nclause  (2) of clause 4, he can say to one of  his\r\n\r\nwives,  \"Ah,  you  are a bit too  old.  Get  out!\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently he ceases to be married to that wife.\r\n\r\nThen  he  can, Sir, under this sub-clause, replace\r\n\r\nthis  wife  with another one, so that he  has  his\r\n\r\nfull  complement of three. That is what  this  law\r\n\r\nsays.  He  can  still have his full complement  of\r\n\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Change the law!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am glad that the Hon. the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has said that you can change\r\n\r\nthe  law.

The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment knows that there are so many people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today  who do not understand  English,\r\n\r\nand  yet  these  people have to  give  notice  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  And under clause 18, a person  has  the\r\n\r\nright to enter a caveat in case he feels that  he\r\n\r\nhas  some objection to any proposed marriage. But\r\n\r\nif  he does not understand English, how could  he\r\n\r\ngo  to the notice board and read and try to  find\r\n\r\nout  whether  his  son, or his  daughter  or  his\r\n\r\nnephew  is  proposing to get married  to  another\r\n\r\nperson?  Or  how can a woman find  out  from  the\r\n\r\nnotice  board that her husband is now  trying  to\r\n\r\nget   married  again  under  this  law?  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest,  Sir, that it would be very  helpful  to\r\n\r\nthe  people if other languages could be used, not\r\n\r\nonly English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some inconsistencies in the Bill,\r\n\r\nand I will not touch on them because the Bill  is\r\n\r\ngoing to a Select Committee. But I would like  to\r\n\r\ntouch  on the principles while I am here.  Clause\r\n\r\n23,  sub-clause  (7)  - this  is  the  solemnization\r\n\r\nprocedure. The couple appear before the Registrar\r\n\r\nwith  two credible witnesses. The Registrar  then\r\n\r\nsays  something and the parties shall  answer  in\r\n\r\nthe  affirmative. But further down,  because  the\r\n\r\nceremony  is  a  solemn one, it is required  that\r\n\r\neach  party  must make a solemn declaration.  And\r\n\r\nhere  again it is in English. But sub-clause  (7)\r\n\r\nsays,  so  long as someone explains  to  the  two\r\n\r\ncontracting   parties  in   the   language   they\r\n\r\nunderstand, that should be enough. They need  not\r\n\r\nhave to make the declaration in the language that\r\n\r\nthey  understand. Surely it is the  intention  to\r\n\r\nmake  it a solemn affair, to make it binding,  to\r\n\r\nmake  both  parties  feel that  that  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  event in their lives,  and  that  they\r\n\r\nshould be called upon to make the declaration  in\r\n\r\nthe language that they understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has touched on clause\r\n\r\n32.  This  is a bit complicated, and  I  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult to understand when a marriage is  valid\r\n\r\nand  when it is not valid. It does not mean  that\r\n\r\nit is valid if it is registered. It can mean that\r\n\r\nalthough  it  is  registered  it  can  still   be\r\n\r\ninvalid. And what is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose of registration? If after registration it\r\n\r\ndoes  not make it valid, other processes have  to\r\n\r\nbe  gone  through  before one can  claim  that  a\r\n\r\nmarriage  at the Registrar's office  is  a  valid\r\n\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now clause 39 says that a couple can get married\r\n\r\nby  a person who holds a licence. He need not be\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar or a Deputy Registrar.  But  then\r\n\r\nunder  clause 39 (1) , Sir, it is an  offence  if\r\n\r\nthat  person knowingly solemnizes the marriage - I\r\n\r\nread paragraph (c) Sir - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"after the expiration of three months from the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the  notice  of marriage  given  under\r\n\r\nsection 13 of this Ordinance,\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  is required under the Bill is that a couple\r\n\r\nproposing to get married shall give notice to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar. The Registrar shall put up the  notice\r\n\r\non  the  notice board for at least three  months.\r\n\r\nBut if the Registrar is satisfied, after 21 days,\r\n\r\nthat that marriage shall take place, he can,  but\r\n\r\nbefore  the expiration of three months,  issue  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  for  marriage. So if  the  Registrar\r\n\r\nwere  to  issue a certificate for marriage,  say,\r\n\r\nabout  80 days after the date of the notice,  and\r\n\r\nthe  couple  had  to  make arrangements  for  the\r\n\r\nmarriage  to  take place, and  the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nwedding  exceeded the three-month limit,  how  is\r\n\r\nthe  poor person who is licensed to solemnize the\r\n\r\nmarriage  to  know that he will be committing  an\r\n\r\noffence  if  he solemnizes it because  the  three\r\n\r\nmonths'  period  has expired?  I  think  what  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the man who holds  a  licence  to\r\n\r\nsolemnize the marriage is that it should be  only\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  him to receive a certificate  for\r\n\r\nmarriage.

Sir. The\r\n\r\nmost  important  clause of this  Bill  which  the\r\n\r\npublic  are  concerned about  is  clause  166 - the\r\n\r\ncompulsory registration of marriages, which  were\r\n\r\nnot  performed under any written law.  They  feel\r\n\r\nthat this law, if it is going to achieve anything\r\n\r\nis  only to protect those women who are the wives\r\n\r\nof  rich  men  or  men  with some  property.  The\r\n\r\nmajority  of married couples in Singapore  belong\r\n\r\nto   the  poorer  class  of  people.  There   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  no  question  of  property  involved.\r\n\r\nThere  is,  therefore, no question  of  the  wife\r\n\r\nwanting to claim the property of the husband when\r\n\r\nthe  husband dies. In cases of this kind, in poor\r\n\r\nfamilies,  when the husband dies, the  wife  will\r\n\r\nhave  to pawn something that she has in order  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  husband buried. Therefore, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  no compulsion about registration.  To\r\n\r\nthose  women who feel that they should have their\r\n\r\nrights  protected, it should be open to  them  to\r\n\r\nbring their husbands along and register. There is\r\n\r\nno  need for a poor farmer to bring his poor  and\r\n\r\naged  wife to the Registry just for the  pleasure\r\n\r\nof  having a marriage certificate. To them  their\r\n\r\nmarriage  is  not only legal, it is also  sacred.\r\n\r\nThat  piece of certificate is not going  to  make\r\n\r\nthem  any  the happier. Therefore, I  would  urge\r\n\r\nupon  the  Government to drop  this  question  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory registration. But if they do insist on\r\n\r\ncompulsory  registration, then  it  is  necessary\r\n\r\nthat  the fee should be a very small one so  that\r\n\r\neverybody can afford it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in this clause no grace given to a\r\n\r\nmarried  couple to register if a man is  sick  in\r\n\r\nbed  and could not get out of bed within one year\r\n\r\nto  have his marriage registered. Or if a man  is\r\n\r\naway  from the country on business, on study,  or\r\n\r\non  something  else, and cannot be back  in  time\r\n\r\nwithin  one year to have his marriage registered,\r\n\r\nthen  he is going to be punished. I submit,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  there should be a proviso whereby cases  of\r\n\r\nthis kind can be given grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I had not intended to speak on  the\r\n\r\nmotion,   but  after  having  endured  for   some\r\n\r\nconsiderable    time   the   irrelevancies    and\r\n\r\ntrivialities from the Member for Cairnhill -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Perhaps if the\r\n\r\nMinister will continue the debate on the  general\r\n\r\nmerits  and  principle of the Bill,  he  will  be\r\n\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I merely intended\r\n\r\nto make the point that I was moved to making this\r\n\r\nspeech  as  a result of the remarks made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of his speech, it was clear to\r\n\r\nme  that  the Member for Cairnhill was  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  a peculiar kind of obsession, and that  is,\r\n\r\nhow  the  Bill would affect the status  of  first\r\n\r\nwives vis-a-vis secondary wives, in the course of\r\n\r\nhis  address, he referred to this problem  on  no\r\n\r\nless than three occasions. First, he thought that\r\n\r\nthe first wives who might have considered getting\r\n\r\nsome   benefit  from  the  Bill  would  be  sadly\r\n\r\ndisillusioned, because all wives would be treated\r\n\r\nequally  under  the Bill. Then he  expressed  the\r\n\r\nview  that the man may want to register only  one\r\n\r\nof the younger wives and neglect the older wives.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, even when he came to the question of\r\n\r\nthe language used, he was concerned lest the wife\r\n\r\nwho  could  not read English would be  unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  out what the intentions of her husband were\r\n\r\nin regard to taking another wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill must have been\r\n\r\nmoving  for a long time in polygamous circles  to\r\n\r\nbe   so  well  acquainted  with  social  problems\r\n\r\nconfronting such families. And, of course, as  we\r\n\r\nall  know,  his  Party has the  support  of  many\r\n\r\nmillionaires who are habitually maintaining large\r\n\r\nfamilies  with several wives. But it is  not  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Women's Charter to give protection\r\n\r\nto wives or the first wife or families of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillionaires. If this problem is still exercising\r\n\r\nthe mind of the Member for Cairnhill, perhaps  he\r\n\r\ncan  move a private Bill designed to protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests of first wives of millionaires. But the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter tries to bring about  more  than\r\n\r\njust monogamous marriages. In other parts of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  there  is  a procedure  set  out  for  the\r\n\r\nregulating of disputes, for the protection of the\r\n\r\nrights  of  children,  and for  divorce.  By  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  this  does represent a major  advance  in\r\n\r\nsocial legislation, not only in this country, but\r\n\r\nperhaps in the whole region of South-east Asia. 1\r\n\r\ndo  take grave objection to the reference by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill that this Bill is  no  more\r\n\r\nthan  the carrot dangled before the donkeys.

Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  the  Member for Mountbatten  express\r\n\r\ngreat  distress that there was no  expression  of\r\n\r\nour  belief that women should get equal pay  with\r\n\r\nmen,  that  women  should have  the  same  social\r\n\r\nadvantages   as   men.  We  can  understand   her\r\n\r\ndistress, since everybody knows that she  is  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Pan-Pacific Women's League, which\r\n\r\nis  an agency of the United Nations. But in  that\r\n\r\nsituation  she  has lost sight of  the  important\r\n\r\nthing that this Bill really does for the women of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the greater\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  population  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nChinese and that, by their personal law, they are\r\n\r\nable   to  contract  polygamous  marriages.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this Bill is making a  very  great\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  personal lives  of  the  greater\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our citizens. It marks  a  complete\r\n\r\nbreak from the past and it is a big step forward.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  just for that reason  that  we  have\r\n\r\nthought it important that we consider this  piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation as something outside the ordinary\r\n\r\nstream of legislation that we consider it to  be,\r\n\r\nin  the real sense of the word, a Charter for the\r\n\r\nwomen of our State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have considered this to be\r\n\r\na Charter for these reasons: One, that it makes a\r\n\r\ngreat  change in the personal law of the  greater\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our citizens; the next  thing,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is that this Bill seeks to place on\r\n\r\none  common  register  all marriages  which  take\r\n\r\nplace  in  our State. Hitherto, there  have  been\r\n\r\nmarriages,  which  have  been  registered  on   a\r\n\r\nspecial register governing the registration of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian  marriages. There have also been  other\r\n\r\nregisters  for  monogamous marriages  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen   contracted   under  the   Civil   Marriage\r\n\r\nOrdinance. We propose in this Bill, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  bring  on  to  a  common  register  all\r\n\r\nmarriages in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the laws affecting women and\r\n\r\nchildren   are   spread  widely  throughout   our\r\n\r\nlegislation,  and  it  needs  the  training   and\r\n\r\nexperience of a lawyer to find one's way  through\r\n\r\nthat  mass  of legislation. We thought that  this\r\n\r\nwould be an excellent opportunity to collect  all\r\n\r\nsuch legislations together, to improve on them as\r\n\r\nfar  as  we  can, and then put them in  this  one\r\n\r\ncompendious    and   comprehensive    piece    of\r\n\r\nlegislation which we have thought fit to call the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been a lot of\r\n\r\ncriticisms on various clauses in this Bill.  They\r\n\r\narise  not because there are faults in this Bill,\r\n\r\nbut  because the Members opposite have not  given\r\n\r\nthis  Bill the attention that it really deserves.\r\n\r\nLet  me  deal with the criticisms that have  been\r\n\r\nmade of the various clauses of this Bill. Let  me\r\n\r\ntake what the Member for Mountbatten has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has expressed great surprise that although\r\n\r\nunder  clause  166  of this Bill  all  polygamous\r\n\r\nmarriages  which have taken place before  2nd  of\r\n\r\nMarch  are  required to be registered why  is  it\r\n\r\nthen that clause 32 provides that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing in this Ordinance or rules made\r\n\r\nthereunder shall be construed to render valid  or\r\n\r\ninvalid  merely by reason of its having  been  or\r\n\r\nnot  having  been registered any  marriage  which\r\n\r\notherwise is invalid or valid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, it would be quite impossible\r\n\r\nfor  any  legislation  to  provide  that  when  a\r\n\r\nmarriage   is  registered,  it  must  necessarily\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  a valid marriage; and  that  if  a\r\n\r\nmarriage is not registered, then it follows  from\r\n\r\nthat  that  it  is  not  a  valid  marriage.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, touching on this point, it looks as\r\n\r\nif  the  Member  for Mountbatten  has  failed  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  clause  166 of  this  Bill.  In  that\r\n\r\nclause it is clearly stated that where there is a\r\n\r\ndispute  as to a marriage, then that dispute  can\r\n\r\nbe  referred to the Registrar for a decision; and\r\n\r\nif the party is still dissatisfied, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe or she can take the matter further to the High\r\n\r\nCourt  for a decision. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have\r\n\r\nwritten  those provisions into the law to provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  case  like this, where,  say,  a  husband\r\n\r\nbrings   a  wife  to  be  registered  under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this clause. It may turn out  that,\r\n\r\nin  fact, he is not married to her. A case  might\r\n\r\nalso  arise  where a man might bring  his  second\r\n\r\nwife  to  be  registered. The  first  wife  might\r\n\r\nchallenge  the marriage of the second wife.  Both\r\n\r\nthese  cases  could  be  challenged  under  these\r\n\r\nprovisions of the law, so that in either case, if\r\n\r\nthere  has been a challenge and if the matter  in\r\n\r\ndispute has been decided by the Registrar in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance, or by the High  Court  Judge  on\r\n\r\nappeal,  then  there would have been  a  decision\r\n\r\nmade as to the validity of each marriage. This is\r\n\r\nprovided for in clause 166. So that is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we have found it necessary to provide  that,\r\n\r\nunless  the procedure that is open to the parties\r\n\r\nwhen  there is a dispute under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause 166 is followed, registration as such does\r\n\r\nnot  under  clause  32  in  any  way  affect  the\r\n\r\nvalidity or invalidity of a marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned the case of a man who is  already\r\n\r\nmarried under Chinese customary law leaving  this\r\n\r\ncountry  and  going abroad and marrying  a  young\r\n\r\nEuropean  girl.  She asked,  what  would  be  the\r\n\r\nposition of the principal wife in that case?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  if that should happen,  this  law\r\n\r\nitself  would  safeguard  the  position  of   the\r\n\r\nprincipal wife. All that she has to do is to  get\r\n\r\nherself  placed on the register and she  will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised   as   that  man's  wife   under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nalso referred to clause 35 of the Bill. She says,\r\n\r\n\"Woe  betide  all mothers here in Singapore  once\r\n\r\nthis   clause   becomes  law.  They   will   lose\r\n\r\npossession  of all their daughters  and  you  can\r\n\r\nexpect the worst once this clause is enacted into\r\n\r\nlaw.\"  Let  us look at this clause, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. What does it say? It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any person who uses any force or threat-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to\r\n\r\ncompel a person to marry against his will; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to prevent a person who has attained the\r\n\r\nage of twenty-one years from\r\n\r\ncontracting a valid marriage,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall  be guilty of an offence and shall be liable\r\n\r\non conviction to [penalties].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  is wrong with that clause? Should it not  be\r\n\r\nenacted  as  law  that any person  who  forces  or\r\n\r\nthreatens any person to marry against his  or  her\r\n\r\nwill  should be subject to penalties? Surely  that\r\n\r\nis  a  reasonable proposition. It does not deprive\r\n\r\nmothers  of  the  custody of their  daughters.  It\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any person who uses any force or threat-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to prevent a person who has attained\r\n\r\nthe age of twenty-one years from contracting\r\n\r\na valid marriage, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall be guilty of an offence...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  a  daughter is 21 years old, she has  got  the\r\n\r\nright  to decide her own future. This law provides\r\n\r\nfor  parental consent in the case of marriages  of\r\n\r\nminors  who  are between the ages of  18  and  21.\r\n\r\nClearly, the Member for Mountbatten has shown that\r\n\r\nshe   has  not  taken  the  trouble  to  read  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill. If she had done  so,  she\r\n\r\nwould  never  have  made that suggestion  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been suggestions\r\n\r\nthat,  as a result of clause 166, the position  of\r\n\r\nprincipal  wives  is going to  be  depressed,  and\r\n\r\nmistresses, concubines and prostitutes  are  going\r\n\r\nto  reap  the benefit from this legislation.  Sir,\r\n\r\nsurely that could not be submitted to be so by the\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite  if they had  really  taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to  read this Bill. I have  explained  to\r\n\r\nthem just now that under clause 166, it is already\r\n\r\nprovided that where the parties appear before  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  and  if  there is  any  dispute  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether they were, in fact, married, that issue of\r\n\r\nfact  can  be tried by the Registrar. If they  are\r\n\r\nstill  dissatisfied  with  the  decision  of   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar,  it goes to the High Court  on  appeal.\r\n\r\nAll that is provided for in this legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Mountbatten started talking\r\n\r\nabout  the  fees,  and  soon.  She  said,  in  all\r\n\r\nsincerity,  that she believed that the  Government\r\n\r\nwas going to charge a fee of $20. I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  where she got that information from. We  are\r\n\r\nstill considering these matters. These are matters\r\n\r\nof  detail, but I am very surprised to  know  that\r\n\r\nshe  has  a  fixation in her  mind  that  the  fee\r\n\r\ncharged is going to be $20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will go on to consider the\r\n\r\nobjections of the Member for Farrer Park.  He  has\r\n\r\ntaken exception to one clause of the Bill - clause 3\r\n\r\n(2).  He says that the exemption here only applies\r\n\r\nto Muslims who are married under the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims  Ordinance, 1957,  implying  that  it\r\n\r\nwould be possible under this Bill for Muslims, who\r\n\r\nare  not  married  under the  provisions  of  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance, to contract a marriage under this Bill.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker,. Sir, if he had taken the trouble  to\r\n\r\nlook  at clause 16 of this Bill, he will find that\r\n\r\nbefore any marriage can be solemnized, it will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary for the parties to produce a certificate\r\n\r\nof   marriage.  It  is  stated  there   what   the\r\n\r\nconditions are before a certificate of marriage is\r\n\r\nissued.  One of the conditions there is that  they\r\n\r\nmust swear a declaration to the effect:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that neither of the parties to the intended\r\n\r\nmarriage  is  married under any law, religion,\r\n\r\ncustom  or usage to any person other  than  the\r\n\r\nperson  with whom such marriage is proposed  to\r\n\r\nbe contracted:\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf   a  Muslim  who  was  married  not  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Muslims Ordinance but under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Muslim law in  the  Federation\r\n\r\ncomes  here  and tries to contract a marriage,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have to swear a declaration that he is  not\r\n\r\nalready married under any law, religion, custom or\r\n\r\nusage. If he makes a false declaration, then he is\r\n\r\nsubject to penalties for doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  has  given this  Bill  very  close\r\n\r\nscrutiny  and  he has decided now that  there  are\r\n\r\nonly  two  new  clauses  in  this  Bill.  He   has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that these two new clauses are  clauses\r\n\r\n45  and 166. Sir, we of the P.A.P. Government  are\r\n\r\nnot people who try to hide things from the public.\r\n\r\nWith  this  Bill  we  have taken  the  trouble  to\r\n\r\npublish  a  comparative table showing the  sources\r\n\r\nfrom which we have obtained the various clauses of\r\n\r\nthis Bill. If the Member for Farrer Park had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  the trouble to count the clauses here which\r\n\r\nwe have acknowledged to be new, then he would have\r\n\r\nfound that they all add up to 13 new clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he has dealt particularly with\r\n\r\nclause  45.  He says that clause 45  is  making  a\r\n\r\nradical  change in the law and is unknown  in  any\r\n\r\nlegislation. I would advise him that clause 45  is\r\n\r\ntaken  from the Swiss Civil Code and it  has  been\r\n\r\nconsidered by eminent jurists before. And he says,\r\n\r\n\"Look  at clause 45 (1). Now everybody knows  that\r\n\r\nthe duty of a husband is to maintain his wife. And\r\n\r\nhere  it  says  that  the  duty  for  caring   and\r\n\r\nproviding  for the children is now placed  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders of both husband and wife.\" Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it is true, in our experience, that  when  a\r\n\r\nhusband  is unemployed or is unable to  work,  the\r\n\r\nduty  of maintaining that home falls on the woman,\r\n\r\nparticularly if she is able to work and she is, in\r\n\r\nfact, working. What is wrong with that? As far  as\r\n\r\nthe  duty of the husband to maintain his  wife  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, we have strengthened the law,  so  that\r\n\r\nif  the hon. Member had only taken the trouble  to\r\n\r\nlook  at clause 62 of the Bill, he would have seen\r\n\r\nthe  way in which we have strengthened that  duty.\r\n\r\nWe have said that if a husband has ill-treated his\r\n\r\nwife  and  his children and he has been  convicted\r\n\r\nfor  doing so; if he has deserted his wife; if  he\r\n\r\nhas  neglected  to provide reasonable  maintenance\r\n\r\nfor her and his children; if he has treated her or\r\n\r\nany  of  his  children with cruelty; if  he  is  a\r\n\r\nhabitual  drunkard; or if he is living in adultery\r\n\r\nwith  another  woman; he would then be  liable  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  his  wife.  Under the  present  law,  as\r\n\r\neverybody  knows,  before  a  woman  can   get   a\r\n\r\nmaintenance order against her husband,  she  would\r\n\r\nhave to prove her case; and if the husband says to\r\n\r\nthe  Court, \"In spite of what has happened,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take her back,\" the moment  he  does\r\n\r\nthat,  then  she  is  deprived  of  an  order   of\r\n\r\nmaintenance. Now we have changed the law here.  We\r\n\r\nhave given her an absolute right to maintenance in\r\n\r\nthese circumstances. Surely we have not in any way\r\n\r\nchanged  the  duties in matrimonial relationships.\r\n\r\nThe hon. Member does not follow clause 45 (2) when\r\n\r\nhe asks, \"Why should it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  that  the husband and the wife shall have  the\r\n\r\nright  separately  to  engage  in  any  trade   or\r\n\r\nprofession or in social activities?\" Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  asks, \"Well, what do \"social activities\"\r\n\r\nmean?\"  Now  if  a  wife wants to  play  rnahjong,\r\n\r\nsurely   the  playing  of  mahjong  is  a   social\r\n\r\nactivity.  I  suggest  that is  just  a  frivolous\r\n\r\nargument.  Although  the  husband  and  wife   are\r\n\r\nassociated  in  a  matrimonial  home,   they   are\r\n\r\nindividuals   and   therefore   they    can,    as\r\n\r\nindividuals,  engage  in trades  and  professions.\r\n\r\nThey   form  a  family  unit  and  they  are  also\r\n\r\nassociated as a family unit in society.  All  that\r\n\r\nthis  provision says is that it would not be right\r\n\r\nfor  a  husband to place restrictions on the  wife\r\n\r\ntaking  part in social activities. What  is  wrong\r\n\r\nwith that? That would be a very sensible thing  to\r\n\r\nintroduce in a Bill like this, particularly  in  a\r\n\r\nChapter, which deals with the rights and duties of\r\n\r\nhusband and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member says that, as clause 45 (3)\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The wife shall have the right to use her own\r\n\r\nsurname and name separately.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>he has no quarrel with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to clause 45 (4) and he says that\r\n\r\nthat introduces a novel provision of law. The sub-\r\n\r\nclause reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The husband and the wife shall have equal\r\n\r\nrights in the running of the matrimonial household\r\n\r\nand  in the ownership and management of the family\r\n\r\nproperties.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  the Member  for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nobviously   does  not  pay  due  regard   to   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 48 of the Bill. Clause 48 re-enacts  what is the present law, that  whatever  a\r\n\r\nwoman  has which belongs to her before she marries\r\n\r\ncontinues to be her separate property on marriage,\r\n\r\nand  that  after marriage, if she engages  in  any\r\n\r\ntrade or occupation or employment and acquires new\r\n\r\nproperty,  that  property which she  has  acquired\r\n\r\nafter  marriage  shall  continue  to  be  her  own\r\n\r\nseparate  property. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  there  are\r\n\r\nsituations  where a husband and wife  can  acquire\r\n\r\nfamily  property, and it would not  be  right  for\r\n\r\neither  of them to regard it as property which  is\r\n\r\ntheir  own  and distinct from the family property.\r\n\r\nThat is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsort  of  thing that this clause deals  with.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir, this is the sort of criticism  that\r\n\r\nwe have from the Front Bench opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has also not treated\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Bill in the way that  they\r\n\r\nought  to  have been treated. He has  charged  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  introducing  legislation,  which\r\n\r\nwill  enable prostitutes to be classed in the same\r\n\r\ncategory   as   married  women.   Surely,   as   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  member  of the  community,  he  could\r\n\r\nnever have made such a charge if he had taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to read the provisions of this  Bill.  He\r\n\r\nhas said that education, and not law, will achieve\r\n\r\nthe  purposes  that we have in mind. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, why was it necessary then that we should have\r\n\r\nthese  provisions in clause 166? Are we trying  to\r\n\r\ninflict  hardship on our women? Are  we  going  to\r\n\r\nmake  things more difficult for them?  If  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to introduce a law governing monogamy,  the\r\n\r\nonly way that we can introduce it and be sure that\r\n\r\nthere is monogamy is to provide, at the same time,\r\n\r\na   system   of  registration  for  all   existing\r\n\r\nmarriages.   We   have  heard   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  say  that  the  polygamous  marriages\r\n\r\nwhich  have taken place under local Chinese custom\r\n\r\nare of various kinds. She has referred to some  as\r\n\r\n\"joss-stick  marriages\" and she has called  others\r\n\r\nmore important marriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we legislate that from the\r\n\r\n2nd  of  March any person who has previously  been\r\n\r\nmarried  cannot take unto himself a  second  wife,\r\n\r\nand   merely  legislate  it  in  that  way,   what\r\n\r\nguarantee have we that there would be monogamy  in\r\n\r\nour  State?  It  is  always a disputable  question\r\n\r\nwhether  a person who has been married to four  or\r\n\r\nfive  wives  under the local Chinese custom  would\r\n\r\nconsider  those marriages to be binding marriages.\r\n\r\nA rich man with four or five wives might, if he is\r\n\r\nnot  required  to register, very well  contract  a\r\n\r\nmarriage under this law. He may say, \"Well,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  regard those marriages as marriages  at  all.\r\n\r\nThey were joss stick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarriages.\" We cannot have that situation  happen.\r\n\r\nI  do  agree, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us  to  make  provision  for   the\r\n\r\nregistration of these marriages in such a  way  as\r\n\r\nnot  to cause any hardship to the community.  That\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  of detail, which the Government  is\r\n\r\nlooking into very seriously now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the period of grace referred to by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill. We realise  that  the\r\n\r\nperiod of one year may be too short a period. That\r\n\r\nis why we have thought it necessary that this Bill\r\n\r\nshould be referred to a Select Committee, so  that\r\n\r\nprovisions  like this could be looked  at  with  a\r\n\r\nview to improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nalso  referred to clause 4, sub-clause (2) of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  I really fail to understand what difficulty\r\n\r\nhe  has  seen in this clause. All that the  clause\r\n\r\nsays  is that on the 2nd of March, say, a man  has\r\n\r\nbeen married under local Chinese custom to one  or\r\n\r\nmore  spouses.  Then after that date  he  suddenly\r\n\r\nceases  to  be  married  to  any  such  spouse  or\r\n\r\nspouses. And if he contracts a marriage after that\r\n\r\ndate,  then  that  marriage will be  a  monogamous\r\n\r\nmarriage.  That is all that it says, and  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat  it  must say. It is as simple as  all  that.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difficulty? It is so reasonable and so\r\n\r\nlogical  and  so  sensible that I cannot  see  any\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  it  myself.  One  cannot  see  any\r\n\r\ndifficulty  unless one wants to see the difficulty\r\n\r\nin this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 23 (7). This is the form of the\r\n\r\nmarriage ceremony. The Member for Cairnhill  finds\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in understanding why it  is  necessary\r\n\r\nthat  if the parties do not understand the English\r\n\r\nlanguage,  it  will be necessary for  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage to be interpreted to the parties. Is this\r\n\r\na  difficulty?  If  these declarations  and  these\r\n\r\nforms  are  to  be used, it will be  necessary  to\r\n\r\nexplain  them  fully to those who  participate  in\r\n\r\nthis  ceremony  in  the language they  understand.\r\n\r\nThat is all that it provides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nasks  me to explain to this House why it was  that\r\n\r\nlong  before this Bill was introduced to the House\r\n\r\n(the \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwords  are  \"long before\") he had read  the  main\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this Bill in the local newspapers.\r\n\r\nIf  he  had  only taken the trouble  to  look  at\r\n\r\nclause 4 (1) he would have read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every person who on the 2nd day of March, 1960,\r\n\r\nis  lawfully  married under  any  law,  religion,\r\n\r\ncustom  or usage to one or more spouses shall  be\r\n\r\nincapable,   during  the  continuance   of   such\r\n\r\nmarriage  or  marriages of  contracting  a  valid\r\n\r\nmarriage under any law, religion, custom or usage\r\n\r\nwith  any  person  other  than  such  spouse   or\r\n\r\nspouses.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, this Bill was introduced on the\r\n\r\n2nd of March. Those newspaper reports appeared on\r\n\r\nthe  1st  of March. This Bill makes it an offence\r\n\r\nfor  any  person  who was already married  under,\r\n\r\nsay,  Chinese customary law, to marry again after\r\n\r\nthe  2nd  of  March. It was necessary that  great\r\n\r\npublicity  be  given to this fact,  because  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  making a very important change  in  our\r\n\r\nlaw.  The  operative date was the date  on  which\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  was  introduced into the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and it was necessary, therefore,  that\r\n\r\nadvance  notice  of  that be  given.  It  is  the\r\n\r\npractice  in  this Legislative  Assembly  not  to\r\n\r\npublish details of Bills unless and until  copies\r\n\r\nof the Bill are first circulated to hon. Members.\r\n\r\nBut  in  this  case,  it was quite  an  important\r\n\r\nannouncement and it was very necessary  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  should  have had advance  notice  of  the\r\n\r\nfact.   And  the  advance  notice  was  the   day\r\n\r\nbefore - not  \"long  before\",  as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park stated here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are matters, which I\r\n\r\nwould   otherwise  have  dealt  with  in   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  but  I  have  been  forced  into  the\r\n\r\nposition  where  I have had to  deal  with  these\r\n\r\nrepresentations, when the principle of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nis  debated. I would say again, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  if  they had considered this Bill to  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  important  Bill, then they would  not  have\r\n\r\nadopted  the attitude they had adopted when  this\r\n\r\nBill  was  under  debate. In the  past,  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  other Bills and have been accused  of\r\n\r\nspringing     surprises    on    them - introducing\r\n\r\namendments  just  before  the  Bill  was  to   be\r\n\r\ndebated. But in this case, the Bill has  been  in\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossession since the 2nd of March, and they  have\r\n\r\nhad  ample  time  to study it. And  if  they  had\r\n\r\nreally  taken the trouble to read this  Bill  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  I am sure they  would  not  have\r\n\r\ndealt  with  it in as light-hearted a  manner  as\r\n\r\nthey had done this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect, I would say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government do not claim that they  are\r\n\r\nperfect  and that they are introducing a  perfect\r\n\r\nBill. But we are trying very hard to do something\r\n\r\nfor  the  people of Singapore. We are  castigated\r\n\r\nand  are  said to be dangling carrots before  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  But  we have been in  politics  only\r\n\r\nvery recently. The Members opposite, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, have been in politics for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nNow,  if  they had any regard for the  rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen,  they  would have done this on  their  own\r\n\r\nbefore.  Because  of  their  past  neglect,  they\r\n\r\njumped  upon  us just now. We are  interested  in\r\n\r\ndoing  what they had failed to do. I do say,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that this Bill  is  an  important\r\n\r\npiece of legislation. It will do for the women in\r\n\r\nour  community what no other piece of legislation\r\n\r\ncan  do. It is no use thinking in terms of  high-sounding  phrases  in  legislation  if  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant thing is not done first, and  that  is,\r\n\r\nif  a  woman who is the mistress of her home  and\r\n\r\nqueen of her home is made to share that home with\r\n\r\nanother  woman.  If  that  is  so  and  if   that\r\n\r\nsituation  is  allowed to continue, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, it is meaningless and sheer nonsense to talk\r\n\r\nabout  the rights of women. And I do say that  we\r\n\r\nare, in fact, asking the House today to approve a\r\n\r\nvery important piece of legislation which we can,\r\n\r\nin  all  modesty, claim to be a charter  for  the\r\n\r\nwomen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker as Chairman and seven other  Members\r\n\r\nto be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

The  proposed amendments to the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nextends the provisions of the Ordinance to  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the person has been convicted on  a  trial\r\n\r\nbefore  the High Court without a jury.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nalso   amends   the  Court  of  Criminal   Appeal\r\n\r\nOrdinance to provide for a reference of points of\r\n\r\nlaw to the Court of Criminal Appeal in case of an\r\n\r\nacquittal  by the High Court in the  exercise  of\r\n\r\nits  original criminal jurisdiction,  and  for  a\r\n\r\nreference to the Court of Criminal Appeal  of  an\r\n\r\nappeal  on  the grounds of public interest  where\r\n\r\nthe   High  Court  has  upheld  or  reversed  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  subordinate court.  These  new\r\n\r\nprovisions  are taken from the Federation  Courts\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill was referred to and was supported by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Bar Committee, but since the  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  published, it has been represented that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  new section 19B of the Ordinance  might\r\n\r\ncause  hardship to an accused person,  as  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  that  he  may  be  acquitted   by   the\r\n\r\nsubordinate  court, have his acquittal  confirmed\r\n\r\nby  the High Court, but nevertheless be convicted\r\n\r\nand sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a person is acquitted on a trial before\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court, there is no appeal against  the\r\n\r\nacquittal.

But the Court  of\r\n\r\nCriminal Appeal will in such a case have power to\r\n\r\ndeliver  a merely declaratory judgment.

But, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the issues involved are so vital  to\r\n\r\nthe  life of the people in the State of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat I feel that the amendments have to be moved,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  hope  that when the  Government  side\r\n\r\nappreciates  the issues involved, it  will  treat\r\n\r\nthe arguments with every consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Bill is presented, it implies that\r\n\r\nthe  status  of the University of Malaya  has  so\r\n\r\ndeclined  that the Government is not  willing  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  University the same rights  as  it  is\r\n\r\ngiving to the Trades Union Congress in Singapore;\r\n\r\nthat   is,  the  right  to  nominate  their   own\r\n\r\nrepresentative  on the Adult Education  Board.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the Government realises that,  by\r\n\r\ndoing so, it is going to give a slap in the  face\r\n\r\nof  the  University of Malaya, and it will  be  a\r\n\r\nshock to those who believe that the University of\r\n\r\nMalaya   should  have  the  right   to   nominate\r\n\r\nwhomsoever  it  will to represent itself  on  any\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope, Sir, that the Government appreciates\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  the  issue.  Otherwise,  why\r\n\r\nshould there be this difference in procedure with\r\n\r\nregard  to the appointment of a member  from  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya  and  two  members  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the Minister on the nomination  of\r\n\r\nthe  Trades Union Congress in Singapore? On  what\r\n\r\nbasis  is the Singapore T.U.C. considered  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  responsible  and  more  reliable  than  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which is very, important in the\r\n\r\neyes  of the public concerns the autonomy of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity   of   Malaya.  In  every   democratic\r\n\r\ncountry, which is a free country, a university in\r\n\r\nthat   country   is  always  considered   to   be\r\n\r\nautonomous. Therefore, not to give the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya the right to  nominate  its\r\n\r\nrepresentative  will  give  credence  to  reports\r\n\r\ncirculating   that  because  the  Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore gives large subsidies to the University\r\n\r\nof   Malaya,  therefore,  the  autonomy  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  going to be impaired,  and  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  and  more  interference  in   the\r\n\r\nappointments  and promotions of  members  of  the\r\n\r\nstaff  of  the  University.

Sir,  I  do\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government will think it over and,\r\n\r\nin order to silence the criticisms and remove the\r\n\r\nfears of the people who are concerned about  this\r\n\r\nautonomy  of  the University, it will  allow  the\r\n\r\nsame rights to the University of Malaya as it has\r\n\r\nallowed to the Singapore Trades Union Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether it will be\r\n\r\nconvenient  for  hon.

Member  for Tanglin served as a  Member,  we\r\n\r\nwill  find  that  he  was  unable  to  forget  the\r\n\r\nconditioning  of  his own mind over  a  period  of\r\n\r\ntime. It is unnecessary for me to repeat all  that\r\n\r\nwas  said  by him and my reply on the question  of\r\n\r\nnomination,  and whether the nominee is  a  rubber\r\n\r\nstamp.  I  think  a  lot  depends  on  whether   a\r\n\r\nparticular person serves as a nominee of  Colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment or as a nominee of a popularly  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The hon. Member for Tanglin  has  had\r\n\r\nthe  experience  of being a rubber  stamp  in  the\r\n\r\npast - and  a very battered one at that.  Those  who\r\n\r\nare   prepared  to  serve  as  nominees  under   a\r\n\r\npopularly elected Government would consider it  an\r\n\r\nhonour to serve as such, because the new popularly\r\n\r\nelected  Government,  as  representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  have  a  high regard for their  standing,\r\n\r\ntheir  integrity and their capability  to  produce\r\n\r\nwork for the Government. Therefore, far from there\r\n\r\nbeing a smear that they are rubber-stamps, it  is,\r\n\r\non the other hand, a compliment to them because it\r\n\r\nshows that they are men of stature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin now raises the question\r\n\r\nof  the autonomy of the University of Malaya. Only\r\n\r\na few days ago, the Prime Minister had to say that\r\n\r\nthe University of Malaya is still unfortunately  a\r\n\r\nColonial  university. Let it  also  be  said  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  many people holding high positions  in\r\n\r\norganisations  existing today who  really  do  not\r\n\r\ndeserve to be on them. That is why it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  this  new Government to decide on nominations\r\n\r\nand  not  to  leave that to the tender mercies  of\r\n\r\nsuch  organisations. In practice, it will  be  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the  Minister consulting  the  principal\r\n\r\nexecutive officer of the institution concerned, be\r\n\r\nit the University of Malaya or Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  present Government of Singapore considers  it\r\n\r\nnecessary, in the case of Nanyang University, that\r\n\r\nthere    should    be   thorough   reorganisation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  deeply  regretted   that   the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment from the Member for Tanglin  is\r\n\r\nnot  acceptable to the Government side.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nall  we  need say is this: there is an old saying,\r\n\r\n\"Old  dogs  are unable to learn new tricks.\"  What\r\n\r\nhas  been  put  forward by  the  hon.

If\r\n\r\ntoday  there  have  been slight changes  here  and\r\n\r\nthere, it is a case of the barking dog, which does\r\n\r\nnot bite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Member to keep to\r\n\r\nthe  point  of his amendments, and not  embark  on\r\n\r\nirrelevancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, if it is important that at\r\n\r\nthe  present  stage nominees from the Universities\r\n\r\nmust be nominated by the Government and not by the\r\n\r\nUniversities,  I  think there  is  no  purpose  in\r\n\r\nputting  down here that one member to be appointed\r\n\r\nby the Minister should be among the tutorial staff\r\n\r\nof  the  University  of Malaya in  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nanother  member  to be appointed by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfrom   among   the  tutorial  staff   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  in Singapore. We may as well  have  it\r\n\r\nclearly stated that two members would be appointed\r\n\r\nby  the Minister from the educational bodies. That\r\n\r\nwould  cover  the same point. But the  moment  the\r\n\r\nUniversities  are mentioned, naturally  one  would\r\n\r\nexpect  that they would be accorded the  right  to\r\n\r\nnominate  their  own  representatives.   That   is\r\n\r\nnatural and logical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nThio Chan Bee -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, lines 29 and 30, to leave out \"from\r\n\r\namong the tutorial staff\" and insert \"on the\r\n\r\nnomination\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it the hon.
