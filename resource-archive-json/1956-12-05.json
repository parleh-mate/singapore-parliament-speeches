Member\r\n\r\nmentioned  in the Assembly in November 1955,  when\r\n\r\nhe  told  us  that the object was  to  demonstrate\r\n\r\nwhether  the flood waters from the Alexandra  area\r\n\r\ncould flow westward into the Ulu Pandan valley. As\r\n\r\nregards  that scheme, I think it is only  a  pilot\r\n\r\ncanal  that  was dug on the westward side  of  the\r\n\r\nBuona  Vista  road  and  railway;  obviously   the\r\n\r\nAlexandra water cannot flow down on the other side\r\n\r\nof  the road and railway. It has to be taken  past\r\n\r\nthe  road  and railway which at present we  cannot\r\n\r\ndo.  If the flood waters of the Alexandra area are\r\n\r\nto  be carried out to the westward through the Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan channel, which is the right solution,  then\r\n\r\nit  will be necessary for three high velocity  box\r\n\r\nculverts  to be installed under the road  and  the\r\n\r\nrailway   embankments.

But  this\r\n\r\nhas only achieved segregation and has not provided\r\n\r\nadequately for any reformative training, nor  have\r\n\r\nthe courts at present power to sentence people  to\r\n\r\nreformative training. It is high time that we did\r\n\r\nmake   proper   provision  for   the   enlightened\r\n\r\ntreatment of this age group 16 to 21. This  is  an\r\n\r\nage at which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority  are likely to respond to expert  efforts\r\n\r\nto  reclaim  them from crime and to  prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom becoming criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development programme provides for building a\r\n\r\nnew  Borstal  Institution and in  our  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates for next year we have entered a vote  of\r\n\r\n$1,000  for  preliminary work  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nbuilding  a new Borstal Institution to  house  300\r\n\r\npersons.  But  we  can  make a  start  immediately\r\n\r\nwithout  waiting  for the new  building.  The  old\r\n\r\nremand  prison  at Outram Road  Prison  has  been\r\n\r\nseparated from the rest of the prison and  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  converted  so  that it can  be  used  for  a\r\n\r\nreformative  training centre. It will  accommodate\r\n\r\n120  boys.  Staff can be found from  the  existing\r\n\r\nprison  staff,  and  again in the  1957  Estimates\r\n\r\nrecently approved by this Assembly, provision  was\r\n\r\nmade for the necessary funds to pay the staff  and\r\n\r\nto  run  a  reformative centre in the Outram  Road\r\n\r\nPrison. I am sure that this legislation will  have\r\n\r\nthe support of all of us in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill gives the High Court and District\r\n\r\nCourts  power  to pass a sentence  of  reformative\r\n\r\ntraining  for young males between the ages  of  16\r\n\r\nand  21,  and it also enables Magistrates'  Courts\r\n\r\nand  Juvenile  Courts to send up to  the  District\r\n\r\nCourts   appropriate  cases   for   sentences   of\r\n\r\nreformative  training. In each case the  Court  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  satisfy  itself  that  the  boy   is\r\n\r\nsuitable  for reformative training, and  clause  3\r\n\r\n(5)   and  (6)  on pages 2 and 3 of the Bill  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   great  care  is  taken  in  assessing   the\r\n\r\nsuitability of each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important principle in this Bill is that it\r\n\r\nprovides  for  flexibility which is  necessary  in\r\n\r\nthese cases. Prisoners do not remain tidily in one\r\n\r\nage  group  during the period of their  sentences,\r\n\r\nnor  will they all respond in the same way to  the\r\n\r\nreformative  treatment.  One  may  be  ready   for\r\n\r\nrelease  much earlier than another,  and  what  is\r\n\r\ndecisive in this Borstal System is not so much the\r\n\r\ngravity  of  the  offence for which  the  lad  was\r\n\r\nconvicted, but the reformation of the boy.  So  it\r\n\r\nis  that the Courts are not empowered to impose  a\r\n\r\nperiod in sentencing a person to reformative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining  under  this Bill. The  law  provides  in\r\n\r\nclause  2  merely  for a sentence  of  reformative\r\n\r\ntraining.  The  actual  period  in  each  case  is\r\n\r\ndecided later by the Visiting Justices as  is  set\r\n\r\nout  in  detail in Schedule D, subject only  to  a\r\n\r\nminimum  period of 18 months, that minimum  period\r\n\r\nbeing  provided  so that there  is  time  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining at the centre to have effect on the  boy,\r\n\r\nand  subject  to a maximum period of three  years,\r\n\r\nthough  it  can  be five years for certain  graver\r\n\r\noffences. In this way, the length of training in a\r\n\r\nreformative centre can be adjusted to  the  nature\r\n\r\nof the person concerned, the whole object being to\r\n\r\nreform  this young boy and turn him into a  useful\r\n\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.34 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

While welcoming this Bill, I think we\r\n\r\nshould  be  very  careful  to  keep  these   young\r\n\r\noffenders  as far away from a prison in  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  possible.  Not only the building  where  these\r\n\r\nyoung  offenders are to be housed should  be  away\r\n\r\nfrom  any  prison, but it should be so constructed\r\n\r\nand   arranged  that  it  has  not  the  slightest\r\n\r\nappearance of a prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

We have done what we can in converting the\r\n\r\nold  remand  prison  to  separate  it  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible from the other parts of the prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  will be a separate entrance and it will  be\r\n\r\nan entrance which is connected with the offices of\r\n\r\nthe  prison  administration rather than  with  the\r\n\r\nremainder of the prison, but, nevertheless, it is,\r\n\r\nof course, a disadvantage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  institution  will  start  in  what   is\r\n\r\ncommonly  regarded  as a prison.  But  as  against\r\n\r\nthat, we feel that we should make a start. We have\r\n\r\nsomething like 80 young lads now undergoing prison\r\n\r\nsentences and we can do something for them even if\r\n\r\nthe  conditions are not ideal, and we should  like\r\n\r\nto  start  on  trying to rescue  these  young  men\r\n\r\nrather than wait until we can get what might be  a\r\n\r\nmuch more ideal institution site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The\r\n\r\npurpose of the Bill is very fully explained in the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Note at the end of the Bill.  Briefly,\r\n\r\nit  is  to  enable a boy, who has been dealt  with\r\n\r\nunder the Children and Young Persons Ordinance and\r\n\r\nhas reached 16 years of age, to be transferred  to\r\n\r\na   reformative  training  centre   if   that   is\r\n\r\nconsidered  by the Court to be more  suitable  for\r\n\r\nhim.   This   Bill  completes  the   comprehensive\r\n\r\narrangements  for dealing with the age  groups  of\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons up to 16, the 16 to 21,\r\n\r\nand  then  the  over 21, and it provides  a  means\r\n\r\nwhereby  a  young  person  dealt  with  under  the\r\n\r\nChildren and Young Persons Ordinance can later  be\r\n\r\ndealt with under the provisions for persons of  16\r\n\r\nto  21 by means of reformative training.

They are steps in the  right\r\n\r\ndirection. I would, however, commend the following\r\n\r\nto Government. I always believe in the saying that\r\n\r\nprevention  is better than cure. Cure should  come\r\n\r\nonly  when  we  have  exhausted  our  methods   of\r\n\r\nprevention. I happen to be dealing with many youth\r\n\r\norganisations and am interested in youth  affairs.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I am tackling this one problem.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant, Sir, that before a boy, finding that he\r\n\r\nhas nothing better to do,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassociates with bad company and indulges in crime,\r\n\r\nhe should be given something more constructive for\r\n\r\nhim  to  fill  his  time. I am referring  to  many\r\n\r\ninstitutions which exert a very good influence  on\r\n\r\nthe  youth  of  Singapore.  Such  institutions,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest,  Sir, are really assisting the Government\r\n\r\nin  their  efforts to prevent a boy  from  turning\r\n\r\ninto  a  bad  character, and if  Government  would\r\n\r\nseriously  consider giving greater  assistance  to\r\n\r\nsuch institutions, then I think the money spent in\r\n\r\nthis   direction   would  help   to   reduce   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure that would be incurred in starting all\r\n\r\nthese  reformative measures. I suggest, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should examine my suggestion  very\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  consider giving increased  aid  to\r\n\r\nsuch  institutions because they have a  favourable\r\n\r\ninfluence on young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The Government  is  in  profound\r\n\r\nagreement with the Malayanisation Commission  that\r\n\r\nthe  objective should be the Malayanisation of the\r\n\r\nadministrative  service.  Immediate  and  complete\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  of the administrative  service  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible, but by taking over the  key  posts,\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  measure of Malayanisation  will  be\r\n\r\nachieved  within the shortest time without  having\r\n\r\nto  displace  all expatriate officers immediately.\r\n\r\nIt   is  the  Government's  firm  view  that   the\r\n\r\nprincipal civil service advisers of Ministers must\r\n\r\nbe local men and this change must be brought about\r\n\r\nforthwith  as soon as the new Public  Service  Commission comes into being, I hope, on the first  of\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1957. These key posts are the nine  posts\r\n\r\nof  Permanent Secretary grade listed in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  laid  before this Assembly today,  and  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of candidates for these posts will be  one\r\n\r\nof  the  first  tasks  of the new  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission in the new year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Sir, I wish to stress that the\r\n\r\nimmediate   Malayanisation  of  these   posts   of\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary  grade  is  no  slur  on  the\r\n\r\npresent  expatriate holders of these  posts.  This\r\n\r\ndecision is both a political and an administrative\r\n\r\nnecessity. The expatriate holders have served well\r\n\r\nand  have  given of their best to this Government,\r\n\r\nand  I am confident that they will freely give  of\r\n\r\ntheir  wide  knowledge and experience  during  the\r\n\r\nnext  six months so as to ensure that their  local\r\n\r\nsuccessors  will  be assisted to  the  maximum  in\r\n\r\ntaking  over  the new duties. I am also  confident\r\n\r\nthat  our  local officers, who will be given  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility from the start, will  rise  to  the\r\n\r\noccasion and prove that they are no less able than\r\n\r\ntheir predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that no Member in this House will run away\r\n\r\nwith  the  idea that, by immediately  malayanising\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretary posts, the way is set for\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmooth  Malayanisation of the public service.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  it.  It is just a proper start and the  only\r\n\r\nlogical approach to this difficult problem.  There\r\n\r\nare  just  over  500 expatriate  officers  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernment   service,  both   permanent   and   on\r\n\r\nagreement or contract. The problem is not only  to\r\n\r\nreplace  these  officers during the coming  years,\r\n\r\nbut  to fill the many vacancies that now exist  in\r\n\r\nthe   service   and  also  to  keep  the   service\r\n\r\nmalayanised.  The  rate  of  Malayanisation   must\r\n\r\ndepend,  in  the  first place, on  the  number  of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers who wish to avail  themselves\r\n\r\nof  the  abolition  terms and leave  this  country\r\n\r\nimmediately.  It would be ideal  if  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nexodus  of expatriate officers could be controlled\r\n\r\nor regulated. We can do this only up to a point by\r\n\r\noffering  some  form of inducement  such  as  that\r\n\r\nproposed  in  the  compensation  scheme,  and   no\r\n\r\nfurther,  for it is useless to force an  unwilling\r\n\r\nofficer to stay against his wish. To be without an\r\n\r\nofficer  is better than to have an unwilling  one.\r\n\r\nWe  recognise the freedom of every man  to  choose\r\n\r\nhis  employer.  We will not retain  a  single  man\r\n\r\nagainst his wish. Malayanisation would have been a\r\n\r\nmuch easier task if in every senior service we had\r\n\r\nlocal  officers  in  sufficient  numbers  and   of\r\n\r\nsufficient      seniority     and      experience.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Sir, we have not.  In  practically\r\n\r\nevery senior service there is a disconcerting  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the local officers recruited  before  the\r\n\r\nwar and those after the war. The gap in some cases\r\n\r\nis from eight to ten years. Also the number of pre-war  senior local officers is small simply because\r\n\r\nit  was  not the policy of the colonial Government\r\n\r\nthen  to  open the door of the senior  service  to\r\n\r\nlocal   officers.  The  responsibility  for   this\r\n\r\nshortage  of senior local officers must  therefore\r\n\r\nbe   placed  at  the  doorstep  of  the   colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  must therefore courageously  make\r\n\r\nuse of what we have, otherwise we will not have  a\r\n\r\ntrue   merdeka  if  the  civil  service  is  still\r\n\r\ndominated by expatriate officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will note in the White Paper  that,\r\n\r\napart  from  the immediate Malayanisation  of  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary posts, the Government has also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided on immediate Malayanisation of other posts\r\n\r\nfor  which the Government is confident that  local\r\n\r\ncandidates  are available. Expatriate officers  in\r\n\r\nposts  which are not to be malayanised immediately\r\n\r\nwill  be  retained for varying periods which  have\r\n\r\nbeen   decided   upon  after  the   most   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Still  it  is  not   likely   that\r\n\r\nMalayanisation   will   proceed   the   way   that\r\n\r\nGovernment wants. We will get an accurate  picture\r\n\r\nof  what  is  likely  to happen  only  when  every\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officer  is  notified  of  his  future\r\n\r\ncareer in accordance with the White Paper and each\r\n\r\nof  them has indicated what his intentions are.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  warn hon. Members that the, last  words\r\n\r\nhave yet to be said on Malayanisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  have  noted  that  in   the\r\n\r\ntechnical service the period of continued  service\r\n\r\nto  be offered to expatriate officers is generally\r\n\r\nlonger  than in the administrative and  the  legal\r\n\r\nservices,  for instance. The reason  for  this  is\r\n\r\nsimple. We are short of technical men, not because\r\n\r\nour boys are incapable of becoming technicians but\r\n\r\nbecause  the old colonial policy was not  to  open\r\n\r\nthe  door of the senior technical services to  our\r\n\r\nboys  to  obtain high technical qualifications.  I\r\n\r\nwant to stress that the technical departments  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for our technical services  on  which\r\n\r\ndepends  the  well-being  of  everybody  in   this\r\n\r\ncountry,  and also our reputation as a great  port\r\n\r\nand  terminus. We are training as many technicians\r\n\r\nas possible, but it will take time to produce them\r\n\r\nin  sufficient numbers and it will also take  time\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  gain  sufficient  experience  after\r\n\r\nqualification. Until then we must  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nqualified expatriate technical officers to run our\r\n\r\ntechnical services efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next few years will be the most critical\r\n\r\nfor  the  civil  service in the  history  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  We have plans for the reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service  and we hope  that  all  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  help in not only malayanising  the\r\n\r\npublic  service  but in keeping it malayanised  by\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of  qualified  officers.  Except   in\r\n\r\ncertain technical or professional posts for  which\r\n\r\ncertain qualifications are the sine qua non, every\r\n\r\nable officer will have an opportunity of rising by\r\n\r\nmerit to the highest appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, one word to our expatriate officers\r\n\r\nwho will be leaving us between now and the day  of\r\n\r\ncomplete  Malayanisation. To  those  who  wish  to\r\n\r\nleave  now,  I will repeat: we will not  retain  a\r\n\r\nsingle one against his wish. To those who elect to\r\n\r\nremain  for the period we ask for or for a  period\r\n\r\nof  their  choice, I will say that  they  will  be\r\n\r\neligible   for   promotion  in   accordance   with\r\n\r\ntraditional   service   principles,   subject   to\r\n\r\nparagraph 11(f)  of the White Paper, and that  they\r\n\r\nwill continue to enjoy the same salary scales  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service as at present.  They  need\r\n\r\nhave  no  fear  that  they will  be  discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  in  any way. I want them to realise  that\r\n\r\nthey   must  move  with  the  times  in   colonial\r\n\r\nterritories. Malayanisation has nothing to do with\r\n\r\nobtaining big jobs for a few local officers. It is\r\n\r\na  logical  conclusion  in  the  progress  of  any\r\n\r\ncolonial  territory  towards  self-government  and\r\n\r\nultimate independence. The entire control  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment must be vested in the local people, and\r\n\r\nwe  must prepare for this well in advance of self-government.  I  therefore move,  Sir,  the  motion\r\n\r\nstanding in my name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  second  the   motion,\r\n\r\nreserving my right to speak at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.05 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  must  first  record my  regret  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  on  such  an  important  subject   as\r\n\r\nMalayanisation,   has   given   Members   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  a bare three days to study its  policy\r\n\r\nbefore  they are asked to debate it. Some  Members\r\n\r\nof this Assembly who have offices in town received\r\n\r\nthe policy statement on Saturday. Those who do not\r\n\r\nhave  offices  in town received the  statement  on\r\n\r\nMonday.  The Hon. the Chief Minister stressed,  no\r\n\r\nless  than  three  times in his speech,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment gave the most careful consideration  to\r\n\r\nthe    recommendations   of   the   Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission's Report. The Government took  no  less\r\n\r\nthan nine months to meditate on the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it has given the Opposition a bare 48 hours to\r\n\r\nstudy  this  policy statement. Fortunately  it  so\r\n\r\nhappened  that the major recommendations  of  this\r\n\r\nWhite Paper were acceptable to most Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition, namely the acceptance of the principle\r\n\r\nthat the control room of the civil service will be\r\n\r\ntaken  away from the white man and put into  local\r\n\r\nhands immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation is one of those issues which have\r\n\r\nbedevilled  the Government, striking right  inside\r\n\r\nthe  machinery  of government for the  last  eight\r\n\r\nyears  since the reoccupation of this country  and\r\n\r\nprincipally in the last three years. Not long  ago\r\n\r\nthe whole civil service was nearly in open revolt,\r\n\r\nnot  on the specific issue of Malayanisation,  but\r\n\r\njust  out  of a feeling of bitterness, frustration\r\n\r\nand  discontent  with the policy of  the  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment. It is comforting to know that  such  a\r\n\r\nbitter issue can find a relatively peaceful end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not supporting this statement of policy\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe that if this White  Paper  is\r\n\r\nimplemented   Malayanisation   will   become    an\r\n\r\naccomplished fact. We support it because once  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  handing over the  control  room  is\r\n\r\naccepted and implemented, then the flood gates are\r\n\r\nopened, and the white men will be swept out of all\r\n\r\npositions  of administrative control in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years.  That  is  why  we  have  accepted  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  the statement of policy  laid  down  in\r\n\r\nthis White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the reaction of the public and of\r\n\r\nthose  members  of  the public in  the  government\r\n\r\nservice  who are directly affected by  this  White\r\n\r\nPaper  has  been a mixed and varied one, depending\r\n\r\nupon -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether they are or are not affected, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Whether they are white or Asian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the white man is concerned, those\r\n\r\ncommercial   tycoons   whose   friends   in    the\r\n\r\nadministrative service have long held the ring for\r\n\r\nthem, I think we shall have to wait until the hon.\r\n\r\nMr  Sutherland makes it known how he feels  about\r\n\r\nit.  From  now onwards Mr Sutherland may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to pick up the telephone and ring up Tom  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Commerce  and  Industry for  a  drink  at  the\r\n\r\nTanglin Club to settle a few matters about  A.  P.\r\n\r\nForms and Foreign Exchange controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to those who have been at the\r\n\r\nother end of the colonial stick - the big end of the\r\n\r\nstick - this   has   been  a  source   of   constant\r\n\r\nirritation.  I  am  not suggesting  that,  because\r\n\r\nlocal  men are moved into key positions, therefore\r\n\r\nthe revolution in Malaya will be over. In fact, at\r\n\r\na later stage in my speech, I wish to remind these\r\n\r\nlocal  men  who  are  assuming control,  that  the\r\n\r\nfuture   of  the  democratic  state  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ndepends  upon  the integrity and  the  drive  with\r\n\r\nwhich they discharge their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has been unsatisfactory on\r\n\r\ntwo  very  important branches of the apparatus  of\r\n\r\ngovernment -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The judiciary, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  were the two issues which we never  settled\r\n\r\nwith  the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  He\r\n\r\npreferred  not  to  discuss them  until  he  could\r\n\r\nsettle  the  question of internal security.  Since\r\n\r\nthat was not settled, these two issues on which  we\r\n\r\nknew we were going to meet difficulties ware never\r\n\r\ndiscussed  at  the conference table.  But  he  did\r\n\r\nindicate that the present High Court judges should\r\n\r\nnot  be  removed,  and  that the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice   and  the  Deputy  Commissioner  and   the\r\n\r\nDirector of the Special Branch of the police force\r\n\r\ncould  not  be Malayanised without the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe  Defence and Security Council. I am,  however,\r\n\r\nastounded  that, although the Secretary  of  State\r\n\r\nhad  only  reserved these three  important  posts,\r\n\r\nthis  Government  should have agreed  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible to Malayanise the police force  in  six\r\n\r\nyears, and that it has proposed to retain about 30\r\n\r\npermanent   officers  of  the   rank   of   Deputy\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Police and above  for  at  least\r\n\r\nsix  years.  The  Commissioner of  Police  himself\r\n\r\nadmitted before the Malayanisation Commission that\r\n\r\nthe  police force including his own job  could  be\r\n\r\nMalayanised   in   five  years.   The   Commission\r\n\r\nrecommended a period of three. The Government  has\r\n\r\nchosen six. To a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain extent, the experience of Members  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side of the recent disorders in the  Colony\r\n\r\nof  Singapore when they found that their own lives\r\n\r\nand  property had to be defended by Gurkha  troops\r\n\r\nand  police and European officers may have weighed\r\n\r\nheavily in their minds. The Asian officers in  the\r\n\r\npolice force no doubt are somewhat frustrated  and\r\n\r\nembittered about the Malayanisation of the  police\r\n\r\nforce. I was discussing this matter recently  with\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  had  occasion to  know  these  Asian\r\n\r\nofficers.  He  said, \"Well, they  have  got  their\r\n\r\ndeserts.  The  cowards  did  not  go  before   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Commission  and  beard  the  white\r\n\r\nofficers  in the Malayanisation Commission's  den.\r\n\r\nThey   deserve  what  they  have  got  for   their\r\n\r\ntimidity.\"  To  this,  someone  wisecracked,   \"Or\r\n\r\nperhaps   this   is  the  best  place   to   start\r\n\r\nsubversion!

Therefore,  if   we   are   true\r\n\r\nsubversionists,  we should exploit  the  situation\r\n\r\nand  hold  out  this carrot to  the  Asian  police\r\n\r\nofficers to support merdeka!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say this to the Asian officers, if they\r\n\r\ndemand  the  right to take over the police  force,\r\n\r\nlet  us see their mettle. Let us see the grit that\r\n\r\nis  wanted in men who are to hold the rifle barrel\r\n\r\nin this little island.

We  now know from the  estimates  that\r\n\r\nonly  one more judgeship is to be created. We wish\r\n\r\nto  make  it  clear that, whatever this Government\r\n\r\nsays  in this White Paper, my Party believes  that\r\n\r\nthe   principle  of  the  inviolability   of   the\r\n\r\njudiciary  can only be accepted after we  Malayans\r\n\r\nhave decided who shall fill those positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  accept that those whom  the  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  appointed  as  our  judges   are\r\n\r\ninviolate,   and   cannot  be  removed   by   this\r\n\r\nLegislature  or  this Government. However  honest,\r\n\r\nhowever good as lawyers they may be, they are part\r\n\r\nand  parcel  of  the colonial machinery  which  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to  any Malayan nationalist.  In  no\r\n\r\nterritory of the British Commonwealth in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia  were  European judges allowed to  remain  in\r\n\r\noffice  when  the British imperial  power  finally\r\n\r\ndeparted. The only exception was in Ceylon where a\r\n\r\nwhite  Chief  Justice, who I notice is  already  a\r\n\r\nmodel  for the Chief Justice of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,   was   allowed  to  remain  because   the\r\n\r\nCeylonese  Government wanted him  to  remain.  But\r\n\r\nwhen that Government decided that he should go, he\r\n\r\nwent.  That  is  a principle which we  must  first\r\n\r\nestablish  before we accept the principle  of  the\r\n\r\ninviolability of the judicial service. It would be\r\n\r\nunfair  to many distinguished judges if my remarks\r\n\r\nwere  to  create the impression that I think  they\r\n\r\nwere  all  dishonest  and useless  instruments  of\r\n\r\nBritish  imperialism. The former Chief Justice  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  for  instance,  was  a  man  of  great\r\n\r\nlearning  and  balance of judgment, for  whom  all\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Bar, whether white or black,  had\r\n\r\nconsiderable  respect.  That  does  not   in   the\r\n\r\nslightest way detract from the principle  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  accept a white judiciary imposed upon  us.\r\n\r\nWe  want the principle established that if we want\r\n\r\nthem  to  quit, then they must go.  Then  when  we\r\n\r\nappoint  our  local men, they will  be  inviolate.\r\n\r\nThey cannot be removed either by the Government or\r\n\r\nthe  Legislature except by the most  stringent  of\r\n\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other matters of detail with which\r\n\r\nwe  could pick faults in this statement of policy,\r\n\r\nbut  before  I  do so, I want to congratulate  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on two important principles  which  it\r\n\r\nhas   established - one,   in   the   administrative\r\n\r\nservice,  and  the other, in the  police.  In  the\r\n\r\nadministrative   service   we   congratulate   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for having created an executive service\r\n\r\nso that no man shall be debarred from holding the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhighest  of  administrative posts just because  he\r\n\r\ndid  not  got to a university to take  an  Honours\r\n\r\ndegree  and  so  join the elite.  We  live  in  an\r\n\r\negalitarian age. A man is judged for  what  he  is\r\n\r\nworth  and what he can contribute to society,  not\r\n\r\nby  the  hallmarks  that he has  acquired  in  his\r\n\r\nlifetime   in   some  venerable   institution   of\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the principle in the police force that\r\n\r\n\"the  Commission's recommendations  endorsing  the\r\n\r\nsystem of promotion from the Rank and File to  the\r\n\r\nInspectorate and that the gazetted ranks should be\r\n\r\nrecruited from the Inspectorate and not by  direct\r\n\r\nentry  is accepted. The recommendation that  every\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  Rank  and File  should  be  given\r\n\r\nfacilities  as  far  as possible  to  improve  his\r\n\r\nEnglish  is accepted. Lack of English should  not,\r\n\r\nhowever, bar the promotion of outstanding  N.C.Os.\r\n\r\nto  the Inspectorate, or the promotion of officers\r\n\r\nof  outstanding ability.\" Sir, when the white  men\r\n\r\ncame  and  colonised parts of South and  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia,  they  created a caste in the administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery. They became an elite and any member who\r\n\r\njoined  that  administrative  service  became,  in\r\n\r\nvarying  degrees, depending on one's  position  in\r\n\r\nthe  hierarchy, a member of an elite force,  where\r\n\r\nentry  was controlled, not by what a man was worth\r\n\r\nbut  by  what  his  wealth, social  position,  and\r\n\r\neducation  were  judged  to  be  worth.  With  the\r\n\r\ndisappearance of the white elite, it is absolutely\r\n\r\nvital  that we should not see in its place a black\r\n\r\nelite - black, brown, yellow, whatever  the  varying\r\n\r\nshades there may be in Asia and in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tendency among some of the less\r\n\r\ndistinguished   officers  of  the   administrative\r\n\r\nservice  recruited locally to imagine  that  their\r\n\r\nrole is to step into the shoes of these sacrosanct\r\n\r\nwhite men and that the purpose of the State is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  them with comfortable quarters, important\r\n\r\npositions,  comfortable salaries and security  and\r\n\r\npensions.  To  these  men we say  that  they  will\r\n\r\nperish,  and  not only them, but  also  the  whole\r\n\r\nState  will  perish  with them,  unless  they  re-orientate themselves. With the disappearance of  a\r\n\r\nwhite elite, we must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput   in  its  place  a  new  and  efficient   and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  group where a man occupies a  position\r\n\r\nbecause of what he can contribute, not because  he\r\n\r\nhas gained entry by some false standard of values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on some quite minor\r\n\r\npoints  where we feel that the Commission's Report\r\n\r\ncould  have  been improved. If we had  been  given\r\n\r\nmore  time, we might have picked out more  faults;\r\n\r\nbut  unfortunately the Government  does  not  seem\r\n\r\nanxious that the Opposition should give this White\r\n\r\nPaper as careful a consideration as the Government\r\n\r\nitself has bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is stated here that there are to be two\r\n\r\nPermanent    Secretaries   to   the   Treasury - one\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  Finance  and  the   other   for\r\n\r\nPersonnel - and that there is, in fact, no need  for\r\n\r\nany  one administrative official to be head of the\r\n\r\ncivil service. On the question of principle,  that\r\n\r\nis  wrong.  There should be one head of the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  There  cannot be two  persons  of  equal\r\n\r\nstatus, for someone in that civil service must  be\r\n\r\nthe  \"Field-Marshal\" through whom  the  Government\r\n\r\nissues its directives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the medical branch, it might\r\n\r\ninterest the Minister for Health to know that  the\r\n\r\ndoctors are once more thinking of \"fixing\" him and\r\n\r\nI  would  advise, if he were to fall ill, that  he\r\n\r\nshould choose his doctors carefully!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, some people in this House\r\n\r\nhave  no  sense of humour, and for these people  I\r\n\r\nhave the deepest sympathy. But for the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong, I hope he will bear this in mind - that  the\r\n\r\nlocal  chest specialists think it outrageous  that\r\n\r\nthey  should wait ten years before they  push  the\r\n\r\nwhite men out. Further, that the local pharmacists\r\n\r\nthink it equally outrageous that they should  have\r\n\r\nto  wait six years before they take over from  the\r\n\r\nwhite  men.  So if the Minister for Health  should\r\n\r\nhave  any chest complaint, no doubt he will choose\r\n\r\nhis doctors carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, we support the detailed proposals\r\n\r\nin this White Paper. We support it notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe fact that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  know  that  many of the junior  administrative\r\n\r\nofficers  are dissatisfied because of a  statement\r\n\r\nof  policy that there will be a five-year time lag\r\n\r\nbefore   their   avenues  for   rapid   fortuitous\r\n\r\npromotion  will be open. We say to  them  that  we\r\n\r\nwant  them  to  prove their mettle in  these  five\r\n\r\nyears,  and to show us that they can compete  with\r\n\r\nthe white men who will stay behind, not as policy-makers   but  as  functionaries.  If  they  cannot\r\n\r\ncompete with the white men, then they deserve  not\r\n\r\nto be promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malayan Civil Service was a mandarinate.\r\n\r\nThe  legend \"M.C.S.\" after a white man's  name  on\r\n\r\nsome  wooden swing-door was some kind of hallmark,\r\n\r\nsymbol  of personal power and influence - as someone\r\n\r\nput  it,  \"A member of the Black Dragon  that  ran\r\n\r\nthis  country.\"  It was patterned  on  the  Indian\r\n\r\nCivil  Service. As we draw to the last  and  final\r\n\r\nround  of  this battle to wrest control  from  the\r\n\r\nwhite  man, it might be useful to recall the  role\r\n\r\nthis  particular service played in the  historical\r\n\r\nexploitation of the territories of South and South-East  Asia.  Let me read a passage on  the  Indian\r\n\r\nCivil Service by a distinguished Indian historian,\r\n\r\nMr  K.  M. Pannikkar, one-time Ambassador of  the\r\n\r\nIndian  Government  to  the People's  Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina, who had reason to know the various types of\r\n\r\ncivil  service that a State can model for its  own\r\n\r\nuse. He said this of the Indian Civil Service:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Under the 'lmperial' or central Government of\r\n\r\nIndia,  there  were the provincial administrators,\r\n\r\nagain  with  authority delegated from the  centre.\r\n\r\nThe  administration of India was  conducted  by  a\r\n\r\nCivil Service, a regular mandarinate, recruited in\r\n\r\nEngland  by  open  competitive  examination.   The\r\n\r\ncurriculum  of the examination was so arranged  as\r\n\r\nto  place  a  premium on candidates from  the  two\r\n\r\nmetropolitan universities of Oxford and Cambridge,\r\n\r\nwith their predominance of public school students,\r\n\r\nthereby  ensuring both the 'class composition'  of\r\n\r\nthe  services and the imperial tradition.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  quarter of the century after the assumption\r\n\r\nof  direct government of India by the Crown (1858) \r\n\r\nthere   were  hardly  any  Indians  in  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService.  Though  from the end of  the  century  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Indians continued annually  to  secure\r\n\r\nadmission to the service, their proportion was not\r\n\r\nconsiderable until after 1919, that is, during the\r\n\r\nwhole  period  of  imperial supremacy.  The  Civil\r\n\r\nService   not   merely  administered,   that   is,\r\n\r\ncollected the revenues, maintained law and  order,\r\n\r\nand formed generally the magistracy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover the entire country, but also participated  in\r\n\r\nhigher  judicial work, a proportion of the  judges\r\n\r\nof the Provincial High Courts being drawn from the\r\n\r\nadministrative service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below this practically 'all-white' service was a\r\n\r\nlarge Indian bureaucracy recruited on a provincial\r\n\r\nbasis  and  strictly controlled and supervised  in\r\n\r\nits  functions by the former. It was through  this\r\n\r\nsubordinate  or  provincial  service,  exclusively\r\n\r\nIndian  in  personnel, that the authority  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment penetrated to the masses. The  control,\r\n\r\nhowever,  was for a long time solely in the  hands\r\n\r\nof European officials.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read what kind of society this mandarinate\r\n\r\ncreated in India:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"One other aspect of British authority in India\r\n\r\nat  this  period was the conviction held by  every\r\n\r\nEuropean  in India of a final and enduring  racial\r\n\r\nsuperiority. Seton Kerr, Foreign Secretary of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   explained  it  as   'the   cherished\r\n\r\nconviction of every Englishman in India, from  the\r\n\r\nhighest  to the lowest, by the planter's assistant\r\n\r\nin  his  lowly bungalow and by the editor  in  the\r\n\r\nfull  light of the Presidency town - from  those  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Commissioner in charge of an important\r\n\r\nprovince   to   the  Viceroy  on  his   throne - the\r\n\r\nconviction in every man that he belongs to a  race\r\n\r\nwhom  God has destined to govern and subdue.' Many\r\n\r\nequally authoritative statements of this point  of\r\n\r\nview from persons in the highest official position\r\n\r\nin  India  could be quoted to show  how  universal\r\n\r\nthis  conviction was during the last  century  and\r\n\r\nindeed up to the time of the first Great War.  One\r\n\r\nfurther  quotation may, however, be permitted,  as\r\n\r\nit  throws light on the attitude of the army. Lord\r\n\r\nKitchener, a most distinguished Commander-in-Chief\r\n\r\nof India, declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is this consciousness of the inherent\r\n\r\nsuperiority of the European which has won for  us India.  However well-educated and clever a native\r\n\r\nmay  be,  and  however brave he may  have  proved\r\n\r\nhimself,  I  believe that no  rank  that  we  can\r\n\r\nbestow on him would cause him to be considered an\r\n\r\nequal of the British officer.' \".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  this  is what Mr Pannikkar has to say  about\r\n\r\nthis.  (Mr Pannikkar is now the Indian Ambassador\r\n\r\nto France.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This flat racialism permeated all the services\r\n\r\nand  constituted the distinguishing characteristic\r\n\r\nof  British rule in the East in the 19th  century.\r\n\r\nIts  effects  were widespread.  In  the  Army,  no\r\n\r\nIndian  could  hold  a King's Commission.  In  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service,  no  Indian could  enter  by  open\r\n\r\ncompetitive examination, no appointments  above  a\r\n\r\ncertain  rank  were  open to  him,  and  the  most\r\n\r\ndistinguished Indian administrator of his day,  R.\r\n\r\nC.  Dutt, had to resign because, on the grounds of\r\n\r\nhis  race,  he was not promoted to the post  of  a\r\n\r\ncommissioner.   Social  life   was,   of   course,\r\n\r\nexclusive, and from hotels and clubs and even from\r\n\r\ncertain  parks, unwritten rules excluded  Indians.\r\n\r\nAlso Indian life was held cheap. Rudd, a planter's\r\n\r\nassistant who committed an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunusually  brutal and cowardly murder,  became  on\r\n\r\nhis  conviction, a martyr, and the European public\r\n\r\ncarried on an agitation for his reprieve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many things have happened since India of the\r\n\r\n19th century. The superiority of the white man was\r\n\r\nexploded, first, by the Japanese armies  and  then\r\n\r\nby  the Chinese armies across the Yalu River.  And\r\n\r\nso  also  has  exploded  the  myth  of  the  White\r\n\r\nmandarinate.  Once he was an elite, a  person  who\r\n\r\nwas  groomed  to govern. After the war,  with  the\r\n\r\n\"banana  colonels\",  this  mandarinate  began   to\r\n\r\ncollapse,  and  we lived to see a Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\nstand up and tell the poor benighted natives  that\r\n\r\nso  many  hundreds of his European  officials  had\r\n\r\nonly   School  Certificates  but  that  they   had\r\n\r\ncommissions in the British Army and were therefore\r\n\r\nqualified to hold positions which local  men  with\r\n\r\nhonours  degrees from local universities were  not\r\n\r\nthought fit to hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a long and bitter battle, but in\r\n\r\nMalaya  it has been much shorter than it otherwise\r\n\r\nwould  have  been, shorter than it  was  in  India\r\n\r\nbecause the whole process of transfer of power  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia has been high-pressured. There  is\r\n\r\nlittle  time  left for us to take over  the  whole\r\n\r\napparatus  of  state and to make it function  more\r\n\r\nefficiently than it did under the colonial system.\r\n\r\nIn  this apparatus of state the administrators are\r\n\r\na decisive factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of revolution in Asia. One is\r\n\r\nthe Indian model where a political Party, like the\r\n\r\nCongress   movement,  obtained  through   peaceful\r\n\r\nmethods   of   non-violence  and  resistance   the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  power  and  the  transfer   of   the\r\n\r\napparatus  of state. That political movement  then\r\n\r\nassumed responsibility and the use of an effective\r\n\r\nmachine - the  Indian  Civil  Service,  the   Indian\r\n\r\nPolice  Service, and the Indian Judicial  Service.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that India is today better governed than\r\n\r\nIndonesia  is because they took over an  efficient\r\n\r\nworking  machine. The Dutch did not have  to  hand\r\n\r\nover to the Indonesians a working machine and  the\r\n\r\nresult  was  chaos and muddle in Indonesia  during\r\n\r\nthe last ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is the other pattern of revolution,\r\n\r\nthat  is  the revolution in China. There they  did\r\n\r\nnot  take over an existing machine. They  built  a\r\n\r\nmovement  that  was a government in  itself.  Then\r\n\r\nwhen  they  took over, they swept  aside  the  old\r\n\r\nmachine  and installed themselves as the  machine.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  fundamental distinction in  the  two\r\n\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Malaya (and I still speak in terms of\r\n\r\nMalaya and not Singapore, because I do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  could exist as an island state) have  to\r\n\r\nchoose  the  first method, the method  whereby  we\r\n\r\ntake   over  peacefully  and  work  the   previous\r\n\r\nmachine. Revolution by violence in Malaya,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, would lead to race war. I am sure no  one\r\n\r\nin  Malaya,  whatever  his political  convictions,\r\n\r\nwants  a  race war. We are convinced that whatever\r\n\r\nthe zigzags of policy between the Colonial Office,\r\n\r\nthe  local Nationalist groups and the Communists.,\r\n\r\nthe  road for this country is the road of peaceful\r\n\r\nnon-violent  transfer  of  power.  Therefore,   it\r\n\r\nbecomes  imperative that when we  take  over  this\r\n\r\nmachine,  it must work, or the whole  basis  of  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  State will collapse. If  U.M.N.O.,  or\r\n\r\nfor   that  matter  the  Labour  Front,   were   a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary Party in the Marxist  sense  of  the\r\n\r\nterm,  what would happen when they won power would\r\n\r\nbe   a   sweeping  aside  of  the  whole  of   the\r\n\r\nadministration and substitution in  its  place  of\r\n\r\nthe  U.M.N.O. party machine as the government. But\r\n\r\nno  constitutional Party in this country hopes  or\r\n\r\ndesires to do that. What we hope to do is to build\r\n\r\na  democratic State in which the machinery of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  there working neutrally,  whatever\r\n\r\npolitical  beliefs  or political  convictions  its\r\n\r\ndrivers  may  have.  No  constitutional  political\r\n\r\nParty  hopes to build up a machine that  can  take\r\n\r\nover  the  administration  of  Singapore,  or  the\r\n\r\nFederation. What constitutional Parties hope to do\r\n\r\nis  to  take over the driver's seat, and the right\r\n\r\nto   tell   the  Chief  Secretary,  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary and the Attorney-General what to do, for\r\n\r\nwe shall then be the drivers. But it will be small\r\n\r\nconsolation  to  the drivers if the  machine  that\r\n\r\nthey are supposed to drive has broken down. It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore vital to see that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith Malayanisation, the machine is no merely kept\r\n\r\nintact  and  efficient.  It  must  be  made   more\r\n\r\nefficient and effective to meet demands which were\r\n\r\nnever made on the previous machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a colonial system which did not have to\r\n\r\nrespond to popular and public agitation, one could\r\n\r\ngovern  from the clouds, from Mount Olympia.  From\r\n\r\nGovernment House one issued edicts. One  moved  in\r\n\r\npomp  and  splendour and the whole patina  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  Government gave prestige and  weight  to\r\n\r\nany  edict that was issued from high places.  That\r\n\r\nis  not open and possible to a colonial Government\r\n\r\nnow,  and therefore this reluctant, belated  hand-over. A popularly elected government will have  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to  popular agitation. We have  to  solve\r\n\r\ndiscontents  where before, they  could  have  been\r\n\r\nignored with impunity. A colonial Government could\r\n\r\nsend  two  Social Welfare vans down to  the  flood\r\n\r\narea  and  the  Governor could come and  tour  the\r\n\r\nflood  area with his trouser creases still showing\r\n\r\nabove his rubber boots, and he can be hailed as  a\r\n\r\ndemocrat. But if any elected Minister attempts  to\r\n\r\ndo  that, he will perish in the next election. The\r\n\r\nneed for a machine much more effective than before\r\n\r\nis vital. The survival of the democratic State, of\r\n\r\nthe  parliamentary  system of government,  depends\r\n\r\nupon whether the state machine can respond to  the\r\n\r\nnew needs. It is not enough just to have efficient\r\n\r\nroutine officers who can write good minutes. It is\r\n\r\nvital  that you find men with imagination,  drive,\r\n\r\nintegrity  and purpose to make Malaya  a  thriving\r\n\r\nsocialist democracy. Those who take over the white\r\n\r\nmen's  jobs  must  realise  that  not  only  their\r\n\r\npensions, and their future prospects of promotion,\r\n\r\nbut the future of a democratic parliamentary State\r\n\r\ndepends  upon whether or not they discharge  their\r\n\r\nduties  with  honour and credit. Unfortunately  in\r\n\r\nthe  past people have been chosen for the service,\r\n\r\nnot  because it was believed that they had  signal\r\n\r\nqualities  for  service to their  fellow-men,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  they had the signal qualities of docility\r\n\r\nand subservience to their white rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Public Service Commission told me\r\n\r\nseveral years ago that the reason why his son  had\r\n\r\ngot on in the world and got into the civil service\r\n\r\nwas because he and his son were not connected with\r\n\r\npolitics. He thought it was good advice to a  nice\r\n\r\nyoung  man  like myself whom he should  save  from\r\n\r\nperdition. That typifies the mind of the  men  who\r\n\r\nchoose  our civil servants. We shall have more  to\r\n\r\nsay  of  this  when the Public Service  Commission\r\n\r\nBill comes up for its Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to fill the civil service with\r\n\r\nefficient  people,  then  we  must  have  men  who\r\n\r\nunderstand the purpose of Malayanisation to do the\r\n\r\nchoosing.  If we have a lot of weak-kneed,  flabby\r\n\r\nand feeble types who are more concerned with their\r\n\r\npersonal  welfare than the welfare of the  people,\r\n\r\nto do the choosing, the whole fabric of government\r\n\r\nwill collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support in principle the policy statement of\r\n\r\nthe  Government on Malayanisation, but we  reserve\r\n\r\nour  right to bring up the question of the  police\r\n\r\nservice and the judicial service, and the right to\r\n\r\ncriticise  further other points of  detail  which,\r\n\r\nbecause of the shortness of time, we have not been\r\n\r\nable  as yet to consider properly. Finally I  wish\r\n\r\nto  remind the senior officers who are taking over\r\n\r\nthe  control  room that theirs is a  trust  to  be\r\n\r\ndischarged with honour. We hope that history  will\r\n\r\nrecord  the  fact  that they  discharged  it  with\r\n\r\ncredit to themselves and the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  find  that  I  have  much  to  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment policy on Malayanisation. I agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government  that  Malayan  officers  will  be\r\n\r\ntrained  to take over vacancies and that the  most\r\n\r\nimportant posts in the Ministries, especially  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary posts, will be filled  by  our\r\n\r\nlocal lads. The Government believes that the  role\r\n\r\nof  the  expatriate  officers should  be  that  of\r\n\r\nadvisers and I think that should be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through the whole of this White Paper, I\r\n\r\nfind that generally it is acceptable. I think that\r\n\r\nGovernment has done one very good thing, and  that\r\n\r\nis, after Malayanisation, and especially after the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of the new Public Service Commission,\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in the matter of promotions to  key\r\n\r\npositions will be put to an end. Previous to this,\r\n\r\nI  am aware that it was very difficult for a local\r\n\r\nlad  with  good  qualifications to  get  into  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  administrative service. In fact,  from\r\n\r\nthe   year   1935   or  so  onwards,   after   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of our first college in Malaya, only\r\n\r\nthe  very  best  graduates from the  college  were\r\n\r\nselected for appointment to the lower rungs of the\r\n\r\nadministrative  service.  The  position  has  not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  improved even after the  liberation.  In\r\n\r\nthe   medical   service,  there   is   still   the\r\n\r\nrequirement  that a local officer has  to  acquire\r\n\r\nfive  years' specialist experience and ten  years'\r\n\r\ngeneral experience before he can be promoted to  a\r\n\r\nspecialist  post. This requirement troubled  me  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  and  I made intensive  investigations\r\n\r\ninto  the matter. What was revealed to me was that\r\n\r\nit  had always been the order. I tried to dig deep\r\n\r\ninto   it   to  find  out  when  that  order   was\r\n\r\npromulgated. I was informed that it  was  of  very\r\n\r\nlong standing. I am not convinced that it was  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  it was not brought into operation  before\r\n\r\nlocal officers obtained degrees to enable them  to\r\n\r\nfill  such  posts. I think that unless a circular,\r\n\r\ndating back earlier than after the liberation  and\r\n\r\nnotifying that such an order had been promulgated,\r\n\r\ncan be shown to me, I shall never be convinced  on\r\n\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of degrees, there is always a large\r\n\r\nnumber which are equal to one another, and in many\r\n\r\ncases  I  found  that jobs were tailored  for  the\r\n\r\nofficers  they had in mind, so that, although  the\r\n\r\nlocal  lads might have higher qualifications,  yet\r\n\r\nbecause the advertisement said that they must have\r\n\r\ncertain  specific  degrees from  certain  specific\r\n\r\nschools  or universities, they were always  barred\r\n\r\nfrom    entering   the   highest    posts.    This\r\n\r\nMalayanisation policy will, however, I  feel,  put\r\n\r\nan end to all these difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we have decided on the implementation of\r\n\r\nthis policy, there is one difficulty that will  be\r\n\r\nencountered.   This  difficulty   is   stated   in\r\n\r\nparagraph   6  of  the  White  Paper   where   the\r\n\r\nGovernment says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There are eight local officers of the\r\n\r\nadministrative service who each have seventeen  or\r\n\r\nmore   years   total  service   in   the   Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements  Civil Service and the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService  combined. But, below  this,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndisconcerting gap, due largely to the  war  years,\r\n\r\nand   the   remaining  twenty-six   administrative\r\n\r\nofficers  all  have less than ten  years  service,\r\n\r\nsixteen of them being still probationers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  say  this - they have only 26 more administrative\r\n\r\nofficers. Eight plus 26 makes 34, and out of these\r\n\r\n34  officers, 16 of them have less than ten  years\r\n\r\nservice;  and  the conclusion that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  reached is that \"there will not be sufficient\r\n\r\nlocal  officers  of experience to fill  the  other\r\n\r\nsuperscale posts\", so that Government has  decided\r\n\r\non retaining many of the expatriate members of the\r\n\r\noverseas  administrative  service.  I  think  that\r\n\r\ndifficulty can be surmounted if Government accepts\r\n\r\nparagraphs  20, 21, 22 and 23 at page  13  of  the\r\n\r\nInterim  Report  of the Malayanisation  Commission\r\n\r\nwhich say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"However, if we seek recruitment for these\r\n\r\nsuperscale jobs from outside the service as  well,\r\n\r\nthe  greater become the prospects for their  rapid\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.  It  was, however,  maintained  by\r\n\r\nsome  local officers that recruitment for the  top\r\n\r\nposts should be reserved for serving officers.  It\r\n\r\nwas  maintained  that  since officers  joined  the\r\n\r\nservice  in  the expectation that they would  have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity of advancing to the top, it would\r\n\r\nbe unfair if they were called upon to compete with\r\n\r\noutsiders for the more responsible jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that, other things being equal, prior\r\n\r\nconsideration  should be given to those  who  have\r\n\r\nmade the Civil Service their life-long career. And\r\n\r\nin normal times that should in fact be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the period between now and complete\r\n\r\nMalayanisation cannot be regarded as  normal.  The\r\n\r\npolicy of Malayanisation means in effect upsetting\r\n\r\nestablished  practices  by  procedures  which  are\r\n\r\nrevolutionary.    For    many    local    officers\r\n\r\nMalayanisation opens opportunities for advancement\r\n\r\nwhich  had  never existed before  and  which  they\r\n\r\nwould never have had otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it should be emphasised that Malayanisation\r\n\r\nis  not intended as a device to promote wholly  or\r\n\r\neven primarily the interests of the Civil Service.\r\n\r\nMalayanisation means providing the people of  this\r\n\r\ncountry with an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefficient  Civil  Service  manned  by   the   best\r\n\r\navailable local people. If this efficiency must be\r\n\r\nprovided  by  transfusion of talents from  outside\r\n\r\nthe  service,  then  this  departure  from  normal\r\n\r\npractice  must  be accepted at least  until  after\r\n\r\nMalayanisation is complete.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to that, we have paragraph 5 of the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on Malayanisation which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The field of candidates for these posts will\r\n\r\nnot be confined to the administrative service.  It\r\n\r\nis  essential that the posts be held by  the  best\r\n\r\nmen  available irrespective of their position  and\r\n\r\nstatus in the service. Nevertheless, it is  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected that the majority of these posts will  be\r\n\r\nfilled  by  senior  members of the  administrative\r\n\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention, Sir, is that those who have served\r\n\r\nus  well and for very long periods should be given\r\n\r\nthe  posts.  They  should have top  priority.  But\r\n\r\naccording  to the White Paper, even if  all  these\r\n\r\nmen  who have been in the service for a long  time\r\n\r\nare  to  be  promoted right now to the top  posts,\r\n\r\nthere  is  still,  as  the  Government  says,   \"a\r\n\r\ndisconcerting gap\". There will be many posts  that\r\n\r\nwill need to be filled by Malayans. We will not be\r\n\r\nable to find them in the civil service itself,  or\r\n\r\nin  any  other  service of the Government.  If  we\r\n\r\nconfine  our  choice to the civil  service  alone,\r\n\r\nthen it will be narrow. The policy of filling  the\r\n\r\nposts  with the best men, the most efficient  men,\r\n\r\nwill also not be possible to carry out. I suggest,\r\n\r\nSir,  that there is quite a large number of  well-qualified people who are well able to do  the  job\r\n\r\nthat  needs  to be done. I consider Malayanisation\r\n\r\nto  be  like this: we are going to fill posts  with\r\n\r\nMalayans,  whether they are inside the service  or\r\n\r\noutside. So long as they are honest, efficient and\r\n\r\nloyal  to  this country, and so long as  they  are\r\n\r\ntruly  Malayans, I say that they should  be  given\r\n\r\nthe  chance of filling such posts after the  local\r\n\r\nserving officers have been given the chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Schedule in the White Paper, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I find that we can divide the  posts\r\n\r\nwhich  are  to be retained by expatriate  officers\r\n\r\ninto  two classes - the technical side and the  non-technical  side. I do not disagree very much  with\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy of wishing to slow  down  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of Malayanisation on the technical  side,\r\n\r\nbut I do contend that the period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvisaged to malayanise it is sometimes  a  little\r\n\r\ntoo  long.  On  page 8 of the White  Paper,  under\r\n\r\nBroadcasting: Engineering, you have nine permanent\r\n\r\nofficers  and  you need eight years  before  local\r\n\r\nofficers can be trained to replace them.  For  the\r\n\r\nthree  permanent officers in the Printing  Office,\r\n\r\nyou  require seven years. I find, Sir, that if  we\r\n\r\nare  to  start from scratch and we have only  boys\r\n\r\nwho just enter the university now to contend with,\r\n\r\nwe   need   less  than  eight  years  to   produce\r\n\r\nengineers.  And  if we consider again,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  our  local students are already  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity,  some  of  them nearly  graduating,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the period of eight years envisaged is  too\r\n\r\nlong.  The period can easily be shortened  without\r\n\r\nthe posts being left vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9 of the White Paper concerning the\r\n\r\nPolice  the  Government suggests a period  of  six\r\n\r\nyears  to  malayanise  the  30  posts  filled   by\r\n\r\npermanent  officers  of Deputy Superintendent  and\r\n\r\nabove.  I  feel also that this period is a  little\r\n\r\nlonger   than  necessary.  There  is  an   opinion\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  many police officers  that  perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  lack experience in certain departments,  and\r\n\r\nif  they are to take over responsible jobs in  the\r\n\r\npolice  force, they should be given  a  chance  of\r\n\r\ntraining  in  those departments  where  they  lack\r\n\r\nexperience.   If  the  Government  is   going   to\r\n\r\nimplement  this  scheme  of  Malayanisation   with\r\n\r\nregard  to  police  personnel,  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  things that it should do  would  be  to\r\n\r\nsend  our  men immediately for training  in  those\r\n\r\ndepartments with which they are not familar. I  am\r\n\r\naware,  too,  that amongst officers who  are  born\r\n\r\nlocally,   many  of  them  are  fit   for   higher\r\n\r\npromotion,  and  it  is  a  fact  that  there  are\r\n\r\nvacancies; and I see no reason why they should not\r\n\r\neven  be  promoted at this stage so that they  can\r\n\r\nacquire  more  experience and a greater  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  The  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar\r\n\r\nsuggests that some of our police officers  may  be\r\n\r\nso  discontented that they can be  incited  to  be\r\n\r\nsubversive! I do not believe in that  at  all.  In\r\n\r\nfact, I think that our police officers have always\r\n\r\nbeen  very loyal and I do not think that  anything\r\n\r\nwill move them to become subversive elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been stated in this White Paper that\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy is to give our  local  people\r\n\r\nwho   have  been  trained  a  chance  for  greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  On page 14 of  the  White  Paper,\r\n\r\nunder  Nursing  Staff, I am aware that  there  are\r\n\r\nalready four locally trained male nurses who  have\r\n\r\nreceived  the  qualification of R.M.N.  What  will\r\n\r\nhappen  to  them? It may sound somewhat  detailed,\r\n\r\nbut  in  the  White Paper it is stated that  three\r\n\r\nmale nursing staff will be retained for six years.\r\n\r\nWill  they  not be a bar to our local  people  who\r\n\r\nhave     already     acquired    the     necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications?  I  would like  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth to clarify this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I agree with the White Paper,\r\n\r\nbut,  of  course, there are defects,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  mend them, it will  receive  our\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I have long since accepted defeat\r\n\r\nin  what  might  have been termed  a  pro-colonial\r\n\r\npolicy  as  far  as  this  Assembly  is  concerned\r\n\r\nanyway,  (after all, one has to be realistic)  and\r\n\r\nanticipated that this debate would be the  concern\r\n\r\nof  elected  Members  only;  but  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong   Pagar  has  thrown  out  some  sort   of\r\n\r\nchallenge at me and I am not clear precisely  what\r\n\r\nit  is.

When  they  embarked  on  their\r\n\r\ncareers,  they  probably gave no  thought  to  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of this colony attaining early  self-government,  and at a later date few of  them  may\r\n\r\nhave  realised that the introduction of the Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution heralded the twilight of the colonial\r\n\r\npower  in  this  island.  Few,  too,  would   have\r\n\r\nrealised that men of the calibre of the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  would rise in  this  Assembly  and\r\n\r\nspeak  of  \"white men\" with the acme of bitterness\r\n\r\nin  his  voice,  as  if the white  men's  lack  of\r\n\r\npigment were at the root of all this trouble. I am\r\n\r\ntherefore glad to see, Sir, that the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government has pledged itself  to  give\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers  fair  treatment.  A   benign\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  Government is in the  process  of\r\n\r\nhanding  over  control  of Singapore  to  its  own\r\n\r\ndestiny.  In doing so, it hands over a  government\r\n\r\nmachine  in first-class working order,  a  machine\r\n\r\ndesigned   largely   by  colonial   officials   of\r\n\r\nunquestioned   integrity,  who   have   earned   a\r\n\r\nreputation for themselves for devotion to duty and\r\n\r\na reputation for zeal in their work. They have set\r\n\r\na  pattern  which one hopes will  be  followed  by\r\n\r\ntheir local successors for whom the task ahead  is\r\n\r\ncertainly not easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English phrase \"to have a chip on one's\r\n\r\nshoulder\"  is probably known to all hon.

The\r\n\r\nMalayanisation   Commission   appointed   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   also   reported   on   City   Council\r\n\r\ndepartments, and it would seem only equitable that\r\n\r\nif   the  government  agencies  are  also  to   be\r\n\r\nmalayanised  at an early date, as presumably  they\r\n\r\nmust  be, adequate protection such as is given  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill to Government expatriate officers should\r\n\r\nalso  be  extended to those officers of the  other\r\n\r\npublic  services and their rights to  compensation\r\n\r\nsafe  guarded by provisions being included in  the\r\n\r\nOrder in Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmy  dream is coming true though it will take  some\r\n\r\nten  years  more to get it finalised.  In  October\r\n\r\n1952,  Sir,  I  moved a motion in the  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil   for  Malayanisation  and  the   Ad   Hoc\r\n\r\nCommittee  took two years to publish a  report.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  expatriates knew  that  the  time  was\r\n\r\ncoming  when they had to leave. I do not know  how\r\n\r\nmany  expatriates have been appointed to the civil\r\n\r\nservice  after I moved my motion in October  1952.\r\n\r\nSomeone might query about it. Sir, I am not  sorry\r\n\r\nthat  my dream of Malayanisation will be finalised\r\n\r\nin   ten  years.  I  am  not  here  to  give   the\r\n\r\nexpatriates  a  parting  kick.  I  only  say  that\r\n\r\ncolonialism  is  coming to an  end  with  the  key\r\n\r\npositions of the civil service in the hands of the\r\n\r\nlocal  men. Let us part as friends. I do not think\r\n\r\nany Member on this side of the House is anti-white\r\n\r\nmen.  We  are  only against the white policy.  Any\r\n\r\nwhite man is welcome to trade here, but he may not\r\n\r\nbe allowed to exploit this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those expatriate officers who stay back\r\n\r\nwill,  I  hope, give their loyalty to this country\r\n\r\nand  also  give guidance to our men  who  will  be\r\n\r\ntaking  over  the  key  positions  in  the   civil\r\n\r\nservice;  for, without a good and efficient  civil\r\n\r\nservice, we might be in the same position as  some\r\n\r\nof our neighbouring countries. India, Pakistan and\r\n\r\nCeylon are carrying on as usual as if nothing  has\r\n\r\nhappened, because there was a trained local  civil\r\n\r\nservice to take over. We must retain the integrity\r\n\r\nand efficiency in our administrative service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members mentioned the judiciary and the\r\n\r\npolice.  The  control of the  judiciary  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, come automatically into our hands when  we\r\n\r\nachieve  independence, as has happened  in  India,\r\n\r\nPakistan  and  Ceylon. There are  plenty  of  able\r\n\r\npeople  who, in the past, did not join  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  because they were frustrated. I think  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able now to pick out many who,  although\r\n\r\nvery  brilliant,  would not  join  the  government\r\n\r\nservice  owing to frustration. I am sure  that  in\r\n\r\nthis connection the new Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nService  Commission with executive powers will  be\r\n\r\nable to help us a great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all Members on this side of the House will\r\n\r\nagree   with  the  Government's  White  Paper   on\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.   We  have  not   had   sufficient\r\n\r\nopportunity to study thoroughly this White  Paper,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is  one subject that I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntouch  on  at page 13. I refer to Education  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Permanent Secretary to be Malayanised forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe  post of Director of Education to be separated\r\n\r\nfrom  that of Permanent Secretary and the  present\r\n\r\nholder  to  continue  until  his  retirement.  All\r\n\r\nofficers  to  be  offered 5 years  with  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects   up  to  Director  (but  not  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary)   and   with   the   reservation   that\r\n\r\nadministrative  posts  would  also  be   open   to\r\n\r\nteachers  in non-Government schools though,  other\r\n\r\nthings  being equal, preference would be given  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  teachers; aided  school  teachers  who\r\n\r\nhave  taken an active part in politics  cannot  be\r\n\r\nconsidered for Superscale posts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  certainly  disagree with this.  These  teachers\r\n\r\nnever  knew  what was coming and  they  had  their\r\n\r\nshare,  like  anyone  else, of  politics.  In  the\r\n\r\nFederation  there is no bar to teachers  who  have\r\n\r\ntaken  part in politics from rising to the highest\r\n\r\nposts.  I do not know why we should have this  bar\r\n\r\nagainst  teachers being considered for  superscale\r\n\r\nposts  just  because  they  have  taken  part   in\r\n\r\npolitics.  When  this motion on Malayanisation  is\r\n\r\npassed  today,  I think it can be  made  clear  to\r\n\r\nthese teachers that, if they will not take part in\r\n\r\npolitics for a one- or two- or three-year  period,\r\n\r\nthey will be eligible for the superscale posts.  I\r\n\r\nthink that is very fair. We should try to be  fair\r\n\r\nto  those locally born people who have the  brains\r\n\r\nand   integrity  to  rise  to  the  top  of  their\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say this: now\r\n\r\nthat we will be taking over, we must retain,  for\r\n\r\nour  own  sake, a most efficient service  for  the\r\n\r\ngood of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

It is recognised  that\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  is  a  thorny  problem   and   has\r\n\r\nbedevilled  our relations for the past  two  years\r\n\r\nand more. It has meant months of sincere effort by\r\n\r\nresponsible    people   in   the    Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission  and  on  the  part  of  Government  to\r\n\r\nproduce  this White Paper now before you, a  White\r\n\r\nPaper  which  presents a solution that  is  sober,\r\n\r\nthat  is  adequate,  and  that  has  achieved   an\r\n\r\namicable settlement with the civil service itself.\r\n\r\nI  confess to considerable disappointment that the\r\n\r\nonly  reception  from the leaders of  the  leading\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties is tantamount to a disgruntled\r\n\r\ngrunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the policy indicated in the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper before us means that the new year will\r\n\r\nsee  a  new era for Singapore, an era when we  can\r\n\r\ngrow  to a self-consciousness and a sense of self-respect,   because   it  is   not   only   through\r\n\r\nconstitutions that people grow. It is through  the\r\n\r\nrealities of life, and the realities, Sir, are  in\r\n\r\nthe machinery of government which this White Paper\r\n\r\nhas  attempted and, I think, succeeded in meeting.\r\n\r\nFor myself, Sir, I would like to say that I warmly\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  policy indicated in the White  Paper\r\n\r\nand I would like to congratulate the Government on\r\n\r\na  magnificient achievement and an excellent  plan\r\n\r\nfor an essential part of our work as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paragraph 12 of the White Paper, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to say this. I am not averse to generosity. I\r\n\r\nam  not  averse to it particularly if it  means  a\r\n\r\nharmonious   transfer  of  power,  and   I   think\r\n\r\nSingapore can take the palm in being more generous\r\n\r\nthan  any  other  territory in the  world  in  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  it  is  giving  for  the   so-called\r\n\r\nelement   of   interference   in   a   career,   a\r\n\r\ncompensation  averaging  $43,000  per   expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer. I wish I could find myself an employer so\r\n\r\ngenerous. Sir, I refer to it only from this  point\r\n\r\nof view - that the Government in paragraph 12 of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper expresses a sense of alarm  that\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers who receive  this  remarkably\r\n\r\ngenerous Christmas gift would see to it that  they\r\n\r\ntake  it  as soon as they can, free of income  tax\r\n\r\nplus  full pension, and try and build a  new  life\r\n\r\nelsewhere, irrespective of the need of the  people\r\n\r\nof  this country. The Chief Minister has said, and\r\n\r\nsaid rightly, that we should never stop a man from\r\n\r\nleaving  our employment if he so wishes.  That  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  Sir,  but  a man who leaves  my  employment\r\n\r\nagainst  my wish does not get by way of  thanks  a\r\n\r\ncheque  for  $43,000. It is suggested,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthat  dismissal interferes with his career.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot going to argue the pros and cons, Sir. This is\r\n\r\nnot  the  time. This is the time when  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nexpress  the gladness which I feel at the solution\r\n\r\nof  a problem, a solution that is essential to our\r\n\r\nfuture growth. If I dismiss him, then by all means\r\n\r\nlet him receive compensation; but if he leaves  me\r\n\r\nagainst   my  will,  I  cannot  see  how   it   is\r\n\r\nconceivably proper that he should consider himself\r\n\r\nentitled  to compensation. I know it is  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  very  act of creating a Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  is  an interference of  so  radical  a\r\n\r\ncharacter with the conditions of service that this\r\n\r\ncompensation accrues. I say, Sir, that that is  so\r\n\r\nthin  an  argument that it must be a  very  thick-skinned man who puts it forward. I say, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should  consider  either  denying\r\n\r\nwholly  or  denying  in part the  compensation  to\r\n\r\nthose who leave the service prior to the date when\r\n\r\nit  is  convenient for the Government to agree  to\r\n\r\nthe  termination. We cannot too soon  replace  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  officers,  but  we  can  and  must\r\n\r\nretain those with technical qualifications whom we\r\n\r\ncannot today replace, because of a colonial policy\r\n\r\nin   respect  of  the  civil  service.  If   those\r\n\r\ntechnical  officers take their  compensation and\r\n\r\nleave, then it means that this country would be in\r\n\r\na   position  of  having  to  re-employ  them   at\r\n\r\nexaggerated salaries and inflated allowances until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  as we are ready with our  own  men-and\r\n\r\nthey  thus get it both ways. This country is being\r\n\r\nasked   to  be  generous - $21.4  million  for   500\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers. Surely we can make it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na condition that payment of this compensation will\r\n\r\nonly  be  made  if  the officer's  termination  of\r\n\r\nemployment  is  in  conformity  with  Government's\r\n\r\nrequirements? If we want him to leave at  the  end\r\n\r\nof  five years and he wants to leave us at the end\r\n\r\nof six months, by all means let him leave; but why\r\n\r\nshould he get compensation when he knows that  his\r\n\r\nleaving  puts  us  to considerable  inconvenience?\r\n\r\nWhy, Sir? Why should we place ourselves to such an\r\n\r\nextent  in the hands of the civil service?  I  can\r\n\r\nsee no reason, Sir. I do not mind surrendering  to\r\n\r\nthe  civil service - I am glad that we can  part  on\r\n\r\nfriendly terms. It costs us $21.4 million - that  is\r\n\r\ncheap  enough - but  why  must  we  so  wholly   put\r\n\r\nourselves  in  their hands that we have  to  plead\r\n\r\nwith  them to stay, when we can say to them, quite\r\n\r\nsimply,  \"If you want to go, goodbye; but  if  you\r\n\r\nwant to go before we are ready to let you, then do\r\n\r\nnot  expect  a Christmas cake.\" That is  the  only\r\n\r\ncriticism  which I have to make in  respect  of  a\r\n\r\nplan which I respect and salute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to deal with some comments which the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar made, and  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  strictures of a most unpleasant character  on\r\n\r\nour  police force. He took it upon himself to call\r\n\r\nthe  Asian police officers cowards, because  they,\r\n\r\nwith  their knowledge, their experience and  their\r\n\r\nsense  of  responsibility,  did  not  see  fit  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  the submissions made on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nforce by the Commissioner of Police in respect  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation. Sir, I think it  is  true  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  there  has  never  been  any  suggestion  of\r\n\r\ncowardice  in respect of our police force  at  any\r\n\r\ntime,  that, in fact, in recent weeks we have  had\r\n\r\ncause  to respect and admire their courage,  their\r\n\r\nfortitude  and  their sense of  responsibility  in\r\n\r\nthis  territory. I can but regret that  a  person,\r\n\r\nwho  suggests  that not only is he  a  responsible\r\n\r\nMember  of this House but the leader of his Party,\r\n\r\nshould  make  a stricture of that character  on  a\r\n\r\nremarkably  fine body of men because they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to gallop as fast as he does. It seems  that\r\n\r\nanybody  who does not agree with the P.A.P. is  a\r\n\r\ncoward. Sir, it may well be that the experience of\r\n\r\nthe next few years of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  may  indicate the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nmore rapid Malayanisation in the police force, and\r\n\r\nI  know  that the Government Benches would welcome\r\n\r\nthat  day;  and  if  that  day  should  come,  we,\r\n\r\nwhichever side of the House we may be occupying - if\r\n\r\nwe occupy any side at all - would only welcome it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of the speeches made\r\n\r\nthis morning to which I wish to refer, and that is\r\n\r\nthe  reference  to the judges. The  Labour  Front,\r\n\r\nboth  in  the  inter-Party meetings prior  to  the\r\n\r\nMerdeka talks last April and at the constitutional\r\n\r\nconference  in  London,  made  it  clear  that  we\r\n\r\nconsidered  the principle of the inviolability  of\r\n\r\nthe  security  of tenure of judges was  one  which\r\n\r\nshould  be respected, if our wishes were respected\r\n\r\nthat  no  further judges would be  appointed  from\r\n\r\namongst  the expatriate officers. Sir, the  judges\r\n\r\nwho  now grace our Bench have served us well. They\r\n\r\ncarry a remarkably fine tradition that has brought\r\n\r\nto  these  shores  one of the finest  institutions\r\n\r\nknown  to  humanity today; and I, for  one,  would\r\n\r\nregret  any suggestion of dragging them  into  the\r\n\r\npolitical  arena. I would particularly regret  any\r\n\r\nattempt by the Secretary of State for the Colonies\r\n\r\nwho sometimes finds it so hard to learn the lesson\r\n\r\nthat  he  is living in the 1950's and not  in  the\r\n\r\n1850's  ,  . . I would regret it very much  if  he\r\n\r\ncompels  this  country  to drag  the  question  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  tenure of judges into the  political\r\n\r\narena  by  appointing further  expatriate  judges.\r\n\r\nThis House has passed the Budget provision for  an\r\n\r\nadditional  judge and the matter is  certainly  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  the  Governor  who  will  act   in\r\n\r\nconformity  with  the orders of the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState. I would like to give this assurance: So far\r\n\r\nas  I am aware today, the Labour Front, as a body,\r\n\r\nbelieves that the security of tenure of the judges\r\n\r\nshould   not   be  interfered  with,  unless   the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State  for the  Colonies  sees  fit\r\n\r\nhimself  to  endanger  that  security  by   riding\r\n\r\nroughshod over the wishes of the people repeatedly\r\n\r\nexpressed in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final word, Sir. The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nhas  made  much  of the fear, which  he  seems  to\r\n\r\nentertain, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  machinery of government might break down.  If\r\n\r\nhe  has  doubts about the adequacy  of  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice   to  the  opportunities  which  are   now\r\n\r\noffering,  I  believe he is the only  Malayan  who\r\n\r\ndoes have them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are you a Malayan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> A great deal more than you are.\r\n\r\nYour right to stand for election was in doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

They come, Sir, as people  who  have\r\n\r\nstruggled and sweated, who know the value  of  the\r\n\r\nprize  which is theirs, and the opportunity  which\r\n\r\nis  theirs;  and  I, for one, Sir,  have  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest  doubt, not only that the  machinery  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  will  function,  but  that   it   will\r\n\r\nfunction with more dynamism and more sincerity  in\r\n\r\nits  application to the welfare of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  whole, I think this Malayanisation scheme\r\n\r\nproduced today is a fair and comprehensive one and\r\n\r\nshould  be  acceptable to most of  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Even the leader of the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty has found very few holes to pick in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one aspect, Sir, on which I wish to\r\n\r\nspeak today, and that is with regard to the rather\r\n\r\nunpleasant recriminations and remarks made  during\r\n\r\nthe  Malayanisation enquiry. I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nall  members of the service who were attacked will\r\n\r\nrealise  that  this  was  due  to  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nfrustration  and struggle which the local  service\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  to put up with for these many years. Now that\r\n\r\nwe  have produced a comprehensive scheme,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  those officers who will be leaving  us  will\r\n\r\nextend  their help and forget all those unpleasant\r\n\r\nthings  that were said and give as much  of  their\r\n\r\nexperience as possible to those who will be taking\r\n\r\nover from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the young men in the service who will be\r\n\r\ntaking over the public service, I have this to say\r\n\r\nto  them. Their opportunities are tremendous. Such\r\n\r\nopportunities  for advancement  and  promotion  to\r\n\r\npositions  of responsibility I do not  think  will\r\n\r\noccur again. I exhort them to treat this not as an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for personal advancement,  but  as  a\r\n\r\ndedication  to the service of this country.  At  a\r\n\r\ntime  when we are working towards the basis of  an\r\n\r\nindependent  nation, I hope that  they  will  work\r\n\r\nhard and make Singapore worthy of its independence\r\n\r\nwhen  we  achieve it and also worthy  of  being  a\r\n\r\nmember of the family of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Government White Paper on Malayanisation\r\n\r\ndeserves  support.  It has made  Malayanisation  a\r\n\r\nreality.  It is real enough to concern  those  who\r\n\r\ndid   everything   to   sabotage   it   and   give\r\n\r\nsatisfaction to those who fought hard  and  longed\r\n\r\nfor it. The White Paper marks the culmination of a\r\n\r\nlong  struggle  begun  many  years  ago  by  local\r\n\r\nofficers  as well as others to break  one  of  the\r\n\r\ntightest monopolies in this country - the expatriate\r\n\r\ncivil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a year ago, Malayanisation on the scale\r\n\r\ncontemplated  by the White Paper would  have  been\r\n\r\ndismissed as impossible. Certainly those political\r\n\r\nleaders  who  graced the old Legislative  Council,\r\n\r\nmost   of   whom  have  now  gone  into  unwilling\r\n\r\npolitical  retirement, would have  found  a  White\r\n\r\nPaper such as this one a dangerous document.  This\r\n\r\nchanged  outlook has come about in  a  very  short\r\n\r\ntime. This is symptomatic of the times in which we\r\n\r\nlive. We are losing our fear of change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain, Sir, there will be broad agreement\r\n\r\nwith the scheme of Malayanisation indicated by the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne  can quarrel that in certain departments,  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Department, for instance, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas been over-cautious, but the essential thing is\r\n\r\nthat   the   key  posts  are  to  be   malayanised\r\n\r\nimmediately - and quite correctly. This will ensure,\r\n\r\nSir, that local officers will be in a position  to\r\n\r\nguide  the civil service and assist in the  making\r\n\r\nof  policy. Whether, in fact, this will be so will\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the  character, the  ability  and  the\r\n\r\noutlook  of  the  local officers who  will  occupy\r\n\r\nthese  key  posts.  If the local  officer  regards\r\n\r\nhimself  as  a  local version  of  the  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer  whom  he  replaces,  then  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nbecomes  meaningless. It is merely an exchange  of\r\n\r\nthe  white  heaven-born for the black heaven-born.\r\n\r\nThere   is   nothing  more  revolting   and   more\r\n\r\ndisgusting  than the sight of a black  expatriate.\r\n\r\nFor Malayanisation to succeed, it is not enough to\r\n\r\nreplace the expatriates with local officers. There\r\n\r\nmust be a new outlook and a sense of dedication on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the local officers. May I quote, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe concluding words of the Majority Report of the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission to remind ourselves  and\r\n\r\nthe   local  officers  of  the  real  meaning   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Malayanisation of the Public Service can only be\r\n\r\na  success  if  all  concerned  regard  it  as  an\r\n\r\nexpression  of  patriotic service. Local  officers\r\n\r\nmust  not  consider this an opportunity for  self-advancement  but rather an opportunity  for  self-sacrifice. They should not expect to see an end to\r\n\r\nall  their problems but rather a beginning to many\r\n\r\ngreater  problems  and  they  must  face  the  new\r\n\r\nproblems  and  difficulties that will  arise  with\r\n\r\ncourage  and  determination to do  their  duty  in\r\n\r\nspite  of the sacrifices they will be called  upon\r\n\r\nto make.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Without  this  sense of dedication, Malayanisation\r\n\r\nwill become a humiliating scramble for spoils. The\r\n\r\nWhite    Paper   merely   opens   the   door    to\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.  The completion of  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nwill rest, to a great extent, in the hands of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  officers.  They  must  translate  the  high\r\n\r\nintentions of the White Paper into action.  It  is\r\n\r\nessential, Sir, that key posts should go to men of\r\n\r\ntalent and men of dedication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reconstituted Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  decisive  say  in  the  choice   of\r\n\r\npersonnel,  it is vital that this body  should  be\r\n\r\nconstituted of men who understand and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappreciate the purposes of Malayanisation. If  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission is composed  of  weak,\r\n\r\ntimid  and servile fumblers, then the result  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  civil  service tainted with  the  timidity,\r\n\r\nservility and futility of those who choose them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point here, Sir, on which the\r\n\r\nGovernment needs to be criticised severely. It  is\r\n\r\non the question of compensation. We all agree that\r\n\r\nofficers whose careers have been cut short  should\r\n\r\nreceive  some  compensation.  This  obligation  is\r\n\r\nmoral  rather than legal; but there is a world  of\r\n\r\ndifference between a just compensation and  lavish\r\n\r\nbaksheesh. A moral obligation should not be made a\r\n\r\npretext for unbridled generosity at the taxpayers'\r\n\r\nexpense.  We do not grudge reasonable compensation\r\n\r\nto abolished officers, but why should we make them\r\n\r\nlottery   winners?   On  what   basis   was   this\r\n\r\ncompensation computed, and who computed it? It  is\r\n\r\nnot  compensation but downright plunder. I  cannot\r\n\r\nblame  the expatriate officer, Sir, for attempting\r\n\r\nto  get  as much as he can by way of compensation,\r\n\r\nbut  even he must have been surprised at the  size\r\n\r\nof  the give-away. Sir, I cannot accept the  scale\r\n\r\nof compensation offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Government has given a  lot  of\r\n\r\nthought  to  the  question  of  implementing   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Malayanisation Commission's\r\n\r\nReport  and has in its White Paper paid due regard\r\n\r\nto the efficiency of the public service during the\r\n\r\ntransition period. It is good to know,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nsomething   is  at  last  being  done  to   enable\r\n\r\nofficers,  who have never had the good fortune  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  a  university, to earn  promotion  to  the\r\n\r\nhighest  post if they prove, by their  experience,\r\n\r\nto  be  worthy of promotion. In the police  force,\r\n\r\nSir, there is now to be a ladder of promotion from\r\n\r\nthe  rank and file to the highest post, and direct\r\n\r\nentry  to the rank of Assistant Superintendent  of\r\n\r\nPolice  and above is to be abolished.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nmove in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation offered by Government to the\r\n\r\nexpatriate   officers  is,  in  my  opinion,   too\r\n\r\ngenerous.  These officers are very lucky  to  have\r\n\r\ncome  to this country after the last war with  the\r\n\r\nBritish  military forces and to  have  found  jobs\r\n\r\nhere.  They  did  not  possess the  qualifications\r\n\r\nrequired of local officers and were lucky to  find\r\n\r\njobs  which they would never have dreamt to obtain\r\n\r\nif  they  had  remained at home.  They  have  been\r\n\r\ngenerously paid for the work that they  have  done\r\n\r\nand  are  now  to be compensated for the  loss  of\r\n\r\nemployment.  I do not see any justification,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin   these  officers  receiving  more  than   what\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers elsewhere received  when  they\r\n\r\nhad to leave the service on account of merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

If there is to be an\r\n\r\nintervention, it should be made properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> With regard to the chest physicians,\r\n\r\nSir,  we have four posts now and one more has been\r\n\r\npassed for 1957. Of those four posts, two are held\r\n\r\nby  expatriates  of considerable  experience,  and\r\n\r\nwith the tremendous advance that we are making  in\r\n\r\nT.B. treatment, more and more will be needed next\r\n\r\nyear  and  the  years  to  come.  I  can  see   no\r\n\r\nlikelihood  that  the  retention  of   these   two\r\n\r\nexpatriates, if they are willing to stay, will  in\r\n\r\nany  way  block  the advancement of local  medical\r\n\r\nofficers. During the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext  few  days there will be an addition  of  408\r\n\r\nbeds  to  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital and another  408\r\n\r\nbeds  later, in addition to the 500 existing beds,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total of 1,316 beds; and  when  certain\r\n\r\naccommodation is released - it is now being occupied\r\n\r\nby nurses - we will have a total of 1,100 beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the remaining posts, two are being held by\r\n\r\nlocal   officers.  One  of  the  posts  has   been\r\n\r\nearmarked to be a superscale key post in  the  new\r\n\r\nT.B. unit  the  operation of  which  we  hope  to\r\n\r\ncommence next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept, of course, the excuse of the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar when he said that he  had  not  had\r\n\r\nsufficient   time   to   study   the   scheme   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation of the medical service, and when he\r\n\r\nhas done so, I do not think he will have any cause\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to say that our officers have  to  wait\r\n\r\nten  years  before they can occupy key posts.  The\r\n\r\noffer  of ten years further service to these chest\r\n\r\nphysicians has been criticised, but I can  see  no\r\n\r\nground  for  criticism. As I have said before,  of\r\n\r\nthe  four  posts of chest physician, two  will  be\r\n\r\nvacant  and additional posts will be required.  It\r\n\r\nis   not   therefore  a  question   of   retaining\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers who stand in the way  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  officers, but rather of retaining  what  we\r\n\r\nneed   until   sufficient   local   officers   are\r\n\r\navailable.  It  is  quite obvious  that  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in our T.B. work, a considerable  number\r\n\r\nof consultant posts will be required and all these\r\n\r\nwill  be  subsequently filled, and filled shortly,\r\n\r\nby available officers. We need all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon spoke a lot about the\r\n\r\ntime  when  local officers had to wait five  years\r\n\r\nand ten years and so forth before they could reach\r\n\r\na super-scale post, and that they were frustrated.\r\n\r\nI  agree with him, but I can only remind him  that\r\n\r\nthat was at a time when the Government was claimed\r\n\r\nto be predominantly \"Progressive\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of six years to the Pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nChemist  was criticised by the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar. There are three posts in that department of\r\n\r\nwhich two are vacant, and we shall certainly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed that one expatriate officer for six years  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  rate of expansion  of  the  medical\r\n\r\nservice today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon also criticised the\r\n\r\nretention  of  male  nurses  for  six  years.  The\r\n\r\nposition  here is that we have two superscale  and\r\n\r\nnine  time-scale appointments, and two  additional\r\n\r\nposts  have been entered in next year's estimates.\r\n\r\nFour of these posts are vacant. It has proved very\r\n\r\ndifficult to find local candidates for training as\r\n\r\nmale nurses since work in the Woodbridge Hospital\r\n\r\nis  not  popular. With the expansion of Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital,  it is undoubtedly necessary  to  retain\r\n\r\nthe four expatriate male nurses for six years,  if\r\n\r\nwe  can, and there are plenty of vacancies for our\r\n\r\nlocal officers. They will all be absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang said that Government was\r\n\r\nover-cautious regarding the medical service. I  am\r\n\r\nglad  he said so because I wish to agree with him.\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   to   be   extremely   cautious,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the Ministry of Health, because  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  health and the lives of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to look after, and, as long as I  am  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of this Ministry, I will certainly see  to\r\n\r\nit  that  we  give of the best we can. Should  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar  and  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  or their family have ever the  need - God\r\n\r\nforbid!  (to  use  an  expression  which  is  very\r\n\r\npopular  with  the  Member for  Tanjong  Pagar) - of\r\n\r\ngoing to our hospitals for attention, and did  not\r\n\r\nreceive  the  best, I am certain that  they  would\r\n\r\ntake  the first plane out to another country where\r\n\r\nthey would get more adequate service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar stated that, in  his\r\n\r\nview,  it was wrong not to appoint a local officer\r\n\r\nto be Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and head\r\n\r\nof   the  civil  service.  Sir,  as  explained  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  3  of the White Paper, we have  adopted\r\n\r\nthe   arrangement  of  two  senior  officers,  one\r\n\r\nresponsible for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinance and the other for personnel, as being  the\r\n\r\nmost  practical  immediate arrangement,  and  have\r\n\r\nstated that subsequently it may be found desirable\r\n\r\nto have one Permanent Secretary to the Treasury of\r\n\r\na  higher grade than the corresponding officers in\r\n\r\nthe other Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar also touched on\r\n\r\nthe   judiciary.  Sir,  the  judiciary  has   been\r\n\r\ndeliberately omitted from the White Paper  because\r\n\r\ntheir position is a matter for discussion with the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State when constitutional talks  are\r\n\r\nreopened early next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar, too, Sir, touched\r\n\r\non the police. The Government was unable to accept\r\n\r\nthe Malayanisation Commission's recommendation for\r\n\r\ncomplete  Malayanisation of the  police  force  in\r\n\r\nthree years, because this would mean promotion  of\r\n\r\nthe  most senior local officers from four to  five\r\n\r\nranks  to  take over the top positions.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe immediate loss of half of its officer strength\r\n\r\nwould  mean denuding the ranks of the inspectorate\r\n\r\nof  all its experienced officers in order to  fill\r\n\r\nthe  resulting vacancies in the ranks of Assistant\r\n\r\nSuperintendent. We have therefore accepted the run-down  of  expatriate officers  put  forth  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police which will be completed  by\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  1962. It must not  be  assumed  that\r\n\r\nbecause  30  expatriate officers in  the  rank  of\r\n\r\nDeputy  Superintendent of  Police  and  above  are\r\n\r\nbeing  offered continued employment for six years,\r\n\r\nthey  will  all remain for that period.  A  number\r\n\r\nwill, in any case, reach the age of retirement and\r\n\r\nwe  must  expect that others will  either  opt  to\r\n\r\nretire   or  be  transferred  on  promotion.   Our\r\n\r\nproblem,   therefore,  was  to   ensure   that   a\r\n\r\nsufficient number of these 30 officers  remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  force until our local officers were ready  to\r\n\r\ntake  over completely. It is for this reason  that\r\n\r\nwe   have   offered   continued  employment   with\r\n\r\npromotion prospects for six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot believe that the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  really  intended the reflections  which  he\r\n\r\ncast  upon the courage and integrity of our  local\r\n\r\npolice officers. They have shown on many occasions\r\n\r\nthat they are second to none in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  world, not only in their professional ability\r\n\r\nbut also in their personal courage and integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the Member for Tanjong Pagar and the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon stated that while they  gave\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  their  general  approval,  they\r\n\r\ncriticised the detailed decisions recorded in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule.  I  must make it clear,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  recorded in the Schedule are the  basis\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  informing the expatriate  officers\r\n\r\nconcerned  of the length of period for which  they\r\n\r\ncan  continue to serve. This must be  done  almost\r\n\r\nimmediately  and  there can be no  going  back  on\r\n\r\nassurances once they have been given. It would  be\r\n\r\nunreasonable to ask the officers concerned to make\r\n\r\ntheir  decision unless they could be assured  that\r\n\r\nthe details in the Schedule are firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated Member Mr Sutherland touched on\r\n\r\nthe  question of Malayanisation in such bodies  as\r\n\r\nthe  City Council, the Singapore Harbour Board and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board. Sir, it would  not\r\n\r\nbe  proper  for  the Government  to  commit  these\r\n\r\nbodies.  Furthermore, it must  not  be  overlooked\r\n\r\nthat the terms and conditions of employment of the\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers in these bodies are  not  the\r\n\r\nsame as those applicable to expatriate officers in\r\n\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hon.

Hitherto  the\r\n\r\nrate  has  always been 2 per cent and the Trustees\r\n\r\nrecommend  no  change in the rate  for  1957.  The\r\n\r\napproval  of  the Assembly is again  required  for\r\n\r\nthis   rate   under   the  Singapore   Improvement\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  This rate, which is  in  lieu  of  the\r\n\r\nImprovement Rate referred to in section 59 of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance,  is collected  by  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and paid over half-yearly to  the  Trust.\r\n\r\nThe  money  from  this  rate,  together  with  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  Government contribution under  section\r\n\r\n23  of  the  Singapore Improvement  Ordinance,  is\r\n\r\nestimated at $2,000,900 and forms one of the major\r\n\r\nitems of revenue of the Trust and is paid into the\r\n\r\nImprovement  Fund.  These  moneys  are  spent   on\r\n\r\nimprovement  schemes,  the  rehousing  of  persons\r\n\r\ndehoused   under  this  scheme,  the  opening   of\r\n\r\nbacklanes,  the  provision  of  open   spaces   in\r\n\r\ncongested  areas, and generally on the maintenance\r\n\r\nof the general improvement plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.

Members are aware, the Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard  was set up in 1955 to operate the telephone\r\n\r\nundertaking which Government had acquired from the\r\n\r\nOriental Telephone and Electrical Company Limited.\r\n\r\nThe Board is charged with the task of providing an\r\n\r\nefficient  telephone service  for  the  public  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is  given wide powers  under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  carry out this task. Since  it  was\r\n\r\nestablished, the Board has set itself to  push  on\r\n\r\nwith the forward policy of expansion. Following up\r\n\r\nplans  prepared  by  the  Oriental  Telephone  and\r\n\r\nElectrical Company, the Singapore telephone system\r\n\r\nwas doubled in its capacity between 1950 and 1955.\r\n\r\nIn  the  succeeding five years up to 1960,  it  is\r\n\r\nplanned  to double the capacity once more and,  at\r\n\r\nthe   same   time,   looking   ahead   to   future\r\n\r\nrequirements  to provide a basis for  even  larger\r\n\r\nextensions  in  the  years to come.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this policy, a five-year programme  has\r\n\r\nbeen drawn up covering work to be undertaken up to\r\n\r\n1960.  In  accordance with this programme,  it  is\r\n\r\nplanned that in 1957 the North Exchange in Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad,  the  Queenstown  Exchange, and  the  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  Exchange will be completed. In 1958  work\r\n\r\nwill  be finished on the City Exchange and on  the\r\n\r\nextensions  to the Central Exchange and  the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar Exchange. By 1959 it is hoped that exchanges\r\n\r\nwill  be  completed at Tanjong Katong and possibly\r\n\r\nNee  Soon  and  Jurong. This is a very  large  and\r\n\r\nexpensive  programme  and it has  been  calculated\r\n\r\nthat,  in order to finance it, the Telephone Board\r\n\r\nwill require between now and the end of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1959  $15  million  over  and  above  any  revenue\r\n\r\nsurplus  that may be available from year to  year.\r\n\r\nOf  this  $15 million, $5 million will be required\r\n\r\nlate  in  1956 or early in 1957, and  the  balance\r\n\r\nover  the next two years as the progress  of  work\r\n\r\ndemands.  In  this connection, Sir, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board has requested that it  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  draw  the money as  and  when  it  is\r\n\r\nactually required, so that interest will not  fall\r\n\r\ndue  to be paid in advance of the actual need  for\r\n\r\nexpenditure. This is the practice followed at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time in respect of loans to the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust and is, of course, acceptable to\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's investment in new buildings and\r\n\r\nequipment will show early financial returns. There\r\n\r\nis  a  steady demand for new telephone facilities,\r\n\r\nand there is no doubt that the increased number of\r\n\r\nsubscribers,  as  each  new  exchange  comes  into\r\n\r\naction,  will  mean a steady rise in  the  Board's\r\n\r\ndisposable income. As far as can be foreseen,  the\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board  should  have  no  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  the  annual installments of the  loan  by\r\n\r\n1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of financing the Board,\r\n\r\nit  has  been  decided that funds for  development\r\n\r\nshould  be  provided by Government, and  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  should  not, for the present at  any  rate,\r\n\r\nmake  any  independent effort to raise funds  from\r\n\r\nthe  public. Financial requirements for the  Board\r\n\r\nhave been taken into account in Government's plans\r\n\r\nfor  capital development over the next five years,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  mentioned  when  introducing  the   1957\r\n\r\nAppropriation Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the terms of the loan, it is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that interest at the rate  of  5\ufffd  per\r\n\r\ncent  will  be fair and reasonable in the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  The loan will  be  repaid  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod   of   20   years  by  annual  installments\r\n\r\ncalculated  on  the  annuity basis.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nmethod  of  repayment adopted in  the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nrecent  loan  to the Singapore Improvement  Trust.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves of the loan by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the Singapore Telephone Board  of  a\r\n\r\nsum not exceeding $15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillions  at an interest rate of 5\ufffd per  cent  per\r\n\r\nannum  repayable over a period of twenty years  by\r\n\r\nhalf  yearly  installments based  on  the  annuity\r\n\r\nmethod  to be secured by a legal mortgage  of  the\r\n\r\nproperties  and assets belonging to and  to  which\r\n\r\nthe  Board  holds legal title for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ncapital   expenditure  on  the  Board's  expansion\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 63 of 1956)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.

Dr Benham requires no introduction  to\r\n\r\nhon.  Members.

We in this House are very much in the\r\n\r\ndark as to what exactly are the duties of such  an\r\n\r\nEconomic  Adviser.  We do know that  the  previous\r\n\r\nEconomic  Adviser  produced a number  of  reports,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Report of the Committee on  Minimum\r\n\r\nStandards  of  Livelihood. But we  would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow: first, why this item was not included in the\r\n\r\nnormal Budget Estimates if the post was considered\r\n\r\na permanent one; and, secondly, why it is proposed\r\n\r\nto engage,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever internationally well known that person may\r\n\r\nbe, an Economic Adviser at the prohibitive salary\r\n\r\nof no less than $4,000 a month?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, first of all, on the question of\r\n\r\nthe duties of the Economic Adviser, these are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to  examine and advise on all matters  of\r\n\r\neconomic and financial importance to the Colony of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as  may be directed for  investigation\r\n\r\neither  by  the Chief Minister or the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters or by the Financial Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question why provision was not\r\n\r\nmade  in  the normal Budget Estimates, it is  only\r\n\r\nvery recently that we have been able to obtain the\r\n\r\nservices  of Dr Benham.

In the autumn sums which are required\r\n\r\nbut which could not be foreseen are introduced  in\r\n\r\na  Supplementary  Budget.  But  it  has  been  the\r\n\r\npractice, in pre-Rendel days, and for the whole of\r\n\r\nthe last session of this Assembly we allowed it to\r\n\r\npass unnoticed, to put in a supplementary vote  at\r\n\r\nalmost every sitting of this Assembly. Sir, barely\r\n\r\none  month  from the Budget debates, we are  today\r\n\r\npresented with two supplementary votes of about  a\r\n\r\nmillion   dollars.   None  of   these   items   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  could be said to  have  been  in  the\r\n\r\n\"could-not-be-foreseen\" category. Every item  that\r\n\r\nappears   here - from  the  provision  of   Economic\r\n\r\nAdviser  to  the Chief Minister, to the  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister  on  to the confidential stenographer  to\r\n\r\nthe  Assistant Minister - could have been  foreseen\r\n\r\nand should have been included in the Budget, which\r\n\r\nis  the proper time for discussion and debate.  We\r\n\r\nmust oppose this practice, on principle, of having\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  of this country debated piecemeal  at\r\n\r\nevery sitting of this Assembly. Sir, the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary should understand that the House expects\r\n\r\nat  the  beginning  of each fiscal  year  to  know\r\n\r\nexactly  what it is asked to vote for, how  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  spent, and does not  expect  to  be\r\n\r\napproached  at  every  sitting  with  items  which\r\n\r\nshould  have  been foreseen but were  not,  either\r\n\r\nthrough   negligence  or  carelessness  or   sheer\r\n\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, the first point is that it is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that throughout the year  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmake  applications  for funds for  services  which\r\n\r\ncould  not be foreseen at the time the Budget  was\r\n\r\ndrawn  up.  Preparation of the  Budget  starts  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  of each year for the following year.  It\r\n\r\nis printed for the first time at the end of August\r\n\r\nand  any corrections are subsequently made. It  is\r\n\r\nnot very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neasy after the first printing of the Estimates  to\r\n\r\nmake  many  corrections and it is inevitable  that\r\n\r\nmany  services which are required in the following\r\n\r\nyear  are left out of the Estimates. That  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue  of  Singapore  alone; it  happens  in  every\r\n\r\ncountry in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of applications for\r\n\r\nsupplementary  vote,  we  have  achieved  a   very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  reduction this  year  in  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  any previous year, and the hon. Member  will\r\n\r\nfind this to be true if he compares the totals  of\r\n\r\nthe  last  Schedule for 1955 and the last Schedule\r\n\r\nfor 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable that things which should have\r\n\r\nbeen   foreseen   are  omitted.   We   cannot   be\r\n\r\nomniscient. We cannot foresee everything.  We  are\r\n\r\nliable  to  make  mistakes, as  perhaps  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember is. On the other hand, I do not think there\r\n\r\nare  many occasions when we have to come  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  ask  for funds for  services  which\r\n\r\ncould have been foreseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as regards the method of presentation of\r\n\r\nthese  applications for supplementary vote, before\r\n\r\nthe new constitution came into being we considered\r\n\r\nvery    carefully   what   procedure   we   should\r\n\r\nfollow - whether we should proceed on the  lines  of\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom Government where the Government\r\n\r\noperate  a  very,  very large Civil  Contingencies\r\n\r\nVote. It is from that vote that the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  spend money on all the services  which\r\n\r\nare  similar  to those for which we ask  funds  in\r\n\r\nthese Sessional Papers; and towards the end of the\r\n\r\nyear, in the autumn, when the Government brings up\r\n\r\na  Supplementary Budget, it is merely to  ask  for\r\n\r\nfunds to meet the services which have already been\r\n\r\npaid for from the Civil Contingencies Vote and  to\r\n\r\nmake good the total of that vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that in future this Government will\r\n\r\noperate on the principle followed by the House  of\r\n\r\nCommons, but I thought in March 1955 that it would\r\n\r\nbe  better  for the time being if we proceeded  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of Sessional Papers rather than on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of a Supplementary Budget once or  twice  a\r\n\r\nyear.  This procedure does keep Members  in  touch\r\n\r\nwith the course of expenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincurred by the Government for services which they\r\n\r\nsupply, and Members are not kept in the dark for a\r\n\r\nperiod   of   nine   months   until   the    first\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Budget comes  up.  I  still  think,\r\n\r\nafter   an  experience  of  18  months   of   this\r\n\r\nprocedure, that it is the best procedure which  we\r\n\r\ncan  have  at  the present time. As I  have  said,\r\n\r\nperhaps  in the future we will adopt the House  of\r\n\r\nCommons procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, I do feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  answer given by the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nhas  not  entirely convinced me. He  has  admitted\r\n\r\nthat there was an oversight in the case of Head  7\r\n\r\nand  I  suspect that it may have been the case  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of Head 8 and Head D 49. I do feel  there\r\n\r\nis  something  wrong  with a  procedure  by  which\r\n\r\nwithin one fortnight of the Budget sittings we are\r\n\r\nasked to pass a further $150,000 for 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> With regard to the cases which my hon.\r\n\r\nFriend the Member for Tanglin has mentioned, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  that  dealing  with the appointment  of  Dr\r\n\r\nBenham,  it  was really a matter of  printing  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  If  my  memory  serves,  I  think   my\r\n\r\ncolleague  the  Assistant Minister  in  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary's  Ministry  was appointed  sometime  in\r\n\r\nOctober.  By  that time, we realised,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthat funds would be required to pay his salary for\r\n\r\n1957   and  it  was  suggested  to  me  that   the\r\n\r\nprovision   might  be  included  in   the   Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates. In fact, it was suggested that we might\r\n\r\nmove  in  Committee of Supply that an addition  be\r\n\r\nmade to the Estimates, and it was my decision then\r\n\r\nthat  we  would  come  with  an  application  for\r\n\r\nsupplementary  provision at the  last  sitting  of\r\n\r\nthis year to obtain funds rather than to alter the\r\n\r\nEstimates  and  cause  the  Printer  yet   further\r\n\r\ntrouble.

The Chief Minister,  in  his\r\n\r\nreply, sought to minimise the actions that private\r\n\r\nemployers  were taking against their  workers.  In\r\n\r\nthe five weeks since that debate, I regret to have\r\n\r\nto  inform  the  House that there have  been  more\r\n\r\ncases  of  flagrant  abuse by employers  of  their\r\n\r\nposition   of   strength  as  a  result   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's purge. Those affected are  mostly  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bus  Workers Union and the Shop  and  Factory\r\n\r\nWorkers  Union.  In the case of  the  Bus  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion, Members in this House will recall that  the\r\n\r\nBus  Owners Association, shortly after our debate,\r\n\r\ndecided that the agreement with their union was no\r\n\r\nlonger  valid  because, technically, they  claimed\r\n\r\nthe  workers  had  broken  a  condition  of  their\r\n\r\nagreement  by going on a lightning strike  without\r\n\r\nnotice.  Fortunately,  the  intervention  of   the\r\n\r\nMember for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) with  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Bus Owners Association prevented\r\n\r\nthe bus owners from going through with this folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But individual members of the Bus Owners\r\n\r\nAssociation are, to the knowledge of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour,  carrying  out a vicious  purge  quite\r\n\r\ncontrary to what the Government itself wants  them\r\n\r\nto do. In the case of the Hock Lee bus owners, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  is  aware  that   his   own\r\n\r\nGovernment  released some ten persons working  for\r\n\r\nHock  Lee  whom  the Government had  detained  for\r\n\r\nsuspected  subversive activities. When  they  were\r\n\r\nreleased, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch took the trouble of informing  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  that there  was  nothing  to\r\n\r\nprevent  these men from being re-employed by  Hock\r\n\r\nLee. The Ministry of Labour tried to persuade  the\r\n\r\nHock  Lee  bus owners to take them back, but  they\r\n\r\nrefused, because it would appear that the  5th  of\r\n\r\nNovember  was  the  expiry  of  the  bus   owners'\r\n\r\ndeadline  by  which  time everybody  who  had  not\r\n\r\nreturned to work was considered dismissed. As  the\r\n\r\nadviser to the Bus Workers Union, I then wrote  to\r\n\r\nthe  bus  owners  and asked them  whether  it  was\r\n\r\nreasonable  to expect people who were detained  in\r\n\r\none  of Her Majesty's prisons to report for  duty.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory conclusion has been reached and  a\r\n\r\nvery  bitter situation is fast developing in  that\r\n\r\ncompany.  It  may be that nothing  explosive  will\r\n\r\nhappen  in  the  next  six to twelve  months;  but\r\n\r\nsurely  the Government, even if the owners do  not\r\n\r\nrealise it, must expect that this bitterness  will\r\n\r\nlead to another explosion one of these days?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is in a position to apply not only\r\n\r\nmoral  but economic pressure on the company, apart\r\n\r\nfrom legal pressure by passing new legislation  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  to  see that there is no  intimidation\r\n\r\nand victimisation of workers by private employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bus company which took the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  carry out a punitive expedition of its own was\r\n\r\nthe Tay Koh Yat Bus Company. I told the House then\r\n\r\nthat members of the old union were being penalised\r\n\r\nby  being made to work two-hour shifts. The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  was  advised by his permanent  officials\r\n\r\nthat  that  was  not so. That it was  not  so  was\r\n\r\nbecause  immediately after the disclosure in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  the old workers were put back on eight-hour\r\n\r\nshifts;  but  soon after, the employers,  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time, told all the workers that  they  must\r\n\r\nstop working for one day each week, as required by\r\n\r\nthe  new  Labour Ordinance - a compulsory  rest  day\r\n\r\nwithout  pay - in order that they can be  penalised;\r\n\r\nand  that the spare pool which the employers  have\r\n\r\ngathered for themselves in readiness for  such  an\r\n\r\nevent could be given gainful employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks later, 15 conductors, because they had\r\n\r\nnot  collected  more  than  a  certain  number  of\r\n\r\ndollars per day, which the employers expected them\r\n\r\nto  collect, were suspended from duty.  Again  the\r\n\r\nintervention  of  the  Member  for   Tiong   Bahru\r\n\r\nresolved what might have become an ugly situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Shop and Factory Workers Union\r\n\r\nbranches   had   similar   skirmishes   with   the\r\n\r\nemployers,  and  again  these  are  known  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour. The Thye Hong Biscuit  Factory\r\n\r\ntook  the  opportunity to repudiate  an  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the Union and to reduce wages by about  one-third.  Intervention  by the  Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\npersuaded  the  employers not  to  implement  this\r\n\r\ndowngrading  of  wage rates. One  week  later  the\r\n\r\nemployers  proceeded  again  to  downgrade  wages.\r\n\r\nAgain  intervention  by  the  Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  get the employers to promise - no  more\r\n\r\nthan promise - that they will wait until the Chinese\r\n\r\nNew Year before they reduce wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some European employers, too, have decided to\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of the situation.  There  was  one\r\n\r\ncase  of  Thorny-croft's.  There  again,  on   the\r\n\r\npretext  that the workers had gone on a  lightning\r\n\r\nstrike  and  therefore repudiated  the  agreement,\r\n\r\nthey  sacked  over ten workers,  although  in  the\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the workers it  was  agreed  that\r\n\r\nthere   would  be  no  dismissals   in   case   of\r\n\r\nredundancy,  but  that there  would  be  a  roster\r\n\r\nsystem  so that everybody will be given some  work\r\n\r\nand  not  retrenched.  Fortunately,  intervention,\r\n\r\nagain  by the Ministry of Labour, and negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween the union and the management produced some\r\n\r\namicable  settlement by way of severance  pay  for\r\n\r\nthe  ten  odd persons who were dismissed. But  the\r\n\r\nmanagement gave notice that in the not too distant\r\n\r\nfuture  they proposed to change the clause in  the\r\n\r\nagreement,  which  they said was  not  valid,  but\r\n\r\nwhich  they  were finally persuaded to  accept  as\r\n\r\nstill valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the most flagrant of all the\r\n\r\nemployers  was  Messrs. George Lee  Motors,  whose\r\n\r\nproprietor  is also the proprietor of the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau. As a result of the activities of  this\r\n\r\nparticular entrepreneur, the regular reporter from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang Siang Pau is missing because  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen given the sack. The Government should realise\r\n\r\nwhat   some   Chinese   towkays   interpret    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action to mean. Some 20  workers  in\r\n\r\nMessrs. George Lee Enterprises were sacked for  no\r\n\r\nreason whatsoever. According to the workers,  they\r\n\r\nwere  sacked  because they had been  active  in  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  which was a branch of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nShop  and Factory Workers Union. When the  workers\r\n\r\nasked  Mr  George Lee why they were sacked,  they\r\n\r\nwere  told to see Mr Lim Ching Siong, who was  in\r\n\r\njail. The workers unfortunately did not go to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour; nothing happened and they were\r\n\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Mr George Lee and the Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau, the Minister for Labour must  be  well\r\n\r\naware of the private purge that this gentleman has\r\n\r\nembarked on. When Mr Seah Yong was released,  Mr\r\n\r\nGeorge Lee told the Singapore Union of Journalists\r\n\r\nthat  he was delighted and that he would take  Mr\r\n\r\nSeah  Yong back. One hour later, he issued a press\r\n\r\nstatement saying that it was not the policy of his\r\n\r\nnewspaper  \"to  have anyone on the staff  who  had\r\n\r\nbeen   detained   rightly  or   wrongly   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\" Now there was a patriotic  and  loyal\r\n\r\nsupporter  of the anti-subversionist  campaign  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  \"Anyone  detained  rightly   or\r\n\r\nwrongly  by  the Government\" is,  as  far  as  Mr\r\n\r\nGeorge  Lee  is concerned, persona non grata.  Mr\r\n\r\nSeah  Yong  was not reengaged, but  worse  was  to\r\n\r\nfollow. Mr George Lee's reporters and translators\r\n\r\nhad  decided that they would be prudent. They left\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang Staff Union, which was affiliated  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union, and\r\n\r\ndecided  to join a moderate, reasonable,  English-speaking,   safe   and  respectable   union,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Union of Journalists. The reporter  who\r\n\r\nused to cover our proceedings in the Assembly, one\r\n\r\nMr  K.  C.  Lee, was the Vice-President  of  this\r\n\r\nUnion. Mr K. C. Lee was active in Mr Seah Yong's\r\n\r\ninterests  and  had moved the Singapore  Union  of\r\n\r\nJournalists to see the Chief Minister on  no  less\r\n\r\nthan two occasions. This action, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve,  somewhat displeased Mr George Lee.  The\r\n\r\nresult  was that on one occasion, at an  editorial\r\n\r\nconference,  Mr George Lee informed all  present,\r\n\r\nincluding  Mr  K. C. Lee, that it would  be  very\r\n\r\ngood  for  them  to leave the Singapore  Union  of\r\n\r\nJournalists. Mr George Lee was told that it would\r\n\r\nbe very bad for Mr George Lee to be known as anti-union,  anti  even  a respectable  and  reasonable\r\n\r\nunion like the Singapore Union of Journalists.  He\r\n\r\nexploded  and said, \"Yes, I am anti-union  and  so\r\n\r\nwhat?\"  On the 30th of October he sacked  five  of\r\n\r\nhis  workers - one chief reporter, two reporters and\r\n\r\ntwo  translators - who had not been detained by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and therefore, we must assume, had  not\r\n\r\nbeen  considered  subversive. When  the  Union  of\r\n\r\nJournalists asked him what was the reason for this\r\n\r\nprecipitate action, he banged down the  telephone,\r\n\r\nlike the democrat that he is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position is not yet acute except for\r\n\r\nthose who have been personally victimised by these\r\n\r\nemployers.  But  with the impending  fate  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Factory and Shop Workers Union - I think I\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  prejudicing the intentions  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  if I  say  that  we  expect\r\n\r\nsomething  to happen to that union - 35,000  workers\r\n\r\nwill  be  disenfranchised trade unionists.  Unless\r\n\r\nthe  Government takes preparatory measures, 35,000\r\n\r\nworkers  are going to suffer at the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  because when the union  is  dissolved,\r\n\r\nall their contracts with these employers are swept\r\n\r\naway.  Before there is time for these  workers  to\r\n\r\norganise  new  unions  or join  some  other  union\r\n\r\naffiliated  to  the T.U.C., they  will  have  lost\r\n\r\nwhatever  benefits they had won  through  the  old\r\n\r\nunion.  It  is imperative, if the Government  does\r\n\r\nnot  want these men to suffer because it has,  for\r\n\r\nwhatever reasons, incarcerated their leaders, that\r\n\r\ninterim  legislation be introduced to prevent  any\r\n\r\nemployer from repudiating any term or condition of\r\n\r\nservice  which prevails between him and the  union\r\n\r\nfor  a period of six or twelve months. During this\r\n\r\nperiod  the employer should not alter any term  or\r\n\r\ncondition  of service without the consent  of  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin  this period the workers will be  given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to regroup and form new unions or join\r\n\r\nother  existing unions. Unless this is  done,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for widespread discontent  that  is\r\n\r\nbound  to  follow  the action  of  the  individual\r\n\r\nemployers  in  taking advantage of  the  situation\r\n\r\nmust  be the Government's. Whatever the Government\r\n\r\ncan  say  about its intentions - that they are  just\r\n\r\npunishing  the \"subversive\" leaders  and  not  the\r\n\r\nworkers  themselves - the workers will come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that the action of the Government  has,\r\n\r\nin   fact,  resulted  to  the  detriment  of   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the workers themselves. I  therefore\r\n\r\ngive  notice  to  the Minister  for  Labour  that,\r\n\r\nunless the Government takes the initiative,  as  I\r\n\r\nhope  it will, I shall at the next sitting of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   propose   that  such   legislation   be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  tide over the necessary  time  lag\r\n\r\nbetween the dissolution of the existing unions and\r\n\r\nthe  formation of new ones, so that in  this  time\r\n\r\nlag no employer will be able to take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation and get his own back on the workers\r\n\r\nand their organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, out of an adjournment\r\n\r\nspeech  of  about  18 minutes by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar,  I find that about  seven  minutes\r\n\r\nwere  spent  on the triangle of the  Lees - my  good\r\n\r\nfriend the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew),  Mr George Lee and Mr K. C. Lee! It  would\r\n\r\nappear  that I am being held responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nmisdeeds of Mr George Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been keeping a very watchful\r\n\r\neye  on  the  situation. Ever since the Government\r\n\r\ntook  action  against subversive activities  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  which a number of trade union  leaders\r\n\r\nwere  arrested and detained, not because of  their\r\n\r\ntrade   union  activities  but  because  of  their\r\n\r\nsubversive activities, reports have been  received\r\n\r\nby the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour  Ministry  of  alleged  victimisation;  and\r\n\r\nwhenever   reports  were  received,   the   Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  officials endeavoured  to  call  in  the\r\n\r\nemployer as well as the workers concerned  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to finding a solution to their difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Tanjong Pagar has touched  on  the\r\n\r\nwork done by the Ministry of Labour and he himself\r\n\r\nhas  been very closely connected with two or three\r\n\r\nsuch negotiations. He has suggested, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  give  consideration   to   the\r\n\r\nquestion of interim legislation in order to freeze\r\n\r\nthe  increased  wages  and  better  conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment that have been obtained for workers  as\r\n\r\na  result  of  the  activities  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nFactory and Shop Workers Union. This matter,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhas  been occupying my mind for some time and,  as\r\n\r\nhon.  Members know, I will be proceeding to London\r\n\r\nshortly,  but  I  will leave  instructions  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   to   explore   the   desirability    or\r\n\r\nundesirability  of  introducing such  legislation.\r\n\r\nBut  I  must ask all workers in Singapore to  come\r\n\r\nand  report to the Ministry of Labour where  there\r\n\r\nare,  according  to them, cases of  victimisation.\r\n\r\nUnless   we  receive  reports  from  the   workers\r\n\r\nconcerned, we will not be in a position to  render\r\n\r\nwhatever assistance we could give. The Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar has said that, unless the Government\r\n\r\nagrees to introduce such interim legislation,  his\r\n\r\nParty  proposes to move a motion in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nto  achieve  it.  All I can say  at  this  present\r\n\r\njuncture,  Sir,  is that I will cause  a  detailed\r\n\r\ninvestigation to be made into the desirability  of\r\n\r\nintroducing  such legislation and the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar will be informed, at the latest  by\r\n\r\nthe  next  sitting  of  the Assembly  in  January,\r\n\r\nwhether   or  not  the  Government  considers   it\r\n\r\ndesirable to introduce such interim legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at 4.22 p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
